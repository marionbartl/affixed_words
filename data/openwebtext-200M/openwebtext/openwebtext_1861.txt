The number of California homeowners who defaulted on their mortgage payments jumped to its highest level in almost 10 years , exacerbated by slowing home sales and adjustable - mortgage resets .
Homes lost to foreclosures in California shot up to 11,033 in the first quarter , an 81.5 percent climb from 6,078 in the previous quarter , according to DataQuick Information Systems .
Foreclosures rocketed 802.1 percent from 1,223 in the first quarter last year but remained below the 1996 peak of 15,418 .
Statewide , lenders sent 46,760 notices of default to homeowners in the first quarter .
That marked a 23.1 percent jump from the previous quarter and a 148 percent jump from a year ago in the same period .
Notices of default mark the first stage in the foreclosure process .
John Karevoll , an analyst for DataQuick , said the numbers have catapulted due to a surge of home loans -- many of which were high - risk subprime loans -- that were made in the summer of 2005 .
The adjustable - mortgage rate on many of those loans was reset a year and a half later , leaving homeowners scrambling to make their payments .
During boom times , homeowners could sell their property or refinance , Karevoll said .
" We had a good long run of strong appreciation and default numbers went down significantly , " he said .
Today , prices have flattened , making it difficult for homeowners to unload their property .
The Bay Area has been shielded from some of the pain compared with the rest of California because of its higher home prices and wealthier residents .
About 60 percent of the homeowners who receive a notice of default are able to make their payments before they lose their homes , Karevoll said .
Nonetheless , default notices in the Bay Area totaled 6,730 in the first quarter , a 160.3 percent increase over last year .
Contra Costa experienced the biggest jump in default notices , totaling 1,969 compared with 605 the previous year , marking a 225.5 percent increase .
In San Francisco , default notices rose 67.4 percent to 216 from 129 the previous year .
Marin had the second - fewest default notices -- 118 compared with 76 the previous year .
Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody 's Economy.com , said areas like Contra Costa are more susceptible to housing pressures because of the number of lower - income households that take on subprime loans .
The Central Valley as well as parts of Southern California face similar challenges .
Zandi said he expects to see more foreclosures later this year , when a peak number of homeowners hit their maximum first payment reset .
Karevoll said foreclosures start to become a problem when they drag prices down on other homes .
But he does not expect that to happen in the Bay Area , where lenders are still able to resell foreclosed homes at their market price .
" It 's very unlikely that the Bay Area will see discounting , " he said .

Mr Singh drew the parallel at a conference in New Delhi on social and caste injustices saying it was modern India 's failure that millions of Dalits ( meaning " oppressed " ) were still fighting prejudice .
" Even after 60 years of constitutional and legal protection and support , there is still social discrimination against Dalits in many parts of our country , " Mr Singh said .
" Dalits have faced a unique discrimination in our society that is fundamentally different from the problems of minority groups in general .
The only parallel to the practice of untouchability was apartheid . "
By raising the spectre of apartheid the prime minister has publicly repudiated the stand taken by the previous BJP - led government .
At a UN human rights conference in 2001 Dalit activists had pushed for a resolution linking the treatment of low - caste Hindu " untouchables " to race - based oppression .
The resolution proved abortive thanks to concerted opposition from official Indian delegates .
They maintained that unlike in apartheid South Africa , the constitution in India does not endorse or tolerate any form of discrimination .
Mr Singh 's statement was welcomed by community leaders yesterday .
" This is the first time that an Indian prime minister has linked Dalits with apartheid , and Singh needs to be congratulated for that , " said Chander Bhan Prasad , a Dalit writer , teacher and activist .
" But the more correct comparison would be with the situation of blacks in the US , where affirmative action is helping the community to get jobs in the private sector , including the media . "
Activists have been lobbying New Delhi to ensure jobs for Dalits in India 's burgeoning business corporations .
But though there are proposals to pass a law reserving jobs for Dalits in private companies , Mr Singh 's government , faced with opposition from business leaders , appears more keen to use persuasion rather than a legal stick .
" The number of jobs in government is very small compared to the jobs being created in the private sector thanks to a booming economy , " said Mr Prasad .
" If Singh really wants to help Dalits , he should look into how jobs can be ensured in the private sector . "
Yesterday Mr Singh also said it was was a cause for regret that large sections of India 's 130 million - strong Muslims had not benefited from the country 's rapidly expanding economy .
The Hindu practice of untouchability is illegal in India and although affirmative action providing university admissions and government jobs to low - caste Hindus has helped create a small but vocal middle class among the country 's 250 million Dalits , the community still remains abysmally impoverished and oppressed .
Even those Dalits who have benefited from the government 's affirmative action can often become victims of upper caste brutality .
In a recent case in the western Maharashtra state , four members of a land - owning Dalit family were lynched by a mob of upper - caste Hindus after they were paraded naked in their village and two women were raped .
Anger over the killings in the Maharashtra village was seen as one of the causes of a major riot by Dalits in Mumbai , when trains , buses and cars in India 's financial capital were attacked and burned .
The riot proved a reminder that despite all the oppression , sections of Dalits have organised themselves politically to face the upper caste challenge .
One of India 's most mercurial regional leaders , Mayawati , has even been chief minister of the northern Uttar Pradesh state , where her party is a frontrunner in next year 's state assembly elections .

Iran 's nuclear vision first glimpsed at MIT
With the shah 's fall , students sent to Cambridge were left to choose between US and theocracy CAMBRIDGE --
The young Iranians arrived in Cambridge in the summer of 1975 , part of a historic venture between their government and Massachusetts Institute of Technology to train the first generation of Iranian nuclear scientists .
The program began as a symbol of friendship but quickly became a lesson in unintended consequences .
Four years later , the Shah of Iran fell , replaced by an Islamic theocracy that Washington considers an enemy to this day .
The stunned students , who had expected to help the shah build a vast network of nuclear power plants , had to choose between America and Iran .
Their decisions may have changed the course of history .
At least three have spent their careers building the Iranian nuclear program that Washington is now fervently trying to curtail , according to a Globe investigation that tracked down 28 of the program 's 35 graduates .
One graduate -- Mansour Haj Azim , remembered by classmates as quiet and studious -- was a leader of Iran 's nuclear program and , according to one widely cited report , the supervisor of a suspected weapons - related site .
Meanwhile , nearly two - thirds of the graduates are working in the United States , some of them in the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and for American defense contractors .
Two of them died , one in a car crash in the United States and the other reportedly executed in Iran for forbidden political activity .
The story of the graduates offers a larger perspective on Iran 's nuclear ambitions and America 's looming nuclear standoff with Iran .
The students arrived in Massachusetts at a time of great optimism about nuclear energy but grew to middle age amid fears of proliferation -- particularly in their native country .
" It was a wonderful program , " said Mohammad " Moe " Moghimi , who now lives in Newton and teaches at Middlesex Community College .
Had history been different , he said , " We would have had five or six nuclear power plants functioning in Iran by now , or maybe more . "
Today , Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice frequently questions why Iran would need nuclear reactors when it has some of the largest oil reserves in the world .
But in 1974 , US officials made the opposite argument , urging Iran to invest its windfall oil profits in expensive US nuclear technology , according to former MIT students and professors and letters found in the MIT and State Department archives .
" There was a push to say , ' Hey , now you have a lot of money but the oil is going to run out eventually .
Why do n't you build nuclear power plants ? ' " recalled Marvin Miller , a professor who taught some of the Iranian students .
Mohammad H. Kargarnovin , a graduate of the MIT program who now teaches mechanical engineering at Sharif University of Technology in Iran , recalled : " All of a sudden , the [ Iranian ] government decided to have nuclear power , so in order to operate things , they needed human power and they started to send students for education outside .
We were told , ' You are responsible to take on this , to take the needle from zero to 100 . ' "
In March 1974 , the shah announced plans to build more than 20 reactors -- beginning with two at a site called Bushehr -- arguing that they would cover domestic energy needs and free up oil for export .
The Nixon administration was so eager to help that it sent Dixy Lee Ray , the chairwoman of the US Atomic Energy Commission , to Tehran in May 1974 to offer up her agency as a " clearinghouse " for Iranian investments , according to a recently declassified State Department memo .
Ray 's team " urged the Iranian side to get on with the job of site selection [ for the reactors ] as soon as possible , " the memo said .
A few months later , MIT got a request from the shah for a large number of Iranian students to be accepted into the next year 's nuclear engineering class -- nearly doubling the size of the graduate program -- recalled Edward Mason , then the head of the nuclear engineering department .
Mason said the US government had boundless optimism about nuclear power .
" US officials said one way to have peace [ in the Middle East ] was to put nuclear reactors there , raise people out of poverty , make the deserts bloom , " he said .
" The attitude then was much different than it is today about the potential dangers of somebody diverting plutonium and making weapons .
. . .
I taught a course in enrichment , reprocessing , fuel manufacture and the like .
We were teaching [ the Iranian students ] how to do it , as we were teaching people from all over the world . "
Later that year , MIT agreed to admit the Iranian students for a three - year master 's program in which they could get hands - on experience with MIT 's research reactor .
In exchange , Iran would pay more than half a million dollars to cover the costs of extra professors and classroom space .
The Iranian students also agreed to serve at least two years at the Atomic Energy Organization .
The deal was struck after the end of the regular admissions process , so MIT professor Kent Hansen flew to Tehran to select the students out of a group chosen by the Iranian government .
Their unusual admissions process , and Iran 's hefty payments , sparked a debate on MIT 's campus .
A student referendum voted against the special program , and the issue was hotly debated at three faculty meetings .
Noam Chomsky , an outspoken opponent on the faculty , said in an interview that the program amounted to " leasing the nuclear engineering department to the shah in exchange for an unspecified amount of money . "
Hansen , however , insists that MIT never relaxed its standards .
Yet when the first students arrived on campus many were dismayed by the feeling that Iran had purchased their place .
" It was kind of discouraging because all of us thought we were the best in the country , " said Farid Bamdad , who now works at the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board in Washington .
He said he studied even harder to prove that he deserved his spot at MIT .
That year , half of all faces were Iranian in many classrooms .
But the students still struggled to adjust .
Six immediately switched to business school , Mason said .
One dropped out after the first semester .
But others stayed on , sometimes studying all night , attending monthly tea - and - cookie gatherings in the nuclear engineering department , and flying to Washington for occasional pep talks at the Iranian embassy .
Some students distinguished themselves , like Roohollah Karimi , who took a legendary load of classes , and Hashem Akbari , who was known for studying for hours .
Bamdad said some of his classmates mingled easily with Americans .
A small group was more religious , keeping to themselves and taking the Red Line subway to a mosque in Quincy for Friday prayers .
By 1977 , however , the program was foundering due to financial disputes .
MIT 's chancellor , Paul Gray , kept sending bills for hundreds of thousands of dollars , according to records in MIT archives .
The Iranian government -- perhaps burdened by growing resistance to the shah 's opulent rule -- balked at the cost .
Nonetheless , more than a dozen Iranian students remained in Cambridge in February 1979 when the shah 's regime collapsed , succeeded by revolutionary forces devoted to a long - exiled cleric , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini .
The students , realizing that their lives were changing forever , debated the future among themselves .
" Some were more toward Islamic way of thinking -- they were happy , " recalled Moghimi .
" The others were pro-shah .
They were angry .
These groups were having discussions all the time . "
Many of the first wave of graduates had already gone back to Iran when the revolution occurred .
" A lot of us wanted to go back and marry an Iranian girl , " said Moghimi , who recalled that he , Azim , Akbari , and Karimi were in Iran around that time .
Moghimi worked briefly at the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization , where he remembers scientists pouring millions of dollars into expensive , grandiose nuclear research that had few practical applications for either power or weaponry .
" They just wanted to show that they were big , that they were active in the area of nuclear research , " he said .
As the political unrest grew , Moghimi decided to return to MIT to pursue a PhD .
He got his visa two days before revolutionaries stormed the US embassy .
Karimi and Akbari -- stars of their class -- also grew dismayed with the chaos .
Karimi changed his first name to Roy and moved to Maryland .
Akbari went to California , where he is now a specialist in alternative energy .
But Azim and another MIT student , Mohammad Zaker , stayed in Iran .
At first , their futures seemed dim .
After the revolution , all the students got letters saying that their services were no longer needed .
The shah 's vision of a nuclear future was too Western for the new Islamic Republic .
The companies that had agreed to build reactors for the shah pulled out , and the US government used its diplomatic leverage to block all sales of nuclear technology .
To make matters worse , war broke out with neighboring Iraq , whose forces bombed the still - incomplete Bushehr reactors .
But in the early ' 80s -- near the start of the eight - year war with Iraq -- Iran began reconstituting its nuclear program .
Azim and Zaker rose rapidly through the ranks .
Zaker became head of a research reactor in Tehran .
Azim became deputy director of the Atomic Energy Organization .
Soon , government officials began contacting the former MIT students in the United States , trying to persuade them to return .
Bamdad said the Iranian government contacted his brother in Iran , demanding that Bamdad either repay his MIT tuition or serve out his two - year obligation to the Atomic Energy Organization .
Bamdad did n't return .
Ali -Akbar Salehi , who earned his PhD from MIT in the late 1970s but was not part of the special program , approached several of the program 's graduates in America about returning to Iran , Moghimi recalled .
It is unclear how many took up the offer .
Salehi also rose in the ranks , becoming Iran 's representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency .
In 1982 , Azim visited Moghimi in Boston and offered him a well - paid position in Iran , Moghimi said .
" He said ' We are going to complete Bushehr , ' " Moghimi recalled .
But Moghimi was n't interested .
In the early 1990s , the CIA began declaring that Iran was developing a nuclear bomb .
A frequently cited 1992 special report in a publication called Mednews named Azim as the supervisor of a secretive weapons - related research center near the Caspian Sea .
But Iranian officials denied any weapons ambitions .
One senior official told Harvard University professor Richard Wilson that Iranian scientists were only " trying to continue what they started 25 years ago that they were encouraged to learn at MIT , " Wilson said .
In 1992 , Moghimi and Azim met again in Iran , and Moghimi asked his friend , point blank , whether Iran was developing a nuclear weapon .
" He said , ' No way .
They are only nuclear power plants . '
He said , ' If the Iranian government wanted to do that , it would be suicide , ' " Moghimi recalled .
" I believed him . "
Now Moghimi is not so sure , as Iran insists on trying to enrich uranium -- which could be used as fuel for nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons .
The last time the two men spoke was about three years ago .
Although his friend did n't say it , Moghimi got the impression that Azim was restless .
He asked Moghimi for a letter of invitation so he could visit the United States .
Moghimi sent one , but has not heard from Azim since .

ASUS EN8800GTX
Graphics Card Even with the advent of the GeForce 8800 Ultra , the ASUS EN8800GTX is still a top - dog .
As our test results in this review and the NVIDIA GeForce 8800 Ultra review have shown , it is just 7 - 13 % slower than the GeForce 8800 Ultra , and yet costs 28 % less .
This gives the ASUS EN8800GTX far better price - performance value than the GeForce 8800 Ultra .
Frankly , the card is so fast , you can run all DirectX 9 games in the market at 1920x1200 ( the highest resolution we tested ) at 8 x AA and 16x AF without worrying about frame rates .
Just set everything to the highest resolution and rendering quality and enjoy the game !
Anything less than that would be sacrilege .
Do note that we have been testing it in Windows Vista .
As you know , none of the graphics drivers for Windows Vista ( for either NVIDIA or ATI ) are really up to par just yet .
So , you can count on better performance as newer drivers for Windows Vista are released in the future .
We are really counting on that to really improve the card 's DirectX 10 performance , as we saw a 35 - 44 % drop in frame rate just switching from a DirectX 9 renderer to a DirectX 10 renderer in Company Of Heroes .
As things stand , even a powerful ( and expensive card ) like the ASUS EN8800GTX can only provide okay frame rates in the 30 - 40 fps region .
With the G80 GPU undergoing a silicon refresh for faster clock speeds and improved timings , it is possible that current ASUS EN8800GTX cards will also be using the same , improved GPUs .
That would mean that these cards would have really interesting overclocking potential .
Although the ASUS EN8800GTX is a really powerful card and one would be a fool to deny its appeal , it is still one of the most expensive desktop graphics cards you can buy .
Only the advent of the incredibly expensive GeForce 8800 Ultra relegated it to second place .
If you are looking to buy a top - of - the line card , you should certainly consider the ASUS EN8800GTX .
While it is no longer the king of the hill , it 's a very close second - in - command and far cheaper .
It would certainly offer you much better value for your money at this moment , compared to the GeForce 8800 Ultra .
In addition , ASUS packs a really nice bundle , consisting of two games and 3DMark 06 , together with a faux leather CD case .
As such , we have no qualms in giving it our Editor 's Choice Award .
We would love to have ASUS drop the price on the EN8800GTX , but still , it was a very nice GeForce 8800 GTX bundle .
Great job on the EN8800GTX , ASUS !

VeriSign , the company that holds a state - sponsored monopoly on the registration of .com and .net domain names , announced yesterday that it will raise the rates they charge to domain registrars , effective October 15 .
The price of registering a .com domain will go from $ 6.00 USD to $ 6.42 USD , a 7 % increase , while .net domains will jump 10 % from $ 3.50 USD to $ 3.85 USD .
VeriSign says they need the extra cash ( about $ 23 million more from .com alone ) to handle increased traffic in domain name queries and to defend against cyberattacks .
Daily Domainer has the details on VeriSign ’s pricing agreement with ICANN that allows them to institute these increases , along with up to three more such increases over the next six years — or maybe even more , if they can document enough expenses resulting from security attacks .
No doubt the domain registrars will pass the additional costs along to their customers .
I hold nine .com and .net domain names , so if my registrar does n’t add any more margin to the increase my cost will go up less than four bucks a year .
Only those who hold a very large number of domain names should suffer any real financial hardship from this .
Domain hosting and management costs far exceed the price of name registration .
Considering that this will be the first price increase since 1999 , the amount seems reasonable enough .
What bothers me is that the hike is determined at the whim of a monopoly that is enforced by the US government , instead of being determined by a free market .
What do you think ?
Are we getting our money ’s worth from VeriSign ?
Could an open market for domain registration ever work ?
Will you be counting your pennies the next time you want to register a domain ?
A short five months ago , I was a busy man , flooded with more business than I could handle right after releasing two Ruby books in six months .
Against this backdrop , I got one more call .
The vendor , Arvato Systems , told me that I could :
Lead a highly visible , important project
Use the technology I love
Work with people I could , at least in part , choose
Oh , and they also mentioned that I would change the world , in a substantive way .
I 've been oversold before , but this time , the pitch was true .
Every word of it .
In this article , I 'd like to tell you about the technical details behind this extraordinary idea , but first , I need you to know the vision .
ChangingThe Present.org has a simple but powerful premise .
The site aims to capture just a fraction of the 250 billion dollars that we spend on gifts every year .
Instead of giving another fruit cake or pair of fuzzy slippers , through ChangingThePresent , you can give a gift that has much more impact and meaning , like an hour of a cancer researcher 's time or the preservation of an acre of rain forest .
Building another donation portal may make it more convenient to give , and generate some extra money .
But the opportunity to change the way that people think about giving got me excited .
An old problem
If you know the nonprofit world , full of technologies your grandmother would n't admire , you can already see where this vision is going .
ChangingThe Present seeks to apply the same techniques that other industries have to use the Internet to bring people together .
Only this time , the people are not buyers and sellers , but donors and nonprofits .
With the heads of the Lance Armstrong foundation , Save the Children , First Book , and the Sierra Club heading up an impressive list of nearly 200 advisors and 380 nonprofits , the business development is well under way .
But here , I want to tell you the technical side of the story .
In this article , I 'll walk you through the way we 're using Ruby on Rails to build the site .
You 'll see the core features we 're using , as well as the primary plugins that we depend on every day .
Most of our technology is n't really earth shattering , but I hope to give you a glimpse inside our day to day operations .
My aim is to give you a broad overview of how the team works , the technology we trust in the production environment , the tools we use , and the Rails frameworks that are most important to us .
I 'll link to a resource rather than going into great detail in any single area , but if you want to know more about any part of it , leave a comment .
I 'll gladly write other articles to dive deeper , if there 's enough interest .
The Basics
In the early stages , I joined the team as an independent contractor and lead programmer .
The founder considered Java for scalability and stability , but the early bids came back and the project looked too expensive and complex .
We settled on Ruby on Rails because it gave us the best combination of great productivity , a clean programming model , and reasonable performance .
Still , the decision was not without concern .
Based on existing portals and our business plan , we decided that we should be able to handle hits in the millions , daily .
Though few Ruby sites have such high traffic requirements , we thought we could provide that kind of scalability through aggressive caching and simple shared - nothing clustering , though we could n't find any evidence of such sites at that time .
September came and went .
We were extremely productive , showing significant progress with each weekly demo , and the customer noticed , and I was sold on the vision , so in November , I joined WellGood , LLC as CTO .
In December , we released the first beta version of the site .
Our team built the initial version of the site at about one fifth of the projected cost of bids using other languages , and in about one sixth of the projected time .
Rails has absolutely been critical to our productivity and success .
We 're far from finished with the site -- we've built roughly five percent of what we 've planned -- but we have a good enough foundation to begin to execute the next steps of our business plan .
Though we 've done some minor benchmarking and profiling to give us some assurance that we 'll be able to handle the big loads when the time comes , we can't be sure that our current deployment will be able to handle the massive volumes we 've projected for the long term , because few Rails sites ever have .
But we 've got high confidence that :
We can build features , test them well , and deploy them quickly
We will be able to scale to high volumes with minimal hardware
We can add additional hardware transparently as our needs grow
Our team of five developers can both develop and manage the site through the early growth curve
We can solve any additional scalability and performance problems that come up
From the above list , the most important item for us is productivity .
My team must be productive enough to satisfy our customers and investors , while staying ahead of our competition .
Throughout the rest of this article , I 'll dive into a little more detail on the details of our deployment .
Where I can't provide a definitive description of what we 're using , I will link you to a place to go for more information .
Topology
First , let 's get the basics out of the way .
Rails is fundamentally a LAMP architecture , We deploy our site on Sun hardware , behind BigIP load balancers .
Like many newer Rails sites , we chose Mongrel as our application server , a lighttpd derivative for static content , and MySQL .
Our database is deployed in a master / master / slave configuration for fail over , performance , and scalability .
We chose Text Drive to host our content because of their experience with high - volume Rails sites .
Like most Internet sites , our traffic is dominated by read - only accesses , with the primary exceptions being several social networking personalization templates , and of course , the shopping experience .
To get the performance characteristics we want , we 've done some profiling , which showed us where to optimize our ActiveRecord models with eager associations to minimize the number of database requests .
We also implement a caching strategy through the Acts As Cacheable plugin , backed by MemCache .
Aside from the caching layer , our configuration is a pretty conventional Rails configuration .
When you 're dealing with donations , you have to appeal to emotions .
That usually means good pictures , and lots of them .
Our nonprofits do a good job of picking good pictures that promote the causes that interest our visitors most .
The pictures reinforce the theme of tangible donation opportunities , so our donors know their contributions will go directly to the people who need it most .
But image downloads can stress the typical Rails setup .
Since Mongrel does not deal with static data very well , we manage the images by URL rewriting , and dedicating a specific URL to static content delivery .
We also are beginning to use Panther Express as an image accelerator .
That service lets us serve cached images from around the world .
We should have that service up some time in April .
Some people , mostly Java and .NET developers and vendors , have warned us that Ruby on Rails cannot give us the scalability we need , but I 'm not overly concerned .
I 'm confident that the industry has amassed excellent experience with technologies that are similar to Rails .
After all , the LAMP principles that form the foundation of Rails also form the backbone of many of the largest sites on the Web .
To me , a far greater concern is the need to develop features fast enough to satisfy my investors , customers , and boss .
These days , I spend much more time thinking about my team , tools , and implementation .
Process and Team
Rails says " be agile , be happy " .
We do n't fight it .
I love the agile approach .
We firmly embrace these agile principles :
We focus our process around short , sharp one - week iterations .
We deploy at least weekly .
Instead of forcing quality through the funnel of a formal test cycle , we rely heavily on our developers to build test cases as we code .
We are not afraid to refactor when it suits our business purposes .
We refactor to improve code quality , address requirements , or improve flexibility .
We manage minor requirements weekly , and major requirements monthly .
We maintain tight communication with our business users through weekly demos , even though our team is distributed .
We use Trac plus SVN to manage our source code , track basic requirements , and manage our basic release plan .
The tight integration between Trac and SVN give me a convenient view to quickly understand what 's happening with the source tree .
We push slight changes directly into production after heavy automated testing and light manual testing , and use branches with a staging environment to work on major revisions .
We prefer to operate off of the trunk , and will do so until our traffic and complexity prevent us from doing so .
With the Rails platform , most revisions we need to make are relatively minor .
Our team is distributed across three time zones , and we 're planning to spread the team out more broadly soon .
We keep an open chat daily so we can quickly get questions answered .
I would rather be able to go after the best Rails developers and communicate over long distances than limit my recruiting .
So far , the tradeoff has paid off well .
We do keep meetings to a minimum .
My developers have one stand up meeting every morning , which we host on Skype chat .
We also have a weekly technical meeting with the business people to keep our priorities in line , and plan weekly releases .
I 've sometimes heard that Rails does n't scale up to complex solutions very well .
I disagree .
Because it 's so much more productive than alternative technologies , Rails has a dramatic impact on my development process , and subsequently way I can build and manage my team .
The slower your technology , the longer you must go between iterations .
The larger your team , the more you must spend on oversight and communications .
After managing both Ruby and Java projects , I 've now got even more tangible evidence to back that up .
Though other organizations projected larger teams ( from 10 to 15 developers ) , we 've been able to keep our team small .
At any given time , we have 5 Ruby developers , and up to two people working on pure HTML and design .
We 'll feel comfortable growing that team to seven .
After that , we 'll form a second development team to work on isolated elements of the code base that are more complex and expensive .
Tools
Our tool suite is extremely simple .
We use the Rails testing stack , and throw in RCov for testing coverage .
We use Selenium for integration testing .
We drive all tests and coverage tools with Rake .
We keep a target of 85 % for test case coverage .
We periodically fall below that target , but we 've never gotten better than 90 % or worse than 79 % since we started seriously tracking coverage .
We 've had less success with Selenium because of the rapidly shifting user interface , but expect it to be more effective once our user interface settles down .
We primarily use Rails unit and functional tests , but we 're exploring some other testing alternatives as well .
Each of our developers can use whatever tool he wants to edit his code .
So far , none of us use a full integrated development environment .
Most of us use TextMate to edit source files .
The Rails tools for benchmarking and debugging , combined with logging and testing , give us everything we need to debug the system .
Some refactoring is a bit if a pain , especially when we have to change the database backed models , so we may well begin to use an IDE once we find one that is good enough .
Still , from my experience , our maintenance cycle is easily three times as fast as a typical Java maintenance cycle , maybe more .
Core Architecture
Though we 're part of a radical movement to change the way companies build major software projects , the call of the hour is conformity .
Our core architecture adheres to the primary Rails architectures .
We believe in migrations , through we see room for improvement .
On the database end , we are DHH disciples .
We do n't try to force database constraints like referential integrity , and we do n't use database views .
And from a testing perspective , we rely primarily on the Rails framework , though we 're starting to explore some alternatives as our test cases get larger .
( I 'm not ready to draw any conclusions yet , so I 'll stick with our primary philosophy here . )
But when you come right down to it , we 're classic Rails MVC , with REST web services .
I 'll lay out the core enhancements below .
The Model
Like many social networking sites , we optimize for read - based performance first , but a significant portion of our content is relatively static , changing less than once per day .
Based on watching the statistics for our competition , we expect high volumes , so we rely heavily on caching the stable content on the site , including nonprofits ( such as UNICEF ) , gifts ( such as making a blind person see or an hour of a cancer researcher 's time ) , and causes ( such as world peace and medical research . )
Since these elements change infrequently , we can cache them aggressively .
We use the Rails plugin ActsAsCacheable for that purpose .
The back end for the cache is a distributed second level caching service called MemCache , but for all practical purposes , we use the ActiveRecord API directly , with few exceptions .
We also have some significant workflow features on the site .
Nonprofits can submit content , and the admins at ChangingThe Present approve or edit each revision .
We must be able to activate or deactivate any gift at any time , and we prefer to mark a record as deleted rather than remove it from the database .
To support this customized work flow , we use a plugin called ActsAsStateMachine .
That plugin lets us represent our state machine in a domain specific language , which you can read about at Crossing Borders : Rails Plugins .
I did n't realize how effective such a DSL could be until it was time to communicate with our business users .
Ruth Ann Hacking manages our content acquisition and management .
Though she has no programming experience , she is also a world cup fencer .
Since she 's perfectly capable of killing me with a sabre ( or probably a ball - point pen ) , I try to keep her happy .
On a whim , I sent her the code with the state machine in it .
She was able to walk through it and find several critical bugs .
Ruth
Ann was happy , and I lived .
But that 's life with Rails .
The unnecessary clutter stalks away and hides in the framework , leaving the fun stuff to me .
The User Interface
Our user interface uses classic Rails controllers , views , and layouts .
We do n't yet support the new Rails RESTful controllers , but new controllers will take advantage of them as our new web site features can use them .
We do make limited use of AJAX in a few areas - - our greeting card wizard , in - place editing -- but in general , we prefer a cleaner , simpler interface .
To make the site scale well , we do the following :
We try to minimize images where possible .
The site has many rounded corners , which we render with JavaScript libraries .
We will probably revisit this strategy once Panther Express is in place .
We do some limited caching of page content .
We cache static pages , but not page fragments .
There are very few static pages on the site , because we have some user customization on every page .
We implement caching primarily at the ActiveRecord level , and image caching through PantherExperss .
We initially showed our gifts in a paginated list , in alphabetical order .
But we soon found that our users learned , and began all gift names with an A .
Since our site can only use so many Aardvarks , we randomize the order of gifts , caching the results each day .
Rather than do this work in the view , we just build a custom finder with the MySQL random function , seeding it with a formula with the current day , month , and year .
Going Forward
New features are going in quickly .
Since early content was all customer facing , we 've gone back to bolster our ability to manage content .
We 've also added a number of features since our launch in December .
We 've added a new console for our nonprofit outreach that allows them to review all changes that we make .
We 've also added community features to let people start their own donation drives .
We 've refined our home page , letting the gifts do more of the talking .
And we 'll be releasing blogs and improved wedding registries soon .
We 'll continue to manage this project with small , geographically distributed teams .
We 'll continue to invest in Rails and LAMP .
Now that we have a running , stable site , look for us to build features that will help us establish community and drive traffic .
We do understand that building the technology is only one small part of the overall problem .
Look for us to increase the number of nonprofits that actively participate in the site , and establish the ChangingThe Present brand .
Helping Out
The Ruby community has been fantastic , supporting us at every turn .
We pass all donations through to the target nonprofit , taking only the credit card processing fee .
But that means we 're dependent on people like you for support .
If you want to help , here are a number of things you can do :
Log onto the site , and click on the link that says " Support Changing The Present . "
Put a banner on your blog supporting the site , your favorite cause , or a drive .
Create a profile and tell five people that you know about it .
Tell each of them to spread the word .
If you want to code , we have a few opportunities for volunteers for designers , flash developers , and Ruby coders .
Feel free to contact me through InfoQ .
It 's not every day that you get a job that lets you do what you love , with people you enjoy , and know that you 're making a difference in substantive ways .
I hope you 've enjoyed reading about this site as much as we 've enjoyed building it .

Despite all the White House spin , new e-mails put Rove right in the middle of the fired U.S. Attorneys controversy .
It was Karl 's idea to can all the U.S. Attorneys back in early 2005 ( that was when the Bush team still believed they had a mandate ) .
Karl and Gonzales were plotting the mass firings even before Gonzales became Attorney General :
New unreleased e-mails from top administration officials show that the idea of firing all 93 U.S. attorneys was raised by White House adviser Karl Rove in early January 2005 , indicating Rove was more involved in the plan than the White House previously acknowledged .
The e-mails also show that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales discussed the idea of firing the attorneys en masse while he was still White House counsel , weeks before he was confirmed as attorney general .
The e-mails directly contradict White House assertions that the notion originated with recently departed White House counsel Harriet Miers , and was her idea alone .
Two independent sources in a position to know have described the contents of the e-mail exchange , which could be released as early as Friday .
They put Rove at the epicenter of the imbroglio and raise questions about Gonzales ' explanations of the matter .
What has made the issue a political firestorm is the White House 's insistence that the idea came from Miers and was swiftly rejected .
So , the White House has been lying to the media -- and the American people -- again .
What a surprise .
Seriously , why does anyone in the White House press corps believe one word uttered by anyone in the Bush White House , including George Bush ?
The White House lying in this issue is summed up in this line :
In other words , the White House 's insistence was a lie .
And , it 's such a blatant lie that even the media has figured that out .
しじみと言えば昔からの家庭の味で、鮮魚コーナーに行けばいつでも手に入るものというイメージをお持ちの方が多いのではないでしょうか。しかし、そのしじみが近年また人気を集めています。なぜなのでしょうか。
平凡な家庭の 味
しじみというと、お味噌汁やお吸い物、地域によってはつくだ煮などで古くから家庭の味として食されてきました。国内の汽水域（淡水と海水が混ざり合う水域）で年間を通して安定的に漁獲され、値段も比較的安価なため季節を問わず家庭の食卓にならぶ食材のひとつと言えます。似たような貝類のアサリと並んで、お味噌汁の具材の代表的なものとしても挙げられますね。
しじみだけに含まれる成分
平凡な食材であったしじみですが、ある成分が含まれていること、その成分の効能が明らかになるにつれ一躍脚光を浴びだします。その成分とは、オルニチンです。
オルニチンが含まれる代表的な食材に
二日酔いにはしじみ汁が良い、とは昔から言われてきたことですが、なぜ良いのかは長らくわかっていませんでした。しかし、オルニチンという成分の働きについて研究が進むと、オルニチンサイクルという回路で疲労物質の分解し肝臓の機能を助けていることがわかってきました。また、オルニチンは他の二枚貝にはほとんど含まれておらず、しじみだけに多く含まれています。ありふれた食材であったしじみが見直され始めました。
老若男女が摂取したいしじみ
オルニチンが含まれていることから注目を浴び始めたしじみは、研究されその他にも有用な成分を含んでいることがわかってきました。うま味の元であるコハク酸はがん細胞の増殖を抑制する効果が確認されていますし、ビタミンB群、鉄分は女性も積極的に摂取したい成分です。当初、肝機能サポートの効能からアルコール摂取の多い年配の男性向けと言ったイメージがあったしじみですが、年齢・性別問わず積極的に摂取したい食材として人気を集めるようになったのです。
しじみが人気なわけをご紹介しましたが、お味噌汁など料理に手軽に取り入れやすいほか、多様なサプリメントが開発・発売されているのも人気が継続している理由と言えそうです。健康のため、ご自身のライフスタイルに取り入れやすい形でしじみを摂取してみることをおすすめします。
Pixelator is an unauthorized on - going video art performance collaboration with the New York City Metropolitan Transit Authority , CBS Outdoor , and its selected artists .
Since 2003 , the MTA has made available for exhibition purposes 80 LED screens located at subway entrances across New York City .
Unfortunately , the high cost of exhibiting ( an estimated $ 274,000 per month per screen ) prevents most artists from having access to these facilities .
While the MTA ’s effort to create more opportunities for video art exhibition in public spaces is to be commended , selected works remain wholly fixated on commercial goods and media conglomerate events , a short - sighted curatorial choice that regrettably ignores the full potential of these promising exhibition spaces .
In an attempt to broaden the scope of MTA ’s video art series , Pixelator takes video pieces currently on display and diffuses them into a pleasant array of 45 blinking , color - changing squares .
Since the project is an anonymous collaboration , the resulting video is almost entirely unplanned and unanticipated , with the original artists helping to create new works of art without any knowledge of their participation .
( Translation : Pixelator turns those ugly , blinding video billboard ads into something a little more pleasant . )
How To
In NYC , video billboards are 27.5 " x 49.5 " .
Make sure your target is the same size before using these numbers .
2 sheets of 40 " x60 " x3/16 " white foamboard ( available at Pearl Paint for $ 7 a sheet )
1 sheet of Heavy Frost diffusion gel 4'x5 ' ( available at Kits and Expendables in Long Island City for $ 30 )
1 roll of white duct tape
6 boxes of Stik Tak or similar adhesive
glue gun and a lot of glue sticks
tape measure or yard stick
box cutter
pencil
Step 1 : Measure your target .
Step 2 : Gather your materials .
Step 3 : Cut the foamboard .
Step 4 : Interlock the pieces .
Step 5 : Tape the sides .
Step 6 : Cut and glue the diffusion gel .
Step 7 : On the back , generously apply Stik Tak to the corners and top edge .
Step 8 : Attach to video billboard and enjoy .
In a New York Times / CBS News poll conducted in March with 1,362 adults , 12 percent of Republicans and 34 percent of Democrats said gay couples should be allowed to legally marry .
Thirty seven percent of Republicans and 41 percent of Democrats said gay couple should be allowed to form civil unions but not allowed to marry .
More than half of Republicans -- 52 percent -- and 30 percent of Democrats said there should be no legal recognition of a gay couple ’s relationship at all .
The nationwide telephone poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points .
At this stage in a presidential campaign , candidates are typically concentrating on winning over the most ideologically motivated members of their parties , assuming that they are the ones most likely to turn out to vote in the primaries .
Any moves to the middle , the thinking goes , can come once the nomination is secure .
But this time , some candidates are challenging ideological orthodoxy in a way that suggests they are willing to gamble that social issues do not pack the punch they once did .
Rudolph W. Giuliani , the former New York City mayor who is seeking the Republican nomination , has reaffirmed his support for abortion rights .
Senator John McCain , the Arizona Republican , is bucking many in his party by backing an overhaul of the immigration system that would allow millions of illegal immigrants a chance to become citizens .
Their positions suggest that candidates and campaign strategists , always on the hunt for the new new thing , may have found it in the great swath of the American middle .
It is not just abortion .
There is a consensus on other social issues as well including health care , the environment and immigration .
Matthew Dowd , one of the chief strategists of George W. Bush ’s 2004 re-election campaign , and now a partner in the firm Vianovo , said there is a consensus on many of these issues and noted that people are “ tired of the polarized discourse and just do n’t want the debate . ”
“ People do n’t want social issues thrown at their doorstep anymore —- abortion , gay marriage , Terry Schiavo , ” said Mr. Dowd .
“ People in the middle say yeah , these are tough personal decisions but we have a structure for dealing with them so why are politicians bringing this up . ”
He added , “ In their mind , things like the abortion debate are settled . ”
Mr. Dowd , who advised Arnold Schwarzenegger in the California governor ’s race , said , “ Someone who thinks they have to go left or right on an issue is running a race that ’s gone . ”
The 2004 Libertarian Presidential Candidate , Michael Badnarik teaches his famous class about the Constitution .
If you do n't know the difference between a right and a privilege , this is a must see !
If you think you know the difference , then answer this question :
Is the US a democracy ?
For the answer ( surprisingly ) , watch this .

He 'd wipe the floor with both of them .

Subject : Speaking truth .... to emptiness Dear Mr. Morpheusone ,
there is no need for panic .
We can see that you are no libertarian .
you are opposed to liberty , the freedom granted by an Almighty actually - existing sovereign God to learn how to conduct life and living in self - responsibility .
Perhaps you should start with the standard admission .
Here is what you might wish to say :
I , morpheusone , am a communist .
I admit I have a problem .
I admit that I have a problem with freedom and perhaps with white people .
I have believed the propaganda fed to me while I was in public school , and I do not know how to get rid of it .
In fact I confess my standard distrust of the history of white people , and especially if they are God-loving , god- fearing , history knowing , or respectors of the American Founding Fathers .
I know that my own model is Karl Marx , and that I can only relax when a full dictatorship comes to power .
I worship the New World Order , even though I cannot officially admit to any religious tendency .
My happiness starts with the misery of others .
When I have free time , I harang others who believe in goodness , kindness , love and being positive , and I try to convince them
that any respect for other races ( other than my priveledged own ) , or any respect for Christianity , should be met with scorn , contempt , mockery or derision .
I have allowed hatred to permeate my life .
I hope to get others to despise their own heritage as much as I despise myself and my own .
And I have taken to a personal emulation of Morris Dees , and the billionaire - funded ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center .
It ( the SPL ) was named that so that we could mislead even more people .
I try to goad people into strong reactions and insults , and then turn around and use that against them .
Then I blame whatever they value .
I am paid for this , but if I were n't , I 'd be a volunteer .
Others may think that this reflects poorly on me , but unless either the great vanishing ( rapture ) hits , or until the day when the
system prevents me from buying or selling without a mark in my own right hand or forehead , then I may have to re-evaluate my own understanding of reality .
In the meantime , I will allow my bitterness to serve as my shield , and my anger against all white culture and history to serve as the means by which I complain bitterly , trying to escape my own historic roots .
Morpheusone .

Something like that ... would be a good start .

While most libertarians may not be white supremacists , they are all " white supremacist shills " bc , they support an ideology that wants to subjugate & enslave all of us for the purpose of furthering it's own developmentally stunted , fear , hate , scare , rumor & smear mongering , tinfoil hat - wearing , Kool - Aid sipping , conspiracy theories .

The closest thing that I have ever found to natural law on any governments documents are those of our constitution .
To me this means that each and every one of us may choose our own path to happiness , or better said seek our own utopia with out the hassles of anybody on your back making you do it differently than you would have if left alone .
As long as the individual understands his rights he is empowered with this knowledge , but if he does n't understand his rights how will he protect himself when Uncle SAM comes a knocking ?

Subject : Badnarik and EricWhoRU can open up your mind ...
There will always be two camps :
Those that believe men are capable of self - governance and those who must be ruled like beasts of the field .
It has been my eperience that those two camps are irreconcileable .
Those who subscribe to the belief that most men need to be ruled over by elitist elements are anti-Christians and deny the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob .
This includes self - professed Christians , Anarchists , Satanists , Luciferians , Deists , Hindus , Buddhists , etc .
The other camp believes in the True and Living God ;
He who grants each of His created men with inalienable rights .
Privileges are for citizens and chattel per the auspices of State .
Rights are for those who understand that freedom and liberty are not the same thing .
An individual may be imprisoned and yet have liberty .
But a person without liberty can never be free .
Except within the confines of a person 's mind .
And that would be the makings of an excellent form of slavery ; the ultimate slave is the one that believes himself to be free when in fact he is quite regulated in his daily life .
The Magna Carta does not grant you freedom from tyranny .
Nor does the Declaration of Independence .
Although the latter declares such it is an announcement not a license .
Physical freedom comes at a very high price .
If a man is not willing to give up his life to maintain or preserve such freedom then it is unobtainable to him .
Now , for a more radical concept .
The U.S. Constitution was not written to free the common man .
Why would the former aristocrats give up their station ?
Why would a man like Thomas Jefferson , who owned some 200 slaves , give credence to such a document if it made the common man equal to him and those of his ilk ?
As for the the Bill of Rights they were necessary to get the U.S. Constitution off the ground due to the unpopularity of the document .
The U.S. Constitution was not well received in its day .
The Confederation was hijacked by the aristocrats , which you know as WE THE PEOPLE , and pandered to the masses of Americans as necessary for their freedom .
What it ended up creating was a corporation operating out Washington D.C. that gave us a king and the American version of the House of Lords and House of Commons .
Washington rules over all the citizens because they volunteer into a system without even knowing what is going on .
It is very similar to the movie THE MATRIX .
The average citizen does not want to know what is really going on around them so long as everything is rosy .
But everything is not rosy .
That birth certificate you possess , that driver 's license you carry , that national ID card that you will soon be mandated to have on your person 24 hours a day under penalty of law , the court systems across this land , the incorporating of your hometown , placing a license plate on your vehicle , etc. are all evidences that you are the property of State ; you are a CITIZEN ; participation in this system is strictly voluntary .
Even though you do not understand it you have volunteered into it just as your parents and grand - parents before you .
Like a slow boiled frog the sheeple have been incrementally enslaved .
Think not ?
Then why is socialism rampant in this land today ?
Just give the sheeple his bread , wine and circuses and he is lulled back to sleep .
Until the shearing or slaughter finds its way to his door step and that of his neighbors .
Hitler was democratically elected by a wide margin .
So go ahead and vote for the lesser of two evils ; evil always begets evil so do not be surprised when you find yourself surrounded by more of the same throughout your days on this earth .
As the True Christians are persecuted in the coming days the world will become a very dark place .
The purification of God 's people has begun .
Meanwhile the rest of humanity is being called out of Babylon but most have not he eyes and ears to come to their senses .
God 's chosen come to understand liberty in its truest form .
The rest will panic and suffer without ever understanding , in this life , what is really going as Satan and his minions make a conflagaration of this planet under a one world order of peace and safety for all sheeple .
Take control of your life and examine all the traditions that have so inured you .
You have been lied to since birth ; Santa Claus ; the Tooth Fairy ; the Easter Bunny ; the origins of Valentine 's Day ; Halloween ; Christmas .
Paganism prevails and has always prevailed in this world .
But soon comes a day of reckoning and the powers prevailing in this world will become powerless .
Wake up or you will be living in a police state where the right to life will become a fairy tale .

Reviewer : zeuslgn - - March 21 , 2008
Subject : Ignorant Ramblings JNagarya : Your comments are utterly ridiculous and ignorant .
First , the Constitution is steeped in history , particularly that of the Founding Fathers and the Revolution for Independence .
Libertarians are well - versed in that history , their viewpoints regarding the Constitution and freedom being nigh impossible without it .
Indeed , libertarians advocate a return to the past , particularly in how the Constitution ( and its purpose ) were originally viewed historically in the past .
As far as jabbering goes , you are one to talk , Sir , as you ignorantly jabber on about libertarians wanting to eliminate the rule of law !
Preposterous and absurd .
Indeed , libertarians seek to RESTORE the Rule of Law rather than allow the government to do as it wishes and continually break the law , namely the Constitution , the highest law in the land .
And then you try to obfuscate and confuse the issue by claiming the Founding Fathers were " liberals " which is true in a technical sense -- but likewise it is also technically true that today 's Democrats were the original Republicans .
You fail to take into consideration the classical meaning of " liberal " in that era versus what it means today -- but you knew that already , in fact you purposely used it to obfuscate and confuse anyone who reads your vitriol and does n't know the difference .
I would commend you on your cleverness but it was n't all that clever and as they say in Internet parlance " I see what you did there . "
Your comment on the meaning of the Second Amendment shows you are stupendously void of the very history you blast libertarians for lacking .
Sir , the Founders fought and died to stop a Tyrant named George from enslaving them .
Do n't spit on their deeds by claiming untruths about them .
They knew as well as you do that without a defense against government LIKE THE ONE THEY FOUGHT , tyranny and corruption will reign .
This is obvious in the lengths they went to to protect us with the Bill of Rights , but if you 're too blind to see that then all you have to do is read their own words , they wrote plenty of documents besides the Declaration and the Constitution and they were quite plain in what they believed .
I recommend starting with Jefferson .
That alone should be enough .
And then you blather on about libertarians being " corporatist " .
No Sir , it is ignorant Neocons such as yourself that support the depredations of corporations with big government interference in the natural course of business .
There is no actual thing you can touch called a corporation , there are only people .
Corporations only exist on paper and can only cause harm if allowed to via corrupt politicians asking for bribes .
Capitalism is not evil , Sir. So - called corporations in bed with corrupt government stooges are .
There can be no political ideology greater than the freedom for men and women to go about their daily business without government interference .
Only when one person has harmed another and violated the rights of life , liberty or property of another should the law you are so fond of touting be involved and even then it should not be administered by the most corrupt , inept and anti-freedom group that exists .

For what a man can say genuinely , he can say in plain understanding of the common ear .
Yes , he could be too idealistic , yes the definition of stupidity is to repeat mistakes ... and still Michael makes good points .

But if you came here to base a few of his mistakes as the basis for discrediting EVERYTHING he had to say , then keep your comments where they belong ... in the safety of your own mind .
He does speak some truth , and I admire that .

I am personally tired of apathy and doing nothing .
If you are afraid of people thinking for themselves ( which is defined in your post ) then good !
Be scared and do something about it .
We are apathetic , but is that because we are happy ?
I doubt it .
I believe we are being conditioned from birth to be pacified with lots of bread and entertainment ... as long as we work ... obediently ... willingly .
In and of itself , this is fine , but allows bad things to come in the long term .
We become pampered slaves , slowly and willingly .
Michael said freedom is hard work , and not everyone should feel the need to fight tooth and nail for it .
He realizes people from a lot of angles .

Subject : Beyond uninformed , dangerous --
It 's unfortunate the inability to distingusih between law , on one hand -- as in " Constitution " -- and on the other , olitical idiology .
I 've yet to listen to are talk with a " Libertarian " who knew the difference ; who did not substitute political idiology for law .
Worse , the " Libertarian " " philosophy " lives in an ahistorical vacuum -- it 's as if the past never happened ; thus it is possible to posit reinventing the wheel , from scratch , as if the wheel had n't already been invented .
As if it were n't already known that a square wheel wo n't roll .
Clue : man tried living in societies without the rule of law .
It did n't work because man is imperfect .
So we have " Libertarians " jabbering about eliminating the rule of law , and substituting therefor man 's entusiasm for accepting personal responsibility .
And then there 's the additional flaw of invoking the Founders and Framers as being " Libertarian " -- or " Libertarian " - like .
In fact , they were Liberals .
As for the " Libertarian " 's bogus claim that the Second Amendment protects an individual right : the reality is this :
No sane , non-sucicdal society leaves dangerous substances or objects lying around unregulated .
The further reality is this -- easily learned by reading the debates by the Framers of the Bill of Rights :
As in " We the people , " in the Second Amendment is _PLURAL_ .
The Framers of that which became the Second Amendment did debate a possible individual right : that of the " person " -- indivdual -- " religiously scrupulous of " -- AGAINST -- " bearing arms " not being " compelled " -- INVOLUNTARY -- to perform militia DUTY .
Those are not complicated facts , and are easily found for oneself : _Creating the Bill of Rights : The Documentary Record from the First Federal Congress_ ( Baltimore : Johns Hopkins , 1991 ) , Ed. by Helen E. Veit ; and _ The Complete Bill of Rights : The Drafts , Debates , Sources , & Origins_ ( NY : Oxford , 1997 ) , Ed. by Neil H. Cohen .
Both are in print and readily availabe .
The corporatist " Libertarian " -- for that is the reality behind " Libertarian " ism -- laissez faire non-regulation of the powerful -- Badnarik wo n't tell you those facts , doubtless becaues he does n't know them .
But , then again , " Libertarians " are against the rule of law to begin with -- wanting to dump it all for a tried - and - failed pie - in - the - sky delusion -- so have netierh interest in learning the actual law , nor the willingness to distnguish between law and political idiology instead of substituting the latter for the former .

TOOL ask you if you " are going to bow down to the New World Order " and also how they " sure could use a vacation from this bull - shit three ring circus side show " .
Rage Against the Machine ( Politicle Musicle Revolutionist ) covers just about every thing , kind of like Michael Badnarik .

Subject : devolves into insanity
This video is very entertaining .
Badnarik is an engaging speaker , and definitely believes what he is saying .
The first few hours are very informative if somewhat incorrect ( When he says something that seems too good to be true , it probably is , especially concerning allodial land titles which he refers to in the first hour .
The titles to which he refers are " pseudo - allodial " , in which you basically end up paying the future property taxes on the land in a lump sum .
It is more a form of hedging against increased assesment values than any attainment of rights . )
The entire seven hours of the video can be summed up in a short sentence - " You can do anything you want if you 're willing to kill anyone who tries to stop you . "
The lecture focuses on the difference between " privileges " and " rights " , " privileges " being granted by a higher authority and " rights " being self - granted in the presence of no higher ( recognized ) authority .
So , basically , you have the right to do anything you want , as long as you are willing to assert the right .
This basically means that you have to shoot anyone that says otherwise .
For example , you have the " right " to own any number of guns you want , and the government may have no " right " to them .
However , that does n't mean the government can't try to take them , and basically means that you have to shoot any government agent that tries to take them .
Badnarik becomes more and more overt about this through the hours of video , eventually saying , literally , that if FDR were still alive today , he would assassinate him personally , and that if any government agent tries to take his guns , that he will shoot them .
From this , any person can declare a plot of land on which they reside to be their property .
" Property " as described in this video basically means that the plot of land is a sovereign nation .
Well , sure , all it takes to start a country is to say that your plot of land is a country , which is basically how the United States started .
However , it comes down to the fact that if someone thinks that your " country " is part of theirs , then you have to kill anyone that attempts to exert authority over it .
However this sounds in principle , the fact is that if you actually try to assert any of these " rights " that Badnarik says you have , you 'll end up in jail if you 're lucky and dead if you 're not , unless you have sufficient military resources to withstand an attack from the US government .
Not likely .
In short , the video may be informative in the sense that you learn that you in fact have no rights as a citizen of the US , but it 's somewhat ridiculous to think that there 's anything you can do about it .

Did you know the federal government can take over your radio station remotely , instantly , and broadcast what they choose ?
do you have any money ?
You think so ?
then watch this video .
Do you own your car ?
You think so ?
Do you have Constitutional Rights ?

If you have always had a suspicion that there 's something fishy going on with the US government , but could n't quite put your finger on it ,
or
if you hav eheard that ' taxes are illegal ' but did n't know why or how ,
or
If you think that there is nothing you can do ,
or if you just want a really good overview of the US Constitution , given by someone who understands it well enough to make it all sound obvious , then watc all 7 of these videos .
Burn them on disc , and send them as Christmas Presents ... everyone will admire your choosing the perfect gift .
I do n't rave about many of the files I download ...
I 've downloaded about 500 gigabytes of stuff from this site , and this is one of the top 20 files I 've seen ... in fact , all 7 of these are in the top 20 .
I recommend this series without reservation to anyone who can understand the English langage ...
My rating is strictly on the content : five stars , or more ...
The video quality is about a 4 or so .
Oh yeah , this guy is running for president , by the way , if he won , My impression is that he would not only attempt , but be actually ABLE to change the govt .
from a pirate ship openly flying the Jolly Roger , and unlawfully preying on the weak and rifling through your wallet , ...
to a smooth - running ship of state , as it was engineered to be in the first place .
But regardless of who you are voting for , this material will be flat out worth watching .

RIAA University Campaign Sputters : Group Asked To Pay Up For Wasting School 's Time

Lately , the RIAA has been on a high - profile campaign to get college students that the RIAA believes have been involved in illegal file trading to settle lawsuits against them at a " discount " .
As part of this strategy , the company has tried to enlist universities to help them identify and turn over the names of offending students .
But it 's heartening to see that some universities are n't spinelessly acquiescing to the RIAA 's demands .
The University of Wisconsin has told the RIAA that it has no obligation to rat its students out unless it 's compelled to do so by a subpoena .
Meanwhile , the University of Nebraska has told the RIAA that it can't help them identify many of the students accused of file trading .
The school 's system changes a computer 's IP address each time its turned on , and it only keeps this information for month .
After that month , the school has no way of associating an IP address with a computer or its user .
The RIAA is angry about this , and a spokesman for the group criticized the university for not understanding " the need to retain these records " .
This is a ridiculous complaint .
The university does n't have a need to retain these records , and there 's no reason it should do so out of some obligation to the RIAA .
If there were any doubt that the university is really irritated by the RIAA 's requests , it has requested that the RIAA pay the university to reimburse its expenses from dealing with this ( good luck with that ) .
If all of this back and forth sounds familiar , it 's because it very closely resembles what happened a few years ago when the RIAA tried getting ISPs to share data on their users .
Fortunately , the ISPs stood up for their users and told the RIAA to get lost .
It 's too bad the group did n't seem to learn its lesson .

“ Control the environment so people can live their lives . ”
It will require more troops , he says , but ultimately things will stabilize .
Then Iraqi forces can take over , and we can leave .

8 p.m. : Seems like an odd segue , but Sen.
McCain is moving on from green energy to kiddie porn , a subject he had wanted to discuss .
Directly addressing D attendees , he says , “ Internet child porn is spreading .
You have the ability to help us combat it .
You can help us develop the tools necessary to combat this terrible evil . ”
And with that , the session concludes .

Already pulling his cabinet together , apparently .

US officials admitted last night that the bombing of the Iraqi parliament shows that not even the heavily fortified Green Zone is safe any more , despite the security crackdown launched earlier this year in the Iraqi capital .
American and Iraqi security officials were last night investigating how a suicide bomber evaded a ring of security checks and blew himself up in the assembly 's cafe , killing three MPs and five other people and wounding more than 20 .
About 100,000 US and Iraqi soldiers are on the streets of the capital as part of the troop " surge " begun two months ago ; while security inside the Green Zone has been tightened following the recent discovery there of two suicide bomb belts .
But after the deadliest attack ever in the Green Zone , US officials warned that nowhere is safe in Baghdad .
" The international zone is not safe , it is just safer than the rest of the city , " said Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Garver .
" Enemies of the country are trying to drive a wedge between the people and the government . "
In Washington the secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , said : " We know that there is a security problem in Baghdad .
This [ crackdown ] is still early in the process and I do n't think anyone expected that there would n't be counter - efforts by terrorists to undermine the security presence . "
The blast came hours after a suicide truck bomb exploded on a major bridge in northern Baghdad that links the east and west of the city .
The steel structure collapsed and sent cars tumbling into the Tigris river , killing at least 10 people .
The parliament bomber struck at around 2.30 pm as lawmakers and government officials gathered for lunch on the first floor .
The Saddam - era building also houses Iraqi government offices and has withstood repeated mortar attacks since March 2003 .
Barzan Mohammed , an assistant to the deputy speaker of parliament , Arif Tayfour , said : " I was just leaving my office for lunch and there was this very big bang .
I ran along the corridor to the restaurant but all I could see were huge clouds of dust .
It was choking and there was the smell of burning meat .
" The windows were blown out , there were tables and chairs everywhere and the sound of groaning .
Then I saw that many people had been hit , and that blood was everywhere . "
Major General William Caldwell , the chief US military spokesman , said witness accounts pointed to a suicide attack but " we do n't know at this point who it was .
We do know in the past that suicide vests have been used predominantly by al - Qaida . "
Initial reports said the explosion was near the cash register and there was speculation a cafe worker had smuggled in a bomb in food boxes .
But Mohammed Abu Bakr , who runs the parliamentary media unit , and other witnesses said they saw two legs on the floor .
" None of those killed or wounded lost their legs , " he said .
A police source said they had found the remains of what appeared to be a suicide belt , and the bomber was believed to have been a man .
The building was sealed after the blast and MPs were told to stay where they were for fear of a second blast .
Among the dead MPs was Mohammed Awad , a member of the hardline Sunni National Dialogue Front , which holds 11 seats in the legislature and is harshly critical of the Shia - led government of the prime minister , Nuri al Maliki .
Another was Taha al - Liheibi , of the Sunni Accordance Front , which holds 44 seats and is part of the National Unity government .
The third was Omar Ali al - Hussein , a member of the Kurdistan Islamic Union .
Iraq 's parliament is surrounded by concentric rings of checkpoints that start from the outer borders of the Green Zone .
Police were looking into reports that a security scanner checking pedestrians at the entrance near the parliament building was not working yesterday morning , and that people were searched by hand and metal detectors instead .
Once past these outer hurdles there is a further check at the door of the building itself .
Dogs sniff for explosives , handbags and briefcases are checked and put through a scanner , and individuals are patted down by guards to check for weapons .
Everyone who enters , including MPs , must have a pass or be escorted by someone with valid credentials .
Is n't it funny what a difference a couple of years can make ?
When Chester Bennington and the rest of the Linkin Parkies last roamed the earth in their full pomp , Green Day were all washed up , My Chemical Romance were an up - and - coming band with a substance - addled lead singer , and Charlie Simpson was still in Busted .
Now EVERYTHING is different ...
Not that you 'd know it from listening to this .
On the face of it , this is the same self - obsessed , mirror - staring , FEEL -MY - PAIN shouty nonsense as always , only with a slight Evenescence goth - sheen to it .
Compared to the wit and drama of MCR , the camp posturing of Fall Out Boy or the righteous anger of Green Day , it seems a bit lost .
A bit five years ago .
And it 's not the nicest thing in the world to admit that you 're not that interested in hearing someone scream their worst feelings about themselves into some kind of massive black musical void .
I mean , you do n't criticise car - crash victims for making the pavement look untidy , do you ?
Clearly Chester has some big nasty emotional issues that he wishes to expel , and hopefully anyone who 's in a similar state will hear him howling and feel some kinship .
So , shall we just say that while I appreciate that this is clearly something Linkin Park feel they have to do , some listeners may be left feeling like eavesdroppers at a meeting of Self - Haters Anonymous - The Musical .

TOKYO - The Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported that the United States and Japan are expected to upgrade their joint operation plan for a possible contingency on the Korean Peninsula .
The Japanese newspaper said the countries agreed on military cooperation in case of an armed conflict on the Korean Peninsula , a missile attack on Japan or the launching of an operation to protect Taiwan from China .
Nuclear Threat Rice : Nuclear test would deepen N. Korea 's isolation Reuters Following report communist state is preparing its second atomic explosion , US secretary of state says , ' We do n't see any change in the circumstances that we currently face '
Rice : Nuclear test would deepen N. Korea 's isolation
The Asahi Shimbun quoted local government officials as saying that under the new agreement the US would be authorized to launch attacks on North Korea from bases and ports in Japan .
In addition , the report said , Japanese and US officials will seek the cooperation of the police , local governments and the private sector in such functions as search and rescue operations for US military personnel , and providing and guarding bases and ports that would serve as operational hubs for the US military .
Some 50,000 American troops are regularly stationed in Japan as part of the existing alliance between the countries .
The current plan is aimed at providing an answer to the threats made by North Korean , which carried out nuclear and long - range missile tests in 2006 .
Talks scheduled for next month
A senior Japanese defense official confirmed that the two countries are examining “ reactions to possible scenarios in the area , ” and admitted that the North Korean nuclear threat and the tensions between China and Taiwan are “ two key points ” that raise Japan ’s concerns .
According to the Kyodo news agency , during talks scheduled for next month Japan and the US are expected to discuss logistical aid to American troops in case of and armed conflict between Beijing and Taipei .
The reports of increased cooperation between Japan and the US come amid Tokyo ’s efforts to raise its political and military profile overseas .
Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe has vowed to alter the pacifistic Japanese constitution to allow more freedom to operate militarily overseas .
The release of Windows Vista has caused an unfortunate resurgence in that eternal flame of computer religious wars , Mac vs. PC .
Everywhere I go , somebody 's explaining in impassioned tones why their pet platform is better than yours .
It 's all so tedious .
Personally , I had my fill of Mac versus PC arguments by 1994 .
I remember spending untold hours on the America Online forums endlessly debating the merits of PCs and Macs with Ross Rubin and other unsavory characters .
But all that arguing never seemed to result in anything other than more arguments .
Eventually , if you 're more interested in using computers than endlessly arguing about them , you outgrow the arguments .
And yet somehow , nearly fifteen years later , we 're all happily retreading the same tired old Mac vs. PC ground .
I have a problem with this .
You might read Charles Petzold 's ironically titled It Just Works as an anti-Mac diatribe .
It certainly casts Apple in an unflattering light ; Petzold 's poor mother can't seem to catch a break .
Perhaps if my mother used lots of various Mac applications and stuck in lots of external devices , the machine would " just work " quite well .
But she basically only uses email , so perhaps that 's the problem .
Just about every time I visit my mother in Jersey , I am called upon to boot up that dreadful machine and do something so it " just works " once again .
For awhile she had a problem where certain spam emails would hang the email program upon viewing , but they could n't be deleted without first being viewed .
( Gosh , that was fun . )
Presumably some patch to fix this little problem is among the 100 megabytes of updates waiting to be downloaded and installed , but my mother has a dial - up and we 're forced to forego this 100 meg download .
And besides , the slogan is n't " It just works with 100 megabytes of updates . "
But if you read closely , as I did , you 'll see that the experience would n't have been any better on a Windows PC .
For a PC of that vintage , it 's likely Petzold would have had to install the enormous Windows XP Service Pack 2 update to bring it up to date , which is certainly no less of a hassle than going from OS X 10.2 to OS X 10.4 .
That 's because Macs and PCs share one crucial flaw : they 're both computers .
My computer frustrates and infuriates me on a daily basis , and it's been this way since I first laid my hands on a keyboard .
Every computer I 've ever owned -- including the ones with an Apple logo -- has been a colossal pain in the neck .
Some slightly more so than others , but any device designed as a general purpose " do-everything " computing machine is destined to disappoint you eventually .
It 's inevitable .
The only truly sublime end - user experiences I 've had have been with computers that were n't computers -- specialized devices , such as Tivo , the original Palm Pilot , the Nintendo Wii , and so forth .
General purpose computing devices are designed to be all things to all people .
As a direct consequence , they will always be rife with compromises , pitfalls , and disappointments .
That 's the first secret of using computers : they all suck .
Which makes the entire Mac vs. PC debate relative degrees of moot .
I learned this lesson early in life ; evidently some people are still struggling with it .
Computers do have one strong suit : they 're unparalleled tools for writing , photography , programming , composing music , and creating art .
It 's the only reason to deal with the pain of owning one .
As the Guardian 's Charlie Brooker notes , the Mac vs. PC debate has an insidious side - effect that can distract you from this key benefit :
Ultimately the [ Get a Mac advertising ] campaign 's biggest flaw is that it perpetuates the notion that consumers somehow " define themselves " with the technology they choose .
If you truly believe you need to pick a mobile phone that " says something " about your personality , do n't bother .
You do n't have a personality .
A mental illness , maybe - but not a personality .
Of course , that has n't stopped me slagging off Mac owners with a series of sweeping generalisations for the past 900 words , but that is what the ads do to PCs .
Besides , that 's what we PC owners are like - unreliable , idiosyncratic and gleefully unfair .
And if you 'll excuse me now , I feel an unexpected crash coming .
That 's the other problem with the Mac vs. PC debate : it completely misses the point .
Computers are n't couture , they 're screwdrivers .
Your screwdriver rocks , and our screwdriver sucks .
So what ?
They 're screwdrivers .
If you really want to convince us , stop talking about your screwdriver , and show us what you 've created with it .
Black helicopter alert
There 's some very good news today for those readers who do not have the good fortune to live in either the UK or the US of A - you now officially exist according to Google UK .
Yup , maps.google.co.uk has now restored those bits of the the globe previously not thought worthy of inclusion in the big map - which was everywhere except Blighty and the States , Canada , Central America , some Caribbean islands and the Irish Republic .
There 's more on the terrifying conspiracy theory behind this mass erasure in our previous report into the matter .
But before the black helicopters can return to base , we must ask this simple question :
Why has Google Maps chosen to remain silent on the small matter of having located Jesus Christ in a Peruvian sand dune ?
We find it impossible to believe that Google did n't spot this ghostly Turin shroudesque image of Our Lord in the South American sands .
What are they not telling us ?
A quick phone call to Erich von Däniken confirmed our initial suspicions that the image was hewn from the sand by an ancient civilisation using hot air balloons and alien laser technology borrowed from the scientists of Atlantis .
Either that or someone is projecting a picture of Charles Manson onto the desert from a low Earth orbit , Erich told El Reg before popping out to discover a representation of an extraterrestrial wearing an Apple iPod carved into a stone by Mayan artisans in 500BC .
Whatever the truth , the implications of this discovery are chilling indeed .
Sinister things are afoot at Google , make no mistake . ®

Ein Stück Internet Geschichte
Not long ago , I was having lunch in a KFC in Harlem , sitting near eight African - American boys , aged about 14 .
Since 1 ) it was 1:30 on a school day , 2 ) they were carrying book bags , and 3 ) they seemed to be in no hurry , I assumed they were skipping school .
They were extremely loud and unruly , tossing food at one another and leaving it on the floor .
Black people ran the restaurant and made up the bulk of the customers , but it was hard to see much healthy “ black community ” here .
After repeatedly warning the boys to stop throwing food and keep quiet , the manager finally told them to leave .
The kids ignored her .
Only after she called a male security guard did they start slowly making their way out , tauntingly circling the restaurant before ambling off .
These teens clearly were n’t monsters , but they seemed to consider themselves exempt from public norms of behavior — as if they had begun to check out of mainstream society .
What struck me most , though , was how fully the boys ’ music — hard - edged rap , preaching bone - deep dislike of authority — provided them with a continuing soundtrack to their antisocial behavior .
So completely was rap ingrained in their consciousness that every so often , one or another of them would break into cocky , expletive - laden rap lyrics , accompanied by the angular , bellicose gestures typical of rap performance .
A couple of his buddies would then join him .
Rap was a running decoration in their conversation .
Many writers and thinkers see a kind of informed political engagement , even a revolutionary potential , in rap and hip - hop .
They could n’t be more wrong .
By reinforcing the stereotypes that long hindered blacks , and by teaching young blacks that a thuggish adversarial stance is the properly “ authentic ” response to a presumptively racist society , rap retards black success .
The venom that suffuses rap had little place in black popular culture — indeed , in black attitudes — before the 1960s .
The hip - hop ethos can trace its genealogy to the emergence in that decade of a black ideology that equated black strength and authentic black identity with a militantly adversarial stance toward American society .
In the angry new mood , captured by Malcolm X ’s upraised fist , many blacks ( and many more white liberals ) began to view black crime and violence as perfectly natural , even appropriate , responses to the supposed dehumanization and poverty inflicted by a racist society .
Briefly , this militant spirit , embodied above all in the Black Panthers , infused black popular culture , from the plays of LeRoi Jones to “ blaxploitation ” movies , like Melvin Van Peebles ’s Sweet Sweetback ’s Baadasssss Song , which celebrated the black criminal rebel as a hero .
But blaxploitation and similar genres burned out fast .
The memory of whites blatantly stereotyping blacks was too recent for the typecasting in something like Sweet Sweetback ’s Baadasssss
Song not to offend many blacks .
Observed black historian Lerone Bennett : “ There is a certain grim white humor in the fact that the black marches and demonstrations of the 1960s reached artistic fulfillment ” with “ provocative and ultimately insidious reincarnations of all the Sapphires and Studds of yesteryear . ”
Early rap mostly steered clear of the Sapphires and Studds , beginning not as a growl from below but as happy party music .
The first big rap hit , the Sugar Hill Gang ’s 1978 “ Rapper ’s Delight , ” featured a catchy bass groove that drove the music forward , as the jolly rapper celebrated himself as a ladies ’ man and a great dancer .
Soon , kids across America were rapping along with the nonsense chorus :
I said a hip , hop , the hippie , the hippie ,
to the hip - hip hop , ah you do n’t stop
the rock it to the bang bang boogie , say
up jump the boogie ,
to the rhythm of the boogie , the beat .
A string of ebullient raps ensued in the months ahead .
At the time , I assumed it was a harmless craze , certain to run out of steam soon .
But rap took a dark turn in the early 1980s , as this “ bubble gum ” music gave way to a “ gangsta ” style that picked up where blaxploitation left off .
Now top rappers began to write edgy lyrics celebrating street warfare or drugs and promiscuity .
Grandmaster Flash ’s ominous 1982 hit , “ The Message , ” with its chorus , “ It ’s like a jungle sometimes , it makes me wonder how I keep from going under , ” marked the change in sensibility .
It depicted ghetto life as profoundly desolate :
You grow in the ghetto , living second rate
And your eyes will sing a song of deep hate .
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alley way .
You ’ll admire all the numberbook takers ,
Thugs , pimps and pushers , and the big money makers .
Music critics fell over themselves to praise “ The Message , ” treating it as the poetry of the streets — as the elite media has characterized hip - hop ever since .
The song ’s grim fatalism struck a chord ; twice , I ’ve heard blacks in audiences for talks on race cite the chorus to underscore a point about black victimhood .
So did the warning it carried : “ Do n’t push me , ’ cause I ’m close to the edge , ” menacingly raps Melle Mel .
The ultimate message of “ The Message ” — that ghetto life is so hopeless that an explosion of violence is both justified and imminent — would become a hip - hop mantra in the years ahead .
The angry , oppositional stance that “ The Message ” reintroduced into black popular culture transformed rap from a fad into a multi-billion - dollar industry that sold more than 80 million records in the U.S. in 2002 — nearly 13 percent of all recordings sold .
To rap producers like Russell Simmons , earlier black pop was just sissy music .
He despised the “ soft , unaggressive music ( and non-threatening images ) ” of artists like Michael Jackson or Luther Vandross .
“ So the first chance I got , ” he says , “ I did exactly the opposite . ”
In the two decades since “ The Message , ” hip - hop performers have churned out countless rap numbers that celebrate a ghetto life of unending violence and criminality .
Schooly D’s “ PSK What Does It Mean ? ” is a case in point :
Copped my pistols , jumped into the ride .
Got at the bar , copped some flack ,
Copped some cheeba - cheeba , it was n’t wack .
Got to the place , and who did I see ?
A sucka-ass nigga tryin to sound like me .
Put my pistol up against his head —
I said , “ Sucka - ass nigga , I should shoot you dead . ”
The protagonist of a rhyme by KRS - One ( a hip - hop star who would later speak out against rap violence ) actually pulls the trigger :
Knew a drug dealer by the name of Peter —
Had to buck him down with my 9 millimeter .
Police forces became marauding invaders in the gangsta - rap imagination .
The late West Coast rapper Tupac Shakur expressed the attitude :
Ya gotta know how to shake the snakes , nigga ,
’ Cause the police love to break a nigga ,
Send him upstate ’ cause they straight up hate the nigga .
Shakur ’s anti-police tirade seems tame , however , compared with Ice - T ’s infamous “ Cop Killer ” :
I got my black shirt on .
I got my black gloves on .
I got my ski mask on .
This shit ’s been too long .
I got my 12 - gauge sawed - off .
I got my headlights turned off .
I ’m ’bout to bust some shots off .
I ’m ’bout to dust some cops off .
. . .
I ’m ’bout to kill me somethin ’
A pig stopped me for nuthin’ !
Cop killer , better you than me .
Cop killer , fuck police brutality ! . . .
Die , die , die pig , die !
Fuck the police ! . . .
Fuck the police yeah !
Rap also began to offer some of the most icily misogynistic music human history has ever known .
Here ’s Schooly D again :
Tell you now , brother , this ai n’t no joke ,
She got me to the crib , she laid me on the bed ,
I fucked her from my toes to the top of my head .
I finally realized the girl was a whore ,
Gave her ten dollars , she asked me for some more .
Jay - Z’s “ Is That Yo Bitch ? ” mines similar themes :
I do n’t love ’em , I fuck ’em .
I do n’t chase ’em , I duck ’em .
I replace ’em with another one .
. . .
She be all on my dick .
Or , as N.W.A. ( an abbreviation of “ Niggers with Attitude ” ) tersely sums up the hip - hop worldview : “ Life ai n’t nothin ’ but bitches and money . ”
Rap ’s musical accompaniment mirrors the brutality of rap lyrics in its harshness and repetition .
Simmons fashions his recordings in contempt for euphony .
“ What we used for melody was implied melody , and what we used for music was sounds — beats , scratches , stuff played backward , nothing pretty or sweet . ”
The success of hip - hop has resulted in an ironic reversal .
In the seventies , screaming hard rock was in fashion among young whites , while sweet , sinuous funk and soul ruled the black airwaves — a difference I was proud of .
But in the eighties , rock quieted down , and black music became the assault on the ears and soul .
Anyone who grew up in urban America during the eighties wo n’t soon forget the young men strolling down streets , blaring this sonic weapon from their boom boxes , with defiant glares daring anyone to ask them to turn it down .
Hip - hop exploded into popular consciousness at the same time as the music video , and rappers were soon all over MTV , reinforcing in images the ugly world portrayed in rap lyrics .
Video after video features rap stars flashing jewelry , driving souped - up cars , sporting weapons , angrily gesticulating at the camera , and cavorting with interchangeable , mindlessly gyrating , scantily clad women .
Of course , not all hip - hop is belligerent or profane — entire CDs of gang - bangin ’ , police - baiting , woman - bashing invective would get old fast to most listeners .
But it ’s the nastiest rap that sells best , and the nastiest cuts that make a career .
As I write , the top ten best - selling hip - hop recordings are 50 Cent ( currently with the second - best - selling record in the nation among all musical genres ) , Bone Crusher , Lil’ Kim , Fabolous , Lil’ Jon and the East Side Boyz , Cam’ron Presents the Diplomats , Busta Rhymes , Scarface , Mobb Deep , and Eminem .
Every one of these groups or performers personifies willful , staged opposition to society — Lil ’ Jon and crew even regale us with a song called “ Do n’t Give a Fuck ” — and every one celebrates the ghetto as “ where it ’s at . ”
Thus , the occasional dutiful songs in which a rapper urges men to take responsibility for their kids or laments senseless violence are mere garnish .
Keeping the thug front and center has become the quickest and most likely way to become a star .
No hip - hop luminary has worked harder than Sean “ P. Diddy ” Combs , the wildly successful rapper , producer , fashion mogul , and CEO of Bad Boy Records , to cultivate a gangsta image — so much so that he ’s blurred the line between playing the bad boy and really being one .
Combs may have grown up middle - class in Mount Vernon , New York , and even have attended Howard University for a while , but he ’s proven he can gang - bang with the worst .
Cops charged Combs with possession of a deadly weapon in 1995 .
In 1999 , he faced charges for assaulting a rival record executive .
Most notoriously , police charged him that year with firing a gun at a nightclub in response to an insult , injuring three bystanders , and with fleeing the scene with his entourage ( including then - pal Jennifer “ J. Lo ” Lopez ) .
Combs got off , but his young rapper prot& # eacute ; g#é Jamal “ Shyne ” Barrow went to prison for firing the gun .
Combs and his crew are far from alone among rappers in keeping up the connection between “ rap and rap sheet , ” as critic Kelefa Sanneh artfully puts it .
Several prominent rappers , including superstar Tupac Shakur , have gone down in hails of bullets — with other rappers often suspected in the killings .
Death Row Records producer Marion “ Suge ” Knight just finished a five - year prison sentence for assault and federal weapons violations .
Current rage 50 Cent flaunts his bullet scars in photos ; cops recently arrested him for hiding assault weapons in his car .
Of the top ten hip - hop sellers mentioned above , five have had scrapes with the law .
In 2000 , at least five different fights broke out at the Source Hiphop Awards — intended to be the rap industry ’s Grammys .
The final brawl , involving up to 100 people in the audience and spilling over onto the stage , shut the ceremony down — right after a video tribute to slain rappers .
Small wonder a popular rap website goes by the name rapsheet.com .
Many fans , rappers , producers , and intellectuals defend hip - hop ’s violence , both real and imagined , and its misogyny as a revolutionary cry of frustration from disempowered youth .
For Simmons , gangsta raps “ teach listeners something about the lives of the people who create them and remind them that these people exist . ”
50 Cent recently told Vibe magazine , “ Mainstream America can look at me and say , ‘ That ’s the mentality of a young man from the ’hood . ’ ” University of Pennsylvania black studies professor Michael Eric Dyson has written a book - length paean to Shakur , praising him for “ challenging narrow artistic visions of black identity ” and for “ artistically exploring the attractions and limits of black moral and social subcultures ” — just one of countless fawning treatises on rap published in recent years .
The National Council of Teachers of English , recommending the use of hip - hop lyrics in urban public school classrooms ( as already happens in schools in Oakland , Los Angeles , and other cities ) , enthuses that “ hip - hop can be used as a bridge linking the seemingly vast span between the streets and the world of academics . ”
But we ’re sorely lacking in imagination if in 2003 — long after the civil rights revolution proved a success , at a time of vaulting opportunity for African Americans , when blacks find themselves at the top reaches of society and politics — we think that it signals progress when black kids rattle off violent , sexist , nihilistic , lyrics , like Russians reciting Pushkin .
Some defended blaxploitation pictures as revolutionary , too , but the passage of time has exposed the silliness of such a contention .
“ The message of Sweetback is that if you can get it together and stand up to the Man , you can win , ” Van Peebles once told an interviewer .
But win what ?
All Sweetback did , from what we see in the movie , was avoid jail — and it would be nice to have more useful counsel on overcoming than “ kicking the Man ’s ass . ”
Claims about rap ’s political potential will look equally gestural in the future .
How is it progressive to describe life as nothing but “ bitches and money ” ?
Or to tell impressionable black kids , who ’d find every door open to them if they just worked hard and learned , that blowing a rival ’s head off is “ real ” ?
How helpful is rap ’s sexism in a community plagued by rampant illegitimacy and an excruciatingly low marriage rate ?
The idea that rap is an authentic cry against oppression is all the sillier when you recall that black Americans had lots more to be frustrated about in the past but never produced or enjoyed music as nihilistic as 50 Cent or N.W.A .
On the contrary , black popular music was almost always affirmative and hopeful .
Nor do we discover music of such violence in places of great misery like Ethiopia or the Congo — unless it ’s imported American hip - hop .
Given the hip - hop world ’s reflexive alienation , it ’s no surprise that its explicit political efforts , such as they are , are hardly progressive .
Simmons has founded the “ Hip - Hop Summit Action Network ” to bring rap stars and fans together in order to forge a “ bridge between hip - hop and politics . ”
But HSAN ’s policy positions are mostly tired bromides .
Sticking with the long - discredited idea that urban schools fail because of inadequate funding from the stingy , racist white Establishment , for example , HSAN joined forces with the teachers ’ union to protest New York mayor Bloomberg ’s proposed education budget for its supposed lack of generosity .
HSAN has also stuck it to President Bush for invading Iraq .
And it has vociferously protested the affixing of advisory labels on rap CDs that warn parents about the obscene language inside .
Fighting for rappers ’ rights to obscenity : that ’s some kind of revolution !
Okay , maybe rap is n’t progressive in any meaningful sense , some observers will admit ; but is n’t it just a bunch of kids blowing off steam and so nothing to worry about ?
I think that response is too easy .
With music videos , DVD players , Walkmans , the Internet , clothes , and magazines all making hip - hop an accompaniment to a person ’s entire existence , we need to take it more seriously .
In fact , I would argue that it is seriously harmful to the black community .
The rise of nihilistic rap has mirrored the breakdown of community norms among inner-city youth over the last couple of decades .
It was just as gangsta rap hit its stride that neighborhood elders began really to notice that they ’d lost control of young black men , who were frequently drifting into lives of gang violence and drug dealing .
Well into the seventies , the ghetto was a shabby part of town , where , despite unemployment and rising illegitimacy , a healthy number of people were doing their best to “ keep their heads above water , ” as the theme song of the old black sitcom Good Times put it .
By the eighties , the ghetto had become a ruleless war zone , where black people were their own worst enemies .
It would be silly , of course , to blame hip - hop for this sad downward spiral , but by glamorizing life in the “ war zone , ” it has made it harder for many of the kids stuck there to extricate themselves .
Seeing a privileged star like Sean Combs behave like a street thug tells those kids that there ’s nothing more authentic than ghetto pathology , even when you ’ve got wealth beyond imagining .
The attitude and style expressed in the hip - hop “ identity ” keeps blacks down .
Almost all hip - hop , gangsta or not , is delivered with a cocky , confrontational cadence that is fast becoming — as attested to by the rowdies at KFC — a common speech style among young black males .
Similarly , the arm - slinging , hand - hurling gestures of rap performers have made their way into many young blacks ’ casual gesticulations , becoming integral to their self - expression .
The problem with such speech and mannerisms is that they make potential employers wary of young black men and can impede a young black ’s ability to interact comfortably with co-workers and customers .
The black community has gone through too much to sacrifice upward mobility to the passing kick of an adversarial hip - hop “ identity . ”
On a deeper level , there is something truly unsettling and tragic about the fact that blacks have become the main agents in disseminating debilitating — dare I say racist — images of themselves .
Rap guru Russell Simmons claims that “ the coolest stuff about American culture — be it language , dress , or attitude — comes from the underclass .
Always has and always will . ”
Yet back in the bad old days , blacks often complained — with some justification — that the media too often depicted blacks simply as uncivilized .
Today , even as television and films depict blacks at all levels of success , hip - hop sends the message that blacks are . . . uncivilized .
I find it striking that the cry-racism crowd does n’t condemn it .
For those who insist that even the invisible structures of society reinforce racism , the burden of proof should rest with them to explain just why hip - hop ’s bloody and sexist lyrics and videos and the criminal behavior of many rappers would n’t have a powerfully negative effect upon whites ’ conception of black people .
Sadly , some black leaders just do n’t seem to care what lesson rap conveys .
Consider Savannah ’s black high schools , which hosted the local rapper Camoflauge as a guest speaker several times before his murder earlier this year .
Here ’s a representative lyric :
Gimme tha keys to tha car , I ’m ready for war .
When we ride on these niggas smoke that ass like a ’ gar .
Hit your block with a Glock , clear the set with a Tech . . . .
You think I ’m jokin , see if you laughing when tha pistol be smokin —
Leave you head split wide open
And you bones get broken .
. . .
More than a few of the Concerned Black People inviting this “ artist ” to speak to the impressionable youth of Savannah would presumably be the first to cry out about “ how whites portray blacks in the media . ”
Far from decrying the stereotypes rampant in rap ’s present - day blaxploitation , many hip - hop defenders pull the “ whitey - does - it - too ” trick .
They point to the Godfather movies or The Sopranos as proof that violence and vulgarity are widespread in American popular culture , so that singling out hip - hop for condemnation is simply bigotry .
Yet such a defense is pitifully weak .
No one really looks for a way of life to emulate or a political project to adopt in The Sopranos .
But for many of its advocates , hip - hop , with its fantasies of revolution and community and politics , is more than entertainment .
It forms a bedrock of young black identity .
Nor will it do to argue that hip - hop is n’t “ black ” music , since most of its buyers are white , or because the “ hip - hop revolution ” is nominally open to people of all colors .
That whites buy more hip - hop recordings than blacks do is hardly surprising , given that whites vastly outnumber blacks nationwide .
More to the point , anyone who claims that rap is n’t black music will need to reconcile that claim with the widespread wariness among blacks of white rappers like Eminem , accused of “ stealing our music and giving it back to us . ”
At 2 AM on the New York subway not long ago , I saw another scene — more dispiriting than my KFC encounter with the rowdy rapping teens — that captures the essence of rap ’s destructiveness .
A young black man entered the car and began to rap loudly — profanely , arrogantly — with the usual wild gestures .
This went on for five irritating minutes .
When no one paid attention , he moved on to another car , all the while spouting his doggerel .
This was what this young black man presented as his message to the world — his oratory , if you will .
Anyone who sees such behavior as a path to a better future — anyone , like Professor Dyson , who insists that hip - hop is an urgent “ critique of a society that produces the need for the thug persona ” — should step back and ask himself just where , exactly , the civil rights–era blacks might have gone wrong in lacking a hip - hop revolution .
They created the world of equality , striving , and success I live and thrive in .
Hip - hop creates nothing .

From time to time , one of my readers asks a question via email that just keeps me thinking .
And sometimes , when I realize the question is not only interesting for me , but maybe for you as well , I may decide to post it and make an article out of it .
Just like last week , when a reader asked :
How much of the software industry will have to deal with the concurrent computing problem ?
This article contains my thoughts on the subject and also allows me to let my mind wander in search for the applications that this kind of power will allow .
The short answer to the question : Many people in the software industry need to deal with it .
How many exactly , I cannot tell , because I do n’t have the big picture ( TM ) on the software industry as a whole .
I can see two groups that will definitely embrace parallel programming : the first one is everyone with a program that has substantial calculations involved – or in other words : all compute - bound programs .
Game programming is the premier example , but stuff like image - processing , multimedia applications and I do n’t know what else will surely follow ( or already do ) .
It ’s quite easy to ignore the fact that there are two cores in today ’s machines , as there are probably more than enough processes on the machine to keep them at least somewhat busy .
Firewalls , anti-virus - software and things like that will happily work on the second core , keeping one core free for the program I am actually working in .
The same thing probably somehow applies to the quadcore machines that will be sold next year ( or already are sold right now ) .
Things get harder when we have 8 , 16 or maybe 80 cores to keep busy .
As many of you know , Intel is developing a machine with that many cores on a single chip .
Every program that is not spending its entire time waiting on the user cannot afford to ignore this potential , as the users are going to wonder why they have to wait for their programs , while their task manager shows a lot of idle resources .
I would call this first group the performance group .
They have performance problems and the only way to solve them on today ’s machines is to embrace parallelism .
As I said , I have no idea how big this group is , but I bet it is growing .
The second group of software developers that will embrace parallelism is probably even smaller , but if I were you I would try to watch it closely .
For them , parallelism is not a burden – many people in the first group I mentioned probably think so , because in the good old days there was no need to parallelize programs , they would just get faster in time with no effort involved .
This second group views parallelism as a chance to do new things and provide value that was not possible before .
I will try to explain it with an example :
Your email application most likely already uses threads to keep the user interface responsive while connecting to your mailbox in the background .
It also most likely has fancy search features included .
What if both of these capabilities would be combined and your email application analyzed the text you are typing as you type it , looking for similar mails you have written or received in the background and keeps them at a handy place ?
An application like that is possible with today ’s computing power – yet I have never seen it .
Searching through your whole hard drive using one of the desktop search programs that were all the hype a few years ago is another example – I do n’t want to change my application and type in a search phrase into these programs , I want them to work in the background to provide me with the information I need know – without me explicitly asking them for it .
Let ’s see what else I can come up with :
While you are chatting with a friend using e.g .
Skype , a voice recognition software could run in the background on a different core , analyze your conversation and try to understand key phrases .
Or even the main nouns would be enough .
And while you are busy talking about a certain topic , in a convenient location a few websites could automatically be loaded that are related to your conversation to make you appear more knowledgeable on a subject .
Or present you with a few Ebay - listings .
Wikipedia .
Google search results .
Related books on Amazon .
The possibilities are endless and the computing power to make it possible is here today or will be available shortly .
Do the ideas presented here make sense ?
I do n’t know .
Maybe none of them would actually work and provide additional value .
But I have put them down here so you can see what I mean when I am talking about innovation through parallel programming .
People that are possibly a lot smarter than me will come up with creative ideas to use the cores and the tremendous computing power that will be available when there are 4 , 8 , 16 or even 80 cores in your machine .
And these are the people and ideas I would keep a close eye on , as some of them may dramatically change the way we use our computers every day .
I want to close this article with a short challenge : what would you do , when you had 80 or so cores to spare ?
What kind of program do you crave for that this kind of parallel programming power makes possible in the first place ?

With each trip to the mail box you become more and more buried in tons of junk mail .
Well no longer will you fall victim to the sneaky junk mail peddlers .
Learn how to regain your mail box .
Learn how to end junk mail forever .
What would you do if I sent you a bill for several dollars each month , for a service you didnâ€™t want , and had not ordered ?
What if there was no way to dodge paying this bill and no matter what you tried the bill just kept coming ?
Well this is basically what happens when you get junk mail .
( click on pictures for full sized images )
Most people donâ€™t think about it but all that junk mail that gets sent to you has to go someplace .
Most of us throw it away , some of us recycle it , but either way we are paying to dispose of it .
Some communities pay to have their trash taken away , others use a tax system , and still others require that you pay for the right to use a dump .
Even if you recycle the junk mail , you are still paying .
Recycling in most communities is paid for the same way trash collection is .
Besides all the money it costs you , companies that make junk mail are wasting paper , wasting ink , wasting power to create the junk mail , wasting gas to send the mail to you , and wasting your time when you have to sort it out of the mail .
So how can we make this madness stop ?
How can we stop junk mail ?
Itâ€™s simple .
We make it so expensive to send us junk mail that companies stop doing it .
We use junk mail against itself .
So about now you should be fired up , â€ œYea lets stick it to the man !â€ 
What we need to do is cost the junk mail people a lot of money .
The way we do this is by moving the cost of disposal back into the hands of the junk mailers .
When you get some junk mail the first thing you should do is open it and look for the reply envelope .
This little guy is amazing .
Not only is it already filled out with the address of the bastards that sent you the mail ; they have also foolishly paid return postage .
Set this gem aside for the moment .
Now take the rest of the crap that came in the junk mail , ( including the envelope it came in ) and tear it up .
This is the most fun part .
Once the mail is in nice bite size scraps place it in the return envelope .
Place this little darling into your mailbox and flip up the flag .
You have just forwarded all the cost of disposal onto the junk mailer .
They will have to pay someone ( or run some machine ) to open your mail , and then pay to dispose of the confetti that falls out .
They also have to pay the postage on this garbage .
Not only is this a fun game , the more junk mail you get the fatter you can stuff the little return envelopes .
I have stuffed entire catalogs into credit card return envelopes .
Use some tape to keep it shut , the fatter the envelope the more the post office will charge the junk mailer .
There is also no reason you cant send the junk mail that didnâ€™t come with a return envelope back to the junk mailer that did send you one .
In this way you can send the Pottery Barn catalog back to Visa , and the coupon book back to MasterCard .
If each and every one of us moves the cost of junk mail back to the junk mailers we can impose millions of dollars in â€œfinesâ€ on them each year .
Imagine how much it is going to cost them to dispose of millions of pounds of scrap paper each year .
The only reason they have not had to pay any of this cost so far is because we have been doing all the disposal or recycling for them .
Brothers , sisters , join with me and help me stick it to the junk mailers where it will hurt them most , their wallets .
A prankster posing as a federal housing official took center stage at a New Orleans event with the city mayor and the governor of Louisiana , controversially promising to throw open closed public housing to thousands of poor former city residents .
The stunt , which the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development called a " cruel hoax , " was the latest by an activist group known as " The Yes Men " who have previously masqueraded as World Trade Organization officials announcing they were disbanding the body .
Activist Andy Bichlbaum , pretending to be HUD " Assistant Deputy Secretary Rene Oswin , " told hundreds of businesspeople at a forum the agency would reverse policy and reopen housing units now targeted for replacement by mixed - income development .
He promised to " fix New Orleans , not just for the benefit of a few but for everyone . "
The audience applauded the speech and the moderator thanked " Oswin " for the " dramatic announcement . "
Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco and New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin gave the preceding speeches at The Gulf Reconstruction and Hurricane Preparedness Summit , although neither was on the podium when the bogus official spoke .
The summit and action by The Yes Men come a day before the one - year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina , which devastated the city and led to the closing of New Orleans public housing .
The federal agency in reality aims to replace much of city 's public housing with mixed - income development , arguing that will produce safer neighborhoods and better lives .
It confirmed that plan in a statement denouncing the stunt .
But agency 's plans have become extremely controversial , with critics saying low - income people will be squeezed out of New Orleans , since the redeveloped land will have fewer spots for the poorest .
A fake release from U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Alphonso Jackson announced the purported change .
" Today , it is my great pleasure to announce to you that HUD is reversing our policy .
From now on , and beginning at all Orleans parish housing communities , our policy will no longer be to destroy much - needed housing , but to do all in our power to make it work , " said the statement .
Later , the group provided barbecued chicken and ribs to contractors at an open public housing development while a brass band belted out New Orleans jazz .
One contractor lured to the event told Bichlbaum he thought the buildings could be fixed for less than half the cost of new construction .
" The main thing is to get in here and get it done , " said Jeff Perryman of B3 Construction .
Mike Bonanno , the second " Yes Man , " told Reuters the hoax was a bittersweet achievement .
" It 's helped us to become the people we wish we could be to correct the problems , " he said .
The duo has a movie , " The Yes Men . "

Observers in the Netherlands reported that more than 240 wild plant species were flowering in December , along with more than 200 cultivated species .
According to biologist Arnold van Vliet of Wageningen University , this unseasonable flowering is being caused by extremely high autumn temperatures .
The mean autumn temperature in 2006 was 13.6 °C , which is 3.4 °C above the long - term average .
It was even 1.6 °C warmer than in 2005 , which was previously the warmest autumn since 1706 , when records were first kept .
It is very likely that other European countries also experienced unseasonable flowering due to the high temperatures .
This information emerged from a unique , large - scale observation campaign conducted by volunteers during the first 15 days of the month .
The flowering observation campaign was coordinated by the Dutch phenological network Natuurkalender ( Nature ’s Calendar ) , which comprises organisations such as Wageningen University , the FLORON Foundation and the popular nature and wildlife radio programme Vroege Vogels ( Early Birds ) .
After the radio programme requested its listeners to make observations of plants in flower on the 10th of December , nearly 2000 observations were submitted by 280 volunteers via the Nature ’s Calendar website .
The aim of the observation campaign was to determine the effects of the extreme weather conditions in the Netherlands during the second half of 2006 .
This year included not only the warmest July and September on record , but also the wettest August .
Temperatures were far above normal : 3.7 °C higher in September , 3.3 °C higher in October and 3 °C higher in November .
The first 17 days of December were even more extreme , registering 4.2 °C above normal .
For the entire autumn the average temperature was 3.4 °C above the long - term average and even 1.6 °C warmer than the autumn of 2005 , which was previously the warmest on record in the Netherlands .
An analysis of the observations revealed that over 240 wild plant species were observed to be flowering during the first 15 days of December .
Examples of such species include Cow parsley , Sweet violet and Evening star .
According to scientists at Wageningen University , only 2 % of these plants normally flower in the winter , while 27 % end their main flowering period in autumn and 56 % before October .
In addition , the observers reported that more than 200 garden plants were flowering in December .
According to this data , the unusually high temperatures are clearly lengthening the growing season .
Leaf colouring and leaf fall of species like Oak and Beech occurred two to three weeks later than the average during the first half of the 20th century .
For species such as Hazel , the flowering season began at least one month earlier than normal .
Some Rhododendron varieties and Japanese Cherry also flowered at the beginning of December , while they previously flowered at the end of January or February .
A complete overview of all the wild plants observed can be found at www.natuurkalender.nl .
Van Vliet warns that the ecological consequences of the extreme temperatures and the longer growing season remain largely unknown .
Next year will be an important year for ecologists to identify the impacts on plants and animals .
The high temperatures in 2006 are likely to increase the numbers of warmth - loving species even further , a trend which has been observed for some time .

More timewasting garbage , another copy - editing moron
Mark Pilgrim is nearly done with his ( online ) python programming book Dive Into Python , but is currently being subjected to that bane of the author 's life , the copy editing phase .
He says :
Dive into Python is almost finished .
...
Now the copy editor is wielding her virtual pen and striking through every word I ’ve ever written .
Incorporating her revisions is simultaneously humbling , enlightening , and mind - numbingly tedious .
Here are the main things I ’ve learned so far : I use have to when I mean need to .
when I mean .
I misplace the word only .
Instead of you can only walk through a stream once , the copy editor prefers you can walk through a stream only once .
.
Instead of the copy editor prefers I use lots when I mean a lot .
when I mean .
I use which when I mean that .

I overuse footnotes to be cute .
This is a bad habit I picked up from the interactive fiction version of Hitchhiker ’s Guide to the Galaxy and the infamous footnote 12 .
and the infamous footnote 12 .
I use like when I mean such as .
when I mean .
I use then immediately after a comma , when I mean and then .

I overuse semicolons for no particular reason except that I ’ve always liked them .
I use note when I mean notice , and vice - versa .
when I mean , and vice - versa .
I use we when I mean you .
As we saw in the previous chapter …
We ’ll work through this example line by line .
And so forth .
Apparently we wo n’t be working through this example .
You will be working through this example ; I will be in the Bahamas drinking my royalty check .
Well , I do n't know who is paying that copy editor , but if she were working for me she would be toast , because every single thing about English grammar here is wrong .
There are some style suggestions included : do n't overuse footnotes , do n't be too liberal with the rather literary device of the semicolon .
On things like this , advice from an opinionated reader or a publisher with style guidelines can be helpful .
I wo n't say anything about them .
And the last point is also about style , though I think the style advice is dead wrong : inviting the reader into your deliberations and saying as we saw in the previous chapters feels much warmer and more supportive than the alternatives ( as I stated in the previous chapters is all pay - attention - to - me , and as you saw in the previous chapters suggests authorial omniscience about the reader 's mental state ) .
But the rest ( familiar copy - editor changes all ) are based on nothing more or less than flatly false claims about what is grammatical in contemporary Standard English .
This copy editor should be told not just to lay off , but to go to school and take a serious grammar course .
Enough of these 19th - century snippets of grammatical nonsense that waste authors ' time all over the English - speaking world .
Let me go through the grammar points on which poor Mark is being corrected , one by one :
Have to and need to are essentially synonymous .
There is a slight tendency for the first to be used when the compulsion source is external and for the second to be used for internally driven urges , but they can easily be used the other way round , as we see from the naturalness of Excuse me , I have to go to the bathroom and You need to move your car because that side of the street is being swept today .

The word only is frequently positioned so that it attaches to the beginning of a larger constituent than its focus ( and thus comes earlier ) , and that is often not just permissible but better .
Ian Fleming 's title You Only Live Twice was not copy -edited to You Live Only Twice .
Why not ?
Because he knows how to write , and he did n't let an idiot copy - editor change his writing into mush , that 's why .

Lots of garbage and a lot of garbage are both grammatical and mean basically the same thing .
Lot here is not used in any literal sense ; it 's what 's called a non-count number - transparent quantificational noun ( CGEL ch. 5 sec. 3.3 ) .
The main difference is that lots of is more informal in style ( especially with count plurals : lots of stupid quibbles is distinctly more informal than a lot of stupid quibbles .
But informal does not mean incorrect .
It is perfectly appropriate , and becoming standard , to use informal English constructions in computer programming books and lots of other kinds of academic and technical published prose .

With an IDA Processor Module

1.0 Introduction
This article is about breaking modern executable protectors .
The target , a crackme known as HyperUnpackMe2 , is modern in the sense that it does not follow the standard packer model of yesteryear wherein the contents of the executable in memory , minus the import information , are eventually restored to their original forms .
Modern protectors mutilate the original code section , use virtual machines operating upon polymorphic bytecode languages to slow reverse engineering , and take active measures to frustrate attempts to dump the process .
Meanwhile , the complexity of the import protections and the amount of anti-debugging measures has steadily increased .
This article dissects such a protector and offers a static unpacker through the use of an IDA processor module and a custom plugin .
The commented IDB files and the processor module source code are included .
In addition , an appendix covers IDA processor module construction .
In short , this article is an exercise in overkill .
NOTE : all code snippets beginning with " ROM : " come from the disassembled VM code ; all other snippets come from the protected binary .
HyperUnpackMe2.zip is provided as an ancillary to this article and includes : codeseg -- lightly -- commented.idb : IDB of Virtual Machine ( VM )
: IDB of Virtual Machine ( VM ) dumped.exe : Statically unpacked executable
: Statically unpacked executable Notepad.idb : IDB of packed executable
: IDB of packed executable processor_module_source.zip :
Source code for IDA processor module
: Source code for IDA processor module th.w32 : IDA processor module
The processor module ( th.w32 ) belongs in %IDADIR % \procs .
It requires IDA 5.0 , as do both of the IDBs .
Although I own IDA 5.0 , these IDBs are linked with the pirated 5.0 key .
This is due to the fact that IDB files contain the majority of your personal keyfile .
Hence , the IDBs will stop working under 5.1 , unless you patch out the blacklist code ( which is trivial ) .
If you are a legitimate customer of IDA and would like IDBs for a later version , contact me under the information at the bottom of the article .
1.1 Modern Protectors
Protectors of generations past mainly compress / encrypt the original contents of the executable 's sections ; redirect the entrypoint to a new section that contains the decompression / decryption stub mixed in with anti-disassembly and anti-debugging techniques ; strip the import information at protect - time and rebuild the import address tables at runtime ; and finally transfer control back to the original entrypoint .
In other words , while the sections ' contents are modified on disk , they are mostly ( with the exception of the import information ) restored to their original state before execution is transferred back to the original program .
Although there are some protectors which are exceptions , this is the basic idiom .
To unpack such protectors , execution is traced back to the original entrypoint , the process is dumped to create a new executable , and the import information is rebuilt .
ImpRec and a sufficiently patched debugger are all that is needed to unpack protectors of this variety .
Rather than having an unmolested image in memory , new protectors are applying transformations to the original code in an effort to thwart understanding it and to make dumping the executable more difficult .
Examples include converting portions of the code into proprietary byte - code formats which are executed by an embedded interpreter ( so - called virtualization , virtual machines or VMs ) and copying portions of the code elsewhere in the process ' address space ( so - called stolen bytes , stolen functions ) .
These techniques are now mainstream in all areas of software protection , from crackmes and commercial packers to industrial - grade protections .
1.2 Transformations Applied by HyperUnpackMe2 to the Original Code
HyperUnpackMe2 extensively modifies the original code , and the entirety of the packer code is executed in a virtual machine .
The anti-debugging is heavy and some of it is novel .
By quickly examining the code at the beginning of the binary , we notice the following : Direct inter-module API calls are replaced with int 3 / 5 x NOP .
It is not known a priori whether these are fixed up directly , or whether they actually require a trip through a SEH .
This could be problematic : think about Armadillo .
Thunks to APIs are similarly obfuscated .
The relevant data in the original IIDs and IATs have been zeroed .
Instructions which reference imports without calling them directly , i.e .
.text:01004462 mov esi , ds:__imp__lstrcpyW@8 ; lstrcpyW( x , x )
have been replaced with zeroes .
However , the surrounding context remains the same :
The Hyper:0103A44D push ebx The Hyper:0103A44E mov ebx , [ esp +8 ]
The Hyper:0103A452 push esi The Hyper:0103A453 db 0,0,0,0,0,0 The Hyper:0103A459 push edi The Hyper:0103A45A push _szAnsiText The Hyper:0103A460 push ebx The Hyper:0103A461 call esi
So clearly , the missing instructions must be re-inserted ( in some form ) into the code before it 'll execute properly .
Perhaps this happens via a trip through the virtualizer , perhaps they 're patched directly , perhaps a SEH - triggering event is patched in .
Without further analysis , we have no way of knowing .

Intra -module calls are replaced with call $ + 5 .
It seems likely that these references are directly fixed up prior to execution ; this turns out not to be the case ( the ' directly ' part is false ) .
Long jump instructions have had their targets replaced with a zero dword .
.text:010023CE E9 00 00 00 00 jmp $ +5
Again , it 's unknown what sort of obfuscation is being applied here .

Functions have been stolen , with zeroes left behind in place of the original code .
These functions have been deposited towards the end of the packer section .

2.0 Virtual Machines
Although VM assembly languages are often simple , VMs pose a challenge because they severely dilute the value of existing tools .
Standard dynamic analysis with a debugger is possible , but very tedious because of the low ratio of signal to noise : one traces the same VM parsing / dispatching code over and over again .
Static analysis is broken because each different VM has a different instruction encoding format ( and this can be polymorphic ) .
Patching the VM program requires a familiarity with the instruction set that must be gained through analysis of the VM parser .
Basically , reverse engineering a VM with the common tools is like reverse engineering a scripted installer without a script decompiler : it 's repetitious , and the high - level details are obscured by the flood of low - level details .
2.1 General Setup of VM Protections
The virtual machine needs an environment to execute in .
This is generally implemented as a structure , hereinafter " the VM context structure " .
Each VM is different , but of the ones I 've encountered thus far , each is based on the concept of a register architecture , and so the VM context structures typically consist of registers , flags , and various pointers ( e.g. stack , maybe a heap of some sort , or a static data section ) .
Before the first instruction is executed , the VM context structure is allocated , and the registers and pointers are initialized , which usually involves allocating memory ( perhaps on the host stack ) for the VM stack .
After initialization , the archetypal VM enters into a loop which : Decodes instructions at VM_context .EIP ,
Performs the commands specified by the instruction , and then
Calculates the next EIP .
The process of execution usually involves examining the first byte of the instruction and determining which function / switch statement case to execute .
Eventually , the VM reaches some stop condition , and either exits or transfers control back to the native processor .
3.0 Description of HyperUnpackMe2's VM
Harness
The HyperUnpackMe2 VM context structure contains sixteen dword registers , including ESP , which can each be accessed as a little - endian byte , word , or dword .
There is an EIP register and an EFLAGS register as well .
There is a pointer to the VM data ( which is where EIP begins ) , and its length .
The structure is zeroed upon creation .
Its declaration follows .
See the included x86 IDB for all of the gory details .
struct TH_registers { unsigned long rESP ; unsigned long r1 ; unsigned long r2 ; unsigned long r3 ; unsigned long r4 ; unsigned long r5 ; unsigned long r6 ; unsigned long r7 ; unsigned long r8 ; unsigned long r9 ; unsigned long rA ; unsigned long rB ; unsigned long rC ; unsigned long rD ; unsigned long rE ; unsigned long rF ; } ; struct TH_context { unsigned char * vm_data ; unsigned long vm_data_len ; unsigned char * EIP ; unsigned long EFLAGS ; TH_registers registers ; TH_keyed_mem keyed_mem_array [ 502 ] ; unsigned long stack [ 0x9000/ 4 ] ; } ;
3.1 Instruction Encoding
The HyperUnpackMe2 VM consists of 36 instructions , split up into five groups .
Each group has a different instruction encoding format , with a few commonalities .
The commands understood by the VM are the following ( non-obvious ones will be explained in detail in subsequent sections ) : Group One :
Two - operand arithmetic instructions : mov , add , sub , xor , and , or , imul , idiv , imod , ror , rol , shr , shl , cmp
: Two - operand arithmetic instructions : Group Two :
One - operand arithmetic and general instructions : push , pop , inc , dec , not
: One - operand arithmetic and general instructions : Group
Three :
One - operand control flow instructions : jmp , jz , jnz , jge , jg , jle , jl , vmcall , x86call
: One - operand control flow instructions : Group Four : Memory - related instructions : valloc , vfree , halloc , hfree
: Memory - related instructions : Group Five : Miscellaneous instructions : getefl , getmem , geteip , getesp , retd , stop
: Miscellaneous instructions :
The VM itself is heavily based on the x86 architecture , as evident from the following snippets :
The Hyper:0104A159 VM_set_flags_dword : The Hyper:0104A159 cmp [ edi ] , esi The Hyper:0104A15B pushf The Hyper:0104A15C pop [ eax+VM_context_structure.EFLAGS ]
The Hyper:0104A316 VM_jz : The Hyper:0104A316 push [ eax+VM_context_structure.EFLAGS ]
The Hyper:0104A319 popf The Hyper:0104A31A jnz short loc_104A31 F The Hyper:0104A31C mov [ eax+VM_context_structure.EIP ] , edi The Hyper:0104A31 F loc_104A31 F : The Hyper:0104A31 F jmp short VM_dispatcher_13h_locret
The VM is using the host processor 's flags in a very literal fashion .
Group one and two , and to some extent group three , instructions are implemented very thinly on top of existing x86 instructions , reflecting the fundamental similarity of this virtual processor to it .
3.2 X86 <-> VM
Crossover
The x86 call instruction , depicted below , switches the host ESP with the VM ESP , and transfers control to the x86 code pointed to by EDI ( what EDI is depends on the specifics of the instruction 's encoding ) .
The result of the function call is placed in virtual register # A .
We 'll find out later that this functionality is only ever used to call small functions associated with the protector , so we do n't have to worry about alternative calling conventions and the clobbering of EDX and EBP by the function .
The switching of the host ESP with the VM ESP signifies that parameters to x86 functions are pushed onto the VM stack in the same order and manner as they would be if the calls were being made natively .
The Hyper:0104A36A mov esi , esp The Hyper:0104A36C mov edx , [ eax+VM_context_structure.VM_registers.rESP ]
The Hyper:0104A36 F mov esp , edx The Hyper:0104A371 call edi The Hyper:0104A373 mov edx , [ ebp+arg_0 ]
The Hyper:0104A376 mov [ edx+VM_context_structure.VM_registers.rA ] , eax The Hyper:0104A379 mov esp , esi
The stop instruction in group five , depicted below , is suspicious and looks like it 's used to transfer control back to OEIP .
EBP , the frame pointer , points to the saved frame pointer coming into the function , which is the first thing pushed after the return address of the caller .
Therefore , [ ebp+4 ] is the return address .
The Hyper:0104A69 F cmp cl , 0 FFh The Hyper:0104A6A2 jnz short go_on_parsing The Hyper:0104A6A4 popa The Hyper:0104A6A5 mov eax , [ ebp+var_4_VM_context_structure ]
The Hyper:0104A6A8 mov eax , [ eax+VM_context_structure.VM_registers.rA ]
The Hyper:0104A6 AB mov [ ebp+4 ] , eax ; [ ebp+4 ] = return address The Hyper:0104A6AE leave The Hyper:0104A6 AF retn 8
We thus expect that the packer will return to OEIP by using the stop instruction , with OEIP in virtual register # A .
3.3 Memory Keying
The virtual machine also maintains an associative array of memory locations .
Each block of memory that it tracks has a keying tag associated with it .
There are native functions to add memory pointers with keys , retrieve a pointer by passing in its associated key , remove a pointer given its key , and update a pointer given a key and a new block of memory to point to .
Not all of these functions are accessible through the instruction set ; they seem to be for debugging purposes .
Some of the memory blocks contain non-obfuscated x86 code , some obfuscated , some contain VM code , and some contain data .
The internal data structure for a keyed memory entry looks like the following :
struct TH_keyed_mem { unsigned char * ptr ; unsigned long key ; } ;
Analyzing the functions which manipulate this structure can be slightly confusing due to negative structure displacements :
The Hyper:0104A3DC mov [ esi ] , edx ; key The Hyper:0104A3DE mov [ esi - 4 ] , eax ; ptr The Hyper:0104A3E1 add dword ptr [ esi - 4 ] , 8 ; ptr
3.3.1 Initializing the Associative Array
During initialization , the VM calls a function which scans the VM 's data looking for all occurrences of the dword ' $ $ $$ ' .
For each instance found , it treats the next dword as the key , and takes the address of the dword following that as the pointer .
[ '$ $ $ $ ' ] [ 4 - byte key ] ^[ arbitrary data ] ^ : pointer
3.3.2 Using the Associative Array
In the instruction set , group four specifically , there are two pairs of instructions which add and remove memory blocks from the internal associative array .
The first pair allocates memory with VirtualAlloc , and the second pair uses HeapAlloc .
There is no protection in the VM against attempting to de-allocate a block which was n't allocated in the first place .
Group five contains an instruction , getmem , to fetch a memory block given a key .
Group three , the control - flow transfer instructions , can take memory keys as arguments .
In other words , jmp / jcc key will transfer control into the memory region pointed at by the key .
In fact , the first instruction executed by the VM is of the form jmp key , and this is the primary form of control - flow transfer in the VM .
4.0 Static Analysis of HyperUnpackMe2's VM
Code
Based on the analysis of the VM dispatching harness , I constructed an IDA processor module to examine the code inside of the VM -- dead and natively .
As such , the anti-debugging tricks are generally beyond the scope of this article , but a brief discussion can be found in appendix A . See appendix B for information about writing IDA processor modules .
Beyond the anti-debugging , there 's a lot of anti-dump protection in this packer .
The main " tricks " all involve the redirection of certain aspects of normal code execution .
The stolen functions are copied into VirtualAlloc'ed memory .
The API calls and API - referencing instructions point to obfuscated stubs which eventually redirect to their intended targets , which are actually in copies of the referenced DLLs , not the originals .
There are 73 kilobytes ' worth of obfuscated stubs in the packer section .
Relative jumps and calls travel through tiny stub functions in VirtualAlloc'ed memory onto their destinations .
Further , all API references are changed to relatively - addressed varieties instead of direct references , i.e. 0xE8 [ displacement to import ] ( call import_address ) instead of 0xFF 0x15 [ IAT entry ] ( call dword ptr [ IAT entry ] ) .
The point is to make dumping as hard as possible by creating a rigid reliance on the exact layout of the process ' address space as it exists during that particular invocation ( including the VirtualAlloc'ed memory regions and copied DLLs ) , and by removing any trace of the import table .
The following sections fill in the gaps ( no pun intended ) left in section 1.2 by describing precisely what happens under the covers of the VM .
In the course of examination , we find that the fixups for each type take place in clusters , with similar code being used repeatedly to perform the same type of fixup .
This turns out to be all of the information needed to break the protection , resulting in an automatic , static unpacker for any binary packed with it ( of which there are no more -- The Hyper informed me that the protector was lost due to a disk crash ) .
4.1 Stolen Functions
The first thing we 'll need to deal with are the missing functions .
As we can see in the following snippet , it turns out that the functions are copied into allocated memory , and a long jump into the relevant function in allocated memory is inserted at the site of the function in the original code section .
It should be noted that the stolen functions are still subject to the modifications described in subsequent sections .
.text:01001B9A ; __stdcall UpdateStatusBar(x ) .text :01001B9A _UpdateStatusBar@4 db 0B7h dup(0 ) ROM:0103AFAA mov r0B , 1038A82h ; location of function in the VM section ROM:0103AFB2 mov r06 , 0B7h ; notice this matches up with the ROM:0103AFBA push r06 ; size of the stolen function above ROM:0103AFBD push r0B ROM:0103AFC0 push r0 F ; points to a block of allocated mem ROM:0103AFC3 x86call x86_memcpy ROM:0103AFC9 add rESP , 0Ch ROM:0103AFD1 mov r0B , 1001B9Ah ; address of UpdateStatusBar ROM:0103AFD9 mov r0E , r0 F ROM:0103AFDD sub r0E , r0B ROM:0103AFE1 sub r0E , 5 ; r0E is the displacement of the jmp ROM:0103AFE9 add r0 F , r06 ; point after the copied function ROM:0103AFED mov [ r0 Bb ] , 0E9h ; assemble a long jmp ROM:0103AFF2 inc r0B ROM:0103AFF5 mov [ r0B ] , r0E ; write the displacement for the jmp
Locating these copies is easy enough : references to x86 _memcpy following the final memory key are the ones which copy the stolen functions into VirtualAlloc'ed memory .
We can easily extract the source of the copy and the destination of the write and copy the function back into its original real estate within the binary .
While we 're on the subject , when fixups are made to functions which have been copied into allocated memory , they are made as a displacement against the beginning of that memory .
I.e. we might see a fixup of a long jump made against address [ displacement + 100h ] .
Thus , in order to know where in the original binary this long jump is , we need to retain information about where the functions in the original binary are situated in the allocated memory .
For example :
Displacement 0h into allocated memory -> 1001B9Ah Displacement B7h into allocated memory -> 1001 EEFh Displacement 11 Dh into allocated memory -> 100696Ah
Then , when we see one of these arbitrary displacements , we can map it to a location in the original binary by looking for the greatest lower bound in the set of displacements .
I.e. for displacement C0h , this is +9h into the function with displacement B7h , and is therefore at the address 1001EEFh + 9h .
Here 's an example :
ROM:01049920 getmem r0B , 10000h ROM:01049926 mov r0B , [ r0B ] ROM:0104992A add r0B , 639h ; where does this point ?
4.2 Long Jump Obfuscation
.text:010019DF E9 00 00 00 00 jmp $ +5
Here we see , in the x86 IDB , an example of the jmp obfuscation .
What actually happens here , at runtime , is that a chunk of memory is allocated , and gets filled with what looks like API thunk functions .
The jmps in the binary are patched to jmp into the allocated memory , which subsequently jmps to the correct location in the binary .
The following VM code illustrates this :
ROM:0104840 F valloc 195h , 6 ; allocate 0x195 bytes of vmem under the ROM:01048418 getmem r0E , 6 ; tag 0x6 ROM:0104841E mov r0 F , 10019DFh ; see above : same address ROM:01048426 mov r0D , r0 F ROM:0104842A add r0D , 5 ; point after the jump ROM:01048432 mov r09 , r0E ; point at the currently - assembling stub ROM:01048436 sub r09 , r0D ; calculate the displacement for the jmp ROM:0104843A inc r0 F ; point to the 0 dword in e9 00000000 ROM:0104843D mov [ r0 F ] , r09 ; insert reference to allocated memory ROM:01048441 mov r0B , 1001AE1h ; this is the target of the jmp ROM:01048449 mov r0C , r0E ROM:0104844D add r0C , 5 ; calculate address after allocated jmp ROM:01048455 sub r0B , r0C ; calculate displacement for jmp ROM:01048459 mov [ r0 Eb ] , 0E9h ; build jmp in VirtualAlloc'ed memory ROM:0104845E inc r0E ROM:01048461 mov [ r0E ] , r0B ; insert address into jmp ROM:01048465 add r0E , 4
This is the general code sequence used to fix up the jumps when the function to be fixed up remains in the original binary 's sections .
When the function has been copied into memory , as described in the previous section , the code changes slightly : r0 F and r0B 's addresses are the displacements described previously .
For example , the code at - 41E and - 441 are replaced with these snippets , respectively :
ROM:010498F3 getmem r0 F , 10000h ROM:010498F9 mov r0 F , [ r0 F ] ROM:010498 FD add r0 F , 469h ROM:01049920 getmem r0B , 10000h ROM:01049926 mov r0B , [ r0B ] ROM:0104992A add r0B , 639h
Given the sequences above , and making use of the stolen address -> real address mapping , it 's trivial to cut out the middleman and insert the proper displacements into the correct dword locations .
In the code above , we retrieve the dword operands from - 41E and - 441 and simply fix the jumps ourselves .
4.3 Calls - To Obfuscation
These are handled in a very similar fashion as the jump obfuscation : the code to fix up the calls - to references is exactly the same as the jump obfuscation fixups .
The calls also go through stubs in allocated memory which jmp to their proper destinations .
.text:01001C51 6A 00 push 0 .text :01001C53 E8 00 00 00 00 call $ +5 .text :01001C58 C2 1C 00 retn 1Ch ROM:0104419A valloc 3F2h , 5 ; allocate 0x3f2 bytes of memory under ROM:010441A3 getmem r0E , 5 ; the tag 0x5 ROM:010441A9 mov r0 F , 1001C53 h ; address of call to be fixed up ( above ) ROM:010441B1 mov r0D , r0 F ROM:010441B5 add r0D , 5 ; point after the call ROM:010441 BD mov r09 , r0E ; r09 points to the allocated jmp stub ROM:010441C1 sub r09 , r0D ROM:010441C5 inc r0 F ROM:010441C8 mov [ r0 F ] , r09 ; insert the proper displacement ROM:010441 CC mov r0B , 1001B9Ah ; we would be calling this address ROM:010441D4 mov r0C , r0E ROM:010441D8 add r0C , 5 ROM:010441E0 sub r0B , r0C ; calculate displacement ROM:010441E4 mov [ r0 Eb ] , 0E9h ; form the long jmp in allocated memory ROM:010441E9 inc r0E ROM:010441 EC mov [ r0E ] , r0B ROM:010441F0 add r0E , 4
Notice that , in this case , a call from a non-stolen function is being fixed up to call a non-stolen function : the addresses on lines - 1A9 and - 1CC are hard - coded within the binary .
When a call in a stolen function is fixed up to call another function , the beginning of the above code sequence is different : it uses the getmem idiom , as we saw previously .
The code at - 1A9 becomes :
ROM:010441F8 getmem r0 F , 10000h ROM:010441 FE mov r0 F , [ r0 F ] ROM:01044202 add r0 F , 20Dh
However , the destination address is not loaded via getmem , because as we saw previously , calls to stolen functions are routed to their destinations via these jumps .
I.e. calls to stolen functions behave just like calls to the original functions .
Recovering the proper displacement from the caller to the callee is as simple as it was for the jumps , because the code is identical , so see the closing remarks for the last section on how to fix up these calls .
4.4 Import Obfuscation
Here 's a sample of the import redirection .
Instead of referencing the imports directly , the jmp / call - to - import instructions are patched to reference locations such as these :
The Hyper:01021524 pushf The Hyper:01021525 pusha The Hyper:01021526 call sub_1021548
The Hyper:01021548 pop eax
The Hyper:01021549 add eax , 16 h The Hyper:0102154C jmp eax
This sort of thing goes on for a while ( six layers for this one ) with some random junked garbage interspersed before eventually redirecting control to the original import :
The Hyper:010215DE 61 popa The Hyper:010215DF 9D popf The Hyper:010215E0 E9 00 00 00 00 jmp $ +5
4.4.1 IAT Reconstruction
Believe it or not , the first thing that HyperUnpack Me2 does when it really gets down to business is to correctly rebuild the original IAT .
First , the DLL names are retrieved from memory byte - by - byte .
The names are not stored contiguously , but rather , the bytes corresponding to the DLL names are randomly mixed together .
The DLL is then LoadLibraryA'd .
ROM:01026058 mov r04 , 1013000h ; point to beginning of packer section ROM:0102607B getmem r05 , dword_101382D ROM:01026081 mov r0B , r09 ROM:01026085 mov r06 , r04 ROM:01026089 add r06 , 41Ch ROM:01026091 mov [ r0 Bb ] , [ r06 b ] ; copy byte of DLL name from 0x101341c ROM:01026095 inc r0B ROM:01026098 mov r06 , r04 ROM:0102609C add r06 , 93h ROM:010260A4 mov [ r0 Bb ] , [ r06 b ] ; copy byte of DLL name from 0x1013093 ; idiom repeats a variable number of times ROM:010260A8 inc r0B ROM:0102617C mov [ r0 Bb ] , 0 ROM:01026181 push r09 ROM:01026184 x86call r0C ; LoadLibraryA ROM:01026186 add rESP , 4
Next , the entire DLL 's address space is copied into a freshly - allocated chunk of memory .
Yes , you read that right .
The DLL's SizeOfImage is used as the size parameter to VirtualAlloc , and then the entire DLL is memcpy'd into it the result .
This is responsible for a huge bloat in the memory footprint .
I did n't think that this trick would work , but the crackme does run , after all .
Personal correspondence with The Hyper reveals that this is why the crackme only runs on XP SP2 ( although I have n't investigated why -- help me out here , Alex ? ) .
The following code illustrates the process :
ROM:0102618E push r09 ROM:01026191 push r0B ROM:01026194 push r0D ROM:01026197 mov r09 , r0A ROM:0102619B getmem r0A , g_Copy_Of_Kernel32_Address_Space ROM:010261A1 mov r0A , [ r0A ] ROM:010261A5 push kernel32_hashes_VirtualAlloc ROM:010261 AB push r0A ROM:010261 AE vmcall API__GetProcAddress ROM:010261B4 mov r0D , r0A ROM:010261B8 mov r0B , r09 ROM:010261BC add r0B , 3Ch ROM:010261C4 mov r0B , [ r0B ] ROM:010261C8 add r0B , r09 ROM:010261CC add r0B , 50h ROM:010261D4 mov r0B , [ r0B ] ; retrieve this DLL's SizeOfImage ROM:010261D8 push 40h ROM:010261DE push 1000h ROM:010261E4 push r0B ROM:010261E7 push 0 ROM:010261ED x86 call r0D ; allocate that much memory ROM:010261EF add rESP , 10h ROM:010261F7 mov r03 , r0A ROM:010261 FB mov [ r05 ] , r0A ROM:010261 FF push r0B ROM:01026202 push r09 ROM:01026205 push r0A ROM:01026208 x86call x86_memcpy ; copy DLL 's address space ROM:0102620E add rESP , 0Ch ROM:01026216 pop r0D ROM:01026219 pop r0B ROM:0102621C pop r09
Next , the imported APIs are loaded , but not in the normal way .
The protector includes a VM - function that I 've called API__GetProcAddress , which takes a pseudo - HMODULE and a shellcode - like API hash as arguments .
The pseudo - HMODULE is the address of the memory that the DLL was copied into above .
Thus , the addresses returned by this function reside in the copied DLL bodies , and not the originals .
API__GetProcAddress works by iterating through the DLL 's exports and hashing each function 's name , stopping when it finds the corresponding hash that was passed in as an argument .
It then returns the address of that function .
This makes it harder for dynamic tools to identify which APIs are actually being used : after all , the API addresses are not contained within a loaded module .
The hashes and their locations in the original IAT are retrieved from the jumble of data at the beginning of the packer section in a similar fashion as the assembling of the DLL names .
Additionally , the address at which the resolved import belongs in the original IAT entries is also assembled from scattered data .
ROM:0102621 F xor r07 , r07 ; r07 = hash ROM:01026223 mov r06 , r04 ROM:01026227 add r06 , 12h ROM:0102622 F mov r05 , [ r06 ]
ROM:01026233 and r05 , 0 FFh ROM:0102623B or r07 , r05 ; get a single byte of the hash ROM:0102623 F ror r07 , 8 ; idiom repeats three times ROM:010262B3 xor r08 , r08 ; r08 = where to put the resolved import ROM:010262B7 mov r06 , r04 ROM:010262 BB add r06 , 5C7h ROM:010262C3 mov r05 , [ r06 ] ROM:010262C7 and r05 , 0 FFh ROM:010262CF or r08 , r05 ROM:010262D3 ror r08 , 8 ; idiom repeats three times ROM:01026347 push r07 ROM:0102634A push r03 ; point at copied DLL ROM:0102634D vmcall API__GetProcAddress ROM:01026353 add r08 , 1000000h ROM:0102635B mov [ r08 ] , r0A ; store resolved address back into IAT
The DLL names , hashes , and IAT addresses can all be recovered with no difficulties , and we can ignore the DLLs being copied into dynamically allocated memory .
It 's a simple matter to reverse the hashes into API names .
Therefore , the entirety of the import information can be reconstructed statically : we can simply mimic what the packer itself does , rebuild the IDTs / IATs with no difficulties , and then point the imports directory pointer in the PE header to our rebuilt structures .
I was anticipating things would be harder than they turned out to be , so I decided to move the FirstThunk lists ( into which the original import references were made ) instead of keeping them at their original addresses .
This turned out to be an unnecessary mistake that complicates some of what follows .
I apologize .
In order to rectify this situation , I kept a map from the old IAT addresses into the new IATs that I created .
For example :
.text:010012A0 __imp__PageSetupDlgW@4 dd 0 010012A0 -> [ Address of new FirstThunk entry for PageSetupDlgW import ]
4.4.2 IAT Redirection
The next thing that happens is that the addresses which were resolved in the previous section are inserted into API - obfuscating stubs described in 4.4 , and the addresses of these API - obfuscating stub functions are inserted into the IAT atop the import addresses .
.text:010012A0 ; BOOL __stdcall PageSetupDlgW( LPPAGESETUPDLGW ) .text :010012A0 __imp__PageSetupDlgW@4 dd 0 The Hyper:01014126 pushf The Hyper:01014127 pusha The Hyper:01014128 call sub_1014150 ; eventually ends up at next snippet The Hyper:0101423A popa The Hyper:0101423B popf The Hyper:0101423C jmp near ptr 0B97002DDh ; patch here + 1 byte ROM:0103659A mov r0B , 10012A0h ; see above : IAT addr ROM:010365A2 mov r0E , 1014126 h ; see above : beginning of import obfs ROM:010365 AA mov r08 , 101423 Dh ; see above : end of import obfs ROM:010365B2 mov r06 , [ r0B ] ROM:010365B6 mov [ r0B ] , r0E ; replace IAT addr with obfuscated addr ROM:010365 BA mov r03 , r08 ROM:010365 BE dec r03 ROM:010365C1 add r03 , 5 ROM:010365C9 sub r06 , r03 ROM:010365 CD mov [ r08 ] , r06 ; form relative jump to real import
This makes no difference to the static examiner , and does not require fixups .
4.4.3 Call Instruction Fixup
Next , the CALL instructions which reference the IAT are re-created as relatively - addressed instructions which reference the API - obfuscating stub functions .
The instructions in the original binary were 0xFF 0x15 [ direct address ] , the pre-fixup instructions are 0xCC 0x90 0x90 0x90 0x90 0x90 , and the new instructions are 0xE8 [ relative address ] 0x90 .
As this operation requires one less byte than the original directly - addressed references , a NOP is needed for the remaining byte cavity .
.text:010019D4 int 3 ; Trap to Debugger .text :010019D5 nop .text :010019D6 nop .text :010019D7 nop .text :010019D8 nop .text :010019D9 nop ROM:0103C747 mov r03 , 10019D4h ; address of the snippet above ROM:0103C74 F mov r06 , r03 ROM:0103C753 add r06 , 5 ; point after call ROM:0103C75B mov [ r03b ] , 0E8h ; insert relative call ROM:0103C760 inc r03 ROM:0103C763 mov r04 , 100121Ch ; where we call to ROM:0103C76B sub r04 , r06 ; create relative displacement ROM:0103C76 F mov [ r03 ] , r04 ; insert relative address ROM:0103C773 add r03 , 4 ROM:0103C77B mov [ r03b ] , 90h ; insert NOP in empty byte spot
As before , the idiom is slightly different for fixing the calls in stolen functions , in that r03 is fetched from memory instead of referenced directly .
The code at - 747 would become , for instance :
ROM:0103C67E getmem r03 , 10000h ROM:0103C684 mov r03 , [ r03 ] ROM:0103C688 add r03 , 1318h
In order to fix these up , we retrieve the address of the call from - 747 , and the import destination from - 763 .
We then manually insert the correct instruction which calls into this IAT slot .
Actually , due to my previously - described mistake , we first run the IAT address through the old IAT slot -> new IAT slot map before fixing the instruction .
4.4.4 Mov Instruction Fixup
Next , instructions of the form mov reg32 , [ dword from IAT ] are fixed up by the protector in the same fashion as in the previous section .
They are relatively addressed to point directly to the obfuscated stubs ( whose addresses are fetched out of the IAT ) , instead of the direct addressing that was present in the original binary .
The registers involved in this process are ESI , EDI , EBP , EBX , and EAX .
Stop and think for a second .
So far , we 've made the assumption that all imports are functions , but this is not always true .
The MSVC CRT contains references to two imported data items .
Trying to run a data import through the import - obfuscating procedure is an incorrect transformation and will always result in a crash .
This is an Achilles ' heel of this protection .
The mov-instruction fixup is accomplished in much the same way as the call - instruction fixups .
There are several idioms : for stolen functions , for regular functions , for EAX versus the other registers ( as the instruction for EAX is five bytes , while the others are six bytes ) .
The EAX - references are assumed to point to data and are fixed up directly instead of relatively .
Once again , extracting this information from the code sequences is not difficult to do statically , and I think I 'm starting to develop RSI so I 'll skip the details here .
4.4.5 IAT Zeroing
After all of the references are correctly fixed up , the import addresses in the IAT are no longer needed , and are zeroed .
We can ignore this step .
4.5 The Rest of the Protection
As is usual in unpacking tasks , we must set the original entrypoint field of the PE header to the real entrypoint .
We scan the disassembly listing for the instruction ' stop ' and then statically backtrace to find the value of r0A .
ROM:01049F05 mov r0A , 1006AE0h ROM:01049F0D stop
Finally , the NumberOfRVAsAndSizes field of the PE header has been set to - 1 in order to confuse OllyDbg , so we should set that back to 0x10 , the default .
And while we 're at it , reduce the raw and virtual sizes of the last section , reduce the SizeOfImage , and truncate the last section in the executable .
The final executable is exactly 1 kb larger than the copy of notepad.exe which ships with Windows XP SP2 .
After making all of the above modifications , the binary runs properly .
Success !
5.0 Comments On The Protection
It took a lot of work to unpack this protector , but ultimately , the static solution was both obvious and straightforward .
On the other hand , dynamic dumping of this protector would be difficult , although still feasible .
5.1 Problems With The Protection
This protection has a few problems in the theoretical sense .
For one , it requires disassembling the binary : considering that the IAT is zeroed , _every_ reference to the IAT must be accounted for ; if not , the program will simply crash .
For example , if a trivial packer which XORed the code section , but left the imports alone , was applied first , all references would be missed and the binary would have no hope of running .
This could be assuaged by not zeroing the original IAT ( but still applying fixups on those which can be found ) so that any non-found references continue to work properly .
Another problem is , of course , that disassembly is n't perfect , and you could end up with all sorts of bugs if you just blindly replace what you think is a reference to the IAT if it is instead just plain old data , for instance .
Another problem is functions which have merged tails .
If a function with a shared exit path is stolen , there are going to be problems .
Another problem , discussed in a previous section , is the assumption that imports will always point to functions and not data .
This a faulty assumption , and will cause many failures .
All of that being said , if one assumes perfect disassembly ( which is possible manually via IDA and / or full debugging information ) and allows a blacklist of imports which are data , then this is a working protection , one which I expect will be quite potent after a few generations .
By no means is this a " fire and forget " packer like UPX , but it can be made to work on a case - by - case basis .
Appendix A : Anti-Debugging Tricks
There are 53 anti-debug mechanisms and checks in the VM , 49 of which can be broken automatically with either a tiny IDC script patching the bytecode directly , or a small patch to the VM harness .
Of the remaining four , there are two which I 've never heard of before ( although I do n't do this type of work often ) , so it 's worth checking it out in the IDB , but I wo n't ruin the surprises here .
I did n't look too heavily into those which could be broken automatically , so some of those descriptions in the IDB may be incorrect .
You may notice conditional jump instructions in the IDB which do n't have their jump targets resolved , such as the following :
ROM:01035E90 cmp r07 , 1 ROM:01035E98 jz 77026DDFh
At first I figured my processor module was buggy , and that this instruction was supposed to transfer control to a keyed memory region which the processor module had failed to locate .
After inspection of the raw bytecode and a close look at the relevant VM harness code , in fact , this instruction will move the VM EIP to the immediate value 0x77026DDF , which will cause a reading access violation or undefined behavior during the next VM cycle , depending upon whether that 's a valid address .
Hence , jumps with unresolved targets are anti-debugging tricks .
The Hyper confirmed this afterwards in private correspondence .
Appendix B : IDA Processor Module Construction
The main difference between writing a simple disassembler and writing an IDA processor module is that , instead of printing the disassembly immediately and moving on to the next instruction , information about each individual instruction and operand must be retained for later analysis and display .
For example , according to this VM 's instruction encoding , 0x20 0 x ? [ 0 - 0 xf ] means " get flags into specified register " .
Whereas in a trivial disassembler one might write this :
case 0x20 : printf ( " %lx : getefl %s
" , address , decode_register ( next_byte & 0xf ) ) ; return 2 ; // size of instruction
In an IDA processor module , one must write something like this ( in ana.cpp ) :
case 0x20 : cmd.itype = TH_getefl ; // instruction code is TH_getefl ; this comes // from an enumeration cmd.Op1.type = o_reg ; // operand 1 is register cmd.Op1.reg = TH_Regnum ( 4 , ua_next_byte ( ) & 0xf ) ; // get register num cmd.Op1.dtyp = dt_dword ; // register is dword size cmd.Op2.type = o_void ; // operands 2 + do not exist length = 2 ; // instruction size is 2 break ;
TH_getefl is an element of an enum ( ins.hpp ) , which in turn has a text representation and flags ( ins.cpp ) .
The operand information is eventually retrieved and printed ( out.cpp ) :
case o_reg : OutReg ( x.reg ) ; break ;
Clearly , writing an IDA processor module is a significant amount of work compared to writing a simple disassembler , and in the case of small portions of straight - line VM code , the latter approach ( via IDC ) is preferable .
However , in the case of large amounts of VM code with non-trivial control flow structure , the traditional advantages of IDA ( cross - reference tracking , comment - ability , ability to name locations , creation and application of structures , and the ability to run scripts and existing plugins ) really begin to shine .
B.1 Logical and Physical Divisions of an IDA Processor Module
It should be noted that , as with all C++ source code , physical divisions are irrelevant as long as all references can be resolved at link - time ; however , the layout presented herein is consistent with the processor modules released in the IDA SDK , and also with the included processor module .
Coincidentally , this information is laid out in the same order as specified by Ilfak in %idasdk%\readme.txt :
" Usually I write a new processor module in the following way : - copy the sample module files to a new directory - first I edit INS .
CPP and INS .HPP files - write the analyser ana.cpp - then outputter - and emulator ( you can start with an almost empty emulator ) - and describe the processor & assembler , write the notify ( ) function "
It should also be noted that I have written only one processor module and am not an expert on the subject .
This information presented is correct as far as I am aware , but should not be considered authoritative .
When in doubt , consult the processor module sources in the IDA SDK , inquire on the DataRescue forums , ask Ilfak , and buy the SDK support plan as a last resort .
B.2 Assigning Each Mnemonic a Numeric Code and Textual Representation
The files herein are solely responsible for defining the opcodes used by the processor , their mnemonics specifically , in both numeric and textual forms .
B.2.1 Ins.hpp
This file contains an enum , called " nameNum " by Ilfak , which assigns each opcode to a number .
This enum contains a special , unused leading entry ( [ processor ] _null , set to zero ) , and a trailing entry ( [ processor ] _last ) denoting the beginning and the end of the enum .
enum nameNum { TH_null = 0 , // Unknown Operation TH_mov , // Move [... , ] // [ more instructions here ]
TH_stop , // Stop execution , return to x86 TH_end //
No more instructions } ;
B.2.2 Ins.cpp
This file is the counterpart to the corresponding header file , which contains an array of instruc_t structures , which consist of a const char * ( the mnemonic 's textual description ) and a flags dword .
The entries in this array correspond numerically to the values given in the enum .
The flags specify the number of operands the instruction uses / changes , whether the instruction is a call / switch jump , and whether to continue disassembling after this instruction is encountered ( e.g. return instructions and unconditional jumps do not generally transmit control flow to the following instruction ) .
instruc_t Instructions [ ] = { { " " , 0 } , // Unknown Operation // GROUP 1 : Two - Operand Arithmetic Instructions { " mov " , CF_USE2 | CF_USE1 | CF_CHG1 } , // Move [ {...,...} , ] // [ more instructions ] { " stop " , CF_STOP } //
Stop execution , return to x86 } ;
B.3 Assigning Each Register a Numeric Code and Textual Representation
B.3.1 Reg.hpp
This file contains an enum , whose real entries begin at 0 ( unlike previously - described enums with a bogus leading entry ) , consisting of the legal registers supported by the processor .
As IDA takes into account the concept of segmentation , you will need to define fake code and data segment registers if your processor does not use them .
enum TH_regs { rESPb = 0 , rESPw , rESP , [... , ] r0 F , rVcs , // fake registers for segmentation rVds , // fake rEND } ;
B.3.2 [ Processor ].hpp
This file contains an array of const char *s which map the elements of the enum described in the previous subsection to a textual representation thereof .
static char * TH_regnames [ ] = { " rESPb " , " rESPw " , " rESP " , [... , ] " r0 F " } ;
B.4 Analyzing an Instruction And Filling IDA's " cmd " Structure
The main disassembler function in an IDA processor module is called int ana ( ) and lives in ana.cpp .
This function takes no parameters , and instead retrieves the relevant bytes to decode via the functions ua_next_byte ( ) , _word ( ) , and _long ( ) .
This function , or collection of functions as the case may be , is responsible for : Setting cmd.itype to the correct value from the nameNum enum described in section B.2.1 .
Setting the fields of cmd .
Op [ 1 - 6 ] to describe the types of operands ( registers , immediates , addresses , etc. ) used by this instruction .
Returning the length of the instruction .
An example from the included processor module :
case 0x1d : cmd.itype = TH_vfree ; // virtualalloc'ed memory free cmd.Op1.type = o_imm ; // type of operand 1 is immediate cmd.Op1.value = ua_next_long ( ) ; // value = memory key to free cmd.Op1.dtyp = dt_dword ; // 4 - byte memory key length = 5 ; // 5 bytes , 1 for opcode , 4 for operand break ;
The cmd structure ties together the functions described in the next two sections : these functions do not take arguments , and instead retrieve information from the cmd structure in order to perform their duties .
B.5 Displaying Operands
Out.cpp is responsible for providing two functions , bool outop ( op_t & ) and void out ( ) . out ( ) is responsible for outputting the mnemonic and deciding whether to output the operands .
There 's a bit of subtlety here : processors which use conditional execution , for example ARM and the instruction MOVEH , may have a single nameNum / Instructions entry for an opcode ( " MOV " ) , and the logic for prepending " - EH " to the mnemonic exists in out ( ) .
I have not encountered this while coding a processor module and cannot speak about it .
One thing to notice about the code below is how gl_comm is set to 1 every time out ( ) is called .
If you do not do this , you will not see comments in the disassembly .
Figuring this required an email to Ilfak .
Frankly , it 's puzzling why displaying comments is not the default behavior , but this is the reality , so be sure to set this variable .
void out ( void ) { char buf [ MAXSTR ] ; init_output_buffer ( buf , sizeof ( buf ) ) ; OutMnem ( ) ; if ( cmd.Op1.type != o_void ) out_one_operand ( 0 ) ; // output first operand if ( cmd.Op2.type != o_void ) // do we have a second operand ?
{ out_symbol ( ' , ' ) ; // put a " , " in the output OutChar ( ' ' ) ; out_one_operand ( 1 ) ; // output second operand } term_output_buffer ( ) ; // attach a possible user - defined comment to this instruction gl_comm = 1 ; MakeLine ( buf ) ; }
The other function , bool outop ( op_t & ) , is responsible for translating the contents of the op_t structure it is given into a textual description of that operand .
The structure of this function is a simple switch statement on the op_t. type field .
This function should be written concurrently with ana ( ) .
The output takes place through a number of functions exported from ua.hpp in the SDK : these functions tend to begin with " Out " or " out_ " ( out_register , OutValue , out_keyword , out_symbol , etc ) .
All in all , coding this function is mainly trivial .
Here 's one of the more complicated operand types from the included processor module :
case o_displ : out_symbol ( '[ ' ) ; OutReg ( x.phrase ) ; out_symbol ('+' ) ; OutValue(x , OOF_ADDR ) ; out_symbol ( ' ] ' ) ; break ;
B.6 Creating Cross - References
Most , but not all , instructions implicitly transfer control flow to the next instruction , and create no other cross-references .
Some instructions like " ret " and " jmp " do not reference the next instruction .
Other instructions , like " call " and conditional jumps , create additional references to the address ( es ) targeted .
Still other instructions create references to data variables specified by immediate values .
This knowledge is not inherent in the depiction of the instruction set which has been developed thus far , and must be specified programatically .
This is the responsibility of the int emu( ) function , which resides in emu.cpp , the smallest .cpp file in the supplied processor module .
int emu ( void ) { ulong Feature = cmd.get_canon_feature ( ) ; if (( Feature & CF_STOP ) == 0 ) // does this instruction pass flow on ?
ua_add_cref ( 0 , cmd.ea+cmd.size , fl_F ) ; // yes -- add a regular flow if ( Feature & CF_USE1 ) // does this instruction have a first operand ?
TouchArg( cmd.Op1 , 0 ) ; // process it if ( Feature & CF_USE2 ) TouchArg( cmd.Op2 , 1 ) ; return 1 ; // return value seems to be unimportant } // " emulation " performed on a given op_t , see emu( ) static void TouchArg ( op_t &x , bool bRead ) { switch ( x.type ) { case o_vmmem : ua_add_cref ( 0 , get_keyed_address ( x.addr ) , InstrIsSet( cmd.itype , CF_CALL ) ?
fl_CN : fl_JN ) ; // add a code reference to the targeted address , either a call or a // jump depending on whether that instruc_t 's flags has CF_CALL set .
break ; } }
B.7 Declaring IDA 's Relevant Processor Module Structures
The bulk of what remains is the creation of structures which are directly or indirectly exported by the processor module .
B.7.1 asm_t Structure
This structure defines an " assembler " which determines what the disassembly listing should look like .
Specifically , what the syntax is for declaring data , origins , section boundaries , comments , strings , etc .
Since we do n't need to re-assemble virtual machine code ( in the case of VMs found in protectors ) , the choices made here are immaterial , and this structure can be created once and re-used for all VM processor modules .
B.7.2 Function Begin and End Sequences
Both of these are optional .
IDA employs both a linear - sweep and a flow - following method of disassembly : on the first pass , it marks all entrypoints as code , and then scans the raw bytes looking for the function begin sequences ( such as push ebp / mov ebp , esp ) .
These sequences can be specified in the processor module ; however , when dealing with a throwaway VM , they are n't so important , because you 're unlikely to know a priori what a function prologue looks like .
B.7.3 Processor Notification Event Handler
This is where my ignorance of processor module construction is most transparent .
This function is called by the kernel upon certain events being triggered ; such events include closing the database , opening an existing IDB , creating a new IDB , changing the processor module type , creating a new segment , and so on .
A complete list of events can be found in idp.hpp .
For the creation of this processor module , I did not need to utilize many processor events , so I did not explore this further .
B.7.4 processor_t Structure
This is the " main " structure employed by the processor module , as plugin_t is the main structure employed by a plugin .
In this structure , the pieces gathered in the previous sections are stitched together .
The processor module must know :
The numeric ID of the processor module ( custom - defined ) .
The long and short name of the processor module .
I.e. metapc and pc respectively .
There 's an important point here which is n't documented : the makefile has a line called " DESCRIPTION " which MUST be in the format " [ long name ] : [ short name ] " .
Failure to ensure this means that the processor module will not be shown in the list of valid processor modules .
Without knowing this , you 'll be mailing Ilfak for advice , like I did .
The assembler (s ) available .
We 'll only need the one we defined in B.7.1 .
A function pointer to int ana ( ) ( see B.4 ) .
A function pointer to int emu( ) ( see B.6 ) .
A function pointer to void out ( ) and bool outop ( op_t & ) ( see B.5 ) .
A function pointer to int notify ( processor_t : : idp_notify , ... ) ( see B.7.3 ) .
The number of registers , and a pointer to the const char * array of register names ( both laid out in B.3 ) .
The function begin and end sequences described in B.7.2 .
We can set these to NULL .
The number of mnemonics , and a pointer to the instruc_t array of mnemonic names ( both laid out in B.2 ) .

What we learned from Libby trial about the secretive operation of Vice President Dick Cheney RAW STORY
Published : Sunday February 18 , 2007 Print This Email
This ( Editor 's note :
At bottom , Times puts ' hold ' on Cheney story slated for Monday 's edition until Tuesday , excerpts from article below ) Monday 's New York Times contains an article which will tie together some of the revelations that resulted from testimony at the trial for former White House aide I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby .
Libby was charged with obstruction of justice and lying to investigators probing the alleged leaking of a CIA operative 's name to journalists , and his defense rested its case last week , without calling his former boss , Cheney , to the stand , as had been widely speculated .
Libby did n't testify in his own behalf , either .
" What we learned from the Libby trial about the inner workings of the White House , especially the secretive operation of Vice President Dick Cheney , " Jim Rutenberg and Scott Shane 's article will detail , according to an early summary of the story released to member newspapers of the New York Times News Service received by RAW STORY .
" The story will focus mostly on one crucial week in early July 2003 , " the budget continues .
On Sunday , the LA Times noted that Cheney was leaving for Asia on Monday for a week long trip , " and many people in Washington are wondering if he might be grateful for an excuse to high - tail it out of town . "
" The past few weeks have not been kind to the vice president -- or at least to his public image , " Maura Reynolds and James Gerstenzang wrote on Sunday .
The article continued , " This month , a close ally was dressed down by the Pentagon inspector general for skewing intelligence before the Iraq war .
The trial of his former chief of staff has depicted the vice president 's office as a center of underhanded intrigue .
And last week 's announcement of a nuclear agreement with North Korea appears to be a repudiation of Cheney 's long - term opposition to a deal . "
" Those events , culminating months of bad news for the conservative wing of the Republican Party , have prompted speculation that the once - formidable vice president -- the most powerful in American history -- has become a spent force , " Reynolds and Gerstenzang wrote .
Also on Sunday , Newsweek 's Michael Isikoff took a look at the CIA leaker " you 've never heard of . "
Testifying on the stand as a defense witness at former White House aide I. Lewis Libby 's hearing , columnist Robert Novak said that he was not only told by his friend , conservative lobbyist Richard F. Hohlt , that Valerie Plame worked for the CIA , but that he also allowed him to " vet " his notorious July of 2003 column .
Newsweek reports that Hohlt even ' leaked ' Novak's " outing " column directly to President Bush 's Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove , before it had been published .
When asked by Libby 's attorney who Hohlt was , Novak replied on the stand that Hohlt was " a very good source " of his that he speaks to " every day . "
" Indeed , Hohlt is such a good source that after Novak finished his column naming Plame , he testified , he did something most journalists rarely do : he gave the lobbyist an advance copy of his column , " Michael Isikoff reports for Newsweek .
" What Novak did n't tell the jury is what the lobbyist then did with it : Hohlt confirmed to NEWSWEEK that he faxed the forthcoming column to their mutual friend Karl Rove ( one of Novak 's sources for the Plame leak ) , thereby giving the White House a heads up on the bombshell to come . "
Cheney story ' held ' by Times Although multiple budgets indicated that the Cheney story would run in Monday 's edition , an additional budget was released after the final one which indicated that the story was being " held , " although for unexplained reasons .
A note from the Times editors said that another article about Sunni lands in Iraq showing oil and gas promise was moved to the front page instead .
While it 's still possible that the Cheney story will be published online late Sunday night along with Monday 's paper , it may be " held " until Tuesday 's edition or later , assuming it will still run .
Excerpts from Times article " A picture that has emerged from hours of testimony and reams of documents in the trial of I .
Lewis Libby Jr. has shattered any notion that the White House was operating as a model of cohesion in President Bush 's first term , " Jim Rutenberg writes in an article now slated for the front page of Tuesday 's New York Times .
" For example , witnesses from the highest levels of the administration have painted a portrait of a vice president with free rein to operate inside the White House as he saw fit to rebut a war critic shortly after the fall of Saddam Hussein , " the article continues .
" The trial testimony has also called into question whether Cheney , known as a consummate inside player , operated as effectively as his reputation would warrant . "
Further excerpts :
The evidence in the trial shows that Vice President Dick Cheney and Mr. Libby , his former chief of staff , countermanded and even occasionally misled colleagues at the highest levels of Mr. Bushs inner circle as the two pursued their own goal of clearing the vice presidents name in connection with flawed intelligence used in the case for war .
The testimony in the trial , which is heading for final arguments as early as Tuesday , calls into question whether Mr. Cheney , known as a consummate inside player , operated as effectively as his reputation would hold .
For all of his machinations , Mr. Cheneys efforts sometimes faltered as he tried , with the help of Mr. Libby , to push back against critics during a crucial period in the early summer of 2003 , when Mr. Bushs initial case for war was beginning to fall apart .
In some of their efforts , Mr. Cheney and his agent , Mr. Libby , appeared even maladroit in the art of media management .
While others on the White House team were primarily concerned about Mr. Bush , the evidence has shown that Mr. Libby had a more acute concern about his own boss .
Unbeknownst to their colleagues , according to testimony , the two carried out a covert public relations campaign to defend not only the case for war but also Mr. Cheneys connection to the flawed intelligence .
In doing so , they used some of the most sensitive and classified intelligence data available , information the rest of Mr. Bushs team was not yet prepared to put to use in a public fight against a war critic .
FULL TIMES ARTICLE CAN BE READ AT THIS LINK Post : Has Cheney lost clout ?
A front page article in Tuesday 's Washington Post explores the vice president 's " shifting status in Washington " and whether or not Cheney has lost " clout . " .
" It has n't helped Cheney that his former chief of staff , I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby -- who at one time aggressively advanced the vice president 's interests through a sometimes hostile bureaucracy -- has been sidelined because of his role in the Valerie Plame case , " Michael Abramowitz writes for the Washington Post .
" The government 's perjury case against Libby will go to the jury this week after a trial that exposed the vice president 's large behind - the - scenes involvement in seeking to discredit Joseph C. Wilson IV , a former ambassador who accused Cheney and other administration officials of twisting intelligence in the run-up to the Iraq war . "
" There 's no question in the current political situation that Cheney has lost clout , " former Council on Foreign Relations president Leslie H. Gelb tells the Post .
" He 's lost clout because Bush has to prove he's not an international confrontationalist , warmonger and diplomatic bungler .
If you have such a reputation , you can't function as president . "
However , Abramowitz adds , " There is no evidence that Cheney 's close relationship with Bush has been lessened . "
Excerpts from Post article : # Some conservatives close to the administration see Libby 's resignation after his indictment in late 2005 as part of the unraveling of a Cheney network , leaving a void that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , the engineer of the North Korea deal , has exploited .
Others who have departed include Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld ; his deputy , Paul D. Wolfowitz , and lower - level aides with long - standing ties to Cheney .
One former administration official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk more candidly , said Cheney 's office has " disappeared " on foreign policy under Libby 's replacement , David Addington , and the vice president 's foreign policy adviser , John P. Hannah .
" Addington and Hannah are smart people , but they are no Scooter .
Scooter worked 25 hours a day and he had Addington and Hannah working for him , so it was a powerful combination , " this source said .
" The result is that Cheney is taking a back seat , and there is no check or balance on Condi in foreign policy .
It is what Condi decides and what the president agrees to . "
Figuring out how much influence Cheney has is a longtime Washington parlor game -- but ultimately unknowable , given that almost all of his advice is offered privately , and both the president and his No. 2 zealously guard the details .
The two meet for a private lunch once a week , share intelligence briefings and get together with staff for policy discussions .

It was warm and windy , alternating between clouds and sun , I had some time , and my camera was by my side .
The ghosts are actually closer to Rosemount .
There is the Dakota Technical College and a University of Minnesota research site in the area .
As I drove down a gravel road I stopped a man that was walking and asked him if he knew anything about them .
He said that from what he knows , they are an abandoned World War II munitions factory .
Apparently it was not completed when the war ended .

Federal judge bars escort service owner from selling company records
• " The horse is out of the barn , " lawyer for Deborah Palfrey says
• Palfrey says she needs to sell records to raise cash to pay for her defense
• She was indicted on money laundering and racketeering charges
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A federal judge ruled Friday that the alleged " Washington Madam " cannot sell phone records and other business records , but her attorney said copies of those records have already been handed over to a media outlet .
Deborah Jeane Palfrey 's civil defense attorney , Montgomery Blair Sibley , said no money changed hands and the originals are safe and sound .
" The horse is out of the barn , " he told CNN .
" It 's too late for the judge to close the door . "
Earlier , Sibley said that the deal to turn over the documents would be finalized next week and that the identity of the media outlet would become evident when it files stories on the contents of the records .
Palfrey has argued that she needed to sell the records to pay for her mounting defense bills .
Prosecutors filed a motion to stop Palfrey , 50 , from selling the records , which contain contact information from up to 15,000 former clients .
U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler granted a temporary restraining order and set a hearing on the matter for Monday .
A grand jury indicted Palfrey March 1 on money laundering and racketeering charges in connection with her former business -- Pamela Martin & Associates escort service .
She pleaded not guilty to the charges on March 2 .
The company operated from 1993 to 2006 .
Kessler released Palfrey but ordered her to be monitored with an electronic device and confiscated her passport .
A status hearing in the case is scheduled for April 12 .
Palfrey , in a statement last week , described her former business as a " legal , high - end , erotic fantasy service " and an " adult outcall service agency . "
Palfrey has also said that each of her employees signed a contract not to engage in illegal conduct , and no claims were made to clients that they would do illegal activities .

New military vehicles that are supposed to better protect troops from roadside explosions in Iraq are n't strong enough to withstand the latest type of bombs used by insurgents , according to Pentagon documents and military officials .
As a result , the vehicles need more armor added to them , according to a January Marine Corps document provided to USA TODAY .
The Pentagon faced the same problem with its Humvees at the beginning of the war .
RELATED : Army seeks $ 20B for protected vehicles
The military plans to spend as much as $ 25 billion for up to 22,000 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected ( MRAP ) vehicles by 2009 .
Last month , Defense Secretary Robert Gates declared that buying the new vehicles should be the Pentagon 's top procurement priority .
But the armor on those vehicles cannot stop the newest bomb to emerge , known as an explosively formed penetrator ( EFP ) .
The Pentagon plans to replace virtually all Humvees with MRAPs to provide better protection against roadside bombs , responsible for most casualties in Iraq .
The document , dated Jan. 13 , is called an urgent universal need statement .
The statements are written by field commanders in all services , who want commercially available solutions to battlefield problems .
Since MRAPs are so much safer against traditional roadside bombs , the document says , Iraqi insurgents ' use of EFPs " can be expected to increase significantly . "
As a result , the Marine commanders in Iraq who wrote the statement asked for more armor to be added to the new vehicles .
MORE : Corps refused 2005 plea for MRAP vehicles " Ricocheting hull fragments , equipment debris and the penetrating slugs themselves shred vulnerable vehicle occupants who are in their path , " said the document , which asks for 3,400 sets of add - on armor .
The Army has tested armor that appears to protect MRAPs from the explosives , said Brig .
Gen. Michael Brogan , who confirmed the document 's authenticity .
Brogan leads Marine Corps Systems Command , the lead agency for the MRAP program .
" How rapidly we can engineer that onto these vehicles is yet to be seen because it is significantly heavy , " he said .
EFPs are explosives capped by a metal disk .
The blast turns the disk into a high - speed slug that can penetrate armor .
The Army 's solution , Brogan said , involves armor that can fracture the slug .
Lt. Col. William Wiggins , an Army spokesman , declined to comment specifically on the armor but released a statement that said the Army is developing " effective countermeasures " against the bombs .
Sen. Joseph Biden , D - Del. , an MRAP supporter , said the Army had confirmed a successful test of new armor to protect against EFPs .
The extra armor will increase the cost of the program , he said .
It 's doubtful new armor can stop all EFPs , said John Pike , director of Globalsecurity , a Washington - based defense think tank .
" Short of victory , they 're going to continue to figure out ways to kill Americans , " Pike said of the insurgents .
" In any war , it is measure and countermeasure . "
Gates recently watched testing of the vehicles and is aware of the concerns about the armor , Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said .
The Marines have sent urgent need requests before , such as for improved first - aid kits and new rifle scopes .

The Pentagon , bearing the brunt of criticism for shortfalls in National Guard supplies after last week ’s devastating tornado in Kansas , acknowledged Wednesday that Army National Guard units had only 56 % of their required equipment .
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates told a Senate hearing that equipment levels were the lowest since the Sept. 11 attacks .
He said that the Bush administration ’s defense budget request , which asks for $ 22 billion for the Army National Guard over the next five years , would take Guard units up to 76 % of their authorized equipment levels .
“ There ’s no question that there ’s been a drawdown of equipment in the National Guard , ” Gates said , adding that even before Sept. 11 , Guard units normally were equipped at about 75 % .
“ Clearly we need to follow through with this program to rebuild the stocks of equipment that are available to the National Guard . ”
At the hearing , a bipartisan group of senators confronted Gates with pointed questions on Guard readiness .
The lawmakers argued that repeated deployments to Iraq were causing shortages in equipment needed for domestic security and national disaster response .

The issue moved back into the spotlight after Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius , a Democrat , noted the shortfalls after a tornado flattened nearly all of Greensburg , Kan .
Guard shortfalls delayed the state ’s emergency response , she said .
President Bush visited the town Wednesday as administration officials continued to insist that Sebelius had all the resources needed to respond to the crisis .
R. David Paulison , director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency , said he had been in repeated contact with the Army general in charge of Kansas ’ Guard units , who assured him the Army had what it needed .
“ He said he has plenty of equipment for this disaster , ” Paulison told reporters traveling with Bush to Kansas .
“ I ’ve asked probably at least 20 times , ‘ Is there anything that you need that you do n’t have ? ’
The answer is no .
And that ’s from the governor , the general , the mayor and the city manager . ”
Sebelius reiterated the criticisms during Bush ’s visit .
She said the state had mustered the resources to deal with the Greensburg disaster but would be hard pressed to meet any other contingencies .

“ If we have another incident ... that needs Guard support , I will be in a situation where we have to choose what we do -- and that ’s a terrible choice to make , ” she said .
“ After four years [ of war ] there ’s no question that , year after year , Guard supplies are depleted not just in Kansas but all over the country . ”
White House and Pentagon officials have insisted that sharing agreements among the states would ensure that any shortfalls faced by one state during a disaster could be filled by neighboring states .
But some experts have challenged that assertion , saying that nearly every state is running short of equipment because of overseas deployments .
“ These compacts are practically nullified now because all states have people in ” Iraq , said Melvyn Montano , former head of the New Mexico National Guard .
“ If you have four or five states around you , where are they going go get their equipment from ?
Because they all have been deployed . ”
The chorus was joined Wednesday by several senators , including Republican Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico , who told Gates that his state was facing severe shortages in the military infrastructure that supported its Guard units .

The Army National Guard has told members of Congress that it had $ 23.6 billion in unfunded requirements that it would need to get back to 100 % readiness .
Sen. Patrick J. Leahy ( D - Vt. ) said failure to fill those requirements meant that some states had only 35 % of their Guard equipment .
Army National Guard requirements not funded by Bush ’s budget include 18,600 Humvees , which would cost $ 2.4 billion over the next five years , and 30,100 trucks , which would require an additional $ 5.6 billion , according to an analysis cited by Leahy .
It indicated the Guard would need $ 6 billion for 159 Chinook helicopters , the most costly deficiency .
“ Right now , there ’s nothing in the budget to do this , there ’s no plan to resupply them , and this is creating a real concern among governors around the states , ” Leahy said .
Gates expressed a willingness to discuss the issue with Congress , saying he was open to adding funding if it filled essential needs .

“ We ’re prepared to sit down and take a look at this and look at it on a state - by - state basis and see if there ’s more we should be doing and if there is a way to make sure that the capacity of the National Guard to respond to disasters at home is what it should be , ” he said .

My life has become so centered around devices , I do n’t know what I ’d do if I lost them .
Here are my top 5 favorite devices :
Slim Storage
This 40 gig external hard drive by CompuCable is a life - saver .
It does n’t require external power , so it easily moves from computer to computer , and it ’s only about as big as an iPod .
It connects via Firewire , so the data transfer is fast , especially for those huge video files that I lug around with me .
I also use it to back up my most important files and carry it with me at all times so they are separated from the originals .
My only complaint is that the capacity is n’t bigger .
40 gig does n’t get you very far anymore .
I paid about $ 350 for this drive five years ago , so I ’m sure you can find one cheaper now .
Wacom Tablet
I started using a Wacom tablet about ten years ago in my graphic design days and now I ’ll never use a mouse again if I can avoid it .
Once you get adjusted to the feel of a tablet , the control that you gain is amazing .
Once you make mental map of the tablet in your head , you can pop to any point on the screen in an instant , instead of having to pick up and drag a mouse .
Even nicer is the fact that the surface is pressure sensitive , giving you even more control .
I do n’t use it for art very often any more , but it comes in handy for sketching graphs like those in A Roadmap from Debt to Living Your Passion .
If you are into art , you will absolutely love this tool in conjunction with a program called Painter .
Since the pad is pressure - sensitive , you can replicate natural media almost perfectly .
In fact , it ’s better than perfect , because you can undo your strokes , and use colors that would n’t be possible in real life .
I got this particular tablet last year , used on eBay for less than $ 100 .
Wireless Headphones
My girlfriend and I live in a tiny little apartment in Los Angeles and therefore we have to make multiple uses for the space we have .
Our living room is also our office and dining room .
Until we bought these RCA wireless headphones ,
It was frustrating when one of us wanted to work and the other wanted to watch TV .
Now , the person who wants to watch TV just puts on the headphones and the other can enjoy the quiet to work .
This little device saves me all kinds of stress .
I bought the RCA because it was about $ 20 cheaper than the Sony .
It works great exept for two things :
1 ) Instead of automatically charging when I put it in the holster , I have to plug it in each time , and 2 ) It cuts out from time to time if I am moving around the house .
If the Sony solved these problems , I would be willing to pay the extra money .
It ’s also great when you are washing dishes , or folding clothes in another room because you can take the TV with you and hear it over the running water .
Stacey even likes to put them on when she ’s in the bathtub !
XM Radio
My XM radio subscription is the best value of any subscription that I have .
For less than $ 20 a month , I listen to hundreds of hours of music , news , and talk radio .
I ’m an information junkie , so I love having instant access to news , sports , stocks , entertainment , and anything I want to know wherever I go .
It ’s also nice to know that I can take my channels with me no matter where I am in the world .
The only thing that would make my XM radio better is if I had an adapter for my home stereo .
Then I could actually listen to it every hour of the day .
( wow , that would be lame . )
CrackBerry
My CrackBerry is named not for it ’s highly hipnotizing and addictive qualities , but for the huge three inch crack across it ’s face .
I dropped it on it ’s head within one week of owning it .
The only thing keeping me from replacing it is the iPhone , which will finally make my life complete .
Ever since I started to use my CrackBerry , I ca n’t believe how I lived without it .
Since most of the businesses I run are somehow computer related , I can run them from just about anywhere .
It ’s concievable that I could run this blog from my CrackBerry alone .
It would wear out my knuckles , but it ’s possible !
For now , I love the fact that I can approve comments and see my blog action from anywhere .
My only problem with it is that the internet is pretty slow and incompatible with most sites .
I hope that the iPhone solves this problem !
In the mid-19th century Karl Marx claimed that European colonisers , though corrupt and violent , were the " unconscious tool of history " that would propel India and China into modernity .
He described the backward " Asiatic mode of production " , defined by the absence of private ownership and the presence of a rigid , centralised form of government that prevents change and modernisation .
Such views prompted Edward Said to denounce Marx as an orientalist who had subsumed India and China into a narrative of human progress designed by and for Europeans .
But nothing Marx said about Asia would ever be as influential or widely disseminated as the recent idea in the west that free - market capitalism has finally awakened India and China from their long Asiatic slumber .
If the rise of India and China seems dramatic , it is because not so long ago India appeared in the western imagination as a poor , backward and often violent nation .
With its needy millions and Luddite communist regime , China seemed sunk even deeper into darkness .
Now , abruptly , we are told that India and China are economic giants , driving world growth by converging on the European model of modernity .
Francis Fukuyama first outlined this post - cold - war ideology of globalisation by claiming in his 1992 book , The End of History , that western liberal democracy , based on private property , free markets and regular elections , was the terminus of historical development .
Consecrated annually in Davos , and circulated in business - class lounges around the world , this quasi- teleological view increasingly shapes the beliefs and policies of western political , business and media elites .
The attempt to explain - and change - the world by exalting the apparently unique western virtues of free - market capitalism and democracy may seem to have run into problems lately .
Failed experiments with unfettered capitalism have helped install authoritarian rightwing and populist leftwing regimes in Russia and Latin America respectively .
The recent irruptions of radical Islam , and the war in Iraq , have muddied further the image of a world rushing to embrace victorious western values .
Nevertheless , the abrupt rise of the two biggest countries of the orient reaffirms the faith expressed eloquently by the American columnist Thomas Friedman : that globalising free - market capitalism and democracy will enable much of the world 's population to reach the summit of material plenitude , political stability and social security , where western societies apparently reside .
It would be nice to imagine the spirit of altruism behind this generous desire to share the west 's good fortune .
But today China offers western corporations a tempting market of more than a billion customers and a seemingly endless source of cheap labour , as does India .
Indian and Chinese elites borrow no less eagerly than their western counterparts from the discourse of neo-orientalism as they attribute India and China 's recent economic growth to the free markets they embraced in the 80s and 90s .
But even a casual glance at their claims will reveal them to be caricatures of a complex political and economic reality .
India registered its most impressive gains from 1951 to 1980 , after emerging from more than two centuries of systematic colonial exploitation , during which it was , in effect , deindustrialised .
Until 1980 India achieved an average annual economic growth of 3.5 % - as much as most countries achieved .
In this period India 's much derided socialistic economy also helped create the country 's industrial capacity .
Much popular literature about China , such as Jung Chang 's recent biography of Mao , makes it seem as though China did little after the communist revolution in 1949 but lurch from one disaster to another .
In fact , China 's national income under a planned economy grew fivefold between 1952 and 1978 .
Though wages were low , the welfare system - the famous " iron rice bowl " - guaranteed lifetime employment , pensions , healthcare and other benefits that created a high degree of personal security .
Economic reforms in the 80s focused on boosting export - oriented industries on the coast .
They made China a huge sweatshop for the west 's cheap goods and gave it an average annual growth of 10 % .
It may be tempting to credit the invisible hand of the free market for this , but , as in the so - called " Asian tiger " economies , the Chinese state has carefully regulated domestic industry and foreign trade and investment , besides maintaining control of public services .
However , economic reforms , geared to creating wealth in urban areas , have smashed the iron rice bowl and caused severe inflation .
The devolution of power to provincial governments , as demanded by free - marketeers , has led to unchecked corruption .
The protests in Tiananmen Square , seen by many outside China as demands for western - style freedom and democracy , were fuelled by mass rage at the dismantling of the old welfare state : inflation , for instance , reached 25 % in early 1989 after remaining well below 2 % for much of the Maoist era .
China is now one of the most unequal countries in the world , even more so than the US .
In India , too , the pursuit of economic growth at all costs has created a gaudy elite but also widened already alarming social and economic disparities .
Facilities for healthcare and primary education have deteriorated .
Economic growth , confined to urban centres , is largely jobless .
Up to a third of Indians live with extreme poverty and deprivation .
And militant communist movements have erupted in the poorest , most populous states .
Still , modernising India and China have become sources of existential and ideological self - affirmation for western elites , who tend to ignore anything that challenges their articles of faith - free markets and democracy - or suggests an arduous complexity .
The neo-orientalist reconceptualising of India and China ignores or suppresses large aspects of their recent history .
It also fails to reckon fully with the tortured and often tragic experience of modern development .
The disasters occasionally seen in the western media - the violence in Kashmir that has claimed more than 80,000 lives in the last decade and a half ; the destruction of the environment and the uprooting of nearly 200 million people from their rural habitats in China - can be explained away by reference to the logic of development as manifested in Europe 's history .
But the west itself has begun to feel the pain of this transition , as China 's hunger for energy raises the price of oil ; its cheap exports undermine the once - strong economies of Italy and Germany ; and it puts white - collar workers out of jobs in America .
It is also true that Europe 's own transition to its present state of stability and affluence was more than just painful .
It involved imperial conquests , ethnic cleansing and many minor and two major wars - involving the murder and displacement of countless millions .
As India and China rise with their consumerist middle classes in a world of finite energy resources , it is easy to imagine that this century will be ravaged by the kind of economic rivalries and military conflicts that made the last century so violent .
In any case , the hope that fuels the pursuit of endless economic growth - that billions of customers in India and China will one day enjoy the lifestyles of Europeans and Americans - is an absurd and dangerous fantasy .
It condemns the global environment to early destruction , and looks set to create reservoirs of nihilistic rage and disappointment among hundreds of millions of have - nots .
Many intellectuals and activists in India and China grapple with this challenge of modernity every day , knowing well the disasters that lie in wait if they fail .
In the meantime , we in the west will do well to dismantle the illusions of neo-orientalism - the most powerful and far - reaching yet of the many accounts of the orient shaped by western self - perceptions and self - interest .
For peace in this century depends on India and China finding a less calamitous way of becoming modern .

YOU may recall that about a decade ago a company called Netscape launched the internet era with a new killer application called a web browser ; that Netscape was subsequently expunged by Microsoft , the world 's largest software company ; and that Microsoft 's copycat browser , called Internet Explorer , has held , in effect , a monopoly ever since .
Until recently , this “ history ” of the web was broadly correct .
Yet something very odd is going on that may yet require history to be rewritten .
And that has a lot to do with Mitchell Baker , formerly of Netscape but nowadays the “ chief lizard wrangler ” ( sic ) of a non-profit foundation called Mozilla , whose main product is a web browser called Firefox .
Firefox seemingly came out of nowhere in November 2004 , and has since captured a market share of 8 - 10 % worldwide — but close to 30 % in Poland , Germany and a few other countries — almost entirely through word - of - mouth marketing .
The rest of the market still belongs mostly to Microsoft .
Still , Firefox 's advances have already had their intended effect : to present web surfers with a viable alternative to the monopoly , and thus to restart much - need innovation in browser technology , even by Microsoft itself .
“ The browser matters ; it 's the piece [ of the internet ] that touches human beings , ” says Ms Baker , whose asymmetrically cut swoosh of red hair is reminiscent ( “ by coincidence ” ) of the Firefox logo .
“ This area should n't be stagnant ; it should be exciting , ” she says .
Thanks to Firefox , it now is .
Firefox 's tale is a curious one .
The closer one looks , the more it appears to be a cooler , hipper , and safer incarnation of the allegedly deceased Netscape .
As a company , the old Netscape disappeared in 1998 , when — eviscerated by Microsoft — it sold itself to AOL , where it still snoozes as an under - utilised brand .
But Netscape 's employees and the browser 's source code did not simply disappear .
Rather , the people fanned out in a diaspora to other companies in Silicon Valley , and many of them continued to fiddle with their beloved browser .
They made its code “ open source ” — code that is freely available to anybody who wants to make improvements and share these with everybody else .
Thus the browser secretly lived on within an informal volunteer “ project ” called Mozilla , and eventually got the name Firefox .
Ms Baker gradually found herself the leader of this project .
Perhaps this is because she is a somewhat unusual member of the Netscape diaspora .
For a start , she is a woman in a community populated , as one ( male ) colleague puts it , by geeky males with “ spare time and no social life ” .
Ms Baker herself has never even written code .
She studied Chinese at Berkeley , and then became a lawyer — her role at the old Netscape was in software licensing .
On all technical matters , she defers to Brendan Eich , her chief geek .
“ By personality , I do n't second - guess ” people , she says .
Indeed , she hones this skill two evenings a week when she flies trapeze for fun ( a discipline where second - guessing the catcher is not advisable ) .
And yet , she is the leader .
What , actually , does that mean in an open - source community ?
“ There 's nothing that I could stick on a résumé that people would understand , ” she says .
“ Create structures out of chaos , ” is one way to put it .
“ Translate geek - speak into English , ” is another , she says .
“ Wrangle the lizards ” is her favourite description , whence her title .
By this she means co-ordinating the 800 or so Mozilla volunteers ( or “ lizards ” , since Mozilla 's logo is a dinosaur ) , of whom many are on the payrolls of companies such as Google , Sun Microsystems and Red Hat , while many others are simply hobbyists .
The other big part of her job is to wear her tough - lawyer hat and provide the strategic and legal direction that Firefox needs to thrive alongside a company like Microsoft .
Her biggest decision of this sort was to formalise the project in 2003 , by turning Mozilla into a non-profit foundation , financed by donations and a share of search - related advertising .
To this foundation , she this year added a corporate ( but still non-profit ) subsidiary , which now employs a small permanent staff of about 40 people .
Ms Baker wants to make sure that competitors cannot use legal red herrings about trademarks , patents and the like to derail Mozilla 's mission .
Upgrading the net
That mission , she emphasises , is obviously not to make profits or even , less obviously , to beat Microsoft .
Instead , it is to make the web a better place by preventing anybody from turning it into a “ monoculture ” .
In technology , as in ecology , monocultures are unstable .
At the height of Microsoft 's monoculture , its browser stagnated and became a security disaster waiting to happen , as hackers wrote nasty software to take advantage of web surfers .
Firefox was safer from the start , and has become safer still with each new upgrade — the latest , version 1.5 , was released on November 29th .
Most users , after a few minutes of clicking around , also find Firefox more intuitive and practical — features such as tabbed browsing , where multiple web pages are stacked in the same browser window , tend to become compelling .
Ms Baker considers it a success that Firefox has already spurred Microsoft to invest again in browser innovation .
This is crucial if the internet is to evolve to its next phase , she argues .
Often dubbed “ Web 2.0 ” , this will enhance users ' experiences of the internet .
For instance , technologies such as AJAX ( short for “ asynchronous JavaScript and XML ” ) supply applications that run on the internet with the same look and feel as applications that sit on the computer .
And user - generated media such as blogs , podcasts and wikis are on the verge of mainstream adoption , promising an age of creativity .
“ Web 2.0 could have happened a lot earlier , if Microsoft had not had a monopoly for a decade , ” says Ms Baker .
Firefox , simply by existing , has done its bit to fix that .
The Times ’s Adam Nagourney looks at how California , armed with an early primary , is changing presidential politics :
Its sheer size , its concentrations of both liberals and conservatives , its status as a money tree for candidates and its role as fertile ground for policy innovation make California especially likely to wield additional clout this time around .
The result is not just a change in tactics ; it is altering the dialogue of the presidential contest in substantive ways .
It is forcing candidates to turn their attention to issues , debates and controversies that have historically drawn little attention on the early playing fields of Iowa and New Hampshire .
“ The most striking example is global warming , an issue that was rarely raised in the past two presidential campaigns , ” Mr. Nagourney adds .
Nevada , too , has gained new prominence , especially among Democrats , with its Democratic caucus set to occur just after Iowa’s .
That means Hispanic voters , sought after by both parties in the general election , are now a key constituency early in the process .
The Associated Press reports on efforts to turn them out for the Nevada caucuses , quoting Andres Ramirez , a voter outreach director :
That means networking with Hispanic clubs and churches , and courting Hispanic celebrities to make public service announcements and appear at local events , he said .
In September , “ mock caucuses ” are scheduled to walk high school students in Hispanic communities through the caucus experience , though participants will pick their pop star of preference , rather than presidential candidates .
In addition , there are plans for a Nevada Democratic Party - sponsored soccer team — Los Democratas — to play in one of Las Vegas ’ several competitive and largely Hispanic adult leagues .
Just off the sidelines , there will be a registration table with materials and banners .
John Edwards is “ sounding a clarion call of a sort not heard on the presidential campaign trail since Robert F. Kennedy ’s run in 1968 , ” writes Alec MacGillis in The Washington Post .
“ A millworker ’s son who became a multimillionaire trial lawyer , Edwards brings to the subject a hard - edged rhetoric and a host of proposals culled from the University of North Carolina ’s poverty center , which he started and ran after his losing campaign for vice president in 2004 . ”
The Post also parses a series of interviews with Tampa supporters and polls to gain insight into how Senator Barack Obama ’s race will factor into the election .
The Los Angeles Times looks at how candidates ’ family histories ’ have an impact on presidential campaigns , noting that in an earlier era , Rudolph W. Giuliani , now on wife No. 3 , would not have even had a chance at the White House .
Mr. Giuliani ’s commencement address at the Citadel on Saturday included a call for increased troop strength in the Army and new special forces trained to handle post - combat operations .
Mitt Romney also gave a commencement address on Saturday , and like Mr. Giuliani , he is struggling to appeal to the Christian right — though , in his case , his Mormon faith , not multiple marriages , is posing a hurdle .
Mr. Romney spoke at the Rev. Pat Robertson ’s Regent University , where , The Boston Globe ’s Scott Helman reports , there was some student dismay over the chosen speaker .
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said she would ultimately vote for a supplemental Iraq spending bill regardless of whether President Bush ultimately agrees to any sort of withdrawal timeline , benchmarks or other conditions .
However , she said , Democratic presidential candidates will not ultimately be held responsible for Iraq because it ’s the president ’s war .
From The A.P. ’s Mike Glover :
A large group of Freshman Democrats know that one of they keys to their election in 2006 was changing the meaning of " business - as- usual " on Capitol Hill , whether that meant ending the Bush rubberstamp on Iraq or how Congress conducts itself .
While a big chunk of the old - timers is resisting ethics reform , the Freshman are pushing a new effort :
U.S. Rep. Chris Murphy spearheaded an effort by freshman representatives Wednesday to call for an independent and bipartisan ethics panel to investigate complaints against lawmakers .
" Clearly the Ethics Committee that Congress has today does n't work , " said Murphy , D - 5th Dist .
" The process that 's in place right now requires congressional members to investigate their friends and colleagues .
" It 's time for a change .
The voters sent me here to drain down the swamp that 's become Washington , D.C.
That 's what I intend to do . "
The proposal is meeting significant resistance in the caucus .
Despite that , Murphy and his colleagues including Zack Space , Baron Hill , Paul Hodes , and Betty Sutton along with a dozen or so others , are pushing the Special Task Force on Ethics Enforcement to consider their proposal .
The task force was set up to determine how Congress could police its own more effectively after the travesty of Bob Ney , in which the existing House Ethics Committee did nothing .
The Freshman proposal would create a wholly independent , bipartisan panel comprised of members of the public .
Or , you know , consitutents .
It woud vet , initiate , and conduct investigations .
This push to have an external , independent review board should be strongly considered by the task force .
While the majority of Members of Congress are honest and ethical , their integrity is hugely sullied by a bad few .
The Ney and Foley sagas are n't the first time that a bad few , like Tom DeLay , Dennis Hastert , and Doc Hastings were in a position to scuttle investigations , and it wo n't be the last .
Last fall , we voted for real reform , for transparency , and for change .
No one understands that better than the Freshman class that swept the Congress back to a Democratic majority .
The leadership needs to recognize that and to give them a seat at the table in shaping reform .
The 17 - year - old went to a police station in the town of Aizuwakamatsu , north of Tokyo , carrying the head in a sports bag , Japanese media said .
The beheaded body of a woman was later found at the boy 's home , police said .
This is the latest in a series of grisly killings in Japan , a country renowned for its low crime rate .
On Monday a severed human leg was discovered in a small river in central Tokyo .
In January , a 32 - year - old woman was arrested after she confessed to killing her husband , dismembering him with a saw and dumping body parts around Tokyo .
' It 's horrifying '
In the latest case , the boy , said to be a local high school student , reportedly told police he killed his mother with a knife during the night as she slept , and had acted alone .
Japanese press said the boy lived with his young brother , separately from their parents .
Their mother was believed to have been visiting them on Monday .
The teenager was reported to have undergone psychiatric treatment at some point in the past .
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuhisa Shiozaki expressed his alarm at the reports .
" If it 's true , it 's horrifying , " he said .
Aizuwakamatsu is located in Fukushima prefecture , some 200 km ( 125 miles ) north of Tokyo .
His assumption was that if a therapist shared his sexual orientation or ethnic group , there would be a kind of guaranteed basis for understanding or acceptance .
I did , in fact , refer him to an excellent colleague who happens to be gay , but the brief conversation left me troubled .
All these patients who were searching for understanding had a misconception , I think , of what empathy is all about .

What is critical to understanding someone is not necessarily having had his or her experience ; it is being able to imagine what it would be like to have it .
Thus , I do not have to be black to empathize with the toxic effects of racial prejudice , or be a woman to know how I would feel about being denied promotion on the basis of sex .
Contrary to what many people believe , being empathic is not the same thing as being nice .
In fact , empathy can sometimes be put to a very dark purpose .
When the Nazis were bombing Rotterdam in World War II , for example , they put sirens on the Stuka dive - bombers knowing full well that the sound would terrify and disorganize the Dutch .
The Nazis imagined perfectly how the Dutch would feel and react .
Fiendish , but the very essence of empathy .
In the right hands , empathy has tremendous positive therapeutic force and can narrow what looks like an unbridgeable gap between patients and therapists .
In the 1980′s if you were a kid an watched Saturday morning cartoons then you might remember seeing lots of PSA ’s aimed at kids .
They often featured cartoon characters telling you about the benefits of eating cheese or planning ahead for your future .
They also usually featured funky bass lines and poor rhyming structures .
I ’m not sure that any of these actually helped me out now that I am an adult but here are some of the best ( worst ) PSA ’s from that era .
In this clip He-man and She - ra warn kids about sexual molestation .
Am I the only one who finds it creepy that a man in a loin cloth with a page boy hair cut is talking about molesting kids ?
And who decided to involve Orco ?
I mean does he even have a body to molest ?
Here ’s a really lame PSA that tells kids how to make a Saturday .
A Saturday being a lame , health version of a Sunday .
It also is quite phallic looking with that banana and whipped cream .
I bet He - Man would love to eat it .
This one features a character called “ The Chopper ” who tells you to exercise you teeth by eating hard foods .
First off how do you exercise your teeth , their freaking bones you idiot .
All your going to do is chip a tooth eating all those , nuts , carrots , gravel , etc .
And what kid eats Pumpernickel by the way ?
I ’m sure a lot of you remember O.G. Readmore a talking cat captain who tells kids about how much fun it is to read .
First of what is he a Captain in ?
The Army , Navy , Coast Guard ?
Last time I checked there were n’t any captains at the library .
And readin with your grandma is n’t fun , trust me I know …
Zack of all Trades was a magical career guidance counselor who came out of your jukebox to give bad career advice .
Yeah become a seamstress little girl leave all those doctor , lawyer and business jobs to the men .
And for someone who gives advice what ’s his job anyways ?
He apparaently has nothing but free time on his hands to annoy people all day with his lame advice .
This next one single handedly is responsible for millions of lactose intollerant children spending their formative years on the toilet .
COPS was a show were ridiculously over muscled cops fought ridiculously over muscled villians in the future with laser beams and other future crap .
Of course since it was a show about cops it had to have PSA ’s about satying out of trouble and preventing crime .
In this one a villian tries to scare kids straight , but the message is kind of lost because every episode he breaks out of jail and goes on a crime spree with no consequences .
And finally the Transformers .
Here are several of their PSA’s .
Thanks robot from another planet you really helped me to see that I need better communication skills with my parents .
Also you might notice that they stole their tagline “ … and knowing is half the battle ” from G.I. Joe .
Apparently the concept of plagairism was n’t part of their programming .
Well thats it for now I hope you learned a lot .
Im going to go eat a cheese Saturday while I read about how to become a seamstress and try and stay out of jail so I do n’t get molested .

Radley Balko has noticed a hunger for good news , and this would seem to qualify :
Eighteen - year - old Jabbor Gibson jumped aboard the bus as it sat abandoned on a street in New Orleans and took control .
“ I just took the bus and drove all the way here … seven hours straight , ’ Gibson admitted .
“ I had n’t ever drove a bus . ”

Blood Diamonds - Conflict Diamonds
What is the Kimberly Process ?
Article by : Hobart M. King , PhD , RPG
Blood diamonds What Are " Blood Diamonds " ?
The movie Blood Diamond traces the path of a large pink diamond found in Sierra Leone in the 1990s by a fisherman working as a slave in a rebel - controlled diamond mine .
That diamond changed and ended many lives , and the story of that stone carries a strong social message .
The story is interesting fiction , but it is based upon facts .
The story can help you appreciate how a mineral resource can fuel the oppression and slaughter of thousands of people .
This is not a first - time phenomenon .
It happened before in Africa with ivory and gold .

What Are " Conflict Diamonds " ?
Blood Diamonds , also known as " Conflict Diamonds , " are stones that are produced in areas controlled by rebel forces that are opposed to internationally recognized governments .
The rebels sell these diamonds , and the money is used to purchase arms or to fund their military actions .
Blood Diamonds are often produced through the forced labor of men , women and children .
They are also stolen during shipment or seized by attacking the mining operations of legitimate producers .
These attacks can be on the scale of a large military operation .
The stones are then smuggled into the international diamond trade and sold as legitimate gems .
These diamonds are often the main source of funding for the rebels ; however , arms merchants , smugglers , and dishonest diamond traders enable their actions .
Enormous amounts of money are at stake , and bribes , threats , torture , and murder are modes of operation .
This is why the term " blood diamonds " is used .
Conflict Diamond Map
What is the " Kimberly Process " ?
The flow of Conflict Diamonds has originated mainly from Sierra Leone , Angola , Democratic Republic of Congo , Liberia , and Ivory Coast .
The United Nations and other groups are working to block the entry of conflict diamonds into the worldwide diamond trade .
Their approach has been to develop a government certification procedure known as the " Kimberly Process . "
This procedure requires each nation to certify that all rough diamond exports are produced through legitimate mining and sales activity .
All rough diamonds exported from these nations are to be accompanied by certificates .
These certificates state that the diamonds were produced , sold , and exported through legitimate channels .
The certification process accounts for all rough diamonds , through every step of their movement , from mine to retail sale .
Retail customers buying a cut diamond are encouraged to insist upon a sales receipt that documents that their diamond originated from a conflict - free source .

" Conflict - Free Diamonds " Nations who agree to participate in the Kimberly process are not permitted to trade with nonmember Nations .
The Kimberly Process is believed to have significantly reduced the number of Conflict Diamonds that are reaching international gem markets .
Today 81 governments and several non-government organizations abide by the Kimberly Process .
The only two nations which remain under Kimberly Process sanctions as of December , 2006 were Liberia and Ivory Coast .
The World Diamond Council estimates that 99 % of all diamonds are now conflict - free .

Legitimate Diamond Trade
The legitimate diamond trade provides jobs for over 10 million workers and brings prosperity to areas where this activity occurs .
Support of the Kimberly Process by all nations and consumers can convert slavery into jobs and smuggling into respected commerce .
The efforts are working .
Today , almost all of the diamonds brought to retail markets come from conflict - free sources .

Rumsfeld by retired military leaders is the culmination of months of intense but largely private debate among active duty officers about how best to voice dissent over Bush administration policies , according to officers involved in the discussions .
A number of officers have been critical of Iraq policy -- mostly anonymously -- since the administration ’s early days .
But the calls for Rumsfeld ’s resignation are an unusual step for members of the military , who are acutely sensitive to the appearance of challenging civilian leadership of the armed forces .
Displays of public dissension are especially controversial while troops are at war and morale is a concern .
In recent months , however , a growing concern that the war ’s setbacks may have been predictable as well as avoidable has spilled into public view .
The officers said that challenges to civilian policy were not new -- similar opposition flared during the Clinton administration , particularly around the issue of gays in the military .
But many of the latest condemnations come from officers who served in the Iraq war , and the controversy has split the ranks over whether attacks by those officers so soon after retiring are appropriate .

One current general who has debated the issue with high - ranking colleagues spoke , like others , on condition of anonymity when discussing actions of other officers .
“ If every guy that retires starts sniping at their old bosses and acts like a political appointee , how do you think senior civilians start choosing their military leaders ? ” the general said .
“ Competence goes out the window .
It ’s all about loyalty and pliability . ”
The ranks of Rumsfeld ’s critics were joined Wednesday by retired Army Maj. Gen. John Batiste , who served as a division commander in Iraq and was a military aide to former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz , a primary architect of the Iraq invasion .
Batiste said he believed Rumsfeld should resign , arguing that the Pentagon needed a new leader who could work with top officers “ without intimidation . ”

In an interview , Batiste said negative feelings about Rumsfeld were widespread among generals he served with .
He added that there was an almost universal belief that the secretary did not treat military leaders and their opinions with respect .
“ It speaks volumes about the leadership climate within the Pentagon , ” Batiste said .
“ Civilian control is absolutely paramount , but in order for it to work , there is a two - way street of respect and dialogue that has to exist . ”
Batiste ’s criticism follows similar attacks by three other retired generals who were involved in the Iraq war or served in top positions in the Middle East : Marine Lt. Gen. Gregory S. Newbold , former director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff ; Army Maj. Gen. Paul D. Eaton , head of training Iraqi forces in 2003 ; and Marine Gen. Anthony C. Zinni , the former head of U.S. Central Command .
Former Defense officials said Batiste ’s criticisms were particularly surprising because of his direct role in planning and fighting the war , first as Wolfowitz ’s military aide and then as commander of the 1st Infantry Division when it was deployed to oversee central Iraq in 2004 .

“ Batiste is really the younger generation who has seen this war firsthand , ” said Thomas E . White , the Bush administration ’s first secretary of the Army and a frequent Rumsfeld critic .
“ When a guy like that steps up , it takes it to an entirely different level . ”
Batiste said his comments were not part of any organized campaign by retired officers .
Although he has worked with Eaton and Newbold , Batiste said he had not talked to either about his decision to go public .
The officers ’ falling out with Rumsfeld began over the Defense Department ’s treatment of retired Army Gen. Eric K. Shinseki , who said at a congressional hearing that several hundred thousand troops would be needed to occupy Iraq , only to be chastised later by Wolfowitz .

The shunting aside of Shineski appears to be something of a touchstone for military critics of Rumsfeld , particularly in the Army , where Shinseki is still well regarded .
One current general said that while the recent criticisms may have brought the uniformed military ’s strained relationship with Rumsfeld into the open , debate over whether they should be more forceful about voicing disagreements had raged for months .
“ The Newbolds and Eatons and the public discussion is spilling over from the internal discussion , ” said the currently serving general .
“ This has been a rising issue within the military . ”
Criticism of political leaders by retired generals is nothing new .
Historians note that former military leaders dating back to the American Revolution have written criticisms of the conduct of wars , and Rumsfeld dismissed many of the criticisms this week as just the latest in that tradition .

“ It ’s historic , it ’s always been the case , and I see nothing really very new or surprising about it , ” he said at a Pentagon news conference .
But Andrew J. Bacevich , a professor of international relations at Boston University and a Vietnam veteran , said he believed it was unprecedented for retired senior officers who had so recently served during a war to criticize civilian leaders while troops were still in the field .
“ I would take this as evidence that the search for scapegoats with regard to the Iraq war has now been fully engaged by the military , ” Bacevich said .
“ The officer corps does n’t want to get stuck with responsibility for a war that has already proven to be a disappointment and could result in failure .
This is an indication that Rumsfeld has been selected as the military ’s preferred scapegoat , ” he said .

The debate within the Pentagon has been influenced by the lessons of the Vietnam War , a conflict many current military leaders believe was lost because military chiefs did not stand up to civilian war plans .
A 1997 book on the subject , “ Dereliction of Duty , ” by H.R. McMaster , now an Army colonel serving in Iraq , has been required reading for many Pentagon officers .
“ There was a deep bitterness over Vietnam and the way the [ service ] chiefs had been co-opted , ” said Richard H. Kohn , a military historian at the University of North Carolina who oversaw McMaster ’s work on the book .
Kohn said it was a lesson sent repeatedly to all Army officers : “ They said : ‘ We ’re never going to put up with this again , we ’re not going to be put in that position again by the civilians . ’ ”

Nevertheless , Kohn , who has discussed relations with civilian leaders with several top officers , said he believed it might be dangerous for such recently retired generals to go public with such criticism .
“ If they go out and attack the policy after leaving and they get personal about it , they ’re undermining civilian control , ” Kohn said .

Baghdad Burning
... I 'll meet you 'round the bend my friend , where hearts can heal and souls can mend ...
I hate the media and I hate the Iraqi government for turning this atrocity into another Sunni - Shia debacle - like it matters whether Sabrine is Sunni or Shia or Arab or Kurd ( the Al Janabi tribe is composed of both Sunnis and Shia ) .
Maliki did not only turn the woman into a liar , he is rewarding the officers she accused .
It 's outrageous and maddening .
No Iraqi woman under the circumstances - under any circumstances - would publicly , falsely claim she was raped .
There are just too many risks .
There is the risk of being shunned socially .
There is the risk of beginning an endless chain of retaliations and revenge killings between tribes .
There is the shame of coming out publicly and talking about a subject so taboo , she and her husband are not only risking their reputations by telling this story , they are risking their lives .
No one would lie about something like this simply to undermine the Baghdad security operation .
That can be done simply by calculating the dozens of dead this last week .
Or by writing about the mass detentions of innocents , or how people are once again burying their valuables so that Iraqi and American troops do n't steal them .
It was less than 14 hours between Sabrine 's claims and Maliki 's rewarding the people she accused .
In 14 hours , Maliki not only established their innocence , but turned them into his own personal heroes .
I wonder if Maliki would entrust the safety his own wife and daughter to these men .
This is meant to discourage other prisoners , especially women , from coming forward and making claims against Iraqi and American forces .
Maliki is the stupidest man alive ( well , after Bush of course … ) if he believes his arrogance and callous handling of the situation will work to dismiss it from the minds of Iraqis .
By doing what he is doing , he 's making it more clear than ever that under his rule , under his government , vigilante justice is the only way to go .
Why leave it to the security forces and police ?
Simply hire a militia or gang to get revenge .
If he does n't get some justice for her , her tribe will be forced to ...
And the Janabat ( the Al Janabis ) are a force to be reckoned with .
The Rape of Sabrine ...
As I write this , Oprah is on Channel 4 ( one of the MBC channels we get on Nilesat ) , showing Americans how to get out of debt .
Her guest speaker is telling a studio full of American women who seem to have over - shopped that they could probably do with fewer designer products .
As they talk about increasing incomes and fortunes , Sabrine Al - Janabi , a young Iraqi woman , is on Al Jazeera telling how Iraqi security forces abducted her from her home and raped her .
You can only see her eyes , her voice is hoarse and it keeps breaking as she speaks .
In the end she tells the reporter that she ca n’t talk about it anymore and she covers her eyes with shame .
She might just be the bravest Iraqi woman ever .
Everyone knows American forces and Iraqi security forces are raping women ( and men ) , but this is possibly the first woman who publicly comes out and tells about it using her actual name .
Hearing her tell her story physically makes my heart ache .
Some people will call her a liar .
Others ( including pro-war Iraqis ) will call her a prostitute - shame on you in advance .
I wonder what excuse they used when they took her .
It ’s most likely she ’s one of the thousands of people they round up under the general headline of ‘ terrorist suspect ’ .
She might have been one of those subtitles you read on CNN or BBC or Arabiya , “ 13 insurgents captured by Iraqi security forces . ”
The men who raped her are those same security forces Bush and Condi are so proud of - you know - the ones the Americans trained .
It ’s a chapter right out of the book that documents American occupation in Iraq : the chapter that will tell the story of 14 - year - old Abeer who was raped , killed and burned with her little sister and parents .
They abducted her from her house in an area in southern Baghdad called Hai Al Amil .
No - it was n’t a gang .
It was Iraqi peace keeping or security forces - the ones trained by Americans ?
You know them .
She was brutally gang - raped and is now telling the story .
Half her face is covered for security reasons or reasons of privacy .
I translated what she said below .
“ I told him , ‘ I do n’t have anything [ I did not do anything ] . ’
He said , ' You do n’t have anything ? ’
One of them threw me on the ground and my head hit the tiles .
He did what he did - I mean he raped me .
The second one came and raped me .
The third one also raped me .
[ Pause - sobbing ]
I begged them and cried , and one of them covered my mouth .
[ Unclear , crying ]
Another one of them came and said , ' Are you finished ?
We also want our turn . '
So they answered , ‘ No , an American committee came . ’
They took me to the judge .
Anchorwoman : Sabrine Al Janabi said that one of the security forces videotaped / photographed her and threatened to kill her if she told anyone about the rape .
Another officer raped her after she saw the investigative judge .
It takes a lot to get the energy and resolution to blog lately .
I guess it ’s mainly because just thinking about the state of Iraq leaves me drained and depressed .
But I had to write tonight .

Sabrine continuing :
“ One of them , he said … I told him , ‘ Please - by your father and mother - let me go . ’
He said , ‘ No , no - by my mother ’s soul I ’ll let you go - but on one condition , you give me one single thing . ’
I said , ‘ What ? ’
He said , ‘ [ I want ] to rape you . ’
I told him , ‘ No - I can ’t . ’
So he took me to a room with a weapon …
It had a weapon , a Klashnikov , a small bed [ Unclear ] , he sat me on it .
So [ the officer came ] and told him , ‘ Leave her to me . ’
I swore to him on the Quran , I told him , ‘ By the light of the Prophet I do n’t do such things … ’
He said , ‘ You do n’t do such things ? ’
I said , ‘ Yes ’ .
[ Crying ]
He picked up a black hose , like a pipe .
He hit me on the thigh .
[ Crying ]
I told him , ‘ What do you want from me ?
Do you want me to tell you rape me ?
But I can ’t … I ’m not one of those ***** [ Prostitutes ]
I do n’t do such things . ’
So he said to me , ‘ We take what we want and what we do n’t want we kill .
That ’s that . ’ [ Sobbing ] I ca n’t anymore … please , I ca n’t finish . ”
[ Crying ]
He picked up a black hose , like a pipe .
He hit me on the thigh .
[ Crying ]
I told him , ‘ What do you want from me ?

So he said to me , ‘ We take what we want and what we do n’t want we kill .
That ’s that . ’ [ Sobbing ] I ca n’t anymore … please , I ca n’t finish . ”
I look at this woman and I can’t feel anything but rage .
What did we gain ?
I know that looking at her , foreigners will never be able to relate .
They ’ll feel pity and maybe some anger , but she ’s one of us .
She ’s not a girl in jeans and a t - shirt so there will only be a vague sort of sympathy .
Poor third - world countries - that is what their womenfolk tolerate .
Just know that we never had to tolerate this before .
There was a time when Iraqis were safe in the streets .
That time is long gone .
We consoled ourselves after the war with the fact that we at least had a modicum of safety in our homes .
Homes are sacred , are n’t they ?
That is gone too .
She ’s just one of tens , possibly hundreds , of Iraqi women who are violated in their own homes and in Iraqi prisons .
She looks like cousins I have .
She looks like friends .
She looks like a neighbor I sometimes used to pause to gossip with in the street .
Every Iraqi who looks at her will see a cousin , a friend , a sister , a mother , an aunt …
Humanitarian organizations are warning that three Iraqi women are to be executed next month .
The women are Wassan Talib , Zainab Fadhil and Liqa Omar Muhammad .
They are being accused of ' terrorism ' , i.e. having ties to the Iraqi resistance .
It could mean they are relatives of people suspected of being in the resistance .
Or it could mean they were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time .
One of them gave birth in the prison .
I wonder what kind of torture they 've endured .
Let no one say Iraqi women did n't get at least SOME equality under the American occupation - we are now equally as likely to get executed .
And yet , as the situation continues to deteriorate both for Iraqis inside and outside of Iraq , and for Americans inside Iraq , Americans in America are still debating on the state of the war and occupation - are they winning or losing ?
Is it better or worse .
Let me clear it up for any moron with lingering doubts :
It ’s worse .
It ’s over .
You lost .
You lost the day your tanks rolled into Baghdad to the cheers of your imported , American - trained monkeys .
You lost every single family whose home your soldiers violated .
You lost every sane , red - blooded Iraqi when the Abu Ghraib pictures came out and verified your atrocities behind prison walls as well as the ones we see in our streets .
You lost when you brought murderers , looters , gangsters and militia heads to power and hailed them as Iraq ’s first democratic government .
You lost when a gruesome execution was dubbed your biggest accomplishment .
You lost the respect and reputation you once had .
You lost more than 3000 troops .
That is what you lost America .
I hope the oil , at least , made it worthwhile .
Europeans Taller on Average Bad Health Care , Deficient Welfare Keep Americans Short

( PopSci.com ) --
Within a decade , a dream team of astronomers and computer geeks vows to bring a world - class observatory to every desktop , giving anyone with a PC access to remote galaxies and exploding supernovae .
The pledge is the result of a partnership announced last winter between a network of 19 national research institutions and engineers from the search - engine giant Google .
Their collective objective is to develop potent software to process the estimated 30 terabytes of astronomy imagery ( think 12 billion five - megapixel photos ) that will stream nightly from the newly built Large Synoptic Survey Telescope , or LSST , slated to go online in 2013 .
Set atop Cerro Pachon Mountain in Chile , the LSST will be the largest survey scope of its kind , sequentially imaging nearly 20 billion astronomical objects in the night sky twice a week at least 2,000 times over the scope 's 10 - year lifetime .
Google 's role in this $ 350 - million project ( beyond the modest $ 25,000 annual dues payment ) is still largely undefined , but Rob Pike , Google 's principal engineer for the LSST , envisions a tool set akin to Google Earth , which combines a search tool with satellite imagery .
So instead of killing time flying over your ideal vacation spot onscreen , you can opt for more productive surfing , such as scanning the skies for hazardous near - Earth asteroids .
How it works
One thousand times as powerful as previous telescopes , the LSST will survey the entire sky every three nights using a wide - angle mirror and a three - billion - pixel digital camera .
As the telescope rotates on its base , the camera 's 15 - second exposures take in an area 50 times as large as the full moon .
Software will compile three - dimensional imagery to produce time - lapse digital " movies " of the universe .
Story Highlights • Flames consume London 's historic clipper ship Cutty Sark
• Vessel was undergoing $ 50 million restoration at time of blaze
• Cause of fire under investigation

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
The Cutty Sark , thought to be the world 's only surviving 19th century tea clipper and a prime relic of the golden age of sail , was engulfed by flames Monday , causing extensive damage to one of London 's most popular tourist attractions .
Police say the blaze , which began before dawn and took 40 firefighters several hours to extinguish , is being treated as " suspicious . "
The fire is expected to drastically increase the cost of a $ 50 million three - year restoration that began in 2006 .
Witnesses described flames leaping 20 feet ( six meters ) in the air , fanned by strong winds .
Nearby residents were temporarily evacuated .
( Watch flames sweep through historic ship )
The clipper -- a very fast multi-masted sailing ship used for transporting high value goods such as tea and wool -- was once regarded as the pinnacle of merchant sail vessel development .
Standing by the smoldering hull of the vessel , Chris Livett , chairman of Cutty Sark Enterprises , told CNN that although the ship 's decks were " unsalvageable " , he believed the vessel could be fully restored .
He said half of the timbers and all historic artifacts on board had been removed for the conservation project .
" I do not think we can give a figure on how much this damage has cost , " he told CNN .
" We 're in dire straits now . "
He added : " This ship has been through many things in its life , it 's sailed through the oceans and been through many natural disasters and survived .
Speed under sail
" We 're devastated .
Lots of people on this project worked very hard and to see that effort go up in smoke is very hard . "
More than 15 million people have visited the ship in its dry dock at Greenwich , a World Heritage Site on the southern bank of the River Thames .
The vessel has been on display since the 1950s .
Cutty Sark rose to prominence after leaving London on its first voyage on February 16 , 1870 , and sailing to Shanghai .
Capable of reaching speeds of up to 17.5 knots and covering more than 360 miles a day , it outstripped most other vessels .
( Read profile of proud maritime relic )
In 1885 , the 85 - meter ( 280 feet ) ship achieved a record - breaking wind - powered voyage from Australia to England , completing the distance in 72 days .
But its glory days were short - lived as steam ships quickly came to replace sail .
Chief executive of the Cutty Sark Trust , Richard Doughty , described the damage as extensive , but said he was hopeful that crucial infrastructure had survived the fire .
" At the moment we are going to try to assess what damage has been done to the metal frame .
A cursory glance indicates that may have survived the fire , " he told CNN .
Doughty paid tribute to the vessel 's status and expressed sorrow over the blaze .
" It is the epitome of speed under sail .
She was a legend in her working lifetime , she set all sorts of records .
Above all , for Londoners , she 's an icon .
" Personally , I 'm gutted .
The smell of the ship , which is pervading over the whole area , the tar of the rope and timbers , usually you can only smell that on the ship , but to smell that all around brings sadness . "

A hybrid car works by combining two smaller engines to produce the power of a larger engine .
Usually , it 's a gas engine and an electric engine .
For instance , in the Toyota Prius it 's currently a 106 horsepower I - 4 engine combined with a 67 horsepower electric engine to produce a 173 horsepower car , about the same as any other I - 4 engine or a small 6 - Cylinder engine .
In the near future , Volkswagen is said to be introducing a new diesel / electric hybrid which will acheive close to 80 miles per gallon and can be used in a standard small car , including the Beetle , Golf , and Jetta .
To improve fuel mileage and exhaust emissions , the electric engine does the work of starting the car and getting it going from a complete stop .
In some hybrids , the electric engine is active all the way up to 35 miles per hour .
One the vehicle is moving , the gas engine starts up and gives the car more power in addition to recharging the electric motor 's batteries .
The gas mileage operates at higher speeds because gas mileage improves with speed up to 65 miles per hour , after which it begins to drop again .
Another way the hybrids are used is as a sort of electric supercharger ( mainly Honda and Lexus use them for this ) to give the engine added power at lower speeds before letting the gas engine take over after a preset speed .
One thing I will say about your purchasing a hybrid vehicle is to be careful which ones you go for .
Toyota 's Prius , because of the heavy weight of the batteries and the added electric motor , does n't get all that much better mileage than the Toyota Corolla .
The Prius , which is rated at 60 miles per gallon in city driving and 51 on the highway , has been found to get closer to 51 city and 40 on the highway ( Consumer Reports , Motor Trend , Car and Driver , etc. have all found this to be the case ) .
The Toyota Corolla has been found to get 32 miles per gallon in the city and 41 on the highway , with some people reporting even higher mileage .
Plus , the Prius costs a lot more than the Corolla , and , in my opinion , the Corolla looks a lot better .
To reimburse your loss in cash over buying the Prius , you 'd have to drive it for over 90,000 , and that 's assuming the gas mileage does n't drop with age .
An even worse case would be Chevrolet 's Silverado Hybrid , which gained just 1 mile per gallon at the expense of over $ 5,000 .
The only hybrids which have gotten similar numbers to what 's been promised have been the Ford Escape Hybrid , Honda Civic Hybrid , Mercury Mariner Hybrid , and Toyota Camry Hybrid .
All of these vehicles have been reliable and are selling well .
If you want to save even more money , consider a diesel - powered Volkswagen , like the aforementioned Beetle , Golf , and Jetta diesels , which have been acheiving 41 - 46 miles per gallon and higher .
Plus , the diesel engines are more efficient than the gas engines and far more reliable .
If you have any more questions , please feel free to ask .
April 15 , 2007  -- Insurgent presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , raised $ 24.8 million in primary cash for his campaign -- almost 30 percent more than did frontrunner Sen.
Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , with $ 19.1 million , the candidates ' Federal Election Commission documents filed on Sunday evening indicate .
Obama also nearly tied Clinton in total donations , having raised $ 25.8 million compared to Clinton 's $ 26 million -- an astounding achievement for a political novice going up against such a veteran .
These and other illuminating , cold , hard facts about the campaigns of those contending to be the 44th president of the United States were revealed this weekend as campaigns posted their first quarterly reports with the FEC .
Among the other headlines :
PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH -- Self - described fiscal conservative Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , spent 64 percent of what he took in , and assumed a stunning amount ( to the tune of $ 1.8 million ) of debt .
BIG MAMA'S WHITE HOUSE ? -- Clinton , who transferred $ 10 million from her 2006 Senate reelection campaign account to her presidential coffers , is large and in charge when it comes to cash on hand , with $ 24 million at her disposal right now .
Clinton has also more overall cash , with $ 31 million , including $ 6.9 million she cannot spend unless she wins the nomination .
HOME AIN'T WHERE THE CASH IS -- Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , who hopes to be the first Mormon elected president , received more donations from Utah , $ 2.8 million , than from the state he used to govern , whose residents gave him $ 2.3 million .
AS DEEP , AND NARROW , AS MANHATTAN ISLAND -- Rudy Giuiani , the former mayor of New York , raised $ 14 million , but it came from fewer donors than any other major candidate , indicating access to big - money donors but not widespread support .
DEMOCRATIC WINDS --
Leading up to an election year anticipated to be one of difficulty for the GOP , the Democratic presidential candidates raised $ 27 million more than their Republican counterparts .
Numbers
The FEC reports revealed much more than wonky numbers :
They tell a great deal about the campaigns .
Perhaps even more than the plethora of public polls , for example , the first quarter filings demonstrate just how difficult it will be for some of the other presidential hopefuls to compete with the big boys and girl in the field .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio , reported having $ 163,887 in the bank as of March 31 and former Gov. Tommy Thompson , R - Wis. , reported having slightly less than that with $ 139,723 .
Some other lessons :
1 ) " BURN RATE " --
One of the key indicators of whether or not a campaign is being managed efficiently is the " burn rate " -- the percentage of the money raised that the campaign spent during the same time period .
McCain is the big loser in this category .
His campaign hemorrhaged money by spending 64 percent of what it raised in the first quarter .
Romney spent roughly half of what he collected -- including nearly $ 2 million on introductory television ads in key early states such as Iowa , New Hampshire , and South Carolina .
Giuliani displayed the most spending restraint among the top three GOP contenders by only spending about 37 percent of what he raised .
Democrats -- historically tagged as the " big spenders " -- are clearly are watching their spending , comparatively .
Clinton 's burn rate was 26 percent , Edwards ' was 24 percent , and Obama 's was 27 percent .
Democratic New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson may have come up with the most clever way to keep his burn rate below 20 percent -- his campaign manager , Dave Contarino , is a volunteer who does not draw a salary from the campaign .
That 's a somewhat different approach than the roughly $ 240,000 annual salary Rudy Giuliani pays to his campaign manager , Mike DuHaime .
It can also be telling to see what these campaigns have spent money on .
Clinton 's campaign , eagerly competing with Obama for the endorsement of Rep. Jim Clyburn , D - S.C. -- the House majority whip and a senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus -- has donated $ 4,000 to Clyburn 's reelection committee .
2 ) CASH ON HAND --
The bottom line matters .
Although it is important to look at how much each candidate has raised as a measure of a campaign 's strength and support , the amount of cash each candidate has in the bank affects a campaign 's strategy going forward .
Clinton 's transfer of $ 10 million from her Senate campaign account dramatically boosted the money available to her and her team heading into the second quarter of the year and has her sitting atop the entire field with more than $ 24 million .
Obama trails her respectably but considerably , with $ 18.2 million cash on hand , followed by Romney with $ 11.8 million .
On the other side of the coin , McCain has only $ 5.18 million in cash on hand , about the same amount as second - tier candidate Richardson and , remarkably , $ 1.3 million less than his friend Sen.
Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , a long shot candidate who chairs the Senate Banking Committee .
3 ) NUMBER OF DONORS --
Beyond the millions of dollars amassed by the leading candidates is an important indication of just how broad that support is .
Obama brought in roughly $ 25 million -- just $ 4 million more than Mitt Romney .
But Obama had more than triple the number of donors -- 104,000 contributors for Obama versus Romney 's 32,000 .
McCain's one bright spot on the GOP side is that he can boast of significantly more donors -- roughly 50,000 people contributed to his campaign -- than his Republican rivals , perhaps indicating a broader base of support .
Clinton also had roughly 60,000 donors and Edwards had north of 40,000 .
Rudy Giuliani rounds out the Big 6 candidates with the most narrow network of support , having received cash from approximately 28,000 people .
4 ) THE INTERNET --
The cheapest and easiest way for a campaign to raise money and reach potential supporters is by having them click on to the campaign Web site and donate online .
Obama scored the most Internet money by raising $ 6.9 million online in the first quarter .
Romney did better than any of his GOP competitors in harnessing the Internet as a fundraising tool by raising $ 3.3 million through its
Web site and an additional $ 3.8 million through " Quick ComMitt " -- the campaign 's online fundraising mechanism .
5 ) SECOND -TIER DEMOCRATS --
The intensity of the wind at Democratic backs in this first quarter is apparent by taking a look at the campaign war chests of the so - called second - tier competitors .
No Republican candidate outside of the Big 3 ( Romney , Giuliani and McCain ) has more than $ 1 million in cash on hand as of March 31 .
Not so for the Democrats .
Dodd ( $ 6.4 million ) , Richardson ( $ 5 million ) , and Sen. Joe Biden , D - Del. , ( $ 2.5 million ) all posted significant cash on hand totals despite the many millions being sent to Clinton , Obama and Edwards .
Who Gave ?
There are conflicts and disagreements buried in those dry FEC reports -- juicy details abound about friends , colleagues , and family members squaring off in rival campaigns .
Past donors to President Bill Clinton have defected from the family , raising money for Obama and raising Democratic eyebrows .
These include Hollywood moguls David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg , as well as longtime Democratic donors such as Peter Buttenwieser , an heir to the Lehman Brothers securities fortune , and Orin Kramer , general partner of Boston Provident Partners LP in New York .
And what are we to glean from the examples of those behind NBC's " Saturday Night Live " ?
Old - school star Chevy Chase gave $ 4,600 to Clinton .
Eddie Murphy kicked in $ 2,300 to Obama .
Adam Sandler gave $ 2,100 to Giuliani .
And their former boss , SNL executive producer Lorne Michaels , dished out $ 1,000 to McCain .
Likewise , are the legendary rivalries among the Pritzker clan evident in the fact that Hyatt hotel heiress Penny Pritzker is Obama 's national finance chair , but her relatives Thomas , Margot and James Pritzker have given money to McCain ?
Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman , Jr. , gave the maximum primary donation , $ 2,300 , to McCain while his father , Jon Huntsman Sr. , gave the same amount to Romney .
The woman who preceded Romney as governor of Massachusetts , Jane Swift , and who was summarily handed her hat and shown the door by GOP officials once Romney started considering a run , gave money to McCain as well .
Conversely , some donors hedged their bets and gave to more than one candidate .
Hollywood mogul David Geffen gave to Obama and Edwards .
Brent Scowcroft , the national security adviser for former President George H.W. Bush , gave to both McCain and Romney .
Obama 's Good News ; McCain's Bad
Former President Clinton is one of the most popular figures in the Democratic Party ; he and his wife are inarguably the definition of a power couple .
On the national stage for more than 15 years , the two were called upon to help raise money for Democratic candidates quite a bit during the 2006 election -- even though Sen.
Clinton had her own , however uncompetitive , re-election campaign to worry about .
That Obama , only in national office since 2004 , a self - described " skinny guy with a funny name , " could come within a hair of matching Clinton 's overall figure raised and thump her on primary cash sent nothing short of shockwaves throughout the political world .
The achievement is all the more impressive when one considers that , unlike Clinton , Obama accepts no donations from registered lobbyists or political action committees .
On Friday , as Obama 's campaign checked its 104,000 donors against the database of federal lobbyists , it found cash from 49 lobbyists , totaling more than $ 50,000 , which the campaign returned .
Conversely , with a burn rate a rival campaign official called " mind boggling , " McCain -- who has had a presidential political and fundraising operation for much of the last decade -- had the most disappointing quarter .
The Arizona senator not only came in sixth in fundraising among the six major candidates , with $ 13 million , his FEC report indicates his campaign had spent $ 8.38 million , about 64 percent of what it raised .
Not even factoring in the campaign 's nearly $ 2 million in outstanding debts , McCain begins this next , increasingly competitive quarter of the presidential race with only $ 5.18 million in cash on hand , far below his two closest rivals for the Republican nomination .
Romney has more than twice as much primary cash on hand as McCain -- $ 11.8 million -- and Giuliani has about $ 10.8 million available to him in the primaries .
And while McCain has $ 1.8 million in outstanding debt , Giuliani owes $ 88,862 .
( Romney has more than $ 2 million in debt , but it 's cash he himself loaned his campaign at its genesis , which he may or may not ever repay . )
McCain has acknowledged " disappointing " fundraising , and campaign officials say they have taken steps to correct the problem .
They say they are pleased with the direction the fundraising is going -- they raised $ 2 million in January , $ 3 million in February , and $ 8 million in March of this year .
And McCain campaign insiders also note that former Rep. Tom Loeffler , R - Texas , is now on board and brought the national finance chairs together for a meeting this week and explained to them that the campaign is now installing high levels of accountability in its fundraising structure .
" Obviously , we would have liked to have raised more money , " McCain said at a press conference in Arizona on Monday .
" We 'll try and do better next time . "

Jimmy Carter Attacked by Killer Rabbit ( April 20 , 1979 )
Today in Odd History , President Jimmy Carter was attacked by a rabbit during a fishing trip in Plains , Georgia .
The rabbit , which may have been fleeing a predator , swam toward his boat , " hissing menacingly , its teeth flashing and nostrils flared . "
President Carter was forced to swat at the vicious beast with a canoe paddle , which apparently scared it off .
Upon his return to the White House , Carter told his staff about the furry amphibian 's assault .
Most of them refused to believe him , insisting that rabbits can't swim ( although since most mammals can swim , there 's no reason to believe that rabbits cannot ) , and that even if they could , they certainly would n't attack humans , and certainly not presidents .
Fortunately , a White House photographer had been on the scene , and had recorded the bizarre attack .
The photograph showed Carter with his paddle raised , warding off a small creature which might , or might not , have been a rabbit .
One staffer was quoted as saying , " You could n't tell what it was . "
Undaunted by their skepticism , Carter had the image enlarged , and there it was -- a killer bunny rabbit , apparently bent on assassinating the president .
The story might have ended there , except that White House Press Secretary Jody Powell mentioned the incident to Associated Press reporter Brooks Jackson in August .
The Washington Post ran it as front page news .
The original photograph was not available ( until the Reagan administration leaked it in 1981 ) , but the paper filled the gap with a cartoon modeled on the poster for the movie Jaws , starring the rabbit and entitled Paws .
Powell made a belated attempt to impress the public with the seriousness of the attack , calling the creature a " swamp rabbit , " but since Carter had to appease his rabbit - loving constituents by insisting that he had not actually smacked his buck - toothed opponent with his paddle , but only splashed water at it to drive it away , it seemed unlikely that he had been in danger .
The entire episode became a symbol of Carter 's floundering presidency .
According to Powell , " [ I ]t shows the extent to which an insignificant incident can snowball and end up in newspapers and news shows across the country .
вЂќ Carter biographer Douglas Brinkley says , в Ђњ It just played up the Carter flake factor ....
I mean , he had to deal with Russia and the Ayatollah and here he was supposedly fighting off a rabbit .

I had originally believed that no digital copy of the rabbit attack was available .
However , Jerry Callen , at Narsil.org ordered and uploaded a 300 DPI digital print of the photo some time ago .
( Click on the smaller image above to access it ) .
A detail from the photo , showing the savage beast more clearly , is also available at Narsil .

The home media server
What 's a home media server ?
A central place to put all that data you have , from e-mail to music to movies .
With multiple PCs becoming commonplace in the home , the need to push data through every room in the house via Ethernet or WiFi combined with the proliferation of digital - only content mean the storage demands of home users are rising quickly .
Fortunately , hard drives have been getting cheaper as well , to the point where they are treated as commodity items by OEMs and even smaller system builders .
The major upside of this is that storing 250 GB of data or more can be done for well under $ 100 , and 500 GB for $ 140 .
Compared to prices 10 or 15 years ago of $ 1 per megabyte , and the possibility of a home media server with a terabyte or three of storage is sure to bring a silly grin to many a face .
A cheap home PC can store a few hundred gigabytes of data very cheaply , while a low - cost home media server can rack together a few hard drives to act as a central location for data storage , distributing everything over the home network .
For our first Home Media Server guide , we 're including two options : Budget Media Server and the Performance Media Server .
For the most part , the parts are interchangeable between the two so you can mix and match the components to meet your needs .
The economical Budget Media Server is possible with the presence of on - board RAID on most motherboards today .
All but the cheapest motherboards and chipsets today implement some form of RAID , and they come with 4 or more SATA ports to allow a 4 - disk RAID array to be done with no additional equipment on the end user 's part .
While the most basic forms of RAID supported are striping ( RAID0 ) and mirroring ( RAID1 ) , spending a few dollars more on a motherboard built with a chipset that supports RAID5 ( striping with distributed parity ) allows users to build a modestly fault - tolerant cluster of hard drives while sacrificing only a single drive 's worth of storage space .
Performance and reliability are not going to win awards , but for a home media server , the modest performance of onboard RAID5 is more than enough .
The Performance Media Server adds quite a bit of performance and expansion potential .
While it is probably overkill for the home , people whose storage needs are this large probably enjoy having overkill .
Going to a true hardware - based RAID controller from Adaptec , Areca , LSI Logic , 3ware , or a similar company with high - end features such as online capacity expansion and gives a significant performance increase and easy support for much larger numbers of drives and arrays .
Most motherboards top out at 6 SATA ports , while a hardware RAID card may have as many as 24 SATA ports .
The Performance Media Server also adds more memory and a faster processor , allowing it to easily handle encoding and decoding tasks , allowing the removal of heavy tasks from the desktop , which can then spend more time helping you play the latest MMORPG .
RAID means what ?
Note : a full discussion of RAID concepts is beyond the scope of this guide , but you can check out " The skinny on RAID , " which will educate you on the whys and wherefores of RAID .
As far as the Media Servers are concerned , RAID is an easy way to make multiple drives appear as a single one .
The danger with multiple hard drives ganged together to appear as a single large drive is that the failure of a single disk could result in the loss of data in the entire array .
To reduce this risk , most levels of RAID ( except RAID0 ) include some form of mirroring ( RAID1 ) or parity ( RAID5 , RAID6 , etc. ) to protect against drive failure .
The most inexpensive form of RAID in the balance of space - vs- reliablity is RAID5 , which uses a single drive 's worth of space dedicated to parity data .
This results in an array that can sustain only a single drive failure , but with the relatively low stress seen in home media servers , fault tolerance for a single disk failure should be adequate , and the relatively minimal cost of lost space means that small arrays can maximize their remaining capacity .
RAID5 is not ideal for everyone or everything , but in a small array with four or six drives , losing only a single disk 's worth of storage is seen by many lightweight users as a good compromise than losing half the disks ' worth of storage to the most common form of redundancy in a RAID array , RAID1 .
Hidden costs
Four disks at 500 GB each is 2TB , six disks is 3TB .
Going to 750 GB disks gets 3TB with just four disks , but at double the cost per disk .
Reality is rarely that simple .
The money saved by buying smaller , cheaper disks is offset by the fact that they still have to be connected to the RAID controller , powered by the power supply , and cooled by the fans in the chassis .
Most motherboards and RAID controllers have four ports .
Going to six disks rather than four suddenly means you need a separate controller card — or you 'll have to hunt for the rare motherboard with six SATA ports .
A hard drive consumes 15 to 20 watts of power when actively seeking , which may mean you 'll need a bigger power supply , and then you have to find a case that can fit more disks .
Finding a case capable of holding four or five 3.5 " drives is not overly difficult , but think six or eight disks and the task becomes , if not more difficult , then at least somewhat more costly .
It 's a balancing act .
Throwing future expansion into the mix only complicates things .
Another important issue is noise .
Putting lots of hard drives together in a small space tends to lead to lots of noise and heat .
Fans to circulate the air from very tightly packed components tend to be of the high - speed , high - flow variety by necessity rather than by choice .
Building a low - noise or even a quiet media server is difficult but not impossible .
Large heatsinks with low - noise fans , low - noise case fans , passive coolers for chipsets , and low - noise power supplies as found in the regular Ars System Guide , particularly the Hot Rod , may aid in the goal of a low - noise media server .
Balancing noise versus cooling needs and cost is not easy .
While we try to avoid specifying loud components in the Media Server guide , we recognize the fact that these boxes are not going to be particularly quiet .
Budget or Performance ?
With a home media server unable to ever take full advantage of a fast RAID controller , the real breakdown between the Budget Media Server and the Performance Media Server is expansion potential .
Cramming another disk or so into the Budget Media Server is about the limit of the motherboard and the chassis .
The Performance Media Server can handle additional drives more easily .
With a larger starting budget , initial capacity can be much greater while retaining significant expansion potential .
From the price of each configuration , the cost to support more than four or so drives increases quickly .
The Budget builder recognizes this limitation , while the Prformance builder can both justify the additional capacity and afford to spend the money .
It 's up to the individual reader to determine what suits his or her needs best .

Journalist finds laughter lacking in North Korea
AP
A Danish journalist who infiltrated the US Republican Party 's presidential campaign in 2004 said on Thursday that he had pulled off a much riskier stunt this year in North Korea .
Mads Bruegger , who works for Denmark 's public television and is renowned for carrying out humorous stunts , said he and three others won permission to enter the reclusive state in May by posing as members of a left - wing theater troupe .
The quartet , including two South Korean - born Danes , staged an eclectic theater performance in Pyongyang , Bruegger said .
They were allowed to film it , and other parts of their visit , saying it would be broadcast on Danish TV .
However , they did n't tell authorities their true intentions .
" The plan was to find out how laughter was doing in North Korea , the world 's most reclusive country , " Bruegger said .
The first episode will be aired Dec. 1 on Danish TV channel DR2 .
His conclusion was that laughter is a rare commodity in the nation led by dictator Kim Jong - il -- which may have helped the Danes carry out their plot without anyone calling their bluff .
" No one grasped the thick irony and satire , " Bruegger said .
" I believe we only survived because 50 years of mind control has wiped out any sense of irony and satire . "
An official at the North Korean Embassy in the Swedish capital of Stockholm , which also oversees Denmark , said he was not aware of the trip .
The Danes , who professed to be big supporters of North Korea 's communist regime , appeared on North Korean TV and marched in an anti-US parade in Pyongyang , Bruegger said .
He said their recordings were approved by North Korean authorities .
One clip , shown on Danish TV , showed the Danes presenting a pizza shovel as a gift to a North Korean official .
During that meeting , Bruegger said he made " a totally delirious speech " in which he wished Denmark would follow the North Korean example and " test fire missiles to defend our strong Danish culture . "
In 2004 , Bruegger and journalist Jakob Boeskov went undercover as Danish campaign volunteers backing US President George W. Bush .
Trailed by a cameraman on a three - week trip across the US , they hobnobbed with local Republican committees , handed out leaflets at rallies and traded insults with Democratic hecklers .
The pair expressed their amazement afterward that nobody seemed to catch on to their stunt .
Update 05/21/07 : I have decided to take down the Calvin and Hobbes cartoon strips .
If you were directed to this page with the promise of cartoon strips , please accept my sincere apologies .
Last Friday evening , I was feeling too relaxed to put together a serious post .
It seemed like it would be a fun idea to post strips of Calvin & Hobbes instead .
I have been a huge fan of C&H for a long time , and thought it would be a neat idea to bring together some of Calvin ’s whacky ideas to make money , in one single post .
I already knew which strips I wanted to include , but finding them online , adding the captions , and in general , putting that post together was a lot of work , and I was quite proud of that post .
The article was a runaway success and drew in a lot of visitors .
I was very happy .
I guess there is a little bit of Calvin in me – feeling happy for “ my ” success , when the credit was really due elsewhere 🙂
A couple of people pointed out to me that I was likely violating copyright .
I had accredited the website where I had obtained the strips from and so I thought I should be fine .
But it kept nagging me .
I had read stories of how Bill Watterson ( the creator of Calvin & Hobbes ) had turned down several lucrative offers to commercialize the cartoon because he did not want to cheapen them .
I really respect that stand ( though I do n’t necessarily agree with it , but that is a different story ) .
I did n’t want to violate the wishes of a person whose work I so loved and whose stand I respected .
So , I mailed the author of the site from where I had downloaded the cartoons asking him permission for posting the strips on my blog .
The site looked quite legitimate , and I thought it might be a licensed site .
But the author told me he did n’t own the rights and requested me not to send any traffic to his site since he had created the site for personal use .
OK .
What next ?
A part of me wanted to just ignore the whole thing – the traffic was just too good .
And another part told me I had to do the “ right ” thing .
Finally , I gave in , and contacted Universal Press Syndicate , the syndication that has the rights to the C&H strips , requesting permission to post the strips .
My request was denied .
To quote from the mail –
We must ask that you remove the Calvin and Hobbes strips from your Website as that use violates Mr. Watterson ’s copyrights .
Mr. Watterson has always held very strong feelings about how his work is used and distributed .
( He explains those feelings in his Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book ) .
While some of his fans may find his decisions difficult to understand , we have an obligation to respect and enforce them .
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation .
And so , the strips have to go 🙁
I HATE doing the “ right ” thing !!!
Well , at least I am going to sleep well tonight .

Teenagers who drink alcohol with their parents are less likely to binge drink , according to a survey of 10,000 children which backs the continental style of introducing teenagers to small amounts of alcohol early .
Parents who do not want their children drinking behind their backs should limit their pocket money to less than £ 10 a week , says the study , carried out by academics and trading standards officers .
It found that teenagers who illegally bought their own alcohol were six times as likely to drink in public , in parks and on the streets , three times as likely to be regular drinkers and twice as likely to be binge drinkers .
Mark Bellis , the lead researcher and director of the public health centre at Liverpool John Moores University , said : " We are too used to handing £ 10 or £ 20 to young people without any realisation of where it is being spent .
Add to that birthday money and money from part - time jobs - young people have money to spend .
Parents need to know more about what their children are spending it on . "
The report calls on the government to force the alcohol industry to stop marketing to teenagers and to crack down on shops selling to underage teenagers .
Some 40 % of the 15 - and 16 - year - olds polled who reported that they drank said they bought their own alcohol .
The survey was carried out in more than 130 schools in the north - west of England by trading standards officers .
More than 10,000 questionnaires were returned by pupils aged 15 and 16 .
The results suggest that girls from the most socially deprived areas who received the most weekly pocket money were the most likely to drink irresponsibly - defined as more than twice a week , five units at a time and in public spaces .
Nearly 90 % drank at least once every six months .
Some 40 % of those binged regularly , a quarter drank frequently and half drank in public .
Those who were most at risk , who did all three , were most likely to buy the alcohol themselves or through an older sibling or friend .
People who drank with their parents , and received less than £ 10 pocket money a week , exhibited the safest behaviour .
Other research has shown that the worst problems associated with teenage drinking happen when it takes place in public , in contrast with France and Italy , where young people typically first drink at mealtimes with their parents .
Today 's findings contrast sharply with a recent call from Alcohol Concern to prosecute parents who give their under - 15s alcohol .
Professor Bellis said that this evidence showed that approach was flawed .
" I do n't think prosecuting parents is the way forward .
It 's possibly the worst thing you can do to a child at that stage . "
A spokesman for Alcohol Concern said : " The drinks industry has a major role to play in cutting down alcohol purchasing by underaged drinkers . "
A Department of Health spokesperson said alcohol sales to under - 18s were decreasing .
" We are working closely with the industry to encourage the responsible sale of alcohol .
In 2005 , restrictions on alcohol advertising on TV were tightened . "

A sad tale of technology dependence
Sometimes I hate technology .
Several months ago I decided to turn over a new leaf and start using better passwords .
So when I got this cool new Sony Vaio laptop , I set it up with a really good password that I had never used before .
It was long and it contained a bunch of mixed case letters and numbers and funky punctuation .
I made sure nobody was ever going to guess this password .
Not even me .
And then I immediately forgot it .
Fortunately , this particular laptop has a fingerprint sensor .
What a cool piece of technology !
I still have no idea what my password is , but every morning I simply drag my index finger over the sensor and Windows logs me in .
Last night in the woodshop I sliced my index finger open while attempting to see if a plane iron was sharp yet .
( It was . )
Today , my &*% #$@ !
laptop thinks my fingerprint has changed .
It was funny at first .
I tried every password I could remember .
Then I started to get frustrated .
I searched my desk to see if perhaps I wrote the password down somewhere .
No luck .
After a while , I started to get angry .
Why do things like this always seem to happen before I 've had any coffee ?
I tried the finger swipe again .
Nope .
My condition started to degrade from angry to irrational .
I hated computers .
I considered dropping the laptop out my fourth floor window .
I tried swiping my index finger in all kinds of different ways .
Still no luck .
I wished I had never seen a computer before .
I remembered the Amish community just south of Champaign and wondered if they would take me in .
I tried using the middle finger instead .
I knew it would n't work , but at the time I just felt like that was the appropriate finger to use .
I picked up the phone to call my parents and blame them for giving birth to me at the wrong point in history .
And as I was dialing , the fingerprint swipe suddenly worked , probably because I had been trying for so long that my finger had time to heal .
The new password on my laptop is " Eric " .
And just in case I forget my name , I 'm going to write it on the outside of the case with a Sharpie .

VICE PRESIDENT
Dick Cheney recently attacked my 1972 presidential platform and contended that today ’s Democratic Party has reverted to the views I advocated in 1972 .
In a sense , this is a compliment , both to me and the Democratic Party .
Cheney intended no such compliment .
Instead , he twisted my views and those of my party beyond recognition .
The city where the vice president spoke , Chicago , is sometimes dubbed “ the Windy City . ”
Cheney converted the chilly wind of Chicago into hot air .
Cheney said that today ’s Democrats have adopted my platform from the 1972 presidential race and that , in doing so , they will raise taxes .
But my platform offered a balanced budget .
I proposed nothing new without a carefully defined way of paying for it .
By contrast , Cheney and his team have run the national debt to an all - time high .
He also said that the McGovern way is to surrender in Iraq and leave the U.S. exposed to new dangers .
The truth is that I oppose the Iraq war , just as I opposed the Vietnam War , because these two conflicts have weakened the U.S. and diminished our standing in the world and our national security .
In the war of my youth , World War II , I volunteered for military service at the age of 19 and flew 35 combat missions , winning the Distinguished Flying Cross as the pilot of a B - 24 bomber .
By contrast , in the war of his youth , the Vietnam War , Cheney got five deferments and has never seen a day of combat — a record matched by President Bush .

Cheney charged that today ’s Democrats do n’t appreciate the terrorist danger when they move to end U.S. involvement in the Iraq war .
The fact is that Bush and Cheney misled the public when they implied that Iraq was involved in the terrorist attacks of 9/11 .
Iraq had nothing to do with the attacks .
That was the work of Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda team .
Cheney and Bush blew the effort to trap Bin Laden in Afghanistan by their sluggish and inept response after the 9/11 attacks .
They then foolishly sent U.S. forces into Iraq against the advice and experience of such knowledgeable men as former President George H.W. Bush , his secretary of State , James A. Baker III , and his national security advisor , Brent Scowcroft .
Just as the Bush administration mistakenly asserted Iraq ’s involvement in the 9/11 attacks , it also falsely contended that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
When former Ambassador Joseph Wilson exploded the myth that Iraq attempted to obtain nuclear materials from Niger , Cheney ’s top aide and other Bush officials leaked to the media that Wilson ’s wife was a CIA agent ( knowingly revealing the identity of a covert agent is illegal ) .
In attacking my positions in 1972 as representative of “ that old party of the early 1970s , ” Cheney seems oblivious to the realities of that time .
Does he remember that the Democratic Party , with me in the lead , reformed the presidential nomination process to ensure that women , young people and minorities would be represented fairly ?
The so - called McGovern reform rules are still in effect and , indeed , have been largely copied by the Republicans .

The Democrats ’ 1972 platform was also in the forefront in pushing for affordable healthcare , full employment with better wages , a stronger environmental and energy effort , support for education at every level and a foreign policy with less confrontation and belligerence and more cooperation and conciliation .
Cheney also still has his eyes closed to the folly of the Vietnam War , in which 58,000 young Americans and more than 2 million Vietnamese died .
Vietnam was no threat to the United States .
On one point I do agree with Cheney : Today ’s Democrats are taking positions on the Iraq war similar to the views I held toward the Vietnam War .
But that is all to the good .
The war in Iraq has greatly increased the terrorist danger .
There was little or no terrorism , insurgency or civil war in Iraq before Bush and Cheney took us into war there five years ago .
Now Iraq has become a breeding ground of terrorism , a bloody insurgency against our troops and a civil war .

Beyond the deaths of more than 3,100 young Americans and an estimated 600,000 Iraqis , we have spent nearly $ 500 billion on the war , which has dragged on longer than World War II .
The Democrats are right .
Let ’s bring our troops home from this hopeless war .
There is one more point about 1972 for Cheney ’s consideration .
After winning 11 state primaries in a field of 16 contenders , I won the Democratic presidential nomination .
I then lost the general election to President Nixon .
Indeed , the entrenched incumbent president , with a campaign budget 10 times the size of mine , the power of the White House behind him and a highly negative and unethical campaign , defeated me overwhelmingly .
But lest Cheney has forgotten , a few months after the election , investigations by the Senate and an impeachment proceeding in the House forced Nixon to become the only president in American history to resign the presidency in disgrace .
Who was the real loser of ’ 72 ?

THE VICE PRESIDENT spoke with contempt of my ’ 72 campaign , but he might do well to recall that I began that effort with these words : “ I make one pledge above all others — to seek and speak the truth . ”
We made some costly tactical errors after winning the nomination , but I never broke my pledge to speak the truth .
That is why I have never felt like a loser since 1972 .
In contrast , Cheney and Bush have repeatedly lied to the American people .
It is my firm belief that the Cheney - Bush team has committed offenses that are worse than those that drove Nixon , Vice President Spiro Agnew and Atty .
Gen. John Mitchell from office after 1972 .
Indeed , as their repeated violations of the Constitution and federal statutes , as well as their repudiation of international law , come under increased consideration , I expect to see Cheney and Bush forced to resign their offices before 2008 is over .
Aside from a growing list of impeachable offenses , the vice president has demonstrated his ignorance of foreign policy by attacking House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for visiting Syria .
Apparently he thinks it is wrong to visit important Middle East states that sometimes disagree with us .
Is n’t it generally agreed that Nixon ’s greatest achievement was talking to the Chinese Communist leaders , which opened the door to that nation ?
And was n’t President Reagan ’s greatest achievement talking with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev until the two men worked out an end to the Cold War ?
Does Cheney believe that it ’s better to go to war rather than talk with countries with which we have differences ?
We , of course , already know that when Cheney endorses a war , he exempts himself from participation .
On second thought , maybe it ’s wise to keep Cheney off the battlefield — he might end up shooting his comrades rather than the enemy .

On a more serious note , instead of listening to the foolishness of the neoconservative ideologues , the Cheney - Bush team might better heed the words of a real conservative , Edmund Burke : “ A conscientious man would be cautious how he dealt in blood . ”
Objective Caml Standard ML
Syntax
See this syntax comparison for more details .
Array / string shorthands
Special syntactic sugar is defined for array and string accesses .
These operations receive no special treatment .
let arr = [ | 1 ; 2 ; 3 | ] ; ; let two = arr .
( 1 ) ; ; arr .
( 2 ) val arr = Array.fromList [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ; val two = Array.sub ( arr , 1 ) ; Array.update ( arr , 2 , 6 ) ; val str = " Hello " ; val e = String.sub ( str , 1 ) ;
Arrays and strings are central data structures of " practical programming , " so they should be as usable as we can make them .
More syntactic sugar clutters the language definition .
Arrays and strings show up infrequently in traditional functional programming applications , and many new ML programmers accustomed to array - based work could quite profitably switch to datatype - based solutions instead .
Character literals
Uses ' c ' Uses # " c "
OCaml 's syntax is shorter and follows the " standard " set by C. Apostrophes mean " type variable " or " prime " in SML and are parts of identifiers ; they should n't be confused with character literals .
Many symbolically - oriented SML programs do n't manipulate individual characters , so we should n't complicate the lexer to support related features .
( Consider ' a ' , which could be either a type variable or a character literal , depending on where it appers . )
Identifier conventions
Module , module type , and constructor names must start in capital letters and other identifiers can't No capitalization convention
type myType = A | B ; ; let f = function A ' -> 0 (* A ' is signaled as an unbound constructor . *) | B -> 1 ; ; datatype myType = a | b ; val f = fn a ' => 0 (* a ' is processed as a variable .
*) | b => 1 ; (* This case is signaled as redundant . *)
This convention stops a very nasty class of pattern matching bugs involving confusion between variables and variant constructors .
It also eases the tasks of text editor syntax highlighters , making it easy to distinguish between module and variable names by color , for example .
More flexibility can't hurt if you 're careful , right ?
In actuality , most SML programmers with opinions would prefer the OCaml convention .
Let - binding syntax
Separate top - level let and let expressions Syntactic class of declarations and let ..in.. end construct for binding them
let six = 6 let rec fact x = if x = 0 then 1 else x * fact ( x - 1 ) let six_fact = let six = 6 in let rec fact x = if x = 0 then 1 else x * fact ( x - 1 ) in fact 6 val six = 6 fun fact x = if x = 0 then 1 else x * fact ( x - 1 ) val six_fact = let val six = 6 fun fact x = if x = 0 then 1 else x * fact ( x - 1 ) in fact 6 end
In practice , this approach leads to some very confusing error messages , since the compiler is less able to predict what grouping you really intended .
Having a unified mechanism for top - level and local bindings leads to less duplication of functionality , and let ..in.. end seems empirically to lead to clearer error messages .
Overloaded " minus "
The standard - symbol is used for both negation and subtraction .
Tilde ( ~ ) is used for negation .
1 - 2 ; ; 1 + - 2 ; ; 1 - 2 ; 1 + ~ 2 ;
Lots of programmers would be confused by throwing over this long - standing convention .
Differentiating subtraction and negation upholds the SML position that operators are just identifiers like any others that happen to be used via special syntax .
Modulo the overloading of binary arithmetic operators , SML avoids situations where an identifier means different things in different contexts .
Semicolon precedence
Semicolon binds more tightly than match bodies and anonymous functions Semicolon binds less tightly than case bodies and anonymous functions
match x with 0 -> print_endline
" It 's zero ! " ; true | _ -> print_endline
" It 's not ! " ; false ; ; fun s -> print_string s ; s ; ; begin match x with 0 -> print_endline
" It 's zero ! " | _ -> print_endline
" It 's not ! " end ; print_endline " The End " ; ; case x of 0 => ( print " It 's zero !
" ; true ) | _ => ( print " It 's not !
" ; false ) ; fn s => ( print s ; s ) ; case x of 0 => print " It 's zero !
" | _ => print " It 's not !
" ; print " The End
" ;
The OCaml precedence rules favor imperative code , expecting semicolons to be used as sequencers in many places .
The SML precedence rules favor pure functional code , requiring parentheses around many places where semicolons might be used .
User - defined infix operators
Fixed precedence rules for infix operators ; curried arguments User - defined precedence rules for infix operators ; tupled arguments
let (++ ) x y = x + y + y ; ; 1 ++ 2 ; ; List.map ( (++) 1 ) [ 1 ; 2 ; 3 ] fun op ++ ( x , y ) = x + y + y ; infix 6 ++ ; 1 ++ 2 ; map ( fn x => 1 ++ x ) [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]
There is never any doubt on seeing an OCaml program about how to parse an expression that includes infix operators .
However , sometimes the inflexibility of precedences forces use of " extra " parentheses .
Curried operators make it easy to use partial applications as arguments to higher - order functions .
User - specified precedences make it easier to implement nicer - looking embedded languages .
However , infix declarations were never integrated well with the module system , meaning that client code can't import fixities from a library module .
Operators
Arithmetic operators
Different operators for arithmetic over different built - in numerical types Overloaded operators that handle several built - in numerical types
let four_int = 2 + 2 let four_float = 2.0 +. 2.0 val four_int = 2 + 2 val four_float = 2.0 + 2.0
Apparently following a " principled overloading or none at all " philosophy , OCaml breaks with a convention found in most other languages .
SML overloads the arithmetic operators in an ad - hoc way .
This has some unfortunate interactions with type inference , like inferring by default that a variable used in arithmetic has type int .
Equality
Equality works on any type but may raise run-time exceptions .
Equality types characterize valid equality arguments .
let member ( x : ' a ) ( ls : ' a list ) : bool = List.exists ( ( = ) x ) ls ; ; member 2 [ 1 ; 2 ; 3 ] ; ; member false [ true ; false ; true ] ; ; member ( fun ( ) -> ( ) ) [ fun ( ) -> ( ) ] ; ; (* Exception *) fun member ( x : '' a ) ( ls : '' a list ) : bool = List.exists ( fn y => x = y ) ls ; member 2 [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ; member false [ true , false , true ] ; member ( fn ( ) = > ( ) ) [ fn ( ) => ( ) ] ; (* Type error *)
It 's very convenient to be able to compare values for equality without having to track whether or not they 're comparable , and the lack of equality types simplifies the language .
However , run -time type errors on bad equality comparisons are no fun .
With SML , it 's clear at compile time that no equality operation will fail with a run-time type error , and the types of functions that use equality clearly state that fact , removing a need for informal documentation .
SML equality types are often criticized as a special case of type classes that ought to be replaced with that more general mechanism .
Standard libraries
Arrays vs. vectors
A single array type family Distinguishes between ( imperative ) arrays and ( functional ) vectors
Programmers used to C and its ilk do n't want to have to worry about whether or not their arrays are functional .
Isolating impure behavior as much as possible is very helpful at making programs easy to understand .
A function taking a vector as input is guaranteed not to " change " it , and the function 's type broadcasts that fact .
Currying vs. tupling
All standard library functions are curried .
Higher - order functions are usually curried , with tupling the default elsewhere .
List.iter ( output_string ch ) [ " Hello " ; " there ! " ] ; ; List.iter ( fun ( ch , s ) -> output_string ch s ) [ ( ch1 , " A " ) ; ( ch2 , " B " ) ] ; ; app ( fn s => TextIO.output ( ch , s ) ) [ " Hello " , " there ! " ] ; app TextIO.output [ ( ch1 , " A " ) , ( ch2 , " B " ) ] ;
Currying makes it easy to pass partial applications as arguments to higher - order functions .
Tupling makes it easy to treat entire function argument lists as first - class values .
Exceptions vs. option types
Most standard library functions indicate conditions like " end of file " by throwing exceptions .
Most standard library functions indicate conditions like " end of file " by returning NONE .
Using exceptions provides uniformity with other uses of exceptions to signal more traditional " error " conditions .
This choice also makes it easier to use multiple - return - status functions in situations where you know that they will encounter the common case .
Giving multiple - return - status functions option return types makes their potential behavior clear , without requiring the programmer to consult informal documentation to learn that .
Generic functions
Standard library contains generic functions that could n't be implemented in OCaml , like comparison and hashing .
Equality is the only generic function of this kind , and it 's built into the language .
1 < 2 ; ; [ 1 ; 2 ; 3 ] < [ 4 ; 5 ; 6 ] ; ; ( fun ( ) -> ( ) ) < ( fun ( ) -> ( ) ) ; ; (* Exception *) 1 < 2 ; [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] < [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] ; (* Type error *) ( fn ( ) => ( ) ) < ( fn ( ) => ( ) ) ; ; (* Type error *)
It 's very convenient to implement container structures and other functionality without having to worry about passing around comparison or hashing functions .
Some of the generic operations , like comparison , can raise run-time type errors .
SML avoids features like this whose formalization would require considerable extra work .
Mutability of strings
Strings are mutable .
Strings are immutable ( and in fact the string type is defined as a synonym for a vector type ) .
Mutating strings can be convenient .
One often performs purely functional string manipulations , and it 's useful for program understanding to have types that reflect that .
If you want mutable " strings " , use the CharArray module .
By defining strings as vectors , we avoid including another primitive base type that goes unused in many programs , like OCaml does .
Data types
Algebraic datatype constructors
Second - class constructors that duplicate some tuple functionality First - class constructors
List.map ( fun x -> Some x ) [ 1 ; 2 ; 3 ] ; ; type ( ' a , 'b ) pair = Pair of 'a * 'b ; ; match e with Pair p -> p (* Type error *) map Some [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ; datatype ( 'a , 'b ) pair = Pair of 'a * 'b ; case e of Pair p => p
This scheme is easier to compile efficiently in the absence of dataflow analysis .
However , by not treating variant constructors as functions , OCaml forces the use of wrappers as arguments to higher - order functions .
By not treating multiple arguments to constructors as tuples , OCaml creates feature overlap between variants and tuples , making it hard to convert between them .
SML avoids the two problems mentioned for OCaml .
Using dataflow analysis , SML compilers like MLton compile uses of multiple - argument constructors efficiently .
Format strings
printf - and scanf - style format strings are built into the language .
No format strings
Printf.printf " %s , %d
" " Hello " 1234 ;
Format strings have proved to be a useful enough idiom that special language support is justified .
It would go against the SML philosophy to include such a complicated type system feature that most parts of most programs would n't use .
It also turns out that SML is already sufficient to implement something almost identical to printf .
Labeled function arguments
Has them Does n't have them
let name ~ firstName ~lastName = firstName ^ " " ^ lastName ; ; name ~lastName : " Doe " ~ firstName : " John " ; ; fun name { firstName , lastName} = firstName ^ " " ^ lastName ; name {lastName = " Doe " , firstName = " John " } ;
Labeled arguments remove the need to keep track of which arguments go in which positions .
Labeled arguments complicate the language definition , and their benefits can often be attained through other means .
OCaml 's lack of anonymous record types seems to explain much of the rationale for including labeled arguments .
Mutable fields
Record fields may be marked mutable .
No concept of mutable fields
type mut_pair = {mutable x : int ; mutable y : int} ; ; let myPair = {x = 1 ; y = 2} ; myPair .x type mut_pair = {x : int ref , y : int ref} ; val myPair = {x = ref 1 , y = ref 2} ; #x myPair := 3 ;
Mutable fields make imperative programming more convenient , and they have a more natural efficient compilation strategy in the absence of dataflow analysis .
ref types are a simpler feature and can be used to implement a work - alike to mutable fields .
With dataflow analysis , SML compilers like MLton produce efficient binaries from code that uses ref s to implement mutable fields .
Optional function arguments
Has them Does n't have them
let print
It ?( prefix = " Hello , " ) s = print_endline ( prefix ^ s ) ; ; printIt " world " ; ; print It ~ prefix : " 1 " " 2 " ; ; fun printIt ( prefix , s ) = print ( Option.getOpt ( prefix , " Hello , " ) ^ s ^ "
" ) ; printIt ( NONE , " world " ) ; printIt ( SOME " 1 " , " 2 " ) ;
Optional arguments make it easy to have highly - configurable functions that can be called succinctly in the common case .
Optional arguments complicate the language definition , and their uses tend in practice to be implementable in other , not much more verbose ways .
Polymorphic variants
Has them Does n't have them
let getNum = function ` Num n ->
Some n | _ ->
None ; ; type t1 = [ `Num of int | ` Other of string ] ; ; getNum ( `Num 6 : t1 ) ; ; type t2 = [ `Num of float | ` Something of bool ] ; ; getNum ( `Num 6.0 : t2 ) ; ; datatype ( 'a , 'b ) base = Num of ' a | Rest of 'b ; type t1 = ( int , string ) base ; getNum ( Num 6 : t1 ) ; type t2 = ( real , bool ) base ; getNum ( Num 6.0 : t2 ) ;
Polymorphic variants enable greater degrees of genericity than regular variants do .
Polymorphic variants can lead to some quite confusing error messages , and static checking is a less effective bug - finder in a program that uses them .
Newcomers to OCaml often fall into using polymorphic variants by default , since they have a lower cost of entry than regular variants , even though most ML programmers agree that regular variants are more desirable when applicable .
Records
Declared , generative record types where field names can shadow others Anonymous record types
type coord = {x : int ; y : int} ; ; let addCoord c = c.x + c.y ; ; type coord ' = {x : int ; y : int} ; ; addCoord {x = 1 ; y = 2} ; ; (* Type error *) type unrelated = {x : float ; y : bool ; z : string} ; ; let myCoord = {x = 1 ; y = 2} ; ; (* Type error *) fun addCoord ( c : {x : int , y : int} ) = #x c +
#y c ; type unrelated = {x : real , y : bool , z : string} ; val myCoord = {x = 1 , y = 2} ;
By looking at just a single field of a valid record construction expression , the expression 's type is uniquely determined , which makes type inference easier compared to anonymous record types .
However , namespace management of fields can be arduous .
To use a record type declared in another module , one must either open that module or reference a field with a full path that includes the module name .
It 's also easy to unintentionally shadow a field name with a new record type declaration .
In general , anonymous record types are a lightweight feature that avoids the problems mentioned for OCaml 's records .
On the other hand , type inference for anonymous record types can be tricky , often prompting SML programmers to include type annotations on record arguments to functions or wrap record types inside single - constructor datatypes .
Recursive types
Any mutually recursive type definitions are allowed , as long as a cycle - detection algorithm accepts them .
All recursion goes through algebraic datatypes .
type 'a tree = {data : ' a ; children : ' a tree list} ; ; type 'a btree = Leaf of ' a | Node of ' a forests * ' a forests and ' a forest = ' a btree list and ' a forests = ' a forest list ; ; datatype ' a tree =
Tree of {data : 'a , children : ' a tree list} ; datatype ' a btree = Leaf of ' a | Node of ' a forests * ' a forests withtype ' a forest = ' a btree list and ' a forests = ' a btree list list ; (* Definition of forest must be substituted *)
OCaml features a single mutually - recursive type syntax , overloaded to cover synonyms , record types , and variants .
Most reasonable definitions just work .
By forcing all type recursion to go through datatype declarations , SML simplifies its formal semantics to only have to deal with recursive types " in one place , " without sacrificing any expressivity .
Pattern matching
Guards
Has them Does n't have them
let f x = function Some y when y < x -> y | _ -> 0 ; ; fun f x = fn SOME y => if y < x then y else 0 | _ =>
0 ;
These can be a significant code - space saver .
Let 's not clutter up the language definition , eh ?
You can always define a local function that you call in the several cases to which you must compile a single guard use .
" Or " patterns
Has them Does n't have them
let f = function 0 | 1 -> true | _ -> false ; ; val f = fn 0 => true | 1 => true | _ => false ;
These can be a significant code - space saver .
Let 's not clutter up the language definition , eh ?
You can always define a local function that you call in all the branches you would have lumped together with an " or " pattern .
( An SML / NJ extension allows " or " patterns . )
Modules and classes
First - class functors and signatures
Allows functors that return functors or take them as arguments , functors and signatures in modules , etc .
Does n't allow these
module F ( A : sig end ) ( B : sig end ) = struct end ; ; module M = struct module type S = sig end end ; ; functor F ( A : sig end ) ( B : sig end ) = struct end ; (* SML / NJ only *) (* No counterpart to second example *)
Both of these features have many nice uses .
It 's almost always possible to work around these omissions , and an SML / NJ extension supports higher - order functors .
Object - oriented features
Novel object system
No special features
class type counter = object ( ' self ) method get : int method set : int -> unit method inc : ' self end ; ; class myCounter init : counter = object val mutable count = init method get = count method set n = count } end ; ; let c = new myCounter 23 ; ; c#set 42 ; ; class type counter ' = object inherit counter method zero : unit end ; ; class myCounter ' init : counter ' = object ( self ) inherit myCounter init method zero = self # set 0 end ; ; datatype counter =
Counter of { get : unit -> int , set : int -> unit , inc : unit -> counter } ; (* Notice that inc 's type only reflects that _some_ * counter is returned , not necessarily " the same * type of " counter . *) fun myCounter init = let val count = ref init in Counter { get = fn ( ) => ! count , set = fn n => count := n , inc = fn ( ) => myCounter ( ! count + 1 ) } end ; val c = myCounter 23 ; case c of Counter {set , ...} => set 42 ; datatype counter ' = Counter ' of { get : unit -> int , set : int -> unit , inc : unit -> counter ' , zero : unit -> unit } ; fun myCounter ' init = let val Counter {get , set , inc} = myCounter init in Counter ' { get = get , set = set , inc = fn ( ) => myCounter ' ( get ( ) + 1 ) , zero = fn ( ) => set 0 } end ;
For some situations , objects are the clear right implementation technique , and OCaml makes them convenient to use .
Most of the individual features that go into a typical concept of " object orientation " are available separately in core ML .
The main omissions are succinct mechanisms to implement inheritance and self types .
As far as education and training go , lack of " OO " features in SML can be a blessing , since new OCaml programmers often latch onto the object system as the default means of abstraction , missing oftentimes more appropriate features in the module system and elsewhere .
open in signatures
open is allowed in signatures .
open is not allowed in signatures .
module type S = sig open M val x : t end ; ; signature S = sig val x : M.t end ;
This can save a lot of time in defining signatures that use many types defined elsewhere .
Just another feature to avoid having to include in the formal language definition !
Separate compilation conventions
Filenames imply module names
No standard separate compilation scheme
When using OCaml as a compiler , every .ml file is treated as a separate module , with its interface optionally given by a corresponding .mli file .
This usually works well , but there are some problems .
First , the " signatures " defined by .mli files are n't first - class module system signatures , so they can't be referenced anywhere else .
This means that multiple source - file - level modules can't share a signature , and that signatures must always live inside of modules .
Of course , one could always put all of his modules in a single file and avoid this problem , but splitting into files is a standard technique for facilitating good interaction with editors , source control , and so on .
There is an analogous problem for functors , leading to examples like Map .
Make in the standard library , as opposed to the work - alike BinaryMapFn in the SML / NJ library .
Candidate tools related to SML separate compilation system and project management include the SML / NJ Compilation Manager and the MLton ML Basis system .
Both of these are essentially file agnostic after all of the appropriate files have been found ( and possibly assigned some compilation flags ) , effectively concatenating the files together and imposing visibility restrictions at the module level .
Tools
Build system
Command - line tools with help generating dependency information SML / NJ's Compilation Manager ; whole - program compilation with MLton
OCaml integrates well into traditional UNIX build systems .
The ocamldep program builds dependency information for use by Makefiles , and the popular ( but separately - distributed ) OCamlMakefile ties it all together .
SML / NJ 's Compilation Manager makes it extremely easy and convenient to compile projects that do n't use much non-SML code , including integrated support for ml - lex / yacc .
It also has some namespace management features for building and packaging libraries .
Build management issues are n't that big a deal for MLton , which must compile whole programs at once , anyway .
Bytecode compiler
Included with the main distribution Present in some systems , including Moscow ML and the ML Kit
Compilation to .NET
F# starts with OCaml , drops the object system and some other features ( like parts of the module system ) , and adds .
NET - style OO that interoperates seamlessly with other .NET languages .
There is Visual Studio support as well .
Lately , there 's been a lot of hype surrounding F#. SML.NET matches most of the main advantages of F # but does n't seem to end up with as many neat experimental features .
On the other hand , unlike F# for OCaml , it implements all of Standard ML .
It also somehow can't match F# 's hype level .
Compilation to Java bytecode
. NET seems to be the managed platform of choice these days for functional programmers , and interest has shifted from MLj to SML.NET .
Debugger
Backtracking debugger Only Poly / ML includes a mature debugger .
OCaml features a debugger in the tradition of GDB , plus some novel features like backtracking .
What , you 're still using a debugger instead of unit tests ? ;-)
Extensible parsing
camlp4 extensible grammar tool integrates with OCaml compilation
No equivalent
camlp4 allows dynamic extension of grammars by adding new non-terminals , in contrast to well - known " macro systems " based around tokens or s-expressions .
Not only does caml p4 integrate with the OCaml compiler , allowing language extension along the lines of traditional macro uses , but it can also be used separately .
For instance , Coq uses campl4 to let users add new commands and tactics implemented in OCaml .
General objections about macros apply : we would like to keep it as simple as possible for both humans and programs to parse arbitrary SML programs , making it undesirable to allow customized grammar extensions .
Most common uses of macros in C and Lisp are better handled with other SML features .
Emacs modes
Foreign function interfaces
Lightweight FFI supported by added language constructs Semi-standardized No Longer Foreign Function Interface , plus MLton 's lower - level FFI for interfacing with C code directly
The FFI is relatively simple to use once you figure out linking , but the C - level view is one of specialized OCaml types instead of " native C " types .
This can make it cumbersome to interface with existing C code .
Also , the programmer needs to write the correct types for external functions manually .
The NLFFI embeds most of the C type system in SML , letting the SML compiler type - check appropriate usage and catch many nasty classes of bugs .
The ml - nlffigen program builds SML wrappers automatically from C header files .
The NLFFI tools are available for both SML / NJ and MLton , making it largely seamless to build an FFI - using project with both .
The tools take care of adapting to the compilers ' different " under the hood " conventions .
See also MLton 's lower - level FFI .
HTML documentation generation from source code
ocamldoc
Some tool is available and used to generate the Standard Basis documentation , but where is it ?
Evaluation pending more information on SML tools
Optimizing native - code compiler
Native code compiler does very little program analysis Whole - program optimizing compiler ( MLton )
OCaml has gotten by quite well by choosing an efficient base compilation strategy .
Development focus seems to be on adding new language features instead of improving compilation .
MLton is one of the best open - source optimizing compilers available .
The Computer Language Shootout has it in 7th place currently for execution speed , behind D , C , C++ , Eiffel , Pascal , and Ada compilers and just ahead of OCaml .
The Shootout only measures microbenchmarks , and MLton 's whole - program optimization can be expected to produce a marked efficiency advantage over native OCaml programs for large projects that make good use of abstraction and modularity .
Parser generators
Performance profiling
Direct profiling of execution counts for bytecode programs and indirect gprof - based profiling of time for native code programs
In MLton , direct profiling of execution counts , time , and allocation for native code programs

Source / interface browser
ocamlbrowser
No equivalent
ocamlbrowser provides a specialized GUI for navigating through OCaml code .
It 's unclear whether many people find ocamlbrowser significantly more helpful than Emacs plus highly - hyperlinked HTML documentation .
Standard library
Standard library plus several other libraries packaged with the main distribution The Standard Basis plus the SML / NJ library
Taking the SML / NJ library into account since it is now distributed with MLton as well as SML / NJ , there is no clear winner in standard library coverage between OCaml and SML .
Each has all the basics , as well as some gems that the other lacks .
Toplevel interactive system
Present Present in all SML compilers but MLton
Social factors
Community contributions to implementations
Contributions to the OCaml implementation are tightly regulated , and patches are often rejected .
Generally open community approach .
MLton 's Subversion repository allows commits by any well - established community member who asks for permission .
This aspect of OCaml philosophy seems oriented towards research projects and makes it hard to take advantage of contributions from well - meaning hackers outside the project .
ML programmers on average are quite knowledgeable and skilled at development , so it is advantageous to tap the whole community in developing implementations and standard distributions .
Cute logos
Caml has the camel : Nothing worth mentioning !
Historical roots
Historical association with theorem proving tools based on type theory and proof terms Historical association with theorem proving tools in the LCF tradition
Caml was developed to use in implementing the Coq theorem prover , as related in this account .
The ML family in general owes its origins to the LCF system .
Today , SML is associated with successors like Isabelle .
Implementation diversity
Language design
Ad -hoc process similar to most " open source programming languages " Language definition with formal semantics
OCaml picks up new features agilely , without any heavyweight standardization or formalization process needed for the entirety of the revised language before a release is made .
The language is in effect defined by some combination of the manual and the implementation .
The existence of a language definition helps language implementers keep in sync and discourages feature bloat .
The formal semantics provides a concrete starting point for formal methods .
On the other hand , these aspects discourage the adoption of new language features that the community might agree on as worthwhile .
The new Successor ML project aims to overcome this stagnation , hopefully using more agile processes in the long term .
Learning materials
Library availability
Relatively many libraries available Relatively few libraries available
OCaml has had the fundamental tools in place to be regarded as a " serious programming language " for longer than SML has , and its significantly greater number of freely available libraries today reflects that .
The Caml Hump collects links to these libraries in one place .
SML has historically been more the domain of scientists with narrow interests in programming languages and formal methods , and so fewer libraries are available in general .
However , particularly in the MLton community , this deficiency is recognized , and directed efforts are underway both to draft an enriched " standard library " and to create useful special - purpose libraries .
Packaging
Pre-built packages available for Debian Linux and many other UNIX - like systems .
MLton and SML / NJ packages available for Debian .

Firefox browser users love the myriad of third - party extensions that tweak the open - source browser 's performance , but some of the most popular of those extensions have created a security hole so wide even a newbie AOL hacker could find it and millions of Firefox users are at risk of having their browsers hijacked .
Third party extensions including the widely used toolbars from Google , Yahoo , Ask , Facebook , LinkedIn , as well as social bookmark extension from Del.icio.us and two anti-hacking add - ons , the Netcraft Anti-Phishing Toolbar and the PhishTank SiteChecker all put users at risk of having their browser infected with malicious code .
Unlike almost all of the extensions hosted at Mozilla , the foundation that created the open - source Firefox browser , these commercial extensions check for updates from servers controlled by their respective corporate overlords .
And they fail to check for extensions from servers with SSL certificates , which most users know as sites that start with https ://.
That means that users who open their browsers when using an open wireless connection are vulnerable to a hacker being able to intercept these third - party extensions ' checks for updates at a plain http :// site and then pretend to be the update server .
At lesser risk are users who have n't changed the default password on home routers , which could allow an attacker to take over the router and mess with internet packets .
Instead of sending back the new legitimate code or a message telling the extension that it is up to date , the rogue wireless connection ( or compromised router ) sends a new malicious extension that could let an attacker take over the browser and use the computer to send spam , attack other computers or steal the user 's passwords and sensitive information .
Independent security researcher Christopher Soghoian , an Indiana University student who first made a name for himself by publicizing a long - known security flaw in boarding passes , discovered the extension vulnerability using a simple packet sniffer on his own computer .
" The bitter irony here , is that by downloading an anti-phishing toolbar , you 're currently making yourself more vulnerable than if you had never downloaded it at all , " Soghoian said .
" It 's totally trivial to spot .
This is in no way a major piece of computer security research .
The work of attempting to harass the vendors into fixing the flaw has taken far more time than finding it . "
The fix is simple for both users and software vendors , according to
Soghoian .
Users should uninstall any extension they did n't download from the official Mozilla add - ons page .
Extensions served from that page all use Mozilla 's free https :// connection .
For their part , software vendors need only to update their extension update servers with a valid
SSL certificate so the extension can check an https :// site .
Since the encryption check requires substantially more computing power than a non-encrypted call , companies with hundreds of thousands or millions of extension users might also need to add extra servers to handle the greater load .
He notes that one security extension , the McAfee SiteAdvisor add - on that warns users when they are about to visit a site known to host untrustworthy downloads or malicious code , correctly uses an https ://
extension for updates .
UPDATE : Reader Johnny writes in the comments that the SiteAdvisor add - on is actually not safe :
Unlike the research suggests , McAfee SiteAdvisor is actually worse than any of these other major extensions .
It periodically downloads completely unauthenticated code from McAfee 's server , which it then executes with the same privileges as your browser .
Not only does this backdoor allow McAfee to do whatever they please with your computer , but a hacker can run any malicious code on your system without you ever noticing by simply spoofing the URL http://www.siteadvisor.com/download/safe/safe.js
/ UPDATE
Soghoian announced the exploit 45 days after he first disclosed it to Google , Mozilla ,
Yahoo and Facebook .
Mozilla fixed a vulnerable co-branded Ebay / Firefox extension in two days , according to Soghoian .
After a flurry of emails to Google , where Soghoian interned last summer , Google told him that it would likely have a fix for the problem before he announced it .
Soghoian says his disclosure is in keeping with widely accepted code of conduct for security researchers , which allows them to disclose vulnerabilities to users after giving the vendors time to solve the problem .
Soghoian also points out that extensions served from Mozilla 's servers are forbidden from automatically updating .
Instead a user is shown that an update is available and given the choice of installing it or not .
Google Toolbar , for one , skips that step and automatically installs the new code .
" My suspicion is that Google / Yahoo 's extension teams never asked their security teams their opinion , " Soghoian told Wired News .
" Google has one of the OpenSSL developers on staff .
Had they asked him ' Hey , we 're going to silently update our customers with code we download from a non-SSL connection .
What do you think of that ? , ' he or any other security professional would have shot it down instantly . "
UPDATE 2 : Del.icio.us writes in via the comments to say it 's most recent version of it's extension has never been vulnerable and that the old version has been updated as well .
Also Mozilla chimes in on its blog .
More on the vulnerability from Ryan Naraine and Brian Krebs .

Archaeologists believe this is the podium of Herod 's tomb
After a search of more than 30 years , Ehud Netzer of the Hebrew University says he has located the tomb at Herodium , a site south of Jerusalem .
Herod was noted in the New Testament for his Massacre of the Innocents .
Told of Jesus ' birth , Herod ordered all boys under two in Bethlehem to be killed , the Gospel of Matthew said .
According to the New Testament , Joseph was warned of the threat in a dream and fled with his wife and the child to Egypt .
Limestone fragments
" When I realised it was the tomb there was great happiness , " said Prof Netzer , who has worked at the Herodium site since 1972 .
WHO WAS HEROD ?
Roman - appointed King of Judea from around 37 BC to 4 BC A bloody ruler who killed political rivals Ordered the Massacre of Innocents to protect his throne , the New Testament says Behind ambitious building projects including expanding Second Jewish Temple and walls around Jerusalem
" Everyone has an interest in the Holy Land and Herod 's tomb is part of that story . "
It was an ancient staircase built for Herod 's funeral procession - described in detail by First Century historian Josephus Flavius - that led Prof Netzer 's team to the hill - top burial site .
" The monumental stairs were built specifically for the funeral , " Prof Netzer said .
At the site , archaeologists found a smashed limestone sarcophagus that , when whole , would have been around 2.5 m ( 8 ft ) long .
Ornate rosette decorations on the fragments alerted the team to the coffin's significance .
No bones were found at the site .
Prof Netzer said that they had likely been removed by Jewish rebels who fought against Rome between 66 and 72 AD .
The site at Herodium is in the West Bank , occupied by Israel since 1967 .
Palestinians officials have in the past complained about what they see as the theft and commercial exploitation of their artefacts .
Major find
If the find is confirmed , this will rank as a major archaeological discovery , BBC Jerusalem correspondent Tim Franks says .
Experts have always believed that Herod was buried somewhere within the palace complex he had constructed on a flattened hilltop in the Judean desert , but they had repeatedly struggled to find any evidence to back up their theories .
Herod was appointed " King of the Jews " by the Roman authorities and ruled Judea from 37 BC until his death in around 4 BC .
He is known for his expansion of the Second Jewish Temple and the construction of walls around the Old City of Jerusalem .
He also built the fortress of Masada , which became the last stand of Jewish rebels in 73 AD .
Did you know that for years
Google has been keeping a record of every search you do ?
And did you know they 're now associating your search history with your Google login for other services like Gmail , Calendar , and the like ?
Surprise !
It 's Search History .
And now it 's being used to personalize your search results
I do n't like Google aggregating this data about me .
It is possible to opt out .
You can turn off search history recording in the settings page .
You can also edit your history , including removing it entirely .
It 's still unclear to me exactly when Google started recording these histories under account names .
Six tech savvy friends I asked all found they had some sort of history on Google going back as far as eighteen months .
Only half of them remember having turned on some personalization feature that would have resulted in that history being collected .
A seventh friend who is scrupulous about cookies and logins had no history .
He regrets that his privacy concerns keep him from using Google Reader .
I believe search history defaults on for new accounts , so 99 % of Google users will have this feature .
Probably 98 % of them wo n't even know that their every search is being recorded , associated with their name .

FOR most of this year , South - East Asian countries have worried that the strength of their currencies is making their exports pricey at a time when the economy of America , their biggest trading partner , is looking weak .
The dollar 's recent fall has only made things worse .
Thailand 's baht has been especially strong of late , and its central bank has twice — in early November and early December — introduced measures to discourage speculation .
They did not work so , on Monday December 18th , as the baht briefly touched its highest level in over nine years , the central bank announced draconian restrictions on currency trading .
However , on Tuesday the authorities were forced to beat an embarrassing retreat after their measures triggered a rout on the Bangkok stockmarket and sent shockwaves across Asia .
Under the first version of the rules , anyone selling more than $ 20,000 - worth of foreign currency , other than for the purposes of trade , would have had to deposit 30 % of it with the central bank — at zero interest — for one year , or forfeit one - third of the deposit .
They certainly had the desired effect on the baht , which dropped around 2 % on Tuesday .
But the panic they caused among stockmarket investors was surely unintended .
The resulting plunge in share prices was worse even than anything seen in the 1997 Asian economic crisis .
At one point , Bangkok 's SET index had lost almost one - fifth of its value .
It closed almost 15 % down , at its lowest level in two years .
On Tuesday evening , the government , heeding the stockmarket 's squeals , backed off and said that stockmarket investments would be exempted from the currency controls , though not other non-trade investment .
The Bangkok market 's fall prompted selling in other emerging markets , especially in Asia : Indian and Indonesian shares fell by almost 3 % , the Singaporean and Malaysian markets lost around 2 % and ripples were also felt in the Philippines and Hong Kong .
Though there was no indication that other countries intended to follow Thailand 's lead , its move was bound to provoke worries that the trend towards market liberalisation , seen since the 1997 crisis , could go into reverse .
The military - appointed interim government that has been running Thailand since September 's coup has pledged to maintain free - market policies but the currency restrictions , whatever the justification for them , run counter to such promises .
Only a few hours before announcing the climbdown , the finance minister , Pridiyathorn Devakula , predicted that shares would quickly rebound .
Some analysts were , however , forecasting that the stockmarket would fall further .
On Wednesday , shares recouped some of their losses but the reputation of the interim government was left in tatters by the fiasco .
The confusion over the currency restrictions is not the only thing to give potential investors in Thailand pause for thought .
An investigation into Shin Corp , the telecoms business sold to a Singaporean government agency by the deposed prime minister , Thaksin Shinawatra , has raised doubts about the legal status of many foreign - owned firms in Thailand .
Tesco , a British retailer , has been pressured to slow its
Thai expansion drive , following protests by small shopkeepers .
Above all , it is still unclear how stable and how market - friendly a government will emerge once elections are held , around a year from now .
It is ironic that Thailand has felt obliged to punish currency speculators just a few days after Malaysia 's former prime minister , Mahathir Mohamad , met and publicly forgave George Soros , the currency trader he had personally blamed for the ringgit 's collapse in the wake of the 1997 crisis .
Mr Mahathir responded to that collapse by pegging the currency to the dollar ( a measure which was only lifted last year ) and introducing strict capital controls — measures seen as unorthodox at the time but since credited with helping Malaysia recover .
The tenth anniversary of the Asian crisis is approaching but , despite the jitters caused by Thailand 's currency restrictions , there are also plenty of reasons for investors to feel reassured that a similar regionwide meltdown is unlikely .
Thailand and its neighbours are these days running strong current - account surpluses , their public finances are mostly in good order and they have hefty foreign - exchange reserves with which to defend themselves from speculative attacks .
Their banking systems — one of the main concerns in 1997 — have since been largely cleaned up .
Even so , ill - chosen or poorly explained policies can do damage — especially if the authorities lose further credibility by being forced to backtrack on them .
The aim of the Thai central bank 's new controls was to ease exporters ' discomfort and preserve the country 's attractions to export - oriented industries .
But they seem , so far at least , to have created uncertainty and fear , and thus risk undermining investment at a time when the competition from China , India and an also - rising Vietnam , is getting stronger .

GrandCentral is a brilliant new web app that lets you consolidate all of your phone numbers into one number , meaning someone can call you on your GrandCentral phone number and all of your phones ( cell phone , work phone , home phone ) will ring .
And then it gets interesting .
Advertisement
If you do n't want every one of your phones ringing each time someone calls your free GrandCentral number , you can set rules by friends , family , work , and others , defining where the calls should be directed .
When a user leaves a message , you can listen to it online or directly on your phone .
The remaining set of features on GrandCentral are a little mind - blowing , in that " I 'd never thought of that , but how am I now living without it ? " sort of way .
When you pick up a call that 's been forwarded with GrandCentral , you can choose to answer it , send it to voicemail ( which will be done automatically if you do n't answer ) , or send it to voicemail and listen in on the message as it's being left in real time ( just like you 're listening to someone leave a message on an answering machine ) .
You can interrupt a " ListenIn " message at any time and join the conversation by pressing star (* ) .
Advertisement
If you 're on a call and you decide that you want to record your conversation , just hit 4 at any time .
You can also record personalized greetings based on contact groups and upload your own MP3s to be played in place of your ring .
All of this can be done with GrandCentral 's free account , though there are a few limitations to the free account ( none of which severely hinders the service ) .
As you can tell , after spending the morning playing around with it , I 'm pretty impressed with this service .
The only problem I 've had with GrandCentral so far is that making calls from the online interface ( which , similar to Jajah , connects to your phone , then the phone of the person you 're calling ) ; it seems like a simple part of the functionality , but who knows - maybe I 'm doing something wrong ( I 'm not ) .
Advertisement
I 'm not ready to tell all of my contacts to start calling my GrandCentral number just yet , but I may in time .
If you give it a try , let us know what you think about it in the comments .
Thanks Nick !

Boy gets a proper burial for his stillborn sister 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
All eyes focused on the tiny casket that 11 - year - old Roger Holloway and his three young cousins carried somberly at a Waller cemetery .
When the boys reached their intended destination , they gently placed the white fiberglass box on a stand .
Then they adorned it with flowers , stuffed animals and a baby blanket .
About 15 adults were on hand Thursday to witness the event that Roger had dreamed of offering his infant sister — a proper burial at a cemetery near his home , complete with a tombstone bearing the name he had given her .
Although the Hockley fifth - grader 's wish might seem basic in the name of all that is decent , his story is anything but ordinary .
Roger assumed those responsibilities after his sister 's body had remained in the morgue at the Harris County Medical Examiner 's Office for almost a year .
The infant , who had been known only as " Fetus Girl Holloway , " was stillborn last May as a result of her mother 's illegal drug use .
The 31 - week fetus — a well - developed female with a full head of hair — might have ended up in a pauper 's cemetery far from Hockley had her brother not objected , authorities said .
The baby 's father could not be located , and the children 's 33 - year - old mother has struggled with a drug addiction for the past two years , staying away from home for months at a time , loved ones said .
So Roger , who did not know of his mother 's pregnancy until it was over , gave the tiny girl a name — Rachel — and sought to have her buried within walking distance of his home or school .
The boy 's determination and persistence set the case apart from those typically seen at the Harris County Social Services Department , which has the task of burying the indigent and unclaimed .
" I think this is amazing , " said Virginia Stebbins , one of the department 's bereavement counselors , who sought help from other agencies to help Roger realize his goal .
" I 'm looking at greatness ...
So many times we deal with people who do n't want to be involved with their loved ones ' funerals . "
Help from donors
Donors helped Roger achieve his mission since his grandmother , who is raising him , could not afford the expense of a private burial .
The boy had refused to let his sister be buried in the Harris County Cemetery because it is 49 miles from his home .
Earlier this week , the board of St. John 's Lutheran Church agreed to let Rachel be buried in its Waller cemetery just down the street from Roger 's school .
The 11 - year - old , who has long been aware of his mother 's drug addiction , never saw his sister in person but took the baby 's death hard .
Perhaps it was because his own father died when he was just a year old .
Maybe it was because of his mother 's long absences from home or because he never had a sibling before .
Whatever the reason , he resolved to keep his sister close .
" Since my dad died , I never got to know him , " the boy said after Thursday 's graveside service .
" And since my sister died , I never got to know her either .
The good thing is she 's with God and my dad in heaven , and she 's going to rest in peace . "
The pastor presiding over Thursday 's service told mourners Rachel had an impact , although she never had a chance to enjoy life .
" She reminded us of our need for one another , " St. John 's Lutheran Church pastor Edd Wunderlich told mourners .
" She brought us together today when it would have been so easy to forget . "
Roger 's mother , whose name is not being published at the family 's request , was unable to attend Thursday 's service since she is undergoing a 30 - day drug- rehabilitation program in a Houston hospital .
But she told her son by telephone that she is proud of him and asked for his forgiveness , he said .
" She 's asking me if I can ever forgive her for what she 's done , " Roger said .
" I told her , yeah , I can forgive her .
She messed up , but she 's still my mom , and I love her . "
' Truly a little man '
One of many donors who came together to make the service happen , John Hamilton , chief executive officer of the Option 1 Realty Group in Katy , promised Thursday that he will pay for flowers for years to come so Roger can decorate his sister 's grave every week until he becomes an adult .
" I will definitely take care of her , OK ? "
Hamilton told the boy , who hugged him in gratitude .
Chronicle readers also showed an outpouring of support for Roger .
The boy 's plight " reminded me no matter how hard life seems , it could be worse , " wrote one reader , Chris Choate , of La Porte .
" This boy has struggled for most of his short life , and at such a young age , he is truly a little man . "

15 . “ I ’ve got a bad feeling about this . ”
When to say it :
When you get a bad feeling , obviously
Had Han
Solo been the only character to speak this line in the entire series , it definitely would have been much higher on the list .
In reality , sadly , the line is present in every single Star Wars film , thus downplaying its importance as a method of character development , instead turning it into a device that allows George Lucas to wink at the audience .
It ’s a cute line , but it ’s not distinctly Han Solo .

Granted , this is a Star Wars quote which will almost immediately get recognized as a Star Wars quote -- hopefully , you ’ll never find yourself in a real life situation where you have to use the term “ weapons malfunction . ”
Still , though , if you ’ve got to go through the typically banal “ wait , you ’re breaking up – can you hear me ? ” conversation with a friend over your phone , why not throw in a Han Solo quote for good measure ?
Pretty much everything Harrison
Ford says in the series is gold – in everyday life , one should always be searching for methods , no matter how forced , to speak the words of Han Solo .

This particular quote wo n’t make you look particularly cool or Han Solo-ish , but if you use this quote on someone and they recognize it as what Han yells to Chewie at the beginning of Empire Strikes Back , marry them .
Immediately .
Does n’t matter what gender they are .
12 . “ Great , kid .
Do n’t get cocky . ”
When to say it :
When a friend accomplishes something
As much as you like your friends , you ca n’t give them too much credit : genuine enthusiasm from one friend to another is generally a trait only shared by women , and Han Solo is decidedly not a woman ( in fact , his penis could probably break concrete ) .
You can only use this line ( or lines like it ) for only so long towards your friends – one must be careful to stay in the realm of “ lovable asshole ” and not crossover into “ outright asshole ” territory .
You want your friends to stay your friends , regardless of how much you may want to mock their accomplishments .
11 . “ Never tell me the odds ! ”
When to say it :
When gambling
If anything , a decision to not know the odds when gambling seems like lunacy .
Logic would dictate that if you bet on a boxing match , you ’d damn well better know the spread , right ?
Well , not if you want to look like a bad - ass , you do n’t .
Refusing to hear the odds when gambling is so blatant a mistake , so obvious a screw - up , that the other gamblers around you will have no choice but to seriously consider what you hope to accomplish by insulating yourself from the odds .
Some of the more nervous men , influenced by your steadfast refusal to play by the rules , may change their bets .
Their changed bets will influence others to change bets , and , before you know it , your one line of Han Solo dialogue has completely reversed the spread .
And if , by chance , your boxer of choice should actually win , then you will be viewed as a gambling prodigy – a man with an unconventional , unbeatable system who knows exactly what he is doing .
And as is the case with so many of these Han quotes , seeming to know what you ’re doing is a lot more important than actually knowing what you ’re doing .
10 . “ Yeah , I ’ll bet you have . ”
When to say it :
When an intergalactic bounty hunter tells you he ’s been waiting a long time to bring you in
But after you say it , MAKE SURE TO SHOOT FIRST .
Even if you somehow manage to “ dodge ” his blaster shot and return fire in self - defense , it will look nowhere near as cool as if you ’d just taken the initiative and blasted the sonofabitch before he knew what hit him .
Honestly , what kind of moron would even consider not having Han shoot first ?
9 . “ Here ’s where the fun begins . ”
When to say it :
When you ’re about to enter a dangerous situation
The purposes of this quote are twofold : firstly , it gives a greater sense of gravitas to whatever situation you are about to undertake .
Even if it ’s something as simple as getting called to your boss ’s office , or taking an off - road shortcut on the way home , this quote alone will make the event seem much more dramatic and cool .
Secondly , having made the event seem much cooler and more dangerous than it actually is , this quote will make the speaker seem that much more skilled , self - assured and bad-ass in the context of the event .
8 . “ You know , sometimes I amaze even myself . ”
When to say it : Anytime
This is pretty much the catch - all arrogant wise - ass phrase to use whenever you do something worthy of congratulation .
And if you consider yourself an arrogant wise - ass , then everything you do is worthy of congratulation .
7 . “ What an incredible smell you ’ve discovered ! ”
When to say it :
Anytime you smell something awful
When showing disgust , one has to show repulsion and righteous indignation without seeming like a complete and utter pansy , which is where this quote comes into play .
Han is obviously not happy that Leia convinced him to jump down a garbage chute , but at the same time , he ’s not running around , whining and crying over the fact that he ’s knee - deep in human fecal matter .
The “ incredible smell ” line serves as the perfect balance of arrogant irritation and bad - ass indifference to use when someone lets out a particularly gruesome fart .
6 . “ Laugh it up , fuzzball . ”
When to say it :
When a fat / hairy person laughs at you
Again : not outright whiny and confrontational , but this line lets everyone know that you mean business and that you ’re tired of their crap .
Nobody would dare ignore an insult as unconventional - yet - harsh as “ fuzzball , ” but they also would n’t start a fight over it .
5 . “ Wonderful girl .
Either I ’m going to kill her , or I ’m beginning to like her . ”
When to say it :
When talking about a woman you ’re attracted to
It ’s okay to show attraction to a woman , but not unqualified attraction .
It ’s okay to show that you would very much like to date a girl you ’ve just met , but only so long as you remember to state that you do n’t really like her that much .
Guys who show unqualified attraction to potential mates usually end up as the schmoes who get screwed over when push comes to shove ( “ push , ” in this case , being a synonym for “ woman , ” while “ shove ” is a synonym for “ musician ” ) .
Not to mention that if the girl hears you use this line , her curiosity will be piqued : why does he like me ?
Why does he want to kill me ?
Such curiosity will lead her to talk to you more frequently in a teasing attempt to get you to reveal what you really think about her .
So long as you never reveal the truth , the teasing will make way for flirting , and the flirting will more than likely make way for astounding amounts of unprotected sex .
4 . “ How we doin ’ ? ”
“ Same as always . ”
“ That bad , huh ? ”
When to say it :
When asking someone about their day
Ah , world - weariness .
The idea that you ’ve seen everything , done everything and had sex with everything , and yet you still consider life to be generally disappointing and awful .
When using a quote like this , people will wonder why you ’re so world - weary , and , if you do n’t tell them , you ’ll seem to have some sort of dark and mysterious past that you never talk about , despite the reality that you spent most of your childhood eating Cheetos and watching Thundercats .
Is there a more wonderfully cynical , yet strangely attractive worldview to have ?
I think not .
3 . “ I 've seen a lot of strange stuff , but I 've never seen anything to make me believe there 's one all - powerful force controlling everything .
There 's no mystical energy field controls my destiny . ”
When to say it : During a debate on religion
It does n’t matter if you actually believe in God ; you have to use this quote in a debate on religion .
It ’s specific and useful enough to not necessarily seem like a Star Wars quote , and it ’s got just the right amount of pseudo - philosophy and world - weary ranting to make you seem infinitely cooler than the other person in the debate .
Yeah , you ’ve been around .
You ’ve seen the world .
You know what it has to offer .
And , you know what ?
None of it impresses you .
You are in charge of your life .
God ?
Psh .
Who needs him ?
Granted , after the debate is done you may need to go home and pray for twenty straight minutes as a method of apologizing to your deity of choice , but the important thing is that , to the guy you argued against , you look like a total bad - ass who remains completely unafraid of Jehovah ’s wrath .
“ Hey …it ’s me ! ”
2 .
When to say it :
When someone tells you to “ be careful ”
Who are they to doubt you ?
Hey , it ’s you !
If you were n’t the careful , clever guy you were , you ’d be dead by now .
You do n’t need expressions of worry – you ’re too cool for that .
Admittedly , right after Han says this in ROTJ he steps on a twig and alerts every stormtrooper in the vicinity to his presence , but ignore that for now .
1. “ I love you . ”
“ I know . ”
When to say it : Duh
If you use this line at least once in your lifetime , you can die a happy man .
It is the epitome of everything Han Solo stands for : cocky and bad -ass , yet sincere .
It ’s rumored that George Lucas ( though he did n’t direct Empire Strikes Back , or even write its screenplay ) wanted Han to tell Leia that he “ loved her too , ” but Harrison Ford demanded that the current version of the line we all adore so very much .
Solo ’s final line to Leia before getting his shit carbonite - frozen is , bar - none , the greatest moment in the entire Star Wars saga .
Not to mention that if you use this line on a woman who is legitimately expressing love for you , it will drive her nuts .
If there ’s one thing women love – other than musicians – it ’s having strong feelings for someone who does n’t reciprocate them ( especially if the person in question is a musician ) .
If you respond to “ I love you ” with “ I love you , too , ” you ’re essentially begging the woman to lose interest in you .
Making an arrogant , not - quite reciprocation of that love that hints at possible affection without outright stating it is the most intelligent thing you can possibly do ; it keeps the mystery up , it keeps you in control and you keep your dignity intact .
Han Solo knows this .
That ’s why he ’s Han Solo .

Heading north of the border to save money on production costs and take advantage of good crews and proximity to the visual effects house Hybrid , the movie was “ shot it in Montreal , which I know instantaneously brings to mind ancient Greece for a lot of people , with the harsh winters and French and all that , ” quips Snyder , noting that his 61 - day shoot finished on schedule in January 2006 .
With a couple of minor exceptions , the entire film was shot indoors , against a blue screen .
Cinematographer Larry Fong devised an efficient method combining overhead and key lighting that made for faster , more efficient shooting — it allowed the perspective to change by turning the simply reversing the lighting : all lights were pre-mounted , so it was a matter of flipping a switch and then some tweaks .
Because all the backgrounds were added later , neither the camera nor the actors had to move .
This disoriented actors , “ because they did n’t know where they were half the time , but because it was so physical , they eventually forgot about the blue screen , ” notes Snyder .

Chris Watts , the Visual Effect Supervisor over a department of 17 , and another 500 artists working in graphics facilities around the world , faced the challenge of creating a three - dimensional version of Miller ’s world and adding elements that were n’t in his novel that would remain true to it .
“ They say that art is never finished , it ’s expanded , and there ’s definitely a huge element of that in this movie .
I ’ve done a lot of movies with a lot of shots and a lot of movies with difficult shots but had never done a movie with twice as many shots that were difficult , ” states Watts , whose credits include Gattaca , Waterworld , The Day After Tomorrow , Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , Corpse Bride , The Fog and Pleasantville .
Watts , one of the first hired on the film and the last to leave when post - production was completed in January 2007 , dealt with the logistics of 1300 effects shots and the limitations of shooting an epic on a soundstage .
“ In the battle scenes , if you wanted to have someone walking from far away right up to the camera , you could n’t actually put them far enough away — there was n’t enough stage space for the amount of time they ’d be walking to cover the necessary distance , ” Watts explains .
“ So we ’d shoot elements and delay them in time and filled up the back space with CG people .
We had hundreds of shots of digital people and even more with real people composited in , because we could n’t afford digital people in every shot .
You try to do things as efficiently as possible because there ’s always something that comes up that you ’re not expecting and you do n’t want to have to say no to a director . ”
“ On " Pleasantville , " we had one terabyte of disc space for the whole thing .
Now I have 16 terabytes on my desktop .
We ’re an all - Mac department and I have 15 G5s .
Most of the compositing is done on Shake or Inferno , ” says Watts , who needed that capacity to handle elements like fake water .
“ I shot a little bit of ocean off the Santa Monica Pier and we used that for two shots but most of it was digital water . ”
A German company , Scanline , digitally created all the elements of a scene showing Persian boats crashing against rocks .
For another scene , depicting a burning village , “ We shot one burning building from a lot of angles and smoke and put that together in an amazing sequence . ”
" " The view that greets the Spartans and their allies as they reach the Hot Gates is the vast Persian fleet approaching the Greek coast .

Scenes involving horses were particularly complicated .
“ In the first battle scene , ” Watts relates , “ we had the riders ride the horses up to the edge of the blue screen and skid to a stop .
That was a challenge we got around through clever editing and a convincing backdrop . ”
But the Persian messenger ‘s ride over the hill to Sparta actually had to be shot outdoors .
“ We could n’t get the horses running fast enough [ otherwise ] , ” says Snyder .
He was intent on having a real feel to " 300 " despite the artificial setting .
“ I did n’t want the movie to look like it was made in a computer , like ' Polar Express . '
The movie was shot on film .
We added grain and lens flares because I wanted it to feel rough .
It ’s very organic - feeling . ”

With spurting showers of blood and no less than three decapitations , 300 earned an R rating for its stylized violence , described by producer Deborah Snyder , the director ’s wife , as a “ ballet of death . ”
But according to Watts , “ We shot with very little actual blood because we had a limited production schedule and shooting with blood can really multiply your shooting time by a lot , and we did n’t want to have a lot of photorealistic blood in the movie — it would have gotten us an NC - 17 .
So [ Grant Freckleton , the VFX art director ] designed what we call 2 - D blood : we splattered coffee onto napkins , photographed it and did some digital processes on it .
We shot a lot of blood as elements against blue screen to comp in but we used very little of it because at the end of the day the 2 - D blood looked a lot more like the comic book and we could use a lot more of it without agitating the ratings board .
The makeup people kept asking me when we were going to use blood .
They had gallons of fake blood but we never used it . ”
On set , Watts coordinated with the set design and costume departments to prevent problems .
Costume designer Michael Wilkinson “ showed me one particular fabric that was beautiful but when you bent it , it developed this blue sheen on the edges so we got rid of it .
It would n’t have worked against the blue screen . ”
Blue screen , rather than green , was chosen for several reasons .
“ We have a lot of red in the movie , and sometimes when you have saturated red on a green screen you often have edge problems , where you get a yellow edge .
It has to do with the way light travels through film and interacts with the emulsion layers , ” explains Watts .
“ Also , the amount of light that bounces back off a blue screen vs. a green screen is different .
The green bounces back a little more light , and we would have ended up with screens that were a little brighter than I like to shoot them .
Some say that the color of the spills that come off a blue screen are less objectionable than those that come off a green screen . ”
Whatever the background color , it took some getting used to for the actors .
“ You need every bit of your brain that you can use to imagine because there ’s nothing around , just blue walls .
You have to imagine with full concentration , ” offers Santoro .
We 'll look at the task of costuming the heroes as well as the original myth of the Spartans in the next section .
As for the fact that most abortions are performed early in pregnancy , and the majority ’s assertion that alternatives to the prohibited procedure are available for later in pregnancies , Justice Ginsburg said adolescents and indigent women have more trouble obtaining an abortion early , so today ’s ruling could put them at a disadvantage .
Justice Ginsburg also took issue with language in the law finding a “ consensus ” that the banned procedure is never necessary .
But the majority said disagreements within the medical community constituted no obstacle to the 2003 law .
“ The court has given state and federal legislatures wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is medical and scientific uncertainty , ” Justice Kennedy wrote .
“ Medical uncertainty does not foreclose the exercise of legislative power in the abortion context any more than it does in other contexts . ”
Today ’s decision gave the anti-abortion forces what they had hoped for with the more conservative makeup of the high court since Justice Alito replaced Justice Sandra Day O’Connor .
Abortion opponents are sure to be pleased by some of the language in Justice Kennedy ’s opinion , including his observation that “ the government may use its voice and its regulatory authority to show its profound respect for the life within the woman . ”
The ruling is surely not the last word on abortion , either legally or politically , and it immediately reflected the deep divides that have long characterized the issue .
Republicans praised the decision , while Democrats denounced it .
“ I applaud the court ’s decision to uphold the ban on partial - birth abortion , ” said Senator Mel Martinez of Florida , chairman of the Republican National Committee , adding that the ruling “ spoke highly of society ’s core values to protect the sanctity of life . ”
President Bush called the ruling “ an affirmation of the progress we have made over the past six years in protecting human dignity and upholding the sanctity of life . ”
When gap - year travellers email home , they mean to calm the fears of anxious parents .
But these glimpses of hair - raising adventures in faraway lands can have the opposite effect - as this selection from Simon Hoggart and Emily Monk 's new book shows
· To say we were held hostage would be overshooting the mark , although technically it 's true .
We all went to get the 11 am bus into Ghorabi [ in Nepal ] , and as we approached the place where the bus sits and waits we were surrounded by six men , none older than us , brandishing 1960s Kalashnikov rifles .
They told us to sit down ( we did ) and that we were not allowed to leave until the rally , which we had inadvertently stumbled upon , was finished .
It was scary : they were painfully young and they had guns which they chose to point at us .
So for four hours we sat and listened and watched while these Maoists preached their message to the masses .
After the initial fear wore off , it simply became a bit boring .
When it was finished we walked home , and that was that .
· So we agreed with this blokey to do a film that would involve being put up in a five - star hotel for two nights in a place outside Mumbai . . . sounds too good to be true .
Actually lots of people we 've met have done similar things , so we thought we would give it a shot .
Except it was too good to be true .
He picked us up in the evening and drove us to this random area in the suburbs to get a luxury bus .
Along the way we learned that it was n't a film , but a real marriage where we had to meet and greet the guests - not as attractive to us as a film , especially when he said we had to particularly greet the young men .
Then the luxury Volvo coach with air - con , TV and reclining seats turned out to be a dodgy minivan parked down a back alley .
Decided there was no chance we'd be getting on that bus and jumped into the nearest taxi , with the guy running after us telling the taxi driver not to drive off .
· Esfahan is a tourist city without any tourists .
I went to a beautiful medieval mosque one afternoon .
It had had six visitors that day . . . one day I went to use the computers in the slick new library and decided to make use of the lavatories in the basement .
My Farsi is n't up to much , so I went to a bathroom and , seeing it was empty , presumed it would be all right to make use of it .
Imagine my horror as I squatted away in a cubicle and heard the chatter of some women .
In Iran , one of the most sensitive countries on this issue , I was making use of the ladies ' loo .
Chances are , if you get caught doing something like that , you get your hands chopped off .
And Iranian ladies are just like ladies in Europe or America .
Once they get chatting there 's no stopping them .
So I was trapped for half an hour , praying that nobody would knock on the door of my cubicle .
· We arrived at the most fantastic hotel [ in Arequipa , Peru ] with en-suite bathrooms , high ceilings , balconies , sheets and bedside lights being the star attractions , and slept like logs on Night Nurse , stirring from sweet slumber only once , when the earthquake struck .
Panic not , mother .
After the initial confusion I fell back to sleep straight away and woke up in the best of health , regardless of gaping cracks in the walls and pavements !
· We waited for a couple of hours on a boat in a scene which could n't have been more Jaws - like .
Then a 10 - 12ft mako shark turned up , and though not a Great White was definitely Jaws - looking , especially when the captain was pulling the fish away from it and it came out of the water .
The cage was bouncing around in the water and you had to be careful not to put your hand through the cage when you were holding on , it was fantastic !
· Well , I got mugged again , trying to get across eight lines of traffic from Cinelandia to the Modern Art Museum in the pouring rain .
He did have a knife , but he was n't particularly threatening , and he let me open my wallet and give him the notes , rather than taking everything , which would have been a pain .
It 's OK .
I 'm used to it now .
· I know it is v dull to talk about the weather , but it is MINUS 30 degrees today [ in northern Russia ] , so I think I am allowed .
All my shampoo on my shelf etc freezes every night and children are n't allowed to go to school because they walk too slowly and tend to freeze to death before they get there .
Nice .
I am slightly worried as I walk at the speed of a lobotomised snail , there is five inches of ice on the roads and my new boots have strayed far from their natural habitat ( the wilds of High St Ken ) .
On the first day of unbelievable iciness I happily stepped outside and within minutes my mascara had frozen my eyelids closed and my nostrils had iced over .
After another few minutes I lost all feeling in my extremities , so by the time I reached the Institute I could n't see , smell or feel .
I walk so slowly that I am often overtaken by octogenarian babushkas shuffling along in felt slippers with massive sacks of turnips on their backs .
Every day Ludmilla smugly informs me that it is another 10 degrees colder than the day before and happily tells me how to notice the first stages of frostbite .
· My fellow volunteers [ in West Africa ] have branded me the " poshest person " they have ever met , but apparently it was " not meant in a ' derogatorily ' way " .
Well , at least I do n't make up words .
Everyone is actually ace , give or take a few slightly annoying girls .
I have taken to dropping my Ts when I speak and saying " you ge ' me ' " a lot .
I also spend a lot of time talking about my stressful summer jobs etc .
( Does Daddy getting me work , and Cowes week count ? )
· Tracey , my flatmate ( the semi- professional boxer who keeps a knife by her bed ) , has been sent home [ from the ski resort ] .
She toppled down the mountain the other day .
I now find myself living with just Peta , the 20 - year - old bisexual , dress size 22 .
I have , however , established that she does not see me " in that way " so it 's all quite chummy .
I ply her with leftover brownies , which keeps her sweet .
· Dear Mummy and Daddy , how are you ?
This may come as a shock but I am thinking of eloping with one of my students to Assam coz he is from the Naga tribe , and I want to be a Naga girl and go hunting monkeys with bows and arrows and fishing with spears like they do , and then come back and do tribal dancing all night , coz it 's so much fun , and all the tribal people here are so great and brave and strong .
Obviously the political situation in Assam is n't ideal , but I 'll be OK .
Love you lots .
Only an idea at the moment .
X , Me
· Going travelling this weekend with five boys .
Am making everyone share one bed under the false pretence that it 's budgeting .
It 's actually because I can't not pull if there are five of them .
Can I ? ( That was a joke , in case you did n't get the sarcasm .
I am not a slut . )
· The local culture in Auckland is " kandi " .
It 's a drug that is very similar to ecstasy , with one major exception - it 's completely legal .
I figured that as they were legal they could n't be that strong , so I ignored the warning not to exceed four pills per week and took 12 in one night . . .
· After I left the internet place we went to do a shop in the supermarket and we walked in to find that a man was putting up a sign ( well , that 's what we thought ) .
He was actually holding down a rat with the sign and another guy was hitting it with a broom to try and kill it .
Lovely !!!! . . .
Had a freak - out on Wednesday as saw a tarantula in the house - huge bloody thing , so hairy and gross .
So typically it would be a day for creepy - crawlies - two more spiders on the walls , and then centipede things !!!
· Night began , me and Hat sitting at the bar , when this fit guy comes over and asks if we 'll do the podium competition for eight free drinks .
Me , trying to flirt , giggle and say " of course " .
Why not ?
Eight free drinks .
Do n't know really what I was thinking of as did n't even know what a podium was , but anyway persuaded Hat to do it , reluctantly .
We both forgot about it and carried on drinking away when suddenly everyone is ushered into this one room .
As I walk in I suddenly realise what a podium is when I see this cage in the middle of the room , 10 feet in the air , with a dirty slapper dancing topless in the middle of it , grinding against the side .
Next thing I know , my name is being called and I am climbing up this ladder on to this tiny platform .
Help !
· HELP HELP HELP .
I just shredded some documents that I was meant to file , and filed the ones I was meant to shred .
HHHHEEEELLLLPPPP !!!!
· I am the most shit chalet girl ever .
The idiot I was working with left me as I 'm apparently too laid back , so have had to cook for 12 people all by myself , which has been a disaster , and this gap - year malarkey has made any brain cells I did have completely disappear , so I made a cake using olive oil , which tasted more like Mediterranean salad and which I left in the oven too long , so I had to cut about 5 cm off the edge , which made it more of a cupcake , gave everyone red wine diluted with white wine instead of kir , which was undrinkable , and then forgot to put any baking powder in my scones so they burned in the oven and looked more like little piles of poo .
Then I had to remake my mince pies as they all stuck in the pan ( yes , you have to grease the little bastards ) , which was a bugger .
In Quito , I went on a crazy party bus which was quite an experience .
Everyone dances on the roof with a band , but the bus is too tall and you have to duck for bridges and cables .
Me , being too chilled out , forgot to do this .
I have since been to a witch doctor , which was scary .
She was a complete nutter and made me strip so she could beat me with flowers , and then spat all over my torso .
( I was a little freaked out by how much she knew of my fetishes . )
Penultimately I visited the equator , which was just a line .
· Never eat deep - fried guinea pig and llama kebabs before travelling on a bus for 20 hours , then boarding a light aircraft .
It just does n't work .
Not unless you want to see them again , a little sooner than expected .
· The train has gone , and so has the dodgy money - lender with my money .
My head was completely scrambled .
I 'm just in a state of shock that the train has gone .
I wander back into the station waiting hall and realise that Sally [ still on the train ] has all our Russian money , all our food .
The Russian official with incredibly cold eyes comes back and hands me back my passport with a stamp over my visa which says that I have been unable to cross the border .
I try to plead and tell him I do n't even have a ticket to Ulan Bator because the carriage attendant never gave it back .
He just stares at me blankly and walks off with a smirk on his face .
· I have taken to teaching my children [ in a school in India ] the most useful things they need to know about English culture - last week we learned about Sloanes , Geordies , wide boys and lager louts .
I have become the chief slayer of insects , having combated cockroaches in my sleeping bag , wash bag , pants , loo seat , hairbrush , as well as taking on a spider the size of a small elephant .
I am indestructible !
- though the dysentery was n't great .
Had a nasty run-in with a leper carrying a python this morning , but being invincible , and the worldly girl I have come to be , I took him on .
I am now slightly worried how contagious leprosy is .
Hope you are all well and disease - free .
· Now the third [ bungee jump in New Zealand ] was a piece of cake .
The rope is attached to your waist and you can run and jump off , and at 43 metres it was all over very quickly .
However , I got to dangle for a while as I had n't listened to the guy explaining the harness he uses to pull people up with , so I put it on wrong .
· I have NO clean clothes .
Literally EVERYTHING is smelly and wet .
I have n't smelled nice for a month , cos even after a shower I have to dry with a dish towel .
Please , Mum , could you fly out here and do my washing ?
· We were all kitted out in our wetsuits , waterproofs , helmets and lifejackets , and had just started out on the river [ in Peru ] when our instructor started shouting instructions to us to turn the boat and back it up . . .
I turned around to see the body of a young woman not much older than us floating in the water face up .
Our instructor asked us to grab the body and attach it to the raft .
The six of us were all in shock , as it was for all of us the first dead body we had ever seen , so dumbstruck , the only thing we could do was to keep paddling .
We got her to the side .
We all stood in a circle and said a prayer for her . . .
We carried on rafting , and luckily all was not ruined , as champagne was brought to celebrate my birthday and we stayed in a lovely campsite with an excellent view of the mountains .
· We have had lots of exciting snake incidents [ in Kenya ] .
Went with Julian to a nearby airfield to drop some bracelets and on the way back we saw a huge spitting cobra crossing the road in front of us .
We both saw it , leaned forward for a better look , realised what it was , leaned back and checked our sunglasses were on firmly .
Luckily it shot off and did n't spit !
· Climbed the volcano [ in Bolivia ] , which was amazing , massive crater at the top , giving out smoke that hurt like hell when you breathe it in .
Had some great photos on the top of Jed having a piss , etc .
· The accommodation is OK .
Well , it 's interesting , a bit sticky on the floor and a few cockroaches but it 's OK .
I 'm staying in a little place about 40 minutes from Sydney on the train .
It 's a small town , loads of crime , drugs etc , etc , a bit like Stoke - only less pottery .
· Right now I 'm in Zhengzhou , the worst place in the world .
It 's a depressing heap of a city , imagine Milton Keynes left to rot for 100 years , and then inhabited by 8 million disgustingly ugly people who keep shouting " HELLO ! HELLO ! " and muttering things under their breath about foreigners .
We could n't get a train straight away , we had to spend the night , and this pissed us off so much that it drove us to going through with something we'd been joking about - the McHut .
The McHut is very simple .
First you go to McDonald 's and eat loads there , and then you go to Pizza Hut and pig out on pizza .
I can honestly say that I 've never been so full in my life , and it had the right effect too , because for some reason Zhengzhou did n't look so bad with a bellyful of burgers and pizza .
· Helped amputate a leg with the vascular fellow , got to tie off all the vessels and suture up the muscle and skin , which was all good .
I have managed to have a couple of free lunches too , which was also nice .
· Thirty hours on a yam transportation ferry where mice crawled all over our bodies at night , followed by several hours in a city that I would wish upon only the very worst people in the world ( think Hitler , Stalin , and possibly this new boy here called Garth ) .
Then went on two 7 - hour bus journeys .
So much sweat , so many flies due to neighbours eating fish for all seven hours and then dropping bones on my feet , then some goats and kindly chickens decided to join us .
Was just about tolerating this , though the smell was so rank I thought about cutting my nose off until I thought about nose , spite , face thing and decided , although not my finest feature , I would look worse without it . . . until chickens pecked my arse and I promptly burst into tears , much to everyone 's amusement .
Eventually arrived , and for the next five days my body was consumed with the most horrendous rash - incidentally , bird flu has reached Ghana in a big way .
· That afternoon was spent fruitlessly piranha - fishing from the canoe , before Victor insisted that we all jump into the muddy brown water - apparently it did n't matter that we'd just been tempting man-eating fish with pieces of meat , and the water was " perfectly safe apart from the fish that swim up your rectum " .
However , having survived swimming in the Amazon , we were able to enjoy another amazing sunset fishing from the banks this time .
Unfortunately , we forgot a torch , so Will and I were almost snapped by a caiman while trying to get back to the shore once it had got dark .
· I have been scared of heights all my life .
So imagine my delight , as we came over the brow of the hill , just over the [ Vietnam / Laos ] border , to see not merely sheer vertical drops falling away from us into mist - covered oblivion , not just a winding mountain pass consisting entirely of hairpin bends snaking blindly into thick fog , but no barrier , no markings , no edge to the road .
But thick slippery mud , more than a foot deep , and piles of rock and rubble all covering the road , if you can call it a road .
And the moisture from the freezing fog had turned its surface into slippery , trickling slop that fell away from the cliff edge into nothingness .
Did I mention I was scared of heights ?
· Guess what happened to me last night [ in Sydney ] ?
We were walking back to the hostel and some guy jumped out of his car and whacked me across the head with a hammer - the bit you take nails out with .
Then he punched George in the face and drove off .
· Birthday plans !
I was planning on doing the sunset cruise and gorge swing , but I think we are doing a bungee jump from the highest bridge in the world (!!! ) .
I am going to dress very silly in a big dress so people do n't forget me !
Love you all . . .
· Hey Mum and Dad , Don't fret , cos I am still alive , and you always said that was the main thing .
I should probably mention that I am not pregnant .
I am also not yet a heroin / coke / ecstasy / morphine addict .
I have definitely " found myself " and also made a huge difference to the village where I am staying .
I have lots of good intentions , like building wells and libraries .
I have given up smoking .
I have started writing poetry .
I have found God .
I miss you and love you all so so so much and can't wait to see you .
Love Tasha .

· Dad , you keep complaining about my spending but the longer you fail to get this problem sorted out , the more money will get spent .
Beijing is an expensive place to piss about going to banks all day , plus its 39 degrees outside , which makes me annoyed the minute I step out of the hotel .
Seriously , I do n't know how much longer I can last . . .
I 'm fucking fed up with this , stop sending me sarcastic emails and telling me " it does n't add up " .
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK .
Just go down to HSBC and do n't leave until you 're convinced that something has taken place which will enable me to come home . . .

BAGHDAD , Oct. 23 — Nearly every night here for the past month , Iraqis weary of the tumult around them have been turning on the television to watch a wacky - looking man with a giant Afro wig and star - shaped glasses deliver the grim news of the day .
In a recent episode , the host , Saad Khalifa , reported that Iraq ’s Ministry of Water and Sewage had decided to change its name to simply the Ministry of Sewage — because it had given up on the water part .
In another episode , he jubilantly declared that “ Rums bin Feld ” had announced American troops were leaving the country on 1/1 , in other words , on Jan .
1 . His face crumpled when he realized he had made a mistake .
The troops were not actually departing on any specific date , he clarified , but instead leaving one by one .
At that rate , it would take more than 600 years for them to be gone .
The newscast is a parody , of course , that fires barbs at everyone from the American military to the Iraqi government , an Iraqi version of “ The Daily Show With Jon Stewart . ”
Even the militias wreaking havoc on Iraq are lampooned .
Microsoft has admitted that the latest update to its Windows Genuine Advantage program will phone back to Redmond even if the user clicks cancel .
WGA is meant to help Redmond fight piracy , but has been criticised on privacy grounds and because previous versions have incorrectly labelled people with genuine software as pirates .
But if you cancel the installation of WGA , maybe because you dislike the privacy implications , the software will still phone home .
Microsoft stresses that WGA does not take any information which could identify you as an individual , but is only used to collate statistics on WGA use .
Microsoft UK anti-piracy manager Michala Alexander said in a statement :
The data collection and transfer in question are part of some of our update download services , such as the Windows Update service .
As with other programs downloaded via these services , the success or failure of WGA Notifications ' installation is sent to Microsoft .
If the user interrupts installation of WGA Notifications , we send the number of the screen on which installation stopped ( first , second , etc. ) .
In order to establish an accurate count , we also generate several globally unique identifiers ( GUIDs ) that do not contain any personal information .
We use the GUIDs to tally the number of individual machines without identifying the user .
Other data sent includes user and machine language settings and whether or not the machine was joined to a domain .
We use the information collected to generate aggregate statistics that help us improve the WGA user experience and quality of service .
Protecting the privacy of our customer 's information is very important to Microsoft .
That is why we have detailed what information is collected in the Windows Update privacy statement .
In addition , the Microsoft Genuine Advantage privacy statement and the Windows Genuine Advantage Notifications End User License Agreement describe this data collection .
As documented in these disclosures , the information collected is not used to identify or contact the user .
For more on this , have a look at Ars Technica , which got the story from HeiseOnline . ®
WASHINGTON -- FEMA exposed taxpayers to significant waste , and possibly violated federal law , by awarding $ 3.6 billion worth of Hurricane Katrina contracts to companies with poor credit histories and bad paperwork , investigators say .
The report by the Homeland Security Department 's office of inspector general , set to be released later this week , examines the propriety of 36 trailer contracts designated for small and local businesses in the stricken Gulf Coast region after the 2005 storm .
It found a haphazard competitive bidding process in which the winning contract prices were both unreasonably low and high .
Moreover , FEMA did not take adequate legal steps to ensure that companies were small and locally operated , resulting in a questionable contract award to a large firm with ties to the Republican Party .
" Based on our analysis , we concluded that FEMA contracting officials exposed the agency to an unacceptable level of risk , " according to the report by the office of inspector general Richard Skinner .
The audit , one of several expected this year on Katrina contracting , is the latest to detail mismanagement in a multibillion - dollar hurricane recovery effort that investigators say has already wasted over $ 1 billion .
It also comes after the Federal Emergency Management Agency acknowledged earlier this month that it would not have a federal plan ready for responding to emergencies before the hurricane season begins June 1 .
In response to the audit , FEMA in the report disagreed that the wide price variations put taxpayers at risk .
The agency contended that it was comfortable with bidders ' financial viability based in part on past performance .
In cases where contract prices appeared unreasonably high , those would be offset with lower payments later on subsequent work orders , FEMA officials said .
In the immediate aftermath of Katrina , FEMA handed out lucrative no -bid contracts for cleanup work to large , politically connected firms such as Shaw Group Inc. , Bechtel Group Inc. , CH2M Hill Companies Ltd. , and Fluor Corp .
After heavy criticism , FEMA Director David Paulison pledged to put those large contracts out to bid again .
He ultimately reopened only a portion , awarding 36 contracts that the agency said would be prioritized for small and local businesses .
Among the winners was joint venture PRI - DJI , which received $ 400 million worth of contracts .
That prompted complaints from small and locally operated firms that said they were unfairly shut out .
DJI stands for Del - Jen Inc. , a subsidiary of Fluor , which has donated more than $ 930,000 to mostly GOP candidates since 2000 .
" It 's not what you know , what your expertise is .
I do n't even believe it 's got much to do with price .
It 's who you know , " said Ken Edmonds , owner of River Parish RV Inc. in Louisiana , which was rejected for a contract .
In the audit , investigators said PRI - DJI was eligible because DJI had partnered with PRI , a minority - owned firm based in San Diego , under a federal mentoring program .
However , investigators found that PRI - DJI was given special preference even though it was not registered as a small business .
Still , the audit noted that the PRI - DJI bid probably would have been selected without the special preference because it was so low .

Genshi
Python toolkit for generation of output for the web
Genshi is a Python library that provides an integrated set of components for parsing , generating , and processing HTML , XML or other textual content for output generation on the web .
The main feature is a template language that is smart about markup : unlike conventional template languages that only deal with bytes and ( if you 're lucky ) characters , Genshi knows the difference between tags , attributes , and actual text nodes , and uses that knowledge to your advantage .
For example :
Intelligent automatic escaping greatly reduces the risk of opening up your site to ​ cross - site scripting attacks ( XSS ) .
cross -site scripting attacks ( XSS ) .
Template directives are often less verbose than those in most other template languages , as they can be attached directly to the elements they act upon .
Independence from a specific serialization format lets you instantly switch between generating well - formed HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 ( or other formats ) .
Stream - based filtering allows you to apply various transformations as a template is being processed , without having to parse and serialize the output again .
Match templates let you enforce a common structure on template output , and more .
This , in combination with XInclude support , is used instead of the more rigid inheritance feature commonly found in other template languages .
For those cases where you do n't want to generate markup , Genshi also provides a simple text - based template language .
Please note that the Genshi source tarballs come with comprehensive HTML documentation , encompassing both the generated API documentation and the user guide .
The API documentation ( courtesy of ​ Epydoc ) in particular is a lot better than the version you find here .
Development
The Git repository can be accessed via :
Discussion about the development of Genshi takes place on the mailing lists or IRC channel .

After a long fight , we have reached the point where a major e-voting reform bill has a chance to become U.S. law .
I ’m referring to HR 811 , sponsored by my Congressman , Rush Holt , and co-sponsored by many others .
After reading the bill carefully , and discussing with students and colleagues the arguments of its supporters and critics , I am convinced that it is a very good bill that deserves our support .
The main provisions of the bill would require e-voting technologies to have a paper ballot that is ( a ) voter - verified , ( b ) privacy - preserving , and ( c ) durable .
Paper ballots would be hand - recounted , and compared to the electronic count , at randomly - selected precincts after every election .
The most important decision in writing such a bill is which technologies should be categorically banned .
The bill would allow ( properly designed ) optical scan systems , touch - screen systems with a suitable paper trail , and all - paper systems .
Paperless touchscreens and lever machines would be banned .
Some activists have argued that the bill does n’t go far enough .
A few say that all use of computers in voting should be banned .
I think that ’s a mistake , because it sacrifices the security benefits computers can provide , if they ’re used well .
Others argue that touch - screen voting machines should be banned even if they have good paper trails .
I think that goes too far .
Touchscreens can be a useful part of a good voting system , if they ’re used in the right context and with a good paper trail .
We should n’t let the worst of today ’s insecure paperless touchscreens – machines that should never have been certified in the first place , and anyway would be banned by the Holt Bill for lacking a suitable paper ballot – sour us on the better uses of touchscreens that are possible .
One of the best parts of the bill is its random audit requirement , which selects 3 % of precincts ( or more in close races ) at which the paper ballots will be hand counted and compared to the electronic records .
This serves two useful purposes : detecting error or fraud that might have affected the election result , and providing a routine quality - control check on the vote - counting process .
This part of the bill reflects a balance between the states ’ freedom to run their own elections and the national interest in sound election management .
On the whole this is a good , strong bill .
I support it , and I urge you to support it too .

The Jammin ' Shaman of Turpan
OK , so that almost rhymes .
Give me extra credit for trying .
Hat tip to The Peking Duck for alerting me to a story that slipped by unnoticed while I was traveling recently .
To make a short story shorter , scientists have announced the discovery of a shaman mummy near Turpan who 's burial objects included a large " sack of marijuana " .
The other day , Xinhua featured an update on the story ( in Chinese ) , with emphasis on said " sack of marijuana " :
Turpan Research Institute post - doctoral researcher Jiang Hong 'en said : " When unearthed in 2003 , the marijuana was still green as if it had just been picked .
The leaves , seeds , branches , and internal plant structures were all preserved perfectly .
Compared with past discoveries in China and around the world , the level of preservation here is unprecedented . "
Dr. Jiang Hong 'en confirmed that researchers from the Kunming Institute of Botany were recently able to extract cannabinoid substances from the 2500 - year old marijuana plants .
I 'm not 100 % sure about the translation of that second paragraph ... anyone out there know the true meaning of 大麻酚 ?
I 'm sure it's not " cannabis hydroxybenzene " .
How about tetrahydrocannabinol ?
I 've translated the article below ( the original Chinese is also included ) - albeit imperfectly - with the help of the lovely Ms. Fan .
Jah !
We be jammin ' ... right by da Taklamakan , mon !
2500 Year old Marijuana Unearthed in Turpan Cemetery
Xinhuanet
January 23 , 2007 URUMQI : Chinese archeologists recently announced that what is thought to be a shaman ’s grave unearthed in Turpan , Xinjiang has been found to contain the world 's oldest and most well - preserved specimens of marijuana .
In March 2003 , archaeologists from the Turpan Cultural Relics Bureau and the Xinjiang Archaeological Research Institute excavated “ Tomb No. 90 ” in “ Area No. 1 ” and found a leather basket containing marijuana plants , branches and seeds .
They also found a large wooden funerary basin in seriously damaged condition containing similar plant matter .
Turpan Research Institute post - doctoral researcher Jiang Hong 'en said : " When unearthed in 2003 , the marijuana was still green as if it had just been picked .
The leaves , seeds , branches , and internal plant structures were all preserved perfectly .
Compared with past discoveries in China and around the world , the level of preservation here is unprecedented . "
Dr. Jiang Hong 'en confirmed that researchers from the Kunming Institute of Botany were recently able to extract cannabinoid substances from the 2500 - year old marijuana plants .
Li Xiao , director of the Turpan Cultural Relics Bureau said : " The mummy 's peculiar dress indicates that he is a shaman and that the tomb was likely dedicated to him . ”
He theorizes that : " The marijuana was placed in the basin before being ground into powder and ingested to induce a frantic state .
The marijuana was buried here in the tomb to be used by the shaman for both medicinal and hallucinogenic purposes . "
Shamanism is a primitive religion that was extremely popular in areas north and south of the Tian Shan Mountains before the arrival of Buddhism in the 1st century CE .
Shamanists believe in animism , and shamans participate in special dances to their gods .
The shaman is able to convey the prayers and wishes of the people to the gods , and messages from the gods to the people .
In the original Chinese :
新疆吐鲁番洋海墓地出土了2500年前的大麻 新华网乌鲁木齐1月23日电 （记者毛咏 张鸿墀报道）中国考古专家近日表示，在新疆吐鲁番洋海墓地出土的萨满教巫师干尸陪葬品中发现的绿色植物，是迄今为止世界上保存最为古老且最完好的大麻标本。
２００３年３月，新疆文物考古研究所和吐鲁番地区文物局对洋海墓地进行抢救性发掘，在编号为一号墓地９０号墓的墓室中，考古人员发现一个皮编草篓，内有大麻的植物种子及小枝条等。墓室中还有一个大木臼中亦装有部分同样类型的植物，木臼底和下内腹已被磨得很薄，其一侧已经严重破损。
吐鲁番学研究院在站博士后蒋洪恩说：“２００３年出土的时候，大麻叶片竟然还是绿色的，仿佛刚采摘的一样，这些大麻的叶片、果实及小枝条，连同内部结构都完整的保存下来，在中国甚至世界上已知考古发现中都没有比这保存得更完好的。 ”
蒋洪恩博士证实，昆明植物研究所研究人员近期从这２５００年前的“ 绿色植物” 中提取出大麻酚。 吐鲁番地区文物局局长李肖博士说： “
我们根据干尸奇特的服饰判断这个墓室中的主人可能是当时的萨满教巫师。”他推测说，“这些大麻很可能是在这个木盆中先被研磨成粉，然后被墓主服用以获得癫狂状态，大麻的致幻作用和药用价值成为墓主人保存这些大麻的目的。 ”
萨满教是一种原始宗教，在佛教东传（公元１世纪前后）以前，萨满教在新疆天山南北盛行。萨满教相信万物有灵，萨满教巫师即跳神之人的专称，他可以将人的祈求、愿望转达给神，也可以将神的意志传达给人。

今月末にバージョ ン1.0リリース
「本家Rubyより速い 」 、JRuby開発者に聞く
PythonやRubyといった動的言語が人気だが、サン・マイクロシステムズは、そうした動きをJavaテクノロジに採り入れつつある。もともとのPythonやRubyはCで実装されているが、Javaによる実装である「 Jython」 や「 JRuby」といった処理系が存在する。Ruby向けに書かれたコードはJVM上で稼働するJRubyでも動作する。同様に、Rubyブームの火付け役となった感もある「Ruby on Rails」 （RoR）で構築されたサイトであっても、かなり高い互換性でJRuby上で動作するという。米国サンフランシスコで開催中のJavaOneで、JRubyプロジェクトの中心人物に話を聞いた。
Ruby on Rails もJVM上で稼働
サン・マイクロシステムズでJRubyの開発に携わるチャールズ・ナッター氏（左）とトーマス・エネボー（右）氏
現在、JRubyは6人のコア・コミッターと30〜35人のコミュニティメンバーによって開発が進められている。6人のコア・コミッターのうちの2人、チャールズ・ナッター（Charles Nutter）氏とトーマス・エネボー（Thomas Eebo）氏は、2006年9月にサン・マイクロシステムズに社員として迎え入れ、現在はフルタイムでJRubyの開発に取り組んでいるという。
「 2004 年 のRubyConfに参加してRubyがおもしろそうだなと思ったのがRubyとの最初の関わりです。ただ、Rubyに興味があったのに、Javaで実装するということになって、今ではJavaばかり使っています（笑）。 サンに入る前は、JRubyは週末だけのプロジェクトだったのが、平日も週末もフルタイムでJRubyに関わることになると、もしかして自分は興味を失うんじゃないかとも思っていましたが、ますます仕事が楽しくなっています」（トーマス・エネボー氏）
今月末にバージョン1.0を正式にリリースするというJRubyだが、本家のRuby1.8との互換性は高い。「互換性には気を遣っています。自分たちで作成したテストツールで互換性の検証をしています」（エネボー氏）といい、RoRで書かれたコードも、サンのJavaアプリケーションサーバ「GlassFish」上で稼働するという。
Rubyには、本家のRubyとJRuby以外にも、高速処理を売りにしたYARV（Yet Another Ruby VM）という実装もある。Rubyは言語仕様が明確にドキュメント化されていないため、こうしたRuby仮想マシン間の互換性を懸念する声も出ていたが、「サンで作成したテストツールは、Rubyコミュニティに提供するつもり」（エネボー氏）といい、互換性に関する心配は杞憂となりそうだ。サンはこれまでにも、Rubyコミュニティに対してソースコード保存用のサーバや、開発ツールなどを提供しており、RoRで注目を集めたRubyが、サンによるJRubyへのコミットメントによってさらに広範囲の注目を集めそうだ。特に商用利用に関して言えば、「
Java EEのライブラリやJavaクラスを、Rubyの文法で自然に使えるように作業を進めている」（エネボー氏）というのはJava開発者にとっても、Rubyの文法に慣れ親しんだ開発者にとっても朗報だろう。
処理速度のチューニングも進んでいる。JRubyは高速実行を目指したYARVと、「ほぼ同等か、テスト項目によってはやや遅い程度の速度」（エネボー氏）といい、本家のRubyよりは確実に速いとしている。
「 動的言語はヘルメットを付けずに走るバイクのようなもの」
JRuby やJythonといった人気の言語がJavaプラットフォーム上で動くとなると、Java言語の位置付けにも影響を受けるのではないかという疑問が出てくる。この疑問に対して、Javaの生みの親であるジェームス・ゴスリン（James Gosling）氏は、 「 Ruby やPythonといった動的言語はHTMLを生成するのに適した言語だが、それがコンピューティングのすべてではない」とコメントしており、例えば、NASDAQの電子取引では1秒間に約15万のトランザクションをJava EEで処理しており、そうした用途ではJavaのスケーラビリティや柔軟性、セキュリティが勝ると指摘する。
「 動的言語を使うのは、ヘルメットを付けずにバイクで走るようなものだ。そのほうがヘルメットを付けてから走り出すよりずっと速いが、コードの安全性や保守性といった面では問題を抱えることになる」（ゴスリング氏）
用途や開発規模によって使い分けられる言語の選択肢が増えるのは、開発者には朗報だ。いずれにしても、Javaプラットフォームは、もはやJava言語だけが動く環境ではない。

UPDATED 2010 : New inkjet printer technology that analysts believe will revolutionize the imaging industry was unveiled today by secretive Silverbrook Research .
The company has released astounding videos * of desktop , photo and wide - format printers that print pages and photos 5 to 10 times faster than products from current printer market leaders HP , Canon , Epson and Lexmark .
“ This thing is gigantic , we 've been in this business for 20 years and I 've never seen something as mind boggling , ” says Charles LeCompte , president of leading printer market analysis firm , Lyra Research .
“ The technology will be available in products in late 2007 , starting with a 100 mm printhead that will be used for home and retail photo printing as well as label printing devices .
An A4 / Letter printhead will be available in 2008 with many different components and technology improvements planned for the future , ” the company announced today .
HP , Canon and other printer manufacturers are described as " potential customers " , by Memjet Technology , the main company established by Silverbrook to market and license the technology .
The company expects the printers to eventually cost $ 200 or less , sources say .
See also our latest opinion article , ' Is Silverbrook 's Memjet printer a hoax ? ' for a discussion of some of the arguments from people who believe these demonstrations could be faked , and a peek at some of the remarkable technology that Silverbrook Research claims will enable a printing revolution ( page will open in new window ) .
Video ( c ) Memjet Services Inc .
The cheap A4 desktop printer with a color printing speed of 60 pages per minute shown in this video is just one of the revolutionary new devices promised by Silverbrook , a company which holds more than 1400 patents , but has never released a product .
The video was released today by Memjet Technology .
Analysts from leading printer market research firm , Lyra Research
Inc say they have personally examined prototypes of the desktop printers and verified that they work as Silverbrook claims
Other products that Silverbrook says will be made possible by the new technology are a $ 150 , desktop photo printer that prints 30 photos per minute .
This is more than 10 times faster than all existing desktop products , and 2 to 3 times faster than the speediest competitor , HP 's new Edgeline printer , which is not available in a retail product for ordinary consumers .
HP 's competing printer costs $ 16,000
While Edgeline could be the closest competitor to Memjet in terms of speed , it appears to be far more expensive .
The only HP Edgeline printer announced for sale on the open market , the multifunction CM8050 , costs $ 16,000 according to HP , and $ 21,000 according to a retail outlet which advertises the printer as ' available in the near future ' .
In fact , a spare paper tray for the HP edgeline printer currently costs more than $ 2,000 - ten times the $ 200 analysts say is possible for Silverbrook 's desktop inkjet printer ( Silverbrook itself says only that the price will be under $ 300 ) .
It is not clear when the HP CM8050 will be available , as HP has removed the product page from its website recently .
( Update March 30 : Since this story was written , HP staff have contacted Texyt to inform us that the company has not officially announced pricing for the Edgeline series .
We await further clarification from HP )
Silverbrook 's assault on the market
In almost 3500 patent applications over the past decade , Silverbrook has described an incredible array of potential products .
These include a full colour printer module small enough to fit into a mobile phone , digital camera or even into handheld games like the Sony PSP or Nintendo DS .
Silverbrook 's working prototype of this miniature color inkjet printing module is shown here in this low - quality snapshot .
Other patents describe large scale printers to print wallpaper and textiles .
According to Lyra Research , Silverbrook believes the radical technology can scale from handheld devices right up to huge commercial printing presses that could print magazines and books .
The desktop printers as described by Silverbrook have a “ price / performance ratio that is off the charts ” , says Steve Hoffenberg of Lyra Research .
Low printing cost claimed
Silverbrook has forecast printing costs for the 60 page per minute desktop printer at below $ 0.02 for black text , and under $ 0.06 for color pages ( with 20 percent ink coverage ) , according to Lyra Research , which had early access to prototypes .
The desktop printer 's individual color ink cartridges hold 50 ml of ink , an almost unprecedented amount in a consumer product , and will sell for less than $ 20 each , the company predicts .
Most existing inkjet printers from companies like Epson use ink cartridges with a capacity of about 10 ml , and prices of $ 15 to $ 30 .
" Silverbrook expect costs of ink and media supplies will be pushing new lows .
They 're not looking to subsidize their costs with high ink prices , instead they want more of a balance , " says Steve Hoffenberg , Lyra 's director of consumer imaging research
The privately - held company has not disclosed the identities of investors , but states that " No existing printer company has any stake in the Memjet Companies " .
Analysts have suggested that Silverbrook could license its technology to outsiders who are trying to break into the printer market .
Dell , which already has a printer business , but owns little of the technology behind it , is one name that has been mentioned .
Radical new technology
The ultra fast speed of the printers is partly due to their ' pagewidth ' format .
Unlike conventional inkjets , the printhead spans the full width of the paper and does not need to shuttle from side to side .
The A4 or letter - size desktop printer 's printhead is a full 8 inches ( 21.3 cm ) wide and contains 70,400 ink nozzles .
This microscope photo shows a tiny section of the print head - each of the small white circles is a single ink nozzle .
The ink nozzles are arranged in lines , with 1600 nozzles per inch .
These can produce more than 2.5 million ink dots per square inch of paper in a single pass .
( The screen you are reading this story on has approximately 10,000 dots per square inch ) .
These tiny nozzles can fire out ink droplets smaller than one picoliter ( one millionth of a millionth of a liter ) .
This produces tremendously sharp prints , say analysts .
The very small size of the ink droplets is important , because it helps the ink dry in less than a second .
This is a critical factor in high speed printing without smudging .
The printhead is made up in four - inch units .
These are themselves assembled from smaller pieces , 20 mm long , which are built using a semiconductor fabrication process , similar to that used to make CPUs and graphics chips .
The photograph on the right , shows an 8 - inch silicon wafer on which these 20 mm print head sections are visible
Please refer to Texyt.com 's exclusive first article on Silverbrook Research and its Memjet technology for background information on Silverbrook Research and its founder , Australian inventor , Kia Silverbrook , and a look at some of the patents behind the invention .
See this article for more on Memjet , including its predicted disruptive effect on the printer industry
Can this remarkable technology actually succeed in the market ?
See also our look at Memjet 's print quality , intellectual property issues , and competition from HP 's Edgeline .
* Update April 2 : Since this story was written , Memjet Technologies has removed the video of the wide format printer from its website .
The company also removed another video which showed all three of its prototypes , including the wide format printer .
Videos of the other two protoypes , the A4 / Letter printer and the photo printer remain on the site .
Update May 28 : Memjet has now added a new video of its wide format printer prototype to its website , replacing the original video which was removed .
Part of this video segment is shown at the end of the video sequence displayed on this page .
The printer and adjacent workstation appear identical to those in the original video - as far as can be ascertained in a low quality video of this nature .
Update Aug 2008 : Despite maintaining their customary low profile , Silverbrook and Memjet have been recruiting numerous engineers with experience of MEMs and other areas that are related to Memjet during the past year .
Hiring has been in Asia and Australia , with an emphasis on practical manufacturing experience .
We 've removed the predicted year from the title of this article because development of the mass - market version of the printer is obviously behind the schedule given by Silverbrook last year .
Update Nov 2008 : According to recent statements by Memjet representatives , the company 's high - speed A4 / Letter page - width printhead is expected to be ready by the end of 2008 .
A printer based on this is expected to be announced in early 2009 by another vendor .
Memjet is predicting a price as low as $ 300 for this product - though the company notes that the price will be set by the printer vendor .
If these predictions prove accurate , the first consumer - oriented Memjet printer will be released approximately one year later than initially forecast .
Update July 2009 : Since this article was originally published , Memjet has put back the launch of products several times .
While Silverbrook and Memjet have been characteristically shy of talking about internal activity , recruitment ads and other sources reveal that the company has been hiring numerous engineering staff and other employees worldwide during this period .
The most recent news from the company , as of mid-2009 , is that no commercial availability is expected until 2010 .
Memjet is not manufacturing or selling printers itself , but is supplying components to other manufacturers .
According to the company : after unexpected delays , almost all problems with the Memjet printheads and other components have been sorted out , but partners ' ramping up to mass production is now also taking longer than expected .
The first products expected on the market are desktop printers aimed at small businesses .
Memjet has not named any of the companies that will use the technology .
However , Videos on the Memjet Home and Office website which compare competing products unfavorably with Memjet technologies include HP , Samsung , Canon , Xerox and Brother - suggesting that Memjet is not partnering with any of these companies , as it would be unlikely to criticize a business partner 's products .
Notably these comparisons make no mention of Epson , one of the world 's largest printer manufacturers ( other notable printer makers or vendors not mentioned include Kodak , Lexmark , Dell , Oki Data , Ricoh ) .
Other announcements from Memjet make clear that , in a break with current industry practice , a key feature of some or all of its home and office printers will be refillable ink cartridges .
Update Feb 2010 : Memjet is now expecting products on the market in the second half of 2010 , with office printers appearing first , followed later by cheaper products aimed at ordinary consumers .
The company has hired tech industry heavyweight , Len Lauer , as its new CEO .
Lauer provided the new product release schedule in interviews .
Lauer was formerly COO at Qualcomm and prior to that held the same position at Sprint Nextel .
Short answer : No .
There are currently eight devices on the market that claim to lure and kill mosquitoes with fermenting sugar solutions , but only one , the Spartan Mosquito Pro Tech , is registered with the Environmental Protection Agency .
That registration is required because the active ingredient , boric acid , is a regulated pesticide .
As a result , all claims made by Spartan Mosquito about the device must be true .
This post is about one those claims , that mosquitoes will gather around the device in large numbers .
The claim is made on the device ’s label ( below ) , on the instruction sheet ( below ) , on the company ’s website , and in the EPA registration document , where it ’s mentioned five times .
On device label
On instruction sheet
It is , of course , a claim that is central to how the device is supposed to work : the mosquitoes in a yard are somehow drawn to the contents of the tubes , they squeeze through the holes in the cap , crawl down to the fluid , ingest some fluid , then crawl back out of the tubes .
They die later from the effects of boric acid .
It ’s an elaborate sequence of events .
What causes the mosquitoes to gather ?
Unfortunately , nowhere does Spartan Mosquito explain exactly why the Pro Tech would cause mosquitoes to gather .
But the company says the device is the “ next generation ” of the Spartan Mosquito Eradicator , and for that device the company claims mosquitoes are attracted to the carbon dioxide produced by sugar and yeast inside the tube .
Although sugar and yeast are not specifically listed as ingredients for the Pro Tech , the contents appear to be sugar and yeast .
Evaluating the claim
The easiest way to determine whether mosquitoes gather around the Spartan Mosquito Pro Tech is to just look .
I ’ve deployed three devices ( one with label removed ) in my yard this summer and , to date , I have not seen any mosquitoes near the devices .
There are also no mosquitoes inside the devices .
For the record , I know what mosquitoes look like and have thousands in my yard .
Pro Tech 1
Pro Tech 2
Pro Tech 3
The above technique has two problems , however .
The first is that one has to be close to the devices to observe mosquitoes , and it ’s theoretically possible that the instant a human approaches , the mosquitoes abandon the device and seek out the human , instead .
I do n’t actually think this is a real concern because I can recognize a mosquito from quite far away , plus I can use binoculars so that the distance is even greater .
The second problem is that people might not believe me when I say I observed zero mosquitoes gathered around the tubes — people are just far more inclined to believe the label ’s claim .
To address both of these concerns , I decided to use a security camera to record the area around a Pro Tech .
Then I could examine the footage and make it publicly available to those who might be skeptical .
Here ’s a photograph of how I arranged everything :
Below is a 15 - second time - lapse to show that small insects such as ants were easily visible , even at night .
I think they are Prenolepis imparis , which are 3 - 4 mm long — mosquitoes are larger and thus would be detectable even in flight .
On the day that I set it up ( September 2nd , 2020 ) I counted over a dozen mosquitoes ( all Aedes albopictus ) on my arms and legs within 30 seconds .
According to the instruction sheet , the device begins to work instantly , as soon as water is added , so an hour of remote , video observation should be a sufficient amount of time to evaluate the attraction claim .
To satisfy potential critics , however , I collected footage for over a week , ending observations on September 10th .
The mosquitoes were still plentiful on the day I published this post ( September 12th ) , so there were plenty of mosquitoes in my yard for a fair test .
Results
During 183 hours of footage , I could n’t find a single mosquito on or near the device .
It ’s theoretically possible that a mosquito landed on the far side of the tube ( which I could n’t view ) and I missed it , but I think I can safely conclude that large numbers of mosquitoes did not “ gather ” , as per the labelling claim .
I ’ve also continued to observe the footage beyond the 183 hours , but it seemed like a waste of time to continue .
The device was simply not attracting mosquitoes .
There ’s only so much boredom I can endure .
Discussion
If the Spartan Mosquito Pro Tech does not attract mosquitoes , at all , I ’m left confused .
Is it possible the EPA did n’t require Spartan Mosquito to provide experimental proof for this label claim ?
I see three explanations .
First , I ’m wondering whether the EPA viewed the claim as “ advisory ” language :
“ Advisory statements are intended to be informational .
They provide information to the product user on such topics as product characteristics and how to reduce risk and maximize efficacy while using the product .
Such statements are acceptable as long as they do not conflict with mandatory statements , and are not false or misleading , or otherwise violate statutory or regulatory provisions . ” [ bolding added ]
https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-labels/label-review-training-module-1-label-basics-page-26
I.e. , maybe the EPA reviewer deemed the “ mosquitoes will gather ” statement as somehow separate from the core efficacy claim ( “ kills mosquitoes ” ) and thus did n’t request proof .
Regardless , the last part of the above passage still requires that such advisory statements are not false or misleading .
Second , perhaps the “ mosquitoes will gather ” claim is based on data from a cage experiment conducted inside a laboratory ?
I.e. , if large numbers of mosquitoes are trapped in a container with a Spartan Mosquito Pro Tech , maybe they do gather around the device simply because there ’s nothing else for mosquitoes to land on .
If that ’s the case , however , it would seem highly misleading to imply ( on all the labelling ) to consumers that mosquitoes will gather around the tubes when they are deployed outside .
100 % of the marketing suggests that the device attracts mosquitoes in yards .
Third , if the data supplied to the EPA was , in fact , from an outdoor experiment , maybe it ’s just untrustworthy .
I.e. , from an experiment that did n’t have controls or that lacked meaningful replication .
Or cherry - picked from multiple experiments where all but one showed no effect .
There are lots of way to conduct a bad experiment and to pitch the results as somehow fantastic .
I ’ve heard this was ( and is ) an issue for the Eradicator .
EXTRA : What about the “ kills mosquitoes ” claim ?
To gain approval for its label claim , Spartan Mosquito must have supplied some sort of data to the EPA that confirmed the device could kill mosquitoes .
But if the device does n’t attract mosquitoes present in a yard , how could it possibly kill them ??
I ’m speculating here , but if Spartan Mosquito did , indeed , test the devices inside cages , they might get a positive finding .
That ’s because the devices contain an aqueous solution of boric acid ( approximate 0.17 % , I think ) , and thus one would expect some boric acid to be present in the fumes that escape through the holes in the cap .
Those fumes could conceivably poison the mosquitoes trapped in the cage .
The lethality of the fumes might be extremely low , but I ’d wager the effect would be measurable when compared to a control cage that lacked those toxic fumes .
Does boric acid evaporate ?
Yes , the main source of boron in the atmosphere is due to evaporation of boric acid from oceans ( Park and Schlesinger 2002 ) .
More generally , evaporation of acids from aqueous solutions can even be used to retard bacterial and fungal growth of meat .
It would be interesting know what Spartan Mosquito ( or the researcher it hired ) used as the experimental control treatment .
One way to bias the experiments in favor of finding an effect is to simply use empty or water - only tubes as controls .
This is because fermentation itself causes acids to form , and those acids would be expected to enter the vapor phase and permeate the experimental cages .
That ’s in addition to the ethanol that enters the vapor phase , of course .
I.e. , mosquitoes trapped with a tube of fermenting sugar might have low survivorship because they were bathed in vapors that are mildly deleterious .
Again , such an effect would have nothing to do with mosquitoes squeezing through the holes and ingesting poison .
And , of course , the “ vapors killing the mosquitoes ” effect would n’t work at all when tubes are deployed in a yard .
If Spartan Mosquito did , in fact , test the device in cages , it would seem best to constrain its claims to “ causes mosquitoes in cages to gather ” and “ kills mosquitoes in cages ” .
Then if consumers had a problem a mosquito outbreak in their cages , perhaps the Pro Tech would be an attractive option .
EPA guidelines
I was curious so I dug around in the guidelines to see what type of experiments need to be done to establish efficacy .
Here ’s a screenshot from , “ Product Performance Test Guidelines OPPTS 810.3000 — General Considerations for Efficacy of Invertebrate Control Agents “ , that seems relevant :
The wording in the red - boxed sections suggests that the EPA allows laboratory experiments in place of experiments under actual conditions ( outside ) .
I could n’t find any directive from the EPA that required a company to clarify the conditions under which the efficacy data were collected .
Again , I do n’t have any information on what type of experiment Spartan Mosquito conducted .
The above is just to indicate that it may be possible that they did n’t conduct the test outdoors .
What does Spartan Mosquito say ?
In general , when consumers ask the company on Facebook how the device works , the company directs them to this webpage or this Facebook video .
Neither has information on how the device works or how well it works .
The company simply deletes any question it does not want to answer , and often blocks skeptical users who ask probing questions .
If you doubt me , try asking a scientific question on the company ’s Facebook page .
For example , “ What causes mosquitoes to gather around the tubes ? ”
Or try , “ Do you have any videos of mosquitoes gathering around the tubes when device is deployed in a yard ? ”
I ’d also like to see them answer , “ Under what conditions was the Pro Tech tested ? ”
The only details the company provides about efficacy is that device kills 95 % of mosquitoes .
Which is hard to believe .
Footage
Below is the video , separated into 16 segments due to size limits on YouTube .
https://youtu.be/X9P4VNVw9HQ
by Thom Hartmann , CommonDreams.org
According to James Madison , the “ Father of the Constitution , ” if a President were to order or allow the “ wanton removal of meritorious officers ” such as US attorneys , such an action “ would subject the President to impeachment and removal from his own high trust . ”
The issue of the firing of people within the Executive branch for political purposes came up during a debate in 1789 about how to create agencies within the Executive branch that would be consistent with Article II , Section 2 of the US Constitution , which says that the President can appoint people ( like US Attorneys / prosecutors ) , but they could n’t take office unless the Senate votes to confirm each individual appointment :
He [ the President ] shall have Power , by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate , to make Treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur ; and he shall nominate , and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate , shall appoint Ambassadors , other public Ministers and Consuls , Judges of the supreme Court , and all other Officers of the United States , whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for , and which shall be established by Law : but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers , as they think proper , in the President alone , in the Courts of Law , or in the Heads of Departments .
But if the President can nominate , and the Senate confirm somebody like a federal prosecutor , who can fire one ?
And what if they ’re fired for politcal purposes ?

The other night , I woke up with a start at 2 a.m .
Smoke was billowing through our bedroom window .
The winds had shifted and a wildfire blazing many miles away was getting worse .
Fear gripped me .
My mind panicked as I thought of all the possibilities of what might happen next .
Suddenly , however , I felt a deep sense of peace overcome me .
I noticed my breath .
I felt the beating of my heart .
I remembered that at that moment , I was okay .
My family was okay .
I did n’t know what was coming next , but I was comforted by my awareness that in that little point in time , there was still so much good .
That shift made all the difference .
There may have been a time in my life when I thought a quality life meant achieving a certain level of success .
Now , I look at life much differently .
I now believe living a quality life is about moments like these — moments when things are tough and somehow , we find our way to turn things around , from fear to calm , from blame to empathy , from distraction to clarity — moments when we can be grateful for all that is right even when so much seems wrong .
We might not do this all the time — most of us do n’t .
It ’s natural to complain or feel fearful when times are tough .
We might not act exactly as we want to .
We might make mistakes , lots of them .
We might not do things perfectly .
But when we get off track , I think the secret to a quality life lies in discovering how to find our way back , to turn things around , to do the hard thing even when we do n’t want to , to make amends , find the silver lining , and sit with ourselves and others even when we feel afraid .
To help us do this more often — create turnarounds in our lives — I have found that asking ourselves these nine questions can help .
Here are 9 questions you can ask yourself to improve your quality of life .
1. What Do You Value ?
If life were to end or change dramatically for you today , what would you hold most dear ?
What would be most important to you ?
What matters most ?

Our lives become richer when we ask ourselves this question often and challenge ourselves to reflect those values daily in the choices we make , thoughts we think , and words we say , day in and day out .
We might get distracted or off track , we might forget , but the more we connect with what matters most to us personally , the better our lives become .
2. What Unique Gift Do People Receive By Just Being Around You ?
Sometimes , we get so caught up in life that we forget one core truth — we are unique , and as a result of that uniqueness , we each have something to offer others and the world that no one else can .
That is hugely important .
You matter .
You have value that has absolutely nothing to do with what you have achieved .
Your value is simply a result of being who you are .
Who are you , really ?
Who are you when no one else is around and you are doing something you love doing just for the sheer joy of it ?
Who are you when you are alone with your thoughts ?
Who were you when you were a small child enchanted by wonder for our world ?
When you are just being you , connected to your highest self , without worrying what other people think , what do you feel like ?
What is your energy like ?
What is it like to be you ?
What is like for others who are around you when you are in that state ?
This is your gift .
One thing I know for sure : the more you are able to connect with that energy — that essence of who you are — and accept and let it shine , the better your life becomes .
Guaranteed .
3. What Do You Stand For ?
If someone you love needed your help during a very difficult time , what would you want them to know ?
What advice would you offer that would make a difference ?
What is your personal message — the thing that answers most dilemmas in your life and in your opinion — that can help others the most ?
I believe living a quality life is all about spreading our unique message , wisdom , and encouragement in whatever form it comes to us as often as possible through our actions , energy , and words .
4. Who Do You Love Most ?
When we are in crisis , who matters most to us becomes clear .
Right now , at this moment , who are the people you most love and care about ?
Whom would you miss most if they were gone ?
Advertising
The more we put our full energies into our relationships with these people — striving to be the best parent , partner , and friend we can be — the better our lives become .
This means nurturing and cultivating these relationships , learning to listen , reaching out , telling others we care , and asking how others are .
Cultivating depth in our relationships comes from being willing to learn from others , noticing the unique value they offer , and expressing gratitude .
Truly loving means letting go of the small stuff , setting loving boundaries , doing our own work , having empathy and understanding , giving of our full selves , and reminding these special friends and family members as often as possible how much they mean to us .
The words “ I love you , ” looking at each other in the eyes and deeply connecting by being present , paying attention , and really listening can make miracles happen in our relationships and our lives .
5. What Brings You Joy ?
What truly brings you pleasure , the kind that goes deep ?
Is it the balance in your checkbook or when a baby reaches out her hand and offers you a cheerio or a puppy leaps a toy ?
Is it your ribbons and trophies , or is it the rush you get when you are creating or doing something you love completely in your creative zone ?
Do you find joy when looking at photos of all the places you want to travel to someday , or looking around at the absolute miraculous beauty of where you are in this moment — like the wildflower sprouting up through a crack in the concrete or the way the sunlight is hitting your kitchen window ?
The more we focus on what is good about our lives in each moment with gratitude and honor those things that truly bring us joy , the more our joy expands .
6. What Makes You Laugh About Yourself ?
True humility comes with a sense of humor .
When we realize how funny our foibles are , we stop taking them so seriously .
What ’s a mistake you recently made ?
What ’s something totally embarrassing and human you have done ?
What ’s goofy about you that makes you chuckle ?
Advertising
When we gain the ability to soften around our humanity — to stop trying so hard to be perfect or the most beautiful , productive , successful or best and instead embrace ourselves just as we are — there is a softness about us that naturally leads us to be more likable , understanding , and loving toward others .
This is not the bully kind of laughing at your self that is mean and critical .
This is the sheepish kind of laughter that is kind and magnetic , the sort of humility when we do n’t take ourselves too seriously and are authentically okay with not always being okay .
When we dare to see and accept ourselves — all of ourselves , the quality of our lives improve .
7. What Do You Really Want to Create ?
Having a sense of purpose makes life better .
Research backs this up .
Research has shown that even at the end of life , having a project that gives a sense of purpose improves the quality of life .
It also makes us more confident .
We remember our value .
We remember we matter .
And we have something worthwhile to dive into when we need a positive distraction .
What is something you really , really want to create ?
What is something you want to create for others to enjoy ?
What is a pursuit that makes your heart sing ?
It does n’t have to be your job or business .
It might be a garden or an artistic project .
It might be creating a beautiful nurturing home .
Whatever it is , make time for whatever it is that your soul is calling you to create in this moment , this week , and this lifetime .
Pouring your whole self into it will make your life better .
8. What Is n’t Working ( and What Are You Doing About It ) ?
What are those small things that are nagging you ?
What are you doing about them ?
Rather than complaining ( which we all do ) , what ’s your plan ?
What can you do today to start fixing them ?
There is so much in our lives that are out of our control , but there is a lot that is in our control that we often do n’t take time to do .
The small stuff matters , whether it ’s clutter , wanting to be more in shape , or cleaning up your neighborhood .
If there ’s something you find yourself complaining about a lot ( even if it ’s just in the privacy of your mind ) , what is one simple step you can take today to improve it ?
Advertising
Little steps go a long way when done consistently and strung all together .
Just for today , choose to do one small thing to make your life better .
Maybe your biggest complaint will one day become your greatest turn - around story .
9 . What Helps You Turn Things Around ?
What is your unique strategy for turning things around when life is n’t going as well as you ’d like it to ?
What helps you to reach out , forgive , repair relationships , or find things to be grateful for in difficult moments ?
What helps you turn around when you ’re heading down a path towards being in a bad mood ?
What helps you change your mindset , take your power back when feeling overwhelmed , and choose to do good in the world and your own heart ?
There is not a simple formula for living a quality of life .
Only you know what works best for you .
Only you can turn your mood , relationships , self - care , and life around .
Only you can change a ho - hum moment into one of the best of your life .
Final Thoughts
Asking the above nine questions can help you uncover your personal formula for improving the quality of your life .
You might want to bookmark this article and over the next nine days , ask yourself one of these questions , one per day .
Journal about it , discuss it with a friend .
Be on the lookout for your personal ah - has .
You already have the formula you need to improve the quality of your life .
You just have to uncover it and apply what your soul already knows about how to create the best life for you .

The war in Iraq is , as expected , one of the threshhold issues of the 2008 presidential election .

Biden Opposes a Troop Increase in Iraq ( Dec. 27 , 2006 ) VOTED YES IN 2002 , NOW OPPOSED

And the fact of the matter is , we went too soon .
We went without sufficient force .
And we went without a plan .

PHASED REDEPLOYMENT WITH DECENTRALIZATION
[ T ]he real question is , are we going to be able to leave Iraq , get our troops out and leave behind something other than chaos ?
In order to do that , the president should start off by not vetoing the language ... saying begin to draw down American troops right now , and move toward a political solution .
Look , there 's only one way .
You got to change the fundamental premise of this engagement , and that is , you got to decentralize Iraq , you got to give the regions control over their own destiny , give them control over their own police forces , their own identity , and have a limited central government and share their oil wealth .

What is needed is a comprehensive political process .

WITHDRAWAL BY END OF 2007
This is what I would do if I were president today .
I would withdraw all of our troops , including residual troops , by the end of this calendar year .

One , a political framework led by the United States where the three religious entities in Iraq have a coalition government .... Number two , I would convene a security conference , and I would invite Iran and Syria ...
And thirdly , I would have a donor conference .
I would have other countries take over the reconstruction responsibility and the security of Iraq .

THEY are the first on the block with the latest gizmo .
They think nothing of paying $ 750 for a Nokia N95 — that ultimate of go - anywhere , cell - cum - everything accoutrements .
They upload digital content to social networks like YouTube , MySpace and Flickr .
They write blogs at home , use wikis at work and gorge on one - segment telly on their mobiles when not talking or texting .
They are the Early Adopters — the 8 % of consumers who cheerfully pay through the nose for the bragging rights of having the latest and greatest of gadgets .
Their opposites are just as easy to spot .
The Laggards and Luddites are slow or reluctant to embrace new technology because they can't afford it , are n't interested in it , or actually fear and loathe it .
As a group , they are apparently much bigger than previously imagined .
In a comprehensive study of how consumers use technology , the Pew Internet & American Life Project reported earlier this week that a surprising 49 % of adult Americans fall into this category .
Even the researchers were surprised .
John Horrigan , Pew 's associate director for research , was quoted as saying that , when he started the survey , he assumed that the more digital appliances people had , the more they would embrace the technology — and the more they would participate in generating and sharing digital content with the rest of the world .
That turned out not to be the case .
What he found instead was a lot of tension towards technology , even among those with gadgets galore and high - speed internet connections .
The recent introduction of a range of digital tools and services that let people express themselves online and participate in the “ commons of cyberspace ” is being heralded as the next phase of the information society .
The digirati have labelled this new form of online interactivity as Web 2.0 — to distinguish it from the one - way browsing , searching and shopping metaphor of the original internet .
Yet , despite the implications for society in general and family life in particular , little is known about who uses Web 2.0's new social networks and how .
To remedy this , the Pew researchers polled some 4,000 adult Americans to learn about their relationship to information and communications technology ( ICT ) .
The pollsters asked them how they used computers , the internet , mobile phones as well as digital cameras , video cameras , webcams , MP3 players and personal digital assistants .
They queried respondents on what they downloaded , whether they generated their own digital content , and what else they used their computers and mobile phones for .
Finally , the researchers solicited views on whether ICT helped people become more productive , pursue their hobbies , keep up with family and friends , and gain greater control over their lives .
The survey identified a rich variety of Web 2.0 users and non-users .
A third of the sample turned out to be elite consumers who owned lots of gadgets and were heavy users of the internet and mobile services .
Within the group , many generated their own digital content , and all seemed satisfied with the way ICT had improved their lives .
Another group , a fifth of the total , were middle - of - the - road users who were more focused on getting things done than expressing themselves .
Half of this particular group found ICT satisfyingly handy , while the other half used it but felt themselves hassled by the technology .
AFP
More savvy than many Americans
But it was those with few bits of modern gadgetry , accounting for almost half the total , who provided the greatest pause for thought .
Despite having mobile phones and online access , some were merely inexperienced .
Others were indifferent to the technology or found it annoying .
Others still ( some 15 % of the total ) had neither mobile phones nor internet connections , relying instead on television and traditional telephones .
Two questions explored people 's attitudes about technology , with encouraging results .
The first asked whether respondents felt overloaded with information these days , given all the TV news shows , magazines , newspapers and computer - information services .
Some 27 % said they did , but a healthy 67 % said they enjoyed having so much choice .
The other question addressed whether people think that information and computer technology gives them more or less control over their lives .
Some 48 % welcomed ICT for helping them gain greater control over their lives , while 29 % said it made no difference and only 16 % thought it made things worse .
What emerges from the Pew study is that it is difficult to make generalisations about attitudes to technology .
Some people may have lots of information appliances , use them frequently for a range of purposes and like what the technology does for them .
Others may have relatively few of the latest gadgets , use what they have only modestly and find the technology to be more of a burden than a blessing .
In between lies a wide variety of attitudes that make pigeon - holing people nigh impossible .
For instance , your correspondent admits to having all eight of the gadgets used to define the survey 's topology , and to have participated , at one time or another , in each of the online activities highlighted .
But he has never considered himself an Early Adopter , still less the Omnivore that Pew 's online quiz labels him .
He likes to think of himself as a Just - In - Time Adopter , who waits until all the initial bugs have been squished and the price has tumbled to a more realistic level .
Out of curiosity , Tech.view would like to hear from readers who have taken the Pew quiz — and feel it is an accurate assessment of their techno - wizardry or not .

Schumer : Gonzales will face no -confidence vote Schumer , center , accompanied by Sens .
Whitehouse , left , and Feinstein , announced Thursday the Senate will hold a no-confidence vote on Attorney General Gonzales .
The non-binding measure likely will be considered in mid-June , unless the immigration legislation runs into problems .

Clozapine is the only drug option for a fifth with schizophrenia
A Manchester University study shows patients respond just as well , and perhaps better , to the older ones .
The Archives of General Psychiatry findings run contrary to the widely held view that newer and dearer drugs are safer and more effective .
But critics say the newer drugs are better and preferred by patients because they have fewer side effects .
Second - generation anti-psychotics are not the great breakthrough they were once thought to be
Professor Shôn Lewis
The new UK results back similar work by US investigators who recently suggested it might be better to switch back to prescribing the older drugs to cut healthcare costs .
The NHS funded the latest work to assess whether the bigger price tag of newer " atypical " antipsychotics was offset by improvements in patients ' quality of life or reductions in the use of health and social care services .
Atypical antipsychotics , which include risperidone , quetiapine , clozapine and olanzapine , cost at least 10 times more than their predecessors .
No advantage
The Manchester team , along with colleagues from the University of Cambridge , Institute of Psychiatry and Imperial College London , studied 227 schizophrenia patients for whom a change in drug treatment was being considered because of ineffectiveness or harmful side effects .
Experienced doctors decided which type of antipsychotic - newer or older - would be best for each patient .
The patients were assessed before and 12 , 26 and 52 weeks after their drugs were switched , using measurements of quality of life , symptoms , side effects , and satisfaction with the drug .
Overall , the newer atypical drugs showed no advantage in side effects or effectiveness .
Lead researcher Professor Shôn Lewis suggested further trials to evaluate the usefulness of cheaper , older drugs could potentially save the NHS millions of pounds .
He said : " Despite modern prescribing patterns , second - generation anti-psychotics are not the great breakthrough they were once thought to be - and certainly may not justify their 10 - times higher price tag . "
A parallel trial , also funded by the NHS , did confirm previous reports that one newer antipsychotic called clozapine stood out from the other atypicals for treating severe schizophrenia .
Informed choice
Jo Loughran , of the mental health charity Rethink , said both types of drugs old and new could bring different benefits and side effects for different people .
She said : " Atypical antipsychotic medicines should always be considered in the first - line treatment of schizophrenia , and patients should be offered an informed choice of medicines to suit them . "
The government 's drugs watchdog NICE echoes this advice .
However , it also says people with schizophrenia who are already taking an older antipsychotic which is working for them should not switch to a newer drug .
Marjorie Wallace , chief executive of the mental health charity SANE , warned it would be wrong to limit accessibility to news anti-psychotics .
" What we hope is that the study will flag up the importance of patients being able to look at the risks and benefits of different drugs , matched to their own biochemistry , and that it will encourage the pharmaceutical companies in their current research to develop third - generation medications . "
Mr Miliband said annual targets would not be ' sensible '
The draft Climate Change Bill calls for an independent panel to set ministers a " carbon budget " every five years , in a bid to cut emissions by 60 % by 2050 .
If they miss the figure , future governments could be taken to court .
The Tories and Lib Dems welcomed the proposals , but said carbon budgets should be set annually .
Mr Miliband has said annual targets would be too rigid to make allowances for climate variations .
He hailed the draft bill as " the first of its kind in any country " , and said Britain was " leading by example " .
' Rolling targets '
The draft legislation will go to public and parliamentary consultation before becoming law next year , but environmental campaigners want to raise the 2050 target to 80 % and set annual 3 % cut targets to ensure compliance .
Current government support for renewable energy has descended into a farce
Sian Berry , Green Party
Analysis : Binding targets ?
Q&A : Climate Bill
Shadow environment secretary Peter Ainsworth , for the Conservatives , said the proposals were a " welcome step forward , " although he said some " key elements " were missing at present .
" We would like to see a system of rolling annual rate of change targets - rather than targets set for five - year periods - to ensure that the UK remains on track towards a low carbon economy and to ensure true accountability .
" There is a danger that the five - year approach will enable responsibility for failure to be shunted on from one government to another . "
But he added it would be a " great help " in international climate change negotiations " to be able to say , ' look we are making binding legal commitments " .
Solar power
The carbon reduction targets will be based on advice by an independent committee .
HAVE YOUR SAY
I think these proposals are paying lip service and wo n't go far enough
Anne , Sevenoaks
Send us your comments
If future governments fail to achieve the targets , they could be taken to court , with a judicial review deciding what punishment - if any - to hand out .
The draft bill does not stipulate how the cuts should be made , or give specific reduction targets for individual businesses , councils and households .
Mr Miliband said there were " big decisions " to be made on issues such as using nuclear power .
He added : " In the end I do n't care where the carbon reduction comes from .
It 's about the public interest and the market finding it . "
The government plans include :
Targets to reduce carbon emissions by 60 % by 2050 , from 1990 levels , and between 26 % and 32 % by 2020
Greater energy efficiency , with more consumers becoming " producers " of their own energy at home
Investment in low - carbon fuels and technologies , such as carbon capture and storage , wind , wave and solar power
Carbon " budgets " - which cap emissions levels - set every five years
Volkswagen and Google develop revolutionary navigation system

Volkswagen and Google are working together to develop a revolutionary new navigation system .
Together with the graphics card manufacturer nVidia , a revolutionary new navigation system is being developed in Volkswagen 's Electronics Research Laboratory ( ERL ) in Palo Alto , California .
This new system uses data from Google Earth to generate 3 - dimensional images of the route .
Moreover , the navigation system can gather online data to provide the driver with important real - time information , for example about the traffic situation or weather .
Volkswagen , Google and nVidia have been working on developing this new navigation system since October 2005 .
In January 2006 at the Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) in Las Vegas , the partnership was able to present its first prototype , which comes closer to " virtual reality travel information " than any other system seen to date .
The central element is a touch - screen interface linked to Google Earth .
Precise 3 - dimensional maps , real - time traffic and route guidance updates and a search function set new standards in navigation technology .
This so - called " open system " integrates the internet to meet the individual requirements of the driver and his passengers .
The prototype enjoys three important advantages over today 's systems .
Firstly : the 3 - dimensional , photorealistic display of the surrounding area makes intuitive orientation easier for the driver and his passengers .
Secondly : important real - time data are fed into the system through a link to the internet .
This means that , for example , traffic data and weather reports , but also any other information relevant to planning the journey such as filling stations , their opening times and current fuel prices are available , enhancing comfort , safety and reliability for the journey .
Thirdly : a further online link coupled to the search function allows the driver and his passengers to receive specific information about special features en route and at the destination – hotels , restaurants , cinemas and theatres are feasible examples .
The driver and his passengers can even receive shopping data , right down to current prices , through the innovative navigation system .
All such data is shown on the display .
At present , this innovative system is still in the development phase – no decision has yet been made about a possible series production launch .
Based in Palo Alto , California , the ERL is the Volkswagen Group 's central research centre in the USA .
In the heart of Silicon Valley , it is able to work directly with globally leading high - tech and start - up companies .
The close working relationship between the ERL and these partners facilitates the design and development of innovative features and applications , which are then applied to test vehicles of the Volkswagen Group brands for further analysis .

I have called this discipline “ quirkology ” – the use of scientific methods to study quirky human behaviour , or quirky methods to probe weightier topics .
Having conducted quirkological research for more than 15 years , on subjects such as luck , jokes and dating , I wish to pay homage to the small band of dedicated academics who have kept the quirky flag flying .
Here are my eight favourite studies made in the pursuit of peculiar knowledge .
Hell hath no fury like …
John Trinkaus of the Zicklin School of Business in the City University of New York studies ordinary people going about their everyday lives – a rich seam for quirkological research , as you might imagine .
One of his specialities is the study of minor acts of dishonesty and antisocial behaviour .
In his 25 years of research , one demographical group has come to …
If substantial amounts of polonium 210 were used to poison Alexander V. Litvinenko , whoever did it presumably had access to a high - level nuclear laboratory and put himself at some risk carrying out the assassination , experts said yesterday .
Polonium 210 is highly radioactive and very toxic .
By weight , it is about 250 million times as toxic as cyanide , so a particle smaller than a dust mote could be fatal .
It would also , presumably , be too small to taste .
There is no antidote , and handling it in a laboratory requires special equipment .
But to be fatal it must be swallowed , breathed in or injected ; the alpha particles it produces cannot penetrate the skin .
So it could theoretically be carried safely in a glass vial or paper envelope and sprinkled into food or drink by a killer willing to take the chance that he did not accidentally breathe it in or swallow it .
“ This is wild , ” said Dr. F. Lee Cantrell , a toxicologist and director of the San Diego division of the California Poison Control System .
“ To my knowledge , it ’s never been employed as a poison before .
And it ’s such an obscure thing .
It ’s not easy to get .
That ’s going to be something like the K.G.B. would have in some secret facility or something . ”
Microsoft Windows Vista RTM
Windows Vista has finally gone RTM !
That 's short for Release To Manufacturing , tech parlance for the final or gold version of the product .
Although end -users will not be able to buy it off the shelves until January 30th , 2007 ; Windows Vista is already available to corporate users .
In fact , Tech ARP was treated to a sneak preview which also doubled as a launch for Office 2007 , Vista and Exchange Server 2007 or L.O.V.E , for businesses .
Who said geeks are n't creative ?
So , yes , Windows Vista is finally completed and is available to businesses right now .
We only have to wait until January 30th , 2007 to get our own copy of Windows Vista .
Earlier , we did a comprehensive review on Windows Vista Beta 2 .
If you compared that review with what we will cover today , you will be able to see just how much work has gone into polishing Windows Vista before it is rolled out to end - users like us .
Although we had already migrated to Vista Release Candidate 2 ( RC2 ) for our desktops , we were still surprised at the changes in the final version of Windows Vista .
Some surprises were nice and others , oh well , were less desirable .
So , join us on this review of the final , shipping version of Microsoft Windows Vista .
This is exactly what you will get when you buy a copy of Windows Vista on January 30th , 2007 .
So , What 's New in Vista ?
Today , we will only be touching on what 's new in Windows Vista RTM , compared to Beta 2 .
We suggest you to read our Windows Vista Beta 2 review first , as we will not be covering features already covered in our earlier review .
While there are a few changes in the UI ( user interface ) , most of the features we covered in the Beta 2 review has been retained in the final version .
Any changes from Beta 2 to RC1 , RC2 or even RTM will be highlighted in this review .
Installation
For this review , we installed Windows Vista RTM on two machines - a server and a desktop PC .
Here are their specifications :
Desktop PC Server Processor  Pentium 4 1.9GHz ( Overclocked )  Pentium 4 3.2GHz HT Memory  1024MB DDR SDRAM  2048 MB ECC DDR2 SDRAM Graphics Card  NVIDIA GeForce FX5200 ( 128 MB )  Intel Extreme Graphics 2 Hard Drives  80 GB hard drive ( 7200 RPM )
 40GB hard drive ( 7200 RPM )  RAID array of two 160 GB HDD ( 7200 RPM ) drives
Although the installation of any new operating system can be a real nightmare , you will be happy to know that it will take only you about 8 steps to get Windows Vista to begin installation .
In addition , Vista will not need any further input until it boots up for the first time .
For a foolproof guide on installing Windows Vista , please take a look at our Installing Windows Vista For N00bs guide .
You can not go wrong if you follow it .
Although the installation interface was nice and the installation procedure pretty straightforward , we felt that Microsoft could have consolidated several of the steps .
That would have reduced the number of steps required for a user to set up Windows Vista .
A clean Windows Vista installation takes up about 5 GB of hard drive space .
That is about 2.5GB less than the Beta 2 version .
Even with all that amazing trimming Microsoft did prior to the final release , Windows Vista still appears bloated , especially to oldtimers who have experienced the " miracle " of booting up MS - DOS from a single floppy disk .
But with the cost of hard drive storage so low these days , 5GB really is n't as bad as it sounds .
Furthermore , we installed the Ultimate Edition , which is the mother of all Windows Vista editions .
Installing other versions of Windows Vista will consume less storage space .
Fred Thompson writes in the Wall Street Journal on the connection between lower tax rates and economic growth :
The results of the experiment that began when Congress passed a series of tax - rate cuts in 2001 and 2003 are in .
Supporters of those cuts said they would stimulate the economy .
Opponents predicted ever - increasing budget deficits and national bankruptcy unless tax rates were increased , especially on the wealthy .
In fact , Treasury statistics show that tax revenues have soared and the budget deficit has been shrinking faster than even the optimists projected .
Since the first tax cuts were passed , when I was in the Senate , the budget deficit has been cut in half .
Remarkably , this has happened despite the financial trauma of 9/11 and the cost of the War on Terror .
The deficit , compared to the entire economy , is well below the average for the last 35 years and , at this rate , the budget will be in surplus by 2010 .
Perhaps the most fascinating thing about this success story is where the increased revenues are coming from .
Critics claimed that across - the - board tax cuts were some sort of gift to the rich but , on the contrary , the wealthy are paying a greater percentage of the national bill than ever before .
The richest 1 % of Americans now pays 35 % of all income taxes .
The top 10 % pay more taxes than the bottom 60 % .
Go on , admit it : you hate your boss .
You do .
The way they accost you with : " It 'll just take five minutes " as you 're trying to leave .
The way they smile patronisingly when they read your appraisal request for more training .
Just them having power over you for eight hours every day is enough to make you spit with fury .
But at least we 're not alone in our angst .
It seems bosses are also a bit cross : they hate us , too .
All of us .
Even when we bring them coffee .
And , according to Sandi Mann , senior lecturer in occupational psychology at the University of Central Lancashire , they may have a point .
" A generation ago , people worked their way up the ladder , hierarchy was based on age and experience , and it was more respected , " she says .
" Now , people may be brought in [ as bosses ] who are seen as the ' young whippersnappers ' or ' from outside ' so there is much more resentment than there used to be - which makes it much difficult to manage effectively . "
And that 's not all .
In the days before open - plan offices and team - bonding days , managers were better protected from us oiks .
" Managers used to be more remote , with their own staffrooms and canteens , and there used to be more middle management , " Mann says .
" But now , they are expected to be the authority figure and ' one of the lads ' as it were , and it 's not always easy to get that balance right . "
The result of all this is that while your boss might look like she 's fine , inside she 's seething .
You think you hate your boss ?
Here are the top 10 things your boss hates about YOU .
1. Lateness
Everyone has days when the bus breaks down , the washing machine packs up , or the alarm does n't go off .
The problem is that some people have those days Monday through Friday .
But what really cheeses off your boss is your lame excuse .
" It shows you do n't care , " says Louis Halpern , CEO at advertising agency Halpern Cowan .
" Why they can't just tell you that they find it hard to get out of bed and be done with it I do n't know .
It really makes me furious . "
2. Lack of initiative
" Do n't ask me if you should buy lunch for the client , if the client is coming at noon , " said one infuriated manager .
" Call up the client and ask if they want lunch . "
Actually that 's not quite what he said : there was a lot more swearing in the original version .
Managers absolutely hate being bothered by stuff that really , if you thought about it for even a second , you could work out for yourself .
They also hate constant updates and being CCd in on everything .
They pay you to do a job - get on with it ...
3 . Too much initiative
... unless you 're an idiot .
A marketing manager for a large educational charity reports that if there 's one thing worse than lack of initiative , it 's completely ignoring instructions to go off and do something else instead .
She recently found herself on stage , ready to announce the winner of an award .
When the person responsible for counting the votes turned up , he showed off a new , whizzy and completely redundant colour - coded method for counting the votes .
Unfortunately , devising the new programme meant he had n't actually had time to ... count the votes .
4. Bitching and whining
So Julie from third floor might not have said hello to you this morning , and that might well be because she 's an unfriendly cow , but in the context of say , the war in Iraq , does it really merit a four - hour disquisition ?
Your boss does n't think so .
On the other hand , while bitching is bad , whining is worse .
" What really annoys me is when we buy new equipment or take everyone out , and all I hear the next day is ' We should have bought a bigger TV ' or ' We could have gone to a nicer restaurant ' " says Halpern .
" And that 's when we 've spent £ 5,000 . "
5. Disloyalty
Although none of the managers came out and said that they hated their staff for talking over them in meetings , pointing out their errors in public , or preventing the bonus - related project coming in on time , Mann says it 's a major issue .
" People used to close ranks , but it does n't happen quite as much as it used to , " she says .
" Managers usually feel obliged to look after their staff , but if their staff do n't feel the same way , the lack of loyalty is always a problem for the boss . "
6. Lack of passion .
Or interest
It might come as a surprise to you , but your boss has a life outside work .
They too find it hard to get up in the morning .
And they find the managing director 's speeches as boring as you do .
But they have to stay motivated , because they are the boss .
So , when you fall asleep in meetings , can't remember the names of your accounts and tell them it does n't matter whether the email goes today or tomorrow , it reminds them that they do n't really give a toss either , but that it 's their job to make themselves , and you , care .
Then they get really , really irritated .
7 . Trying to be their best friend
They do n't want to go down the pub with you , they do n't want to hear about what you really think of their boss , and they most certainly do n't want to know what happened between you and Andy in the loos last Friday .
They like you , but they know from bitter experience that if they show too much interest , you 'll start treating them like a friend and refuse to take orders .
8. Petty lying
Saying that you missed the call because your mobile has run out of power .
That you did n't get the email .
That you 've sent the report but there must be a technical glitch .
That the meeting has run over and it's not worth you coming back to the office .
That you 've lost two big taxi receipts .
That you 're working from home today .
That you have to go to a funeral , the dentist , the doctor , your mum 's house , your best friend 's cousin 's wedding .
Whatever .
The biggest insult is that you think they believe you .
9. Childishness
I 'm paraphrasing , but the key message here is : " I 'm not your mum .
Do n't email me about the brand of toilet paper in the loo .
Do n't leave the kitchen in a mess .
Do n't ask me for a new biro .
I 'm not going to clean up after you and I do n't care about this crap . "
You get the idea .
10 .
Wanting their job
They spend all their time and energy trying to protect you from the higher - uppers , you spend all your energy complaining about them .
And then , on top of that , you want their job ?
Unforgivable .
July 7 , 2006
By : Paul Krugman
The nature of the right - wing attack on The New York Times — an attack not on the newspaper ’s judgment , but on its motives — seems to have startled many people in the news media .
After an editorial in The Wall Street Journal declared that The Times has what amount to treasonous intentions — that it “ has as a major goal not winning the war on terror but obstructing it ” —
The Journal ’s own political editor pronounced himself “ shocked , ” saying that “ I do n’t know anybody on the news staff of The Wall Street Journal that believes that . ”
But anyone who was genuinely shocked by The Journal ’s willingness to play the treason card must not have been paying attention these past five years .
Over the last few months a series of revelations have confirmed what should have been obvious a long time ago : the Bush administration and the movement it leads have been engaged in an authoritarian project , an effort to remove all the checks and balances that have heretofore constrained the executive branch .
Much of this project involves the assertion of unprecedented executive authority — the right to imprison people indefinitely without charges ( and torture them if the administration feels like it ) , the right to wiretap American citizens without court authorization , the right to declare , when signing laws passed by Congress , that the laws do n’t really mean what they say .
But an almost equally important aspect of the project has been the attempt to create a political environment in which nobody dares to criticize the administration or reveal inconvenient facts about its actions .
And that attempt has relied , from the beginning , on ascribing treasonous motives to those who refuse to toe the line .
As far back as 2002 , Rush Limbaugh , in words very close to those used by The Wall Street Journal last week , accused Tom Daschle , then the Senate majority leader , of a partisan “ attempt to sabotage the war on terrorism . ”
Those of us who tried to call attention to this authoritarian project years ago have long marveled over the reluctance of many of our colleagues to acknowledge what was going on .
For example , for a long time many people in the mainstream media applied a peculiar double standard to political speech , denouncing perfectly normal if forceful political rhetoric from the left as poisonous “ Bush hatred , ” while chuckling indulgently over venom from the right .
( That Ann Coulter , she ’s such a kidder . )
But now the chuckling has stopped : somehow , nobody seems to find calls to send Bill Keller to the gas chamber funny .
And while the White House clearly believes that attacking The Times is a winning political move , it does n’t have to turn out that way — not if enough people realize what ’s at stake .
For I think that most Americans still believe in the principle that the president is n’t a king , that he is n’t entitled to operate without checks and balances .
And President Bush is especially unworthy of our trust , because on every front — from his refusal to protect chemical plants to his officials ’ exposure of Valerie Plame , from his toleration of war profiteering to his decision to place the C.I.A. in the hands of an incompetent crony — he has consistently played politics with national security .
And he has done so with the approval and encouragement of the same people now attacking The New York Times for its alleged lack of patriotism .
Does anyone remember the editorial that The Wall Street Journal published on Sept. 19 , 2001 ?
“ So much for Florida , ” the editorial began , celebrating the way the terrorist attack had pushed aside concerns over the legitimacy of the Supreme Court decision that installed Mr. Bush in the White House .
The Journal then warned Mr. Bush not to give in to the “ temptation ” to “ subjugate everything else to the priority of getting bipartisan support for the war on terrorism . ”
Instead , it urged him to use the “ political capital ” generated by the atrocity to push through tax cuts and right - wing judicial appointments .
Things have changed since then : Mr. Bush ’s ability to wrap his power grab in the flag has diminished now that most Americans no longer consider him either competent or honest .
But the administration and its supporters still believe that they can win political battles by impugning the patriotism of those who wo n’t go along .
For the sake of our country , let ’s hope that they ’re wrong .

My txt setup Merlin Mann | Dec 12 2005
The explications continue .
It 's been a while since I talked about how I 'm using text files , and my post a while ago on Quicksilver appending reminded me of a few little changes I 've made over the past year or so that my fellow text geeks might find interesting .
Reviewing : Why text ?
Like a lot of geeks and aspirational geeks , I do as many things as possible in plain text files .
I 've endlessly sung the praises of text on 43 F , but in a nutshell , they 're portable , efficient , tiny , and almost endlessly mungible .
They 're the lingua franca of Unix and most of the civilized world .
As you 'll see , I use text files for any variety of things , although my favorite use is for making and maintaining lists .
The aforementioned append functionality lets me quickly add items to any file with nothing but muscle memory and a few keystrokes .
Best thing ever .
I also write in text files as well as store large amounts of reference information .
Text is very easy to swap into HTML ( I keep almost everything in Markdown format ) , and text is wonderfully searchable , whether using Spotlight , Find & Replace , or just via incremental search from within the editor .
Point being : I use applications like OmniOutliner , iCal , and ( formerly ) Entourage to organize the relationships between silos in my life ; but text files are the living repositories for as much of the actual information as I can manage .
Getting a system
Like everything , this text system benefits from a loose organizational framework that lets me quickly create and change files without having to worry too much about what it 's called , where it goes , and how I 'll find it again .
So here 's a few high points from my text world .
One and only one place I 've whittled down to a single folder for all my active text files with just two sub- directories , " Archives " and " Old . " " Old " is simply where I dragged every text file I was pretty sure was dead or obviated ( but you never know ) , and " Archives " is where I put the dearly - departed since making the move to the one folder to rule them all .
Archiving is done ... well ... whenever
I feel like it or notice that the top txt directory is starting to seem a little wooly .
Everything else sits in one directory .
I use a little system of " meta symbols " and intuitive naming to keep things organized in the one big folder .
A smart name Nearly all my files are named according to this structure : Metasymbol SphereOfLife Project UniqueIntuitiveFilename VersionNumber .txt where : Metasymbol tells me whether the file is a running list , a reference file , or a static document ( more on this in a minute )
tells me whether the file is a running list , a reference file , or a static document ( more on this in a minute ) Sphere of Life is simply something like " work " or " home " or " 43 folders " -- any über - silo that represents , say , 20 % or more of your time and attention ( hint : abbreviations are good here )
is simply something like " work " or " home " or " 43 folders " -- any über - silo that represents , say , 20 % or more of your time and attention ( hint : abbreviations are good here )
Project is what it sounds like : " Make - Articles " or " Johns - Site " or whatever ( hint : abbreviations are good here too )
is what it sounds like : " Make - Articles " or " Johns - Site " or whatever ( hint : abbreviations are good here too )
The unique file name is the first and most intuitive name that pops into my head , sometimes augmented with redundant acronyms , etc .
For me it 's important to be able to find stuff quickly in Quicksilver , so I leave big fat hooks that account for whatever I 'm likely to be looking for in the future
is the first and most intuitive name that pops into my head , sometimes augmented with redundant acronyms , etc .
For me it 's important to be able to find stuff quickly in Quicksilver , so I leave big fat hooks that account for whatever I 'm likely to be looking for in the future Version number is a slick little trick of mine .
When I start a new version of a document , instead of adding a " 2 " or " 3 " to the most recent copy , I simply duplicate the document , then timestamp the old one -- ala " + work haa site design proposal - 2005 - 12-12_08-16-34.txt " .
That way I always know the unversioned copy is the most recent , but I still have backups I can roll back to any time .
Neato .
Meta symbols
I 've discovered I have three basic kinds of text files , and chose a simple method for marking the type of files they are for quick visual cueing .
This is super helpful for winnowing file names in Quicksilver : I start by typing one of these unusual ( non-alpha - numeric ) characters , and I can instantly pop to just a list of the types of files I want to see .
Running lists
Running lists are the majority of my files .
They 're the kinds of lists that I mentioned in the appending article -- ongoing places to park ideas of any kind over time .
They begin with a " > " .
This is , as with all these , purely my own convention , so you should feel free to pick symbols that make sense for you .
This yields file names like : > broken. txt - items or functionalities in my world that need repair or fixes
- items or functionalities in my world that need repair or fixes > mom birthday gift ideas .
txt - ways to delight the one what brung me
- ways to delight the one what brung me > webdav wish list and questions .
txt - little projects for my newfound favorite technology Reference Reference items are evergreen and reusable content that I update fairly infrequently and refer to as needed .
^ work resume.
txt
^ 43 f site bio.txt
^ work domains I 'm not using .
txt Static files
These are things like blog posts , articles , and any kind of nonce content that will be used once , and then probably not needed again ( making them very quick to archive every month or so ) .
+ 43 f post new text setup.txt ( this document )
( this document ) + 5ives post five ways to make the party all about you .
txt ( potential list for 5ives )
( potential list for 5ives ) + work letter larry tate 2005 - 10 - 23.txt
So that 's my current system .
It 's actually not as byzantine as it sounds .
It really comes down to : fast creation
fast addition
fast archiving
invisibility and intuitiveness
Your mileage will certainly vary , but I hope this stuff helps if you 've been working to tame your own text beast .

1. Writing karakuri :
This doll - very similar to our "
By the years when the great Jaquet - Droz was building his astonishing automata , Japan had developed their own mechanized puppets .
These dolls , called Karakuri Ningyo , were built during Edo period ( 1603 to 1867 ) and were able to practice all kind of activities : serving tea , shooting or walking down the stairs .
Take a look to some of the most interesting examples :
This doll - very similar to our " writing automaton " - was built by Tanaka Hisashige in the 19th century and could write a complicated kanji character with an accomplished face expression .
2. Bow - shooting karakuri
This doll pulls an arrow out of the fan beside him , puts it to his bow , aims , and fires at a target .
Amazing !

More models are making their way into the MP3 market
Under the agreement , Spiralfrog will offer Universal 's songs online in the US and Canada .
New York - based Spiralfrog will launch its service in December and make its money by carrying adverts on the site .
Spiralfrog aims to take on market leader Apple 's iTunes service , which charges 99 cents per song in the US .
" Offering young consumers an easy - to - use alternative to pirated music sites will be compelling , " Spiralfrog Chief Executive Robin Kent said .
Mr Kent , the former head of the Universal McCann advertising agency , added that his research suggested that in return for free music , young people would be willing to endure adverts - as long as the brands and products were relevant to them .
' Shrewd move '
US - based music industry legal specialist Josh Lawler said news of the new service was " inevitable " .
Spiralfrog will have to find a way to pay artists from the advertising dollars they are generating
Josh Lawler , music industry specialist
" It 's a very shrewd move by Universal , " he told BBC News .
" The music industry is going to a point where all delivery will probably be some form of downloading or streaming . "
Figures from the International Federation of Phonographic Industries ( IFPI ) estimate that for each legal download , 40 are done illegally .
Mr Lawler added that the success of Myspace had underlined the power of the internet to make or break artists - as well as proving that advertising - based formats can work .
Funding question
But while Spiralfrog is discussing possible deals with other big record firms , questions still remain over how the artists featured on Spiralfrog will be paid .
" The internet is very much a viable media , but the trick is going to be getting it off the ground in the first place , " Mr Lawler added .
" Spiralfrog will have to find a way to pay artists from the advertising dollars they are generating .
" But they 're not necessarily going to know how many advertising dollars there are and so some artists are going to be hesitant about it , " he said .
Rapid growth
The music downloads industry is a burgeoning market .
According to the IFPI , 60 million MP3 players were sold in 2005 , while 420 million single tracks were downloaded during the year - up 20 times on two years earlier .
DOWNLOADS INDUSTRY * 60 m MP3 players sold worldwide 420 m single tracks downloaded Revenues from music downloads for MP3s and mobile phones totalled $ 1.1 bn 350 legitimate download sites in 2005 , up from 50 in 2003 * Source : IFPI Digital music report 2006
Many of the models sold are also expected to be incompatible with Apple 's online record store - such as Sony 's Walkman .
At the same time , numerous companies are jumping on the downloads bandwagon .
Entertainment retailers HMV and Virgin already offer music downloads , while music television channel MTV has opened its own online shop , Urge .
Microsoft is preparing to launch a music store to go with its
Zune player , made by Toshiba , which is popularly viewed in the industry as an " iPod killer " .
2000 was basically the year of fraud , where we were just losing more and more money every month .
At one point we were losing over $ 10 million per month in fraud .
It was crazy .
— Max Levchin , founder of PayPal , page 6
All the best things that I did at Apple came from ( a ) not having money and ( b ) not having done it before , ever .
Every single thing that we came out with that was really great , I 'd never once done that thing in my life .
— Steve Wozniak , founder of Apple , page 36
Microsoft made a buyout offer for Excite in late ' 95 , and even then I had Microsoft 's CTO , Nathan Myhrvold , yelling at me , " Search is not a business .
People are just going to search a few times and then bookmark what they want to go to . "
— Joe Kraus , founder of Excite , page 68
I originally had my parents moderating , since they were retired , and after a few days I asked my dad how it was going .
He said , " Oh , it 's very interesting .
Mom saw a picture of a guy and a girl and another girl , and they were doing ... "
So I told Jim , " Dude , my parents can't do this anymore .
They 're looking at porn all day . "
— James Hong , founder of HotOrNot , page 380
Founders at Work is a collection of interviews with founders of famous technology companies about what happened in the very earliest days .
These people are celebrities now .
What was it like when they were just a couple friends with an idea ?
Founders like Steve Wozniak ( Apple ) , Caterina Fake ( Flickr ) , Mitch Kapor ( Lotus ) , Max Levchin ( PayPal ) , and Sabeer Bhatia ( Hotmail ) tell you in their own words about their surprising and often very funny discoveries as they learned how to build a company .
Where did they get the ideas that made them rich ?
How did they convince investors to back them ?
What went wrong , and how did they recover ?
Nearly all technical people have thought of one day starting or working for a startup .
For them , this book is the closest you can come to being a fly on the wall at a successful one , to learn how it 's done .
But ultimately these interviews are required reading for anyone who wants to understand business , because startups are business reduced to its essence .
The reason their founders become rich is that startups do what businesses do — create value — more intensively than almost any other part of the economy .
What are the secrets that make successful startups so insanely productive ?
Read this book , and let the founders themselves tell you .
What type of human being thinks intentionally aiming to bomb and attack civilians is ever justified ?
Apparently , 1 out of 4 Americans .
From the Christian Science Monitor :
... Americans are more approving of terrorist attacks against civilians than any major Muslim country except for Nigeria .
The survey , conducted in December 2006 by the University of Maryland 's prestigious Program on International Public Attitudes , shows that only 46 percent of Americans think that " bombing and other attacks intentionally aimed at civilians " are " never justified , " while 24 percent believe these attacks are " often or sometimes justified . "
The really sad thing about about this is these people who say it 's justified to intentionally aim to kill civilians are all seemingly " normal " people .
They have just become so self - deluded and delusional that they really do n't have the slightest care for anyone but themselves .
" That 's war " they say .
But I wonder , would they say " that 's war " if it was their family who was intentionally targeted to be killed ?
Would they say " that 's war " if it was them who was targeted and they lost their limbs and had to go through life crippled ?
Of course they would n't , and if they were to lose their limbs they would be the most pathetic " victim types " there is .
Yet these same people have no problem saying " that 's war " when it 's someone else who is suffering .
Do you remember the dismal , rainy Sunday when worry over your biological rigidity drove me out to a bar ?
I was sitting there drinking whiskey -- no , little man , I 'm not a drinker , though I like a drink of whiskey now and then .
Anyway , I was drinking a highball .
You were slightly tipsy , you 'd been in the war and had just come home from overseas .
You described the Japanese as " ugly - looking apes . "
And then with that peculiar facial expression that I have purposely provoked in my treatment room in an effort to cure your plague , you said : " You know what we ought to do to those Japs on the West Coast ?
String 'em up , every last one of them .
But not quickly ; no , very slowly , twisting the noose a little tighter every five minutes . . . very slowly . . . like this . . . "
And you twisted your hands to illustrate your meaning , little man .
The waiter nodded his approval and admired your heroic virility .
Have you ever held a little Japanese baby in your arms , you little patriot ?
No ?
On through the centuries you 'll keep stringing up Japanese spies and American fliers and Russian peasants women and German officers and English anarchists and Greek Communists ; you 'll shoot them , electrocute them , and asphyxiate them in gas chambers , but all that wo n't make the slightest change in the constipation of your bowels and mind , in your incapacity for love , your rheumatism and psychic disorder .
No amount of shooting or hanging will pull you out of the muck you 're in .
Take a look at yourself , little man !
That 's your only hope .
- Wilhelm Reich , Listen Little Man !
If you do n't care for others , who will care for you ?
Kate Moss is launching her own fashion label .
The catwalk queen is re-modelling herself as a fashion designer after being the muse for so many during her career - and she is determined to make her brand the biggest and best .
She is alleged to have recently said : " I 'm going to take everyone on and I 'm going to shock everyone .
" I know what works , I know what women want , and I know there is money to be made .
My name is my brand and it's going to be the biggest thing in fashion .
" A close friend told Britain 's Grazia magazine : " No contracts have been signed yet , so there is no launch date - although she is looking at getting something underway by next year .
But everyone around her is being really positive about the whole thing .
They think it will just grow and grow .
" Possible names being lined up for her line include ' Kate ' , ' Mossy ' or ' Lila Loves ' - a homage to her three - year - old daughter .
Her friend added : " She is clear about the direction she wants it to take - she loves Stella 's McCartney 's clothes and would like to do something similar .
" Kate will be overseeing the whole design and , presumably , ensuring the clothes have enough of the ' Kate sparkle ' that has made her a style icon . "
A spokeswoman for Moss has confirmed that she is considering releasing a clothing range after she has finished modelling , but claims she has no plans of retiring from the catwalk for " three or four " years .
It seems like something from a James Bond film , with code names like Top Screen and " tiered security risk . "
Yet for the propane gas industry and thousands of other chemical facilities , this is no fiction .
Starting June 8 , makers and sellers of the colorless , odorless , flammable gas and other chemicals face a new Department of Homeland Security rule requiring them to complete a secure online survey assessing whether they are a high - risk target for terrorists .
If so , they must make security fixes or face $ 25,000 - a- day fines or be put out of business .
The rule is the latest , and one of the most sweeping , of more than 150 the department has issued since the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
The complaints of propane manufacturers illustrate the delicate balance the department must maintain as it tries to terror - proof the nation without prohibitive expense for the industries .
The department figures it may cost companies as much as $ 3.6 billion over three years to secure the facilities .
The rule will " reduce the safety of propane customers , hurt the environment and needlessly cost American businesses hundreds of millions of dollars on a paperwork exercise that will not improve our country 's national security , " said Philip Squair , senior vice president of the National Propane Gas Association .
The Washington trade group represents 3,500 propane - related businesses .
Some 40,000 facilities across the nation would have to go through the initial screening , according to regulators ' estimates .
That 's based on the 344 " chemicals of interest " listed in the appendix to the 59 - page rule published last month .
The propane industry said the government estimate was too low .
According to its calculations , about 144,000 propane facilities alone would be affected .
Some trade groups , including the International Dairy Foods Association ( concerned about anhydrous ammonia in refrigeration systems ) and the American Feed Industry Association ( urea used in animal feed that could be used to make explosives ) , also have told federal regulators they do n't present much security risk .
On the other hand , the American Chemistry Council , which speaks for 130 chemical companies including Dow Chemical , said it supports the rule .
Members already have spent $ 3.5 billion to protect their facilities against terrorism , said council spokesman Scott Jensen .
" The interim final rule was a step forward in improving chemical facility security , " he said .
Jensen suggested some smaller companies covered by the initial screening may be overreacting , since it 's unlikely they will end up in the pool of 300 to 400 facilities the government thinks will have the highest risks .
The risk is based on elements that include the nature of the substance and the facility 's proximity to large populations .
Though other companies officially say they support the mission of the department , their preference often has been to seek voluntary compliance or stress that existing state and local storage and security requirements are sufficient .
In the case of propane , the association asked the department not to include the gas in the rule because it is " non-weaponizable . "
It has already been exempted from similar security requirements by the Environmental Protection Agency for accidental releases of chemicals , the trade group said .
The cost and benefits of many of the department 's previous rules have been hard to assess since it is almost impossible to predict an attack , or whether one will ever occur , said Veronique de Rugy , senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University .
The center supports free - market approaches and limited government .
Predicting the cost of the new rule is particularly difficult , because it's hard to gauge which risk level facilities will fall into .
That will determine how much companies will have to spend .
It took five years to issue the chemical facility rule , even with prodding from Congress and public pressure .
The department said its intent was " to work aggressively with chemical facilities presenting the very highest security risks first . "
Critics said parts of the chemical industry are comfortable because it allows high - risk facilities to figure out how to meet a particular standard , rather than having the government tell them exactly what to do .
Groups critical of the rule wanted the government to mandate that companies use less - risky chemicals , instead of emphasizing security measures .
They also wanted clear assurances that the federal government would n't overrule New Jersey and other states that already have chemical security rules in place .
" It provides cover to the chemical industry , " said Clayton Northouse , information policy analyst with OMB Watch , a nonprofit group in Washington that monitors the regulatory process and openness in government .
" It 's woefully inadequate . "
OMB
Watch thinks more information about the program should be disclosed to the public and even more companies should be included in the initial screening .
The propane industry argues that it should n't be on the list at all .
Squair said the department has dramatically undercounted the number of propane facilities that sell or store at least 7,500 pounds of the gas .
( By comparison , the standard tank attached to your backyard grill is 20 pounds , containing about 4.3 gallons of gas weighing 17 pounds when full . )
Large retailers in the propane industry , such as AmeriGas Partners in Valley Forge , Pa. , and Ferrellgas Partners in Overland Park , Kan. , would have to use the Top Screen tool .
So too , Squair said , would small businesses , hospitals , nursing homes , campgrounds , farms and homeowners who might have two big tanks in the backyard to heat a large house and a pool with a Jacuzzi .
Homeland Security regulators were nonplussed about pleadings for leniency .
The government 's position is that the need for a comprehensive picture of what facilities are at risk outweighs some industries ' unhappiness , one official said .
Department spokesman Russ Knocke declined to comment .

Impressively - especially when you compare it to your average desktop computer .
In fact , your computer at home does n't even come close to matching the power of half a mouse brain : researchers at IBM and the University of Nevada have been using IBM 's BlueGene L supercomputer - which contains 4,096 processors , each using 256MB of RAM - and succeeded in simulating a small fraction of the power of just half a mouse brain .
" The mouse cortex has roughly 8x10 ⁶ ( 8 m ) neurons and 8,000 synapses per neuron , " state researchers James Frye , Rajagopal Ananthanarayanan and Dharmendra S Modha .
" Assuming an average firing rate of 1 Hz , the entire memory must be refreshed every second , each neuron must be updated at every simulation time step , and each neuron communicates to each of its targets at least once a second . "
As the team says in a gloriously deadpan way : " Modeling [ sic ] at this scale imposes tremendous constraints on computation , communication and memory capacity of any computing platform . "
However , even this huge processing effort still only managed to run at a speed 10 times slower than real time , and only for 10 seconds - the equivalent of one second of mouse - thought .
Barely enough time for a mouse to register a hungry cat in the vicinity .
Supercomputers are being used in other , more ambitious projects , including a collaboration between IBM and researchers in Switzerland to simulate the human brain .
The aim is to provide more understanding of human cognition , including perception and memory .
Flowing from this , the researchers at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne say they might be able to " begin to explain how the brain changed from species to another in evolution " .
But their work is just the beginning .
They point out that the human brain has up to 100bn neurons - compare that to the measly 8 m that the Nevada researchers have managed to simulate and you will have some idea of just how much of a leap in processing power the human brain would require .
Would such a supercomputer develop consciousness ?
The Lausanne researchers are refreshingly candid on this : " We really do not know , " they say .
" If consciousness arises because of some critical mass of interactions , then it may be possible . "
That might be useful to know , given that the UK government recently suggested that we might have robots as intelligent as humans by 2050 .
( Are mice intelligent but not conscious ?
Or vice - versa ? )
Of course according to the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy , mice are in fact the most intelligent life forms on the planet , " a race of hyperintelligent pan-dimensional beings who commissioned the construction of the Earth to find the question to the ultimate answer of life , the universe and everything " .
Maybe we should simulate rats instead .

Knowledge is weakness

It 's a balancing act , I tell you .
If you know nothing about technology , you 'll keep running into totally opaque , utterly illogical problems that totally shatter your workflow - or entertainment - flow , for that matter - and confidence , leaving you feeling like a chimp trying to pass a driving test .
If you learn all of the ins and outs , though , you start to notice things .
Bad things .
Things that may drive you stark raving mad .
I certainly do n't wish I were ignorant .
Knowledge is good .
Take the other day , for instance , when I changed my Windows desktop resolution and , of course , ended up with all of my icons in a pile .
So I used Microsoft 's Desktop Icon Layout doodad to put them back .
And my Recycle Bin disappeared .
Maybe it was under some other icon(s ) .
Maybe it was completely gone .
Who knows ?
Windows is like that .
I did n't care .
I just used Tweak UI to ( definitely ) remove the Bin from the desktop , then replaced it again , and bing , there it was .
No problem .
It was the work of ten seconds .
Just thinking about walking someone else through that procedure , though , makes my head hurt .
If you 're clueless about computers , this kind of problem arises all the damn time , and not only for people unfortunate enough to be using Windows .
So , yeah , it 's great to be able to fix stuff like that .
But when you know a lot of technical things , you start getting annoyed when you see things that are n't right .
Even when people less knowledgeable than you do n't notice anything wrong .
The obvious example is screen refresh rate , but the Curse Of 60 Hz is more and more a thing of the past now that LCD monitors are commonplace .
Take audio / video synchronisation , though .
It drives me nuts when the soundtrack of a TV show or movie does n't quite line up with the video .
And it 's common , too .
It happens all the time in computer video files - I think because different sound and video driver and codec setups introduce different amounts of delay , so even if the original encoder perfectly syncs the file on his computer , other people wo n't necessarily see it the same way .
But the same problem also commonly happens with pay - TV services of various kinds , and sometimes with free digital TV too , depending on the decoder .
Your average TV watcher does not , so far as I can tell , notice bad audio sync at all , unless it 's really awful .
But when you know about codecs and drivers and signal - processing delays , things like this jump out at you .
Knowing how to fix problems helps you notice the darn things .
Another example ?
How about incorrect aspect ratios , folks ?
They 're no problem for the ignorant , either .
As I 'm sure you all know , now that widescreen TV sets are no longer reserved for rich home - theatre geeks .
I 'd find it hard to believe if I had n't witnessed it myself , but lots of people do n't seem to notice gross aspect - ratio problems .
They 've got a widescreen TV , so they expect everything to fill the screen , and they cheerfully press the anamorphic - video - expand button when they 're watching 4:3 TV on their 16:9 set .
Now all of the cars have oval wheels and Chewbacca looks like Wicket , but they just do n't care .
You can fix many of these problems , of course .
The more tinsel - free PC media player programs , like Media Player Classic , let you jockey audio sync and aspect ratio around .
The very handy all - in - one , no - outboard - codecs VideoLAN media player lets you quickly cycle through all of the popular aspect ratios .
And unless Uncle Fred wo n't let you touch his remote control , you should be able to fix home - theatre aspect problems too .
There 's a whole separate world of pain awaiting you as you try to figure out whether that Discovery Channel watermark has an exactly round globe in it now , not to mention when you keep watching the same five seconds of video over and over again while you tweak the audio timing back and forth until you lose the ability to tell exactly when someone 's mouth is meant to make a given noise and have to wait for a nice clapper - board moment like someone shooting a gun .
But at least you can fix the problem , then .
If you 've got a satellite TV box with a 30 - millisecond sync problem , and you notice it , all you can do is try to get hold of a different model without that glitch .
Or a firmware update that fixes it ( fat freakin ' chance ) .
Or you can shell out for a home - theatre amp that has configurable audio delay .
If , of course , your audio is in front of the video , you 'll still be screwed .
The list goes on .
Lousy de-interlacing that gives moving objects zig - zag edges .
Surround speaker systems with three out of six speakers connected out of phase ( but not the subwoofer , even though its phase switch should be flipped for it to sound right in the place where it 's been put ) .
Low - or , worse yet , uneven - frame rate video .
My hat is off to anyone who can watch an action movie on SVCD without needing at least a stiff drink .
Some uneducated consumers notice stuff like this , and are once again left in the unfortunate position of being aware of a problem they have no idea how to fix .
But most just do n't .
If you do n't understand what 's going on under the surface , you tend to just assume that whatever the surface looks and sounds like is the way it ought to be , and so you do n't worry .
Seek and ye shall find ; seek not and ye shall not .
This problem 's a freakin ' plague among tech - heads .
Audiophiles who listen to their stereo through the music instead of the other way around , photographers who wince at every blown highlight and lens flare , home - theatre nuts - yet again - who obsess over edge enhancement and HD codecs and exactly what kind of sugar - water to spray on the carpet to give it that authentic cinema stick .
Does my technical knowledge let me get more pleasure out of a perfectly configured ... whatever ... than I would if I did n't have a clue ?
Nope .
So clearly I - and probably many of you - need to cultivate a mystic balance between knowing and needing , seeing and doing , being and thinking .
" Wise men hear and see as little children do " , according to some dude who may or may not have existed .
And a bloke who definitely did exist went on to say " Where ignorance is bliss , ' tis folly to be wise " - though not really in a positive way .
I do n't know , people .
I think there may be a FAQ about it somewhere , though .
Ever wonder how christians deal with gaming issues that everyone seems to deal with ?
I also play a lot of online games and often I think about whether or not it 's a good use of my time .
I 'm not a Christian so I do n't have to think about what Jesus would do but I do wonder if it 's something that Richard Feyman would do .
I think Mr. Feyman would have been very interested in the social aspects of WoW and probably would have played ... for at least a week , maybe two .
Over the past year of playing I 've learned about as much as I 'll ever get out of WoW or any MMORG so at this point it 's a waste of my time .
It 's just for entertainment , as much as watching " Lost " is to someone with a TV .
Why do I still play ?
Why do I want a kodo mount as an undead priest ?
I definitely get a sense of accomplishment out of the game , which is odd since it 's all imaginary and paid for .
If I devoted this much time to my job I 'm sure that I 'd be a Manager by now .
I play because it gives me a high , the same high I get when I win at rullete or find someone at a bar that is as passionate about vouchers as I am .
When we take down Ragnaros as a guild it gives me the momentary glee I crave .
When I lay on my deathbed am I going to remember taking down Rag ?
Probably , I remember killing the final boss in " Curse of the Assure Bonds " when I was 10 .
Does that make my life sad , I do n't think so , I 've wasted more time reading Conan .
The real question is whether or not playing the game is as important as say getting my graduate degree .
Put that way I know Mr. Feymans choice and I know mine , however I 'd rather play the game than watch TV .
I guess I 'll go start studying for the GRE .
Your mom would not be pleased if she heard you say this .
You have no time for cleaning up your room .
But if she knew how hard you were studying lately , and if she saw the results you were producing , she would not in the least mind cleaning your room for you .
Do n’t lock the door on her and just let her express herself in her usual motherly way .
There can be nothing greater than a mother ’s love .
You could treat commercial cleaning atlanta ga contracts as something of a mother to your business .
Indeed , this is the kind of business that would be unisexed .
There are equal opportunities in the employment ranks .
But not just anyone , whether male or female , gets to work just yet for a commercial cleaning company .
During their application process , and if they are lucky enough to make the cut , they will be closely screened .
Their potential employer needs to make sure that they are not felons .
They should not have blemished records .
It is of the utmost importance to ensure that new cleaning staff are not about to harm the company ’s customers , whether the harm is deliberate or accidental .
Indeed , there can be no margin for error in this cleaning business .
Just one slip in a puddle of water or pool of oil is all it takes to close a business down .
Long before new recruits are sent off to fulfil their first contract , they will be required to undergo full and proper training .
They have also got to be taught how to use their cleaning equipment , materials and detergents in the most efficient manner possible .
They have also got to be taught how to be customer - centric .
In other words , as though they were mothers cleaning their kids ’ rooms .

On the eve of the 2004 presidential election , Beliefnet introduced the " Twelve Tribes of American Politics " to demonstrate how the religious groups that factor in American political decision - making are a great deal more complicated than simply a division between the Religious Right and the Religious Left .
Using data from the Fourth National Survey on Religion and Politics ( see full study ) , Beliefnet defined the religious groupings that make up our political landscape .
The data was later updated to include results from surveys completed after the November 2004 election .
It now shows both longterm trends and specific preferences during the 2004 election season .
What the data show is that the Religious Right and the Religious Left are almost exactly the same size .
The former has had a much greater impact for the past 25 years largely because of superior organization and drive .
( Political junkies click here for a full explanation of methodology . )
What effect will the tribes have on the 2008 race ?
In coming months , we 'll find out .

... so I am visiting a couple of good friends at Google .
Sampling the food , so to say .
We are trying to select a least crowded table in their mecca - of - a- cafeteria .
Finally we end up at a table with five other people , when I notice that one of them is Udi_Manber , who until recently was a CEO of Amazon 's A9 before being hired by Google a couple of months ago .
So I tell my friend " do you know who is sitting at this table ? " .
" Of course I do " answers my friend .
Right after this , a guy on my right turns around and then conversation proceeds as follows
Guy :
Hi guys !
What do you do around here ?
Friend1 : I am doing ...
Friend2 : And I am doing ....
Me : And I am just visiting here , and I must say the food is really good !
Guy :
And what do you do ?
Me : Oh , I am a software engineer in a startup near by .
Friend1 : " .. and a pretty good one "
Guy :
Why do n't you come work for Google ?
Me : Maybe I should apply , the food is excellent here [ trying to be funny ] .
And what do you do around here ?
Guy : [ after a brief pause ] ...
Well , I just do different odd jobs .
Conversation ends here , the guy turns around to continue his conversation with Udi and others , while my friend explains to me that I have just asked Larry Page " what he is doing around here " .
As I now think about it , this was probably the single most absurd question one could ask Google co-founder in Google cafeteria , and I must admit the answer was right on the mark for this situation ...

This week , Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow brings his
mixture of menace and mockery back to the big screen in Pirates Of The Caribbean 3 .
But the real pirate he is based on would have
eaten the skittish Jack Sparrow for breakfast and spat out his bones into the deep blue sea .
Scroll down for more ...
His name was Bartholomew Roberts .
The most successful raider in the history of piracy , he took prisoner an astounding 470 vessels , and so
renowned was his ferocity that many of those ships were surrendered to him without a fight .
Black Bart was the nickname he was given - and not only because of his black locks and dark eyes .
When this swashbuckling Welsh buccaneer had to fight for his prizes , he was merciless .
In 1720 , the crew of a 42 - gun Dutch vessel anchored off Dominica in the Caribbean dared to resist .
In the close - quarters cannonade which followed , several of his crew were cut down .
Even
more were slaughtered in the hand - to - hand fighting as Black Bart ’s pirates swarmed over the vessel .
Roberts ordered an exemplary revenge .
Those Dutchmen who had not been killed in the fighting were hung from the yardarm , or stripped of their
shirts and lashed at the masthead until they lost consciousness in the blistering sun , then mutilated .
The Dutch captain ’s ears were cut off and presented to him as a reminder to listen harder when Roberts told him what to do .
The torture and butchery did not end until the last Dutchman
had been dragged out and carved up in similar fashion .
Roberts renamed the ship the Royal Fortune , and sailed it with his great black flag at the helm , which showed Black Bart standing , with cutlass
uplifted , on two skulls , representing his dominance over the islands of Barbados and Martinique .
He was one of the many sailors who took to freebooting after his own ship had been captured by pirates .
Born in Wales , 325 years ago this month , he went to sea in 1695 at the age of 13 .
He served on British merchant vessels before fighting in the 1702 - 1713 War of the Spanish Succession .
Apart from a brief mention of him as mate of a Barbados sloop , he is not heard of again until 1719 , when he sailed as third mate aboard the slave ship Princess .
The Princess was anchored at a small , semi-derelict fort on the Gold Coast of West Africa ( present day Ghana ) when she was captured by two pirate ships , the Royal James and the Royal
Rover , led by another Welshman , Captain Howell Davis .
Roberts was said to have been reluctant to be forced into piracy - but he soon saw
the point of it .
A contemporary quotes Roberts as saying : " In an honest service , there is thin victuals , low wages and hard labour .
In this , plenty and satiety , pleasure and ease , liberty and power ...
" No , a merry life and a short one shall be my motto . "
Scroll down for more ...
And he kept to it .
His quick mind was appreciated by Davis , who took to consulting him over navigation and the rig of the sails .
Roberts was older than most of the conscripts on the pirate vessels .
Before this gold - plated opportunity , he would have been sailing the triangular route from Britain to Africa to the West Indies and North America for many years , before returning with rich cargoes for his ship - owners .
His own wages would have been about £ 3 a month , with little chance of promotion .
When the Royal James had to be abandoned as unseaworthy off the Gold Coast , the Royal Rover made for the nearby fort of Principe , falsely hoisting the flags of a British man - of - war .
These flags , which Davis always kept stowed in his locker , meant any ship he sailed could approach merchant ships without them realising what treachery was abroad .
Once again , his ruse worked .
The Portuguese governor let the Royal Rover enter the harbour , and entertained the pirates - smartly dressed as
officers .
After a relaxing fortnight , Davis invited the Governor to lunch on board his ship , intending to hold him hostage for ransom .
Meanwhile , however , the Governor had discovered that Davis had been making advances to his wife .
He was most displeased and hatched a plan of his own , inviting the pirate captain to call at the fort before lunch for a glass of wine .
On the way , the party were ambushed .
Davis , shot
through the stomach , fell back , firing his pistols , and died .
A new captain had to be found .
Roberts was elected .
He had been a pirate for only six
weeks , but his shipmates had already recognised his seamanship .
One of them said later : " He was chosen not so much for his strength and courage , as for his cunning and knowledge of the seas .
" He could make a quick guess of the bulk and force of any ship that came nigh . "
Roberts ' first decision - to bombard the fort , set fire to the town , slaughter all the men they could find and steal everything they could carry away - displayed the ruthlessness which was to
become his byword .
A contemporary historian wrote : " He accepted of the honour [ being elected captain ] , saying that since he had dipped his hands in muddy water , and must be a pirate , it was better being a commander than a common man . "
The first black flag he raised was of himself and Death holding up an hour - glass .
This is the side of Black Bart which Johnny Depp picks up for his captain Jack Sparrow .
As cool and brave as he was ruthless , Roberts dressed like a Georgian dandy in ruffs and jewels , velvet breeches , pleated shirts , buckled shoes and silk jackets - all of them looted .
While Jack - and nearly every other pirate we know of - was very partial to a shot of rum , Roberts was teetotal .
He disliked drunkenness .
Instead of rum , he drank cups of tea .
The secret of Black Bart ’s success was patience and tactical flair .
He took the Royal Rover to Brazil , where , after a fruitless nine weeks merely looting and burning a couple of slave ships , he encountered 42 Portuguese trading vessels under the escort of two 70 - gun warships , at anchor off Bahia .
It was the Lisbon Fleet , an annual armada of incalculable riches .
In the darkness , Roberts
sailed between the merchant vessels , established which one had the richest cargo and towed it out
to sea .
As one of the huge Portuguese warships gained on the Royal Rover , Roberts fired a broadside .
Astonishingly , the 70 - gunner panicked and heaved to , waiting for the other men- of - war to sail out in support .
Roberts escaped with £ 40,000 in gold coins and jewellery .
But while Roberts was chasing prey off the coast of Guyana , his deputy , left in charge of the Royal Rover , sailed away in an act of treachery , leaving Roberts with one small , poorly armed sloop .
Black Bart ’s resources were badly depleted : he had a crew of tough and experienced mercenaries , but his supplies were low and his chances of capturing a prize with this second - best sloop were slim .
Roberts ’ response was to ensure the loyalty of his men by making them sign a code of conduct .
This was democracy with iron gloves .
Each man would have an equal vote in the big decisions and an equal right to food , liquor and prize
money .
If any man robbed or defrauded another , he would have his nose and ears slit and be
marooned .
No gaming was allowed .
Lights went out at eight , and any drinking after that had to be done on deck , in the dark .
Quarrels would have to
be be resolved by duelling .
Any man carrying a mistress to sea in disguise would be executed .
The musicians ( all conscripted ) would be on call every day except Sunday .
These rules the pirates swore on the Bible to uphold .
That done , Roberts renamed his sloop the Fortune , later Royal Fortune .
He joined forces with a small - time French buccaneer , and together they harassed shipping around Barbados and Martinique , until the local inhabitants financed
a well - armed ship which saw off both sloops .
The Fortune limped to Dominica for repairs , with 20 of her crew dying on the journey .
Then , when he set sail for Newfoundland , Black Bart ’s luck began to change .
He plundered up and
down the Atlantic coast , capturing or destroying 27 sloops .
Among his bounty was an 18 - gun galley in which he proceeded to cause serious havoc .
Roberts despised cowardice .
Twenty - two captains of the seized Newfoundland vessels , who had
tried to flee at the sight of the black pirate flags and the sound of drums and trumpeters , were summoned to appear before him every morning , at peril of having their ships burned .
Some of them he lashed for impertinence .
Meanwhile , his crew made full use of the local brothels , while respectable women kept their
doors locked .
By late 1720 , Roberts was back terrorising shipping in the West Indies , this time with unassailable firepower - as that 42 - gun Dutch
vessel found to its cost .
News of the bloody havoc he wreaked aboard travelled far and wide .
Roberts then exacted sweet revenge on the locals for their previous defiance .
From Martinique , Roberts used the captured Dutchman and ran up flags to signal that cheap slaves were on offer in St Lucia .
He proceeded
to ambush the 14 French ships who brought gold dust - the common currency of the slave trade - to pay for them .
Around this time , he captured a 52 - gun warship , and finding the Governor of Martinique on board ,
he hanged him from the yardarm .
The latest of his flagships to be renamed the Royal Fortune was a floating arsenal , including four 12 - pound cannons capable of sinking a small vessel with a single shot .
Roberts had virtually forced a standstill in shipping on the Spanish Main , outmanoeuvring
the navies hunting him .
He now judged it wise to head for West Africa for fresh opportunities .
Off Senegal and Sierra Leone , he continued to destroy or commandeer everything in his path , including two French gunships and the Onslow , a British frigate taking soldiers to Ghana ’s Cape Coast Castle , the leading slave bazaar .
Several Onslow soldiers were eager to join the pirates .
A few were accepted , but , as landlubbers , they were allowed only a quarter share of any loot .
Roberts had heard that two Royal Navy ships were due to revisit Sierra Leone at the end of 1721 , but he was used to such tales .
In any case , he was already getting on for 40 and was planning to hang up his cutlass for good - once he had spent the summer of 1722 unburdening Portuguese vessels of their cargoes of Brazilian gold .
By January 1722 , his flagship was in convoy with three other commandeered French warships off
the Ivory Coast .
As he entered Ouidah , the wealthiest harbour on the coast , all 11 slave ships at anchor there immediately struck
their colours , signalling surrender .
Roberts captured the ships and ransomed them back to their captains for 8lb of gold dust each .
When one Captain refused him , Roberts burned the ship to ashes , including the 80 slaves in its hold .
He left Ouidah shortly before Challoner Ogle , captain of the 50 - gun warship HMS Swallow , came
looking for this dastardly pirate who was seriously impeding Britain ’s trade with Africa and the West Indies .
It took
Ogle three weeks sailing up and down the
coast before a tip - off from a captured pirate sent the Swallow to her destination .
On February 5 , 1722 , Ogle came upon Roberts and his favourites eating lunch by the shore near
Cape Lopez in present - day Gabon , while his crews worked on their ships ’ hulls .
Ogle could have taken them then , but his steersman were forced to veer out to sea to avoid a sandbank .
Sniffing booty , Roberts sent out one of the captured French gunships , the 16 - gun Ranger , in pursuit of this unknown vessel .
He was out of sight and earshot when the Swallow opened its gunports and blasted the Ranger with
a broadside of 32 - pounders .
By the time the Ranger surrendered , ten men had been killed and 20 more wounded .
The mate of the Ranger went below and fired a pistol into the ship ’s gunpowder - but the powder
was damp and only succeeded in blowing a hole through the side of the ship , taking the mate with it .
Boarding the stricken sloop , the Swallows ’ surgeon , John Atkins , was confronted by dead and dying crewmen on a deck awash with blood .
He noted dryly that they were " dressed with white shirts , watches and a deal of silk vests " .
Some of Ogle ’s men coaxed the captured pirate vessel back to harbour , careful of the fortune in
plunder in its hold .
The Swallow returned to Cape Lopez for a second foray five days later .
Black Bart ’s pirates , befuddled from capturing a ship loaded with liquor the day before , were slow to recognise her .
When they did , Roberts alerted his crews and prepared for battle .
He dressed in crimson from head to foot , a gold chain round his neck , a curling red feather in his hat , and four pistols roped over his shoulder in a silk sling .
His plan was to sail past the Swallow , risking a single broadside before catching the wind to escape .
Instead , the helmsman , panicking , exposed the vessel to a second broadside .
A spray of grapeshot tore out Black Bart ’s throat and he slumped dying over a cannon .
While the battle still raged , Black Bart ’s body was weighted down and thrown overboard , fulfilling the pirate captain ’s wish to be buried at sea .
The Royal Fortune was forced to surrender and 54 of the pirates were later hanged .
Some historians argue that the death of Bartholomew Roberts marked the end of the Golden Age of piracy .
Roberts ’ own life , for all its flamboyance , demonstrates that there was no " golden age " : only the base metal of greed , ruthlessness , debauchery and vicious cruelty , which for 60 years or more bedevilled the Western seas .

Delegates at the first conference of the new University and College Union in Bournemouth voted by 158 to 99 for " a comprehensive and consistent boycott " of all Israeli academic institutions , as called for by Palestinian trade unions in response to Israel 's " 40 - year occupation " of Palestinian land .
The union 's leadership must now circulate calls from Palestinians for a boycott of Israeli universities to all branches throughout the country .
Tom Hickey , a Brighton University academic and union executive member , who led the move , said : " There will be adverse effects on individuals , but this is not targeting individuals or trying to break contacts with them . "
The vote reflected " the deep concern people have " .
A boycott might involve refusing to work with journals published by Israeli companies or collaborate on research contracts with Israeli academics .
But Sally
Hunt , the general secretary of the union , said : " I do not believe a boycott is supported by a majority of [ 120,000 ] UCU members , nor do I believe that members see it as a priority for the union . "
The boycott was also opposed by the education minister , Bill Rammell .
He said : " The UK government fully supports academic freedom and is firmly against any academic boycotts of Israel or Israeli academics .
Whilst I appreciate the independence of the UCU , I am very disappointed that the union has decided to pass a motion which encourages its members to consider boycotting Israeli academics and education institutions .
I profoundly believe this does nothing to promote the Middle East peace process . "
The issue has been hotly debated over the past five years by academics within the Association of University Teachers and the University and College Lecturers ' Union , which merged into the UCU last year .
In 2005 , a vote for a boycott by the AUT was rejected at a special meeting later that year .
Natfhe continued to support boycotts at its conference last year , but the policy was dissolved when it merged to form the UCU very soon afterwards .
Previous attempts at a boycott have caused international outcry , especially in Israel and the US .
When the AUT ratified a boycott in February 2005 , the story hit the front pages in Europe , North America and Asia .
During the ensuing weeks , a delegation of Israeli academics put pressure on the union by touring UK campuses .
Twenty one Nobel prizewinners , including Shimon Peres and Elie Wiesel , wrote to the Guardian , stating : " Academic freedom has never been the property of a few and must not be manipulated by them ... mixing science with politics and limiting academic freedom by boycotts is wrong " .
In response to yesterday 's decision , Ofir Frankel , spokesman for the Advisory Board for Academic Freedom , said : " We see it as discriminatory and counterproductive .
It will make British academia look a little less serious . "
Jon Benjamin , chief executive of the board of Deputies of British Jews , said : " Now is the time to strengthen the kinds of relationships that will bring all sides of the Israeli / Palestinian conflict together and , in this country , create a better understanding of the complex issues through that engagement .
We call upon the union 's leadership and all members who are rightly outraged by the decision to work towards a reversal of this policy . "
Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously said that he could n't define obscenity , but that he knew it when he saw it .
The same has long been the case with spyware .
It 's not easy to define , but most people know it when parasitic programs suck up resources on their computer and clog their browsers with pop -up ads .
Recognizing that one person 's search toolbar is another 's spyware , a coalition of consumer groups , ISPs and software companies announced on Tuesday that it has finally come up with a mutually agreeable definition for the internet plague .
Spyware impairs " users ' control over material changes that affect their user experience , privacy or system security ; use of their system resources , including what programs are installed on their computers ; or collection , use and distribution of their personal or otherwise sensitive information , " according to the Anti-Spyware Coalition , which includes Microsoft , EarthLink , McAfee and Hewlett - Packard .
The group hopes the definitions will clear the way for anti-spyware legislation and help create a formal , centralized method for companies to dispute or change their software 's classification .
" One of the biggest challenges we 've had with spyware has been agreeing on what it is , " said Ari Schwartz , associate director of the Center for Democracy and Technology , which has led the group 's work .
" The anti-spyware community needs a way to quickly and decisively categorize the new programs spawning at exponential rates across the internet . "
The lack of standard definitions of spyware and adware has doomed federal and state legislation and hampered collaboration between anti-spyware forces .
In a colloquial sense , spyware is used to refer to a whole range of programs , including unwanted browser toolbars that come bundled with other downloads , surf - tracking software that generates pop-up ads , and software that tries to capture passwords and credit - card numbers .
Software companies like Claria , which distribute their pop-up advertising software by bundling it with free programs such as peer - to - peer software , adamantly deny their products are " spyware . "
They point out that users can usually find a definition of the programs ' effects deep in the user agreement .
It is unclear what effect the new definitions will have on current anti-spyware programs , such as Lavasoft 's Ad- Aware and Microsoft 's free AntiSpyware tool .
Recently , Microsoft downgraded the default program action for Claria 's software from " Remove " to " Ignore , " which prompted widespread criticism .
Microsoft responded by saying that it had changed the handling of " Claria software in order to be fair and consistent with how Windows AntiSpyware ( beta ) handles similar software from other vendors . "
Microsoft is in negotiations to buy venture - capital - backed Claria , according to The New York Times .
Ben Edelman , the country 's foremost spyware researcher , questions whether the new definitions are simply there so that adware companies can find a way to get a stamp of approval for their software .
" From the perspective of users whose computers are infected , there is nothing hard about ( defining spyware ) , " Edelman said .
" If you have adware or spyware on your computer , you want it gone .
" Maybe the toolbar is Mother Theresa , but it 's Mother Theresa sitting in your living room uninvited and you want her gone also , " Edelman said .
" You do n't need a committee of 50 smart guys in D.C. sipping ice tea in order to decide that .
" The question is , what do you want to do with it ?
If you had a consensus of 100 computer - repair technicians or Bill Gates himself , what would they say to do ? "

You could hardly have asked for a clearer demonstration of the futility of copy protection than the events of the past three weeks .
The DVD - encryption key that sparked a user rebellion on Digg in early May is now largely moot .
Despite having been posted to hundreds of thousands of websites and garnering attention worldwide , the key is now useless , because the industry group that oversees HD DVD and Blu-ray copy protection has changed its encryption scheme to use a different one .
The new key , in turn , has itself already been leaked , even before it was scheduled to go into effect this week .
Perhaps in recognition of the futility of stopping the spread of an obsolete code , the Advanced Access Content System Licensing Administrator ( the industry group behind the AACS copy - protection standard ) seems to have abandoned its earlier threats of legal action .
" It apparently was highly controversial ( for the AACS Licensing Administrator ) to send the legal threat letters , " says Fred von Lohmann , a senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
" I assume they would need to have consensus before they could step up to any lawsuits .
And , in any event , it 's too late for this key – it's been immortalized as an internet celebrity thanks to the first legal threats , and will likely outlive all of us , no matter how many lawsuits are brought . "
The AACS Licensing Administrator seems likely to turn to technical means of defending its copy - protection system now rather than legal ones .
Instead of playing Whac - A - Mole , trying to pursue legal actions against people who post the encryption - processing key , the group is now playing keep away , trying to stay one step ahead of the hacker community by releasing new keys and revoking old ones faster than they can be cracked .
AACS Licensing Administrator representatives refused to comment on the group 's strategy or lack of legal activity this month .
AACS is the digital rights management standard used by next - generation high - definition movie discs .
Both of the two competing high - definition optical disc standards , HD DVD and Blu-ray , employ AACS to protect content from being copied .
AACS uses encryption keys to keep that content locked down .
Last month , Digg removed a user 's post that contained the encryption key , sparking a widespread revolt as irate web surfers reposted the key all over the internet .
Today , a Google search for the 32 - character key returns nearly 1.5 million results .
It 's not the first time that an industry 's attempt to secure its content has been thwarted by a vast army of internet users bent on breaking a copy - protection scheme .
The promise of AACS was that it would be more bulletproof than the Content Scrambling System , or CSS , the encryption scheme on DVDs .
CSS was broken in 1999 by a trio of computer - security researchers , including Jon Lech Johansen , better known as " DVD Jon , " who was all of 15 years old at the time .
The program they created , DeCSS , showed DVDs to be easily exploited , and today a wide variety of programs will decrypt and copy DVDs .
What 's more , attempts to thwart the spread of the DeCSS algorithm resulted in an outpouring of creative publications based on it , including T - shirts and even an epic poem written in haiku stanzas .
AACS is supposed to be superior to CSS in that it uses device - and title - specific keys .
Since the AACS Licensing Administrator can revoke device keys on compromised players and issue fresh title keys for new HD DVDs that will not work with compromised players , it would seem to be able to stay one step ahead of the hacker community .
A new set of keys was due to be released May 22 .
Unfortunately for the AACS Licensing Administrator , the new keys have already been broken and it will be 90 days before the consortium can release another update .
As Wired and other sources noted last week , SlySoft , a software publisher that makes tools for getting around copy protection on movies , updated its AnyDVD HD program to exploit an as - yet - unpublished key .
According to security expert Ed Felton , SlySoft had likely already found the exploit in a prior version , but kept the attack a secret until all the other keys were blacklisted .
AACS Licensing Administrator refuses to reveal or speculate as to what its next steps might be .
A statement released earlier this year is vague as to specifics .
" AACS LA has multiple tools , both technical and legal in nature , available to address threats to the AACS technology .
AACS LA views these tools as complementary , and will use them as appropriate under any particular set of circumstances , " the statement reads .
" I think that you have to remember AACS is a collection of people who do n't actually agree on most of these issues , " says von Lohmann .
" Anything that AACS can say under its own name is certain to have been negotiated by many lawyers for many days . "
" It 's a delicate thing to keep all those guys on a single press release , " von Lohmann says .
" My expectation is that they will probably reign in the legal activity with respect to keys .
I think you have to view what happened a few weeks ago as a remarkable failure in that light . "

How many different ways do you get information ?
Five kinds of emails , text messages , voicemails , paper documents , regular mail , blog posts , messages on different online services ( MySpace , Facebook , Netscape , et al ) … the list could go on and on , and your processing of information certainly does .
It ’s an endless process , but it does n’t have to be exhausting or stressful .
Getting your information management down to a less stressful level , to a more manageable level , and into a productive zone only takes a few simple steps .
Read on for more , and your poor reading eyes will thank you .
First stage : Minimize your inboxes .
Every place you have to go to check your messages or to read your incoming information is an inbox , and the more you have , the harder it is to manage everything .
Cut the number of inboxes you have down to the smallest number possible for you to still function in the ways you need to .
Here ’s how :
List all the ways you receive information .
You might forget a few at first , but as you remember new ways , add them to the list .
The list should include digital and analog information — paper and computer .
Evaluate each to see if it gives you value .
Sometimes we continue to check certain inboxes even if it ’s not adding anything to our lives .
It ’s just more stuff to check .
Have a pager when you also have a cell phone ?
Maybe the pager is n’t any use to you anymore .
Find ways to combine or eliminate inboxes .
If something ’s not giving you value , consider eliminating it from your life .
See if you can go a week without missing it .
For all the rest , see if you can combine multiple information streams into one inbox .
For example , how many places in your home do incoming papers get placed ?
Have one inbox at home for all mail , papers from work , school papers , phone notes , computer printouts , schedules , and more .
Have four email services ?
See if you can forward them all to one service .
Get different voicemails ?
Try forwarding them to one service , or use an internet service to deliver them to your email inbox .
At work , have one inbox for all incoming paperwork .
Read a lot of blogs ?
Put them all into a feedreader , in a single stream of posts , instead of having to check 25 different inboxes .
The fewer inboxes you have , the better .
Aim for 4 - 7 inboxes if possible .
Second stage : Master your inboxes .
This stage will sound familiar to my long - time readers , but it should be covered here :
Do n’t allow your inboxes to overflow .
This will create a huge backlog of stuff for you to go through , and it will definitely stress you out .
Instead , become the master of your inboxes .
Here ’s how :
Check and process your inboxes once a day .
For some inboxes , you may need to check more than once ( I check my email every hour ) , but do n’t check constantly and obsessively .
That just wastes your time and cuts into your productivity and real life .
But do n’t check less than once a day , because otherwise you ’ll allow it to pile up .
Piles are your enemy .
Process it from the top down , making quick and immediate decisions .
Start with the top item in your inbox , and make an immediate decision .
Do n’t skip over it or put it back in or delay the decision .
Here are your choices : delete , delegate to someone else , do it immediately ( if it takes 2 minutes or less ) , or defer it for later ( add it to your to - do list ) .
In all cases , do n’t leave the item in your inbox .
Delete or file it .
Work your way down through each item until your inbox is empty .
Note : if you have hundreds of items in your inbox , it might be good to toss them all into a folder to be processed later ( and schedule a couple hours to do that ) , and then start this process with all new items from that point on .
Repeat this process , to keep your inboxes empty .
If you ’ve minimized the number of inboxes you have , this should n’t be too hard .
Celebrate when your inbox is empty !
It ’s a wonderful feeling .
Remember :
Do n’t check them all day long — schedule your processing time — and definitely do n’t have instant notification on .

Dr. Geim says his main contribution was not the tape , but his way of spotting the single - layer graphene among the thicker flakes .
The highest of high - tech microscopes can spot the bumps of a single atom , but using them to measure the thickness of each flake is impossibly slow .
A one - atom - thick sheet is generally invisible , but Dr. Geim found that a sheet that thin does change the color of the silicon oxide layer atop the wafer , much as a sheen of oil on water generates a rainbow of colors .
Now , at a glance under a simple light microscope , researchers can tell whether a graphite flake is more than 100 layers thick ( yellow ) , 30 to 40 layers thick ( blue ) , about 10 layers thick ( pink ) or just a single - layer ( pale , almost invisible , pink ) .

Dr. Geim said he thought the earlier researchers — and indeed , anyone who has written with a pencil — was likely to have produced graphene but simply could not see it .
After researchers had an easy way to make graphene , they started playing with all types of experiments .
Techniques borrowed from silicon technology allow them to cut graphene into specific shapes , constructing transistors and other electronic devices .
They face years of challenges .
The ragged edges can affect the devices ’ properties , though they also offer the possibility of tuning the electronics by attaching various atoms at the edges .
Scientists have also explored more esoteric aspects of graphene , including a prediction from more than half a century ago .
Because of how the electrons flowing in graphene interact with the honeycomb chicken - wire structure , they behave as if they have no mass , always traveling at the same speed regardless of their energy , like particles of light .
Dr. Beenakker at Leiden has proposed taking advantage of graphene ’s unusual behavior in a new type of electronics that he calls “ valleytronics . ”
Independently , Dr. Geim and Dr. Kim at Columbia demonstrated a phenomenon known as the quantum Hall effect , where the electrical resistance perpendicular to the current and an applied magnetic field jumps between certain discrete values .
The quantum Hall effect is usually seen just at very low temperatures in semiconductors , but it occurs in graphene at room temperature .
A more recent paper by Dr. Geim and his collaborators describes a suspended graphene sheet as not flat , but wavy .
There are Iraqis in Cairo who feel roughly the same way .
In the courtyard of a hastily constructed apartment complex on the airport road , I found a group of Sunnis sitting outside their small shops .
Ghaith , an 18 - year - old from Baghdad ’s western Sunni stronghold of Amriya — long since cleansed of its Shiites — had opened a small grocery .
He pointed across the courtyard to his 12 - year - old brother playing soccer with other boys and told me he had been kidnapped in Baghdad and held for one week .
The kidnappers demanded six million Iraqi dinars .
Sitting in the grocery store was Dhafer , a round 35 - year - old man with a sharp nose .
Originally from Baghdad ’s Ghazaliya district , he had been threatened by Shiite neighbors .
He was given 48 hours to leave .
“ I brought my relatives for my protection , and weapons , and they escorted us out , ” he told me .
Next door to the grocery shop was a hair salon owned by a Sunni couple also from Ghazaliya .
It was decorated pink and red for Valentine ’s Day .
Its owner , Ghada , taught herself hairdressing after she arrived in Cairo with her husband , Abu Omar , and their three children .
Abu Omar was a former colonel in the Iraqi Army who retired in 1999 .
“ After the American invasion , I started to feel the Iranian influence , ” Abu Omar said .
“ Before , there were no problems between Sunnis and Shiites , but then on television we started hearing people talking about Sunnis or Shiites . ”
Like many former military officers , Abu Omar had been active in the Iraqi resistance .
“ As long as they are attacking the occupiers or those cooperating with the occupiers , ” he said , the Iraqi resistance was honorable .
Ghada told me that Iraq ’s sectarianism followed them to Cairo , causing problems in their children ’s school .
Iraqi Shiite boys beat their son Omar , she said .
“ He hates Shiites so much , ” she told me , adding that many fights occurred between Sunni and Shiite Iraqi children .
Ghada told me that Egyptian customers cried with her and consoled her after Saddam ’s execution , and they had recited a prayer together .
“ The ones that Saddam killed , ” Ghada said , meaning Shiites , “ I would go back and kill more of them .
I hate Shiites . ”
III .
The New Normal
Of the main destination countries , Syria is the friendliest for Shiites .
Egypt may be ill disposed toward Shiites , but Jordan is downright hostile .
Syria is a different story , and Damascus in particular has a variety of Iraqis seemingly ready to live together .
Ali Hamid , a Sunni barber from Baghdad ’s Shiite district of Shaab , has been working in the same Damascus shop since 2003 .
He explained that many barbers fled Iraq to Syria because Islamist radicals , who believe beards should be left to grow and Western - style haircuts avoided , had forced them to close their shops .
“ In Iraq there is a sectarian war , ” he told me .
“ Here , we all get along . ”
He attributed this to the vigilant Syrian authorities : “ Praise God , thanks to the Syrian government we have no problems .
If anything happens , they deal with it when it happens .
As shop owners we are not allowed to talk about sectarianism .
Word spread to all business owners :
You live in a different country , not your country ; you have to respect their rules . ”
Even Moktada al - Sadr ’s representative in Syria , Sheik Raed al - Kadhimi , was espousing antisectarianism , even though Sadr ’s Mahdi Army has systematically targeted Sunnis .
“ All Iraqis are united and well integrated , ” he told me when I visited his offices in the Sayeda Zeinab neighborhood one morning .
“ I can say that they are like one body against the common enemy .
Also I should say that Iraqis do not kill Iraqis .
It is not possible .
It is only those who come into the country , as well as takfiris ” — radical Sunnis who anathematize Shiites as infidels — “ and former Baathists who operate under the umbrella of the Americans .
You see how they kill Iraqis through torture and suicide bombings . ”
Under such conditions , he said , it was natural that “ people resort to a safe place and they come to Syria . ”
Kadhimi ’s office was in an Iraqi neighborhood that has sprung up in southern Damascus around the shrine of Zeinab , granddaughter of the Prophet Muhammad and the daughter of Imam Ali , the fourth caliph .
Her brother Hussein was killed at Karbala .
For Shiite Muslims , this moment , when the family of Ali was betrayed , is one of the defining moments of their history .
A vast commercial district has grown around the shrine .
It has become home to so many Iraqis that , walking through its streets , I felt transported back to Baghdad , where I had spent so much time reporting — back to Kadhimiya , the Shiite commercial district built around the shrine to Imam Kadhim .
The Damascus streets bustled with men speaking Arabic in the Iraqi dialect , overflowing indifferently onto the road nicknamed Iraqi Street .
The walls were covered with political posters from Iraqi elections past .
There was a mobile - phone shop named after the Euphrates River , and there were barbershops called Karbala and Son of Iraq .
On the eve of the 10th of Muharram — the month on the Muslim calendar when the martyrdom of Hussein at the hands of the caliph Yazid ’s forces is commemorated — a procession organized by Sheik Kadhimi ’s office gathered .
Dressed in black , the men were led by youths wielding immense wooden flagpoles with colored flags that they struggled to wave from side to side .
Others carried framed pictures of Moktada al - Sadr and his father .
It was a latmiya procession , in which the men chanted songs lamenting Hussein ’s martyrdom and vowing fealty to him .
“ We have chosen our destiny , ” they sang , “ we are the sons of Sadr , soldiers for the Mahdi . ”
The thousands of onlookers waited until dawn for the culmination of the events .
At 4 in the morning , hundreds of men dressed in white robes met in tents .
They carried short swords , which they cleaned in buckets of soap .
After performing the dawn prayer they lined up , and led by trumpeters and drummers , they began a march through the alleys toward the shrine of Zeinab .
They chanted : “ Haidar ! Haidar ! ” — another name for Ali , father of Hussein and Zeinab .
The men and boys swung their swords rhythmically , hitting their foreheads and drawing blood , which soon drenched their faces and robes .
As onlookers filmed the scene on their camera phones and the sun rose above them , the men danced in bloody ecstasy until they reached the shrine and the event ended suddenly , with people returning to their homes or hotel rooms .
In Iraq ’s shrine cities , I had seen such religious marches end in explosions and armed attacks .
Here in Syria , the commemoration ended with the beginning of another unremarkable day .
This must be what Iraqi normality is like , and now it can only happen outside Iraq .
Each person has an effect on someone else — positive or negative .
Whether one runs a company or just on a personal level , one can influence others .
One of the infinite ways to do so positively is with The Way to Happiness booklet .
The message of the booklet includes sharing it with others .
To make this even more possible , The Way to Happiness Foundation has state - of - the - art graphic design and print - on - demand facilities at its headquarters in Glendale , California , to produce booklets with customized covers in 114 languages for any individual , group , corporation or agency that wishes to forward this message of goodwill .
Marc Hedlund , founder of the intriguing Wesabe , recently made this interesting observation :
One of my favorite business model suggestions for entrepreneurs is , find an old UNIX command that has n’t yet been implemented on the web , and fix that .
talk and finger became ICQ , LISTSERV became Yahoo !
Groups , ls became ( the original ) Yahoo ! , find and grep became Google , rn became Bloglines , pine became Gmail , mount is becoming S3 , and bash is becoming Yahoo !
Pipes .
I did n’t get until tonight that Twitter is wall for the web .
I love that .
A slightly related way of thinking about how to choose web projects is to take something that everyone does with their friends and make it public and permanent .
( Permanent as in permalinked . )
Examples :
Blogger , 1999 .
Blog posts = public email messages .
Instead of “ Dear Bob , Check out this movie . ” it ’s “ Dear People I May or May Not Know Who Are Interested in Film Noir , Check out this movie and if you like it , maybe we can be friends . ”
Twitter , 2006 .
Twitter = public IM .
I do n’t think it ’s any coincidence that one of the people responsible for Blogger is also responsible for Twitter .
Flickr , 2004 .
Flickr = public photo sharing .
Flickr co-founder Caterina
Fake said in a recent interview : “ When we started the company , there were dozens of other photosharing companies such as Shutterfly , but on those sites there was no such thing as a public photograph — it did n’t even exist as a concept — so the idea of something ‘ public ’ changed the whole idea of Flickr . ”
YouTube , 2005 .
YouTube = public home videos .
Bob Saget was onto something .
Not that this approach leads naturally to success .
Several companies are exploring music sharing ( and musical opinion sharing ) , but no one ’s gotten it just right yet , due in no small measure to the rights issues around much recorded music .

U.S. Agents Visit Ethiopian Secret Jails
By ANTHONY MITCHELL
The Associated Press
Tuesday , April 3 , 2007 ; 2:10 PM
Published in The Washington Post
NAIROBI , Kenya -- CIA and FBI agents hunting for al - Qaida militants in the Horn of Africa have been interrogating terrorism suspects from 19 countries held at secret prisons in Ethiopia , which is notorious for torture and abuse , according to an investigation by The Associated Press .
Human rights groups , lawyers and several Western diplomats assert hundreds of prisoners , who include women and children , have been transferred secretly and illegally in recent months from Kenya and Somalia to Ethiopia , where they are kept without charge or access to lawyers and families .
The detainees include at least one U.S. citizen and some are from Canada , Sweden and France , according to a list compiled by a Kenyan Muslim rights group and flight manifests obtained by AP .
Some were swept up by Ethiopian troops that drove a radical Islamist government out of neighboring Somalia late last year .
Others have been deported from Kenya , where many Somalis have fled the continuing violence in their homeland .
Forty - two - year - old mother of three , Kamilya Mohammedi Tuweni , left , sits with her brother Sabry Abdullah in her house in Sharjah , United Arab Emirates , Sunday , April 1 , 2007 .
Kamilya said she was held incommunicado , without charges or due process for more than two and a half months in jails in Kenya , Somalia and finally Ethiopia .
She was freed a month after being interviewed , fingerprinted and photographed by a U.S. agent , she said .

Ethiopia , which denies holding secret prisoners , is a country with a long history of human rights abuses .
In recent years , it has also been a key U.S. ally in the fight against al - Qaida , which has been trying to sink roots among Muslims in the Horn of Africa .

U.S. government officials contacted by AP acknowledged questioning prisoners in Ethiopia .
But they said American agents were following the law and were fully justified in their actions because they are investigating past attacks and current threats of terrorism .
The prisoners were never in American custody , said an FBI spokesman , Richard Kolko , who denied the agency would support or be party to illegal arrests .
He said U.S. agents were allowed limited access by governments in the Horn of Africa to question prisoners as part of the FBI 's counter - terrorism work .
Western security officials , who insisted on anonymity because the issue related to security matters , told AP that among those held were well - known suspects with strong links to al - Qaida .
But some U.S. allies have expressed consternation at the transfers to the prisons .
One Western diplomat in Nairobi , who agreed to speak to AP only if not quoted to avoid angering U.S. officials , said he sees the United States as playing a guiding role in the operation .
John Sifton , a Human Rights
Watch expert on counter - terrorism , went further .
He said in an e-mail that the United States has acted as " ringleader " in what he labeled a " decentralized , outsourced Guantanamo . "
Details of the arrests , transfers and interrogations slowly emerged as AP and human rights groups investigated the disappearances , diplomats tracked their missing citizens and the first detainees to be released told their stories .
One investigator from an international human rights group , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak to the media , said Ethiopia had secret jails at three locations : Addis Ababa , the capital ; an Ethiopian air base 37 miles east of the capital ; and the far eastern desert close to the Somali border .
More than 100 of the detainees were originally arrested in Kenya in January , after almost all of them fled Somalia because of the intervention by Ethiopian troops accompanied by U.S. special forces advisers , according to Kenyan police reports and U.S. military officials .
Those people were then deported in clandestine pre-dawn flights to Somalia , according to the Kenya Muslim Human Rights Forum and airline documents .
At least 19 were women and 15 were children .
In Somalia , they were handed over to Ethiopian intelligence officers and secretly flown to Ethiopia , where they are now in detention , the New York - based Human Rights Watch says .
A further 200 people , also captured in Somalia , were mainly Ethiopian rebels who backed the Somali Islamist movement , according to one rights group and a Somali government official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to jeopardize his job .
Those prisoners also were taken to Ethiopia , human rights groups say .
Kenya continues to arrest hundreds of people for illegally crossing over from Somalia .
But it is not clear if deportations continue .
The Pentagon announced last week that one Kenyan al - Qaida suspect who fled Somalia , Mohamed Abul Malik , was arrested and flown to the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
When contacted by AP , Ethiopian officials denied that they held secret prisoners or that any detainees were questioned by U.S. officials .
" No such kind of secret prisons exist in Ethiopia , " said Bereket Simon , special adviser to Prime Minister Meles Zenawi .
He declined to comment further .
A former prisoner and the families of current and former captives tell a different story .
" It was a nightmare from start to finish , " Kamilya Mohammedi Tuweni , a 42 - year - old mother of three who has a passport from the United Arab Emirates , told AP in her first comments after her release in Addis Ababa on March 24 from what she said was 2 1/2 months in detention without charge .
She is the only released prisoner who has spoken publicly .
She was freed a month after being interviewed , fingerprinted and photographed by a U.S. agent , she said .
Tuweni , an Arabic - Swahili translator , said she was arrested while on a business trip to Kenya and had never been to Somalia or had any links to that country .
She said she was arrested Jan. 10 .
Tuweni said she was beaten in Kenya , then forced to sleep on a stone floor while held in Somalia in a single room with 22 other women and children for 10 days before being flown to Ethiopia on a military plane .
Finally , she said , she was taken blindfolded from prison to a private villa in the Ethiopian capital .
There , she said , she was interrogated with other women by a male U.S. intelligence agent .
He assured her that she would not be harmed but urged her to cooperate , she said .
In a telephone conversation with AP , Tuweni said the man identified himself as a U.S. official , but not from the FBI .
A CIA official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said Tuesday that the agency had no contact with Tuweni .
" We cried the whole time because we did not know what would happen .
The whole thing was very scary , " said Tuweni , who flew back to her family in Dubai a day after her release .
Tuweni's version of her transfer out of Kenya is corroborated by the manifest of the African Express Airways flight 5Y AXF .
It shows she was taken to Mogadishu , Somalia , with 31 other people on an unscheduled flight chartered by the Kenyan government .
The family of a Swedish detainee , 17 - year - old Safia Benaouda , said she was freed from Ethiopia on March 27 and arrived home the following day .
Benaouda had traveled to Somalia with her fiance but fled to Kenya during the Ethiopian military intervention , her mother said .
" She is exhausted , her face is yellow and she 's lost about 10 kilograms ( 22 pounds ) , " her mother , Helena Benaouda , a 47 - year - old Muslim convert who heads the Swedish Muslim Council , wrote on a Web site she set up to help secure her daughter 's release .
" She was beaten with a stick when she demanded to go to the toilet . "
The mother spoke briefly by telephone with AP , saying any information she had was being posted on the Web site .
She declined to make her daughter available for an interview .
According to the Web site , an American specialist visited the location where Benaouda was being held and took DNA samples and fingerprints of detainees .
It said the teenager was never charged or allowed access to lawyers .
The teen was also concerned about a 7 - month - old baby that was in detention with her , the Web site said .
The transfer from Kenya to Somalia , and eventually to Ethiopia , of a 24 - year - old U.S. citizen , Amir Mohamed Meshal , raised disquiet among FBI officers and the State Department .
He is the only American known to be among the detainees in Ethiopia .
U.S. diplomats on Feb. 27 formally protested to Kenyan authorities about Meshal 's transfer and then spent three weeks trying to gain access to him in Ethiopia , said Tom Casey , deputy spokesman for the State Department .
He confirmed Meshal was still in Ethiopian custody pending a hearing on his status .
An FBI memo read to AP by a U.S. official in Washington , who insisted on anonymity , quoted an agent who interrogated Meshal as saying the agent was " disgusted " by Meshal 's deportation to Somalia by Kenya .
The unidentified agent said he was told by U.S. consular staff that the deportation was illegal .
" My personal opinion was that he may have been a jihadi a -hole , but the precedent of ' deporting ' U.S. citizens to dangerous situations when there is no reason to do so was a bad one , " the official quoted the memo as saying .
Like Benaouda , Meshal was arrested fleeing Somalia .
A Kenyan police report of Meshal 's arrest obtained by AP says he was carrying an assault rifle and had crossed into Kenyan with armed Arab men who were trying to avoid capture .
Meshal 's parents insist he is innocent and called on the U.S. government to win his release .
" My son 's only crime is that he 's a Muslim , an American Muslim , " his father , Mohamed Meshal , said from the family 's two - story home on a cul - de-sac in Tinton Falls , N.J. , where he lives with his wife , Fifi .
" Clearly the U.S. government interrogated him , and threatened him with torture according to the accounts that we 've seen , " said Jonathan Hafetz , a lawyer at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law who has been assisting the family .
Rep. Rush Holt , D - N.J. , wrote to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Monday to demand Meshal 's immediate release .
" Our government cannot allow an American citizen to continue to be held by the Ethiopian government in violation of international law and our own due process , " he said .
The International Committee of the Red Cross , the guardian of the Geneva Conventions that protect victims of war , is seeking access to the Ethiopian detainees , said a diplomat from a country whose citizens are being held .
He insisted on speaking anonymously because he is working for their release .
U.S. officials , who agreed to discuss the detentions only if not quoted by name because of the information 's sensitivity , said Ethiopia had allowed access to U.S. agencies , including the CIA and FBI , but the agencies played no role in arrests , transport or deportation .
One official said it would have been irresponsible to pass up an opportunity to learn more about terrorist operations .
Kolko , the FBI spokesman , also said the detainees were never in FBI or U.S. government custody .
" While in custody of the foreign government , the FBI was granted limited access to interview certain individuals of interest , " he told AP .
" We do not support or participate in any system that illegally detains foreign fighters or terror suspects , including women and children . "
Paul Gimigliano , a CIA spokesman , declined to discuss details of any such interviews .
He said , however : " To fight terror , CIA acts boldly and lawfully , alone and with partners , just as the American people expect us to . "
One of the U.S. officials said the FBI has had access in Ethiopia to several dozen individuals _ fewer than 100 _ as part of its investigations .
The official said the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania that killed hundreds are a major focus of the agents ' work .
Law enforcement officials have long believed the bombings were carried out by members of Osama bin Laden 's terrorist network who were later given safe haven in Somalia .
The official said FBI agents would not be witness or party to any questioning that involved abuse .
It was n't clear how many people the CIA interviewed or whether the agency 's officers were working jointly with the FBI .
The CIA began an aggressive program in 2002 to interrogate suspected terrorists at an unknown number of secret locations from Southeast Asia to Europe .
Prisoners were frequently picked up in one country and transferred to a prison in another , where they were held incommunicado by a cooperative intelligence service .
But President Bush announced in September that all the detainees had been moved to military custody at Guantanamo Bay .
One Western diplomat , who refused to be quoted by name for fear of hurting relations with the countries involved , would not rule out that additional suspects in Ethiopia could be sent to Guantanamo .
Kenyan government spokesman Alfred Mutua insisted no laws were broken and said his government was not aware that anyone would be transferred from Somalia to Ethiopia .
Lawyers and human rights groups argue the covert transfers to Ethiopia violated international law .
" Each of these governments has played a shameful role in mistreating people fleeing a war zone , " said Georgette Gagnon , deputy Africa director of Human Rights Watch .
" Kenya has secretly expelled people , the Ethiopians have caused dozens to disappear , and U.S. security agents have routinely interrogated people held incommunicado . "

Andrew M. Cuomo , the New York attorney general who has been investigating the relationship between student lenders and universities , has issued subpoenas to Columbia and to the CIT Group , and requested information from the University of Southern California and the University of Texas .
A senior lawyer in Mr. Cuomo ’s office , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing , said , “ As we gather the information we have subpoenaed from CIT , and we ’ve subpoenaed both documents and testimony , we certainly will get to the bottom of all these relationships . ”
The New York State Ethics Commission twice approved Mr. Ryan ’s membership on the CIT board , in July 2003 , when he was president at SUNY ’s Maritime College , and again in July 2005 , when he became SUNY ’s acting chancellor .
Mr. Ryan said he had been unaware until yesterday that Maritime College , where he was president for three years , had listed Student Loan Xpress as a preferred lender last year , after he had left the campus .
He was Maritime ’s president from 2002 to 2005 .
He recently announced his intention to step down as SUNY ’s chancellor at the end of May .
“ I do n’t make loans , ” he said .
“ I do n’t make any decisions as chancellor about who is going to be permitted to make student loans at each university or college .
They have professionals that do that . ”
Mr. Ryan said that CIT , a New York - based company that specializes in commercial and consumer finance , had not been in the student loan business when he joined its board in 2003 .
He said it entered that business in 2005 with the acquisition of Education Lending Group , the parent company for Student Loan Xpress .
He said he had undoubtedly voted on the acquisition , but had not been consulted individually about it .
At the time of the acquisition , CIT ’s chairman and chief executive , Jeffrey M. Peek , said student lending was attractive because it was a “ higher growth business with predictable performance characteristics . ”
One of two Republican lawmakers who attended the meeting , Representative Chris Cannon of Utah , said in an interview afterward that he had pressed Mr. Fielding on whether he “ understood that a lie would be prosecutable , ” even if the interview was not conducted under oath .
“ He said , ‘ Yes , we understand that , ’ ” Mr. Cannon said .
Lying to Congress can be a crime even if the false statements are not made under oath .
But Democrats dismissed Mr. Fielding ’s offer as window dressing .
Senator Harry Reid , the majority leader , suggested that the administration had misled him , and released a Justice Department letter that said it was not aware that Mr. Rove had played any role in the decision to appoint one of his former deputies as United States attorney in Arkansas .
“ I want to hear Karl Rove testify under oath about the role he played in this whole affair , ” Mr. Reid said .
As the war of words escalated , people on both sides acknowledged a legal fight carried political risks .
Beth Nolan , who was counsel to President Bill Clinton and twice testified to Congress under subpoena , said she suspected the clash would lead to more negotiations , and not a court fight .
“ There ’s the legal path to the fight and the political path , ” she said .
“ It ’s much more likely that you ’ll see a political path . ”
The Bush administration has been a fierce defender of presidential powers but has solved most of the issues without going to court .
For instance , the president and Vice President Dick Cheney agreed to be interviewed by the commission investigating the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , although they did so behind closed doors and not under oath .
Nevertheless Mr. Bush said Tuesday that he would “ oppose any attempts to subpoena White House officials . ”
Asked if he would be willing to go to court over the matter , Mr. Bush said , “ Absolutely . ”
Mr. Bush once again defended the dismissals , and he said it was “ natural and appropriate ” for members of the White House staff to discuss them with the Justice Department .
At the same time , he offered an apology to the dismissed United States attorneys , saying , “ I regret that these resignations turned into such a public spectacle . ”
The motivation for the dismissals is still not fully understood .
Democrats , including Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York , who is leading the inquiry in the Senate , and Senator Dianne Feinstein of California , have said they want to know whether prosecutors were dismissed to thwart public corruption investigations .
Last week I published an article here entitled “ LandlordMax ’s Most Challenging Bug ” which received lots of comments both online and through personal emails ( probably more people sent emails than commented ) .
One thing that really struck me was the difference in thinking between people who run a business ( from small ISV owners to managers ) and technical people ( developers , architects , etc. ) .
Based on their background the solutions varied substantially .
I ’m not talking how to tackle the problem technically ( btw there were some great tips and information being shared , thank you ! ) , there was no doubt there was a lot of variation here , but I ’m talking in terms of what types of solutions made economical sense .
What really struck me is that most developers completely ignored the cost to benefit side of the equation !
I ’m not saying that you should always base your decision on cost to benefits ( I do n’t want to acquire design debt for example ) , but sometimes this becomes a strong factor in the decision making .
This is something that I use to lack , I always wanted to get in there and find the correct technical solution .
The reality is that sometimes it ’s not the right thing to do .
This is a hard pill for technical people to swallow .
I know it use to be for me .
Not so much anymore being a lot more on the business side of things , but in the past it was a common issue .
Using my last article as a basis for this argument , let ’s look at the cost to benefit of different types of solutions .
Not actual solutions , but cost to benefits of the types of solutions .
Rather than share my actual numbers , let ’s just round realistic numbers to make the calculations , it ’ll be much easier that way .
So our first assumption is that allocating a developer to a task for 1 full day will cost $ 1000 in immediate salary .
We should of course add in the costs of benefits , hardware , software , training , testing , etc. , but for now let ’s just say it ’s $ 1000 / day for a developer .
Now remember this cost does not include any testing !
Ok , now I ’ll assume that our fictional company makes $ 1 million in revenue a year , a simple round number .
Assuming we have a unit price of $ 150 per unit , then this means we sell 6667 units per year .
Now before I proceed , let me backtrack a little .
For those of you who are interested , you can read the full article here .
However , just to get everyone up to speed , here ’s the quick version .
We found a bug in LandlordMax regarding how it reads certain types of JPG images .
This bug is also present in many larger software application such as Internet Explorer and FireFox , so it ’s not a simple solution .
Also , images are n’t part of our core functionality .
Do n’t get me wrong , they ’re a great feature , but we did n’t have them in the first 3 major versions .
Now the problem is that we have two solutions , one that ’s quicker to implement and one that is n’t .
This problem only affects 0.05 % of our total customers , and of those 90 % will be satisfied with this solution .
The other solution is complex , will take more than a week or two , and probably wo n’t fully work ( IE and FireFox with very large resources still do n’t have it full working ) .
This solution will satisfy 90 % of those customers too , possibly more .
Using these parameters , we can see there are two sides to this coin .
Most technical people will want to fully solve the issue , to get it right .
Yes the costs are high , but let ’s do it right .
The business side want ’s to see what ’s the cost to benefit .
Now just a quick side step , you have to remember that you ca n’t always just look at the cost to benefit otherwise you ’ll get so far into design debt that you ’ll eventually kill your company .
However , in this case , we ’re not very likely to expand on this issue once it ’s solved so it ’s very unlikely that we ’ll add any design debt no matter what solution we decide .
In any case , let ’s look at the two solutions .
Solution 1 :
An acceptable solution to the problem which will take about 1 / 2 a developer day , padded to 1 full day for safety .
In this case , the cost is $ 1000 .
Now if we calculate it terms of cost to benefit , it means we ’re paying $ 1000 for 0.05 % of our 6667 customers , or 333 customers .
On average , this means that we ’re paying $ 3.33 to add this solution for these customers , of which 90 % will be ok with the solution .
The remainder would like a better solution but will probably live with it since this is only a small part of why their using the software , after all this is not the core functionality of the software .
Also remember that these few people who are used to using this type of image mode also use to having this issue with a number of other major software applications .
So it ’s nothing new .
Solution 2 :
We provide as best a technical solution as we can , knowing that we probably wo n’t be able to solve it fully as other software companies with budgets multiple orders of magnitude bigger larger than our total revenue ca n’t solve it .
We ’d be lucky to spend only a week , probably 2 weeks , and this might only reduce the number of people facing the issue by a percentage .
But let ’s be optimistic and say that we ’ll solve it for 90 % of the people who use this image mode .
Then in this case , we ’ll spend 10 developer days , $ 10,000 , to solve it .
This means that it costs us $ 10,000 for our 333 customers .
On average , this means we spend $ 30 per customer on this solution alone .
This is now a significant percentage of the purchase price ( 20 % of the total purchase price for fixing a small bug ) .
But again , remember that it ’s only for 90 % of these 333 , so we ’re only really solving it for 300 people , bringing our per customer solution price to $ 33.33 , or 22 % of the total purchase price .
We still have to deal with the remainder 10 % , or 33 people .
Assuming we use solution 1 for the remainder , this now brings up our price to $ 11,000 , $ 10,000 for the initial solution and $ 1,000 for the remainder .
Our total price per customer is now $ 33 for just this bug fix , or 22 % of the total purchase price .
Which Solution is Right ?
Which of these two solutions would you be more inclined to implement from a business side ?
What about from a technical side ?
From a technical side , at least from my experience , we always want the perfect solution .
But from a business side , it makes a lot more sence to go with solution 1 .
And do n’t forget , solution 2 is probably a lot more costly than we estimated , it might take us a month , maybe two , or what if it ’s a never ending series of issues ?
If the solution takes two months , which is not so hard to imagine once you see how Mozilla ( FireFox ) solved it ( and that ’s not even fully working ) , that brings our cost per customer to approximately $ 120 per customer .
We ’re now at 80 % of the total purchase price for just one bug fix that ’s not critical !
Yes it ’s only a portion of the customer , yes we could amortize it , yes we could calculate in the total lifetime purchases of the customer , and so on .
But looking at the numbers when the first scenario is perfectly acceptable , I just ca n’t see how I can justify scenario 2 .
As a developer , I can easily find ways to justify solution 2 such as design debt , etc .
But from a business perspective solution 2 makes no sense !
UPDATE : Now add to solution 1 the fact that we now have an additional 9 - 10 developer days to add more features and benefits to the software .
Let ’s say we can increase our sales by 2 % by instead allocating this same developer for the time difference to a new highly requested feature ( maybe it ’s only 1 % , maybe it ’s 10 % , in any case , we ’ll just use 2 % since it ’s easily feasible ) .
If that ’s the case , we can increase our sales of $ 1 million to $ 1,020,000 , or by $ 20,000 .
Now not only have we paid for our bug fix , we ’ve also paid for our developer and made a profit !
And the thing to remember here is that we ’re not just helping 0.05 % of the people ( which we are ) , we ’re also making 100 % of the all our customers happier with a new feature ( well maybe not 100 % , but a much much larger percentage than 0.05 % ) that they wanted !
Several bloggers have written today about this quote from Thomas Sowell :
When I see the worsening degeneracy in our politicians , our media , our educators , and our intelligentsia , I canâ€™t help wondering if the day may yet come when the only thing that can save this country is a military coup .
I think it ’s perfectly clear that this was somewhat of a throw - away line on Sowell ’s part ; and definitely hyperbole .
Nonetheless , it ’s set off quite a discussion .
Steven Taylor for one did n’t hold back :
One wonders if Sowell has ever actually studied countries where the assumption was that the military could sweep in and â€œfixâ€ things .
Clearly there are people out there , who ought to know better , who prefer democracy only when it produces the outcomes that they like .
A military coup as a throw - away suggested cure for what ails us ?
Quite frankly , that is an obscene suggestion .
Steven Bainbridge suggests that , because of the culture that has developed in the Armed Services over the past 200 years , it ’s unlikely that the military would ever overthrow the government in this country .
And , finally , James Joyner points out that even if such a coup did succeed , it would take away not only the civilian government , but any notion of individual liberty .
Clearly , if he really is suggesting that a military coup would be the cure for a despotic government , Sowell is completely wrong .
Without fail , military coups in other countries have led to repression and a loss of individual freedom .
Even when the junta finally cedes control back to civilian authorities , which happens rarely and only after much time has passed , the relationship between the state and the military is forever changed and the threat of another coup hangs over the civilian leadership like the Sword of Damocles .
Instead of being an institution under civilian control , the military turns into a power center of it ’s own and , since it has the real power in the form of guns , tanks , and airplanes , it quickly becomes the predominant power .
I do n’t disagree with Sowell that there is much to be distressed about when it comes to the current state of the United States of America .
The question of whether there will come a time when armed rebellion against an oppressive state is justified has been debated here and elsewhere countless times .
However , turning the United States , or any other country , into a military dictatorship is n’t going to do anything to stop the erosion of personal freedom .
Dynamic models
For an updated information about dynamic models in Django 1.2 and later ​checkout this guide .
this works with django 0.96 .
There are some modification that make it hard to adjust it with django version 1.0
TOC ?
As of [ 5163 ] , Django models can now be created dynamically at run-time , rather than being defined in a Python source file .
While this may seem useless on the surface , it actually provides a powerful way to prototype a Django project , even by users who do n't know a thing about Python !
This page lists the basic technique involved in creating models at run-time , as well as some examples of how it could be used .
It is not meant to be exhaustive , nor is it meant to be drop - in code for your own project .
Read and learn , do n't copy .
The basic technique
Internally , Django uses metaclasses to create models based on a class you provide in your source code .
Without getting into too many details , that means that rather than your classes being the actual models , Django receives a description of your class , which it uses to create a model in its place .
For more details , see the writeup on Model Creation .
Thankfully , Python treats classes like any other object , so we can force this process to occur even when the class was n't defined in source .
All we really need is to give Django a description of a class , and let it do all the work of creating the model for us .
Here 's some bare - bones code .
model = type ( name , ( models .
Model , ) , attrs )
As you can see , describing a model for the purposes of metaclasses involves three pieces of information :
The intended name of the class
A tuple containing any classes it inherits from
A dictionary containing the attributes of the class
Python then processes that description as if it came from a normal class declaration , automatically triggering Django 's metaclass along the way .
In fact , these three bits of information correspond exactly to standard definitions , as shown in the following comparison .
This :
class Person ( models .
Model ) : first_name = models .
CharField ( max_length = 255 ) last_name = models .
CharField ( max_length = 255 )
is functionally equivalent to this :
Person = type ( ' Person ' , ( models .
Model , ) , { ' first_name ' : models .
CharField ( max_length = 255 ) , ' last_name ' : models .
CharField ( max_length = 255 ) , } )
Yes , that is slightly more code than the standard technique , but the advantages of not having to declare a model in Python source should become clear shortly .
A general - purpose approach
To illustrate in a simple manner how easy it can be to create full models on the fly , consider the following function .
def create_model ( name , fields = None , app_label = '' , module = '' , options = None , admin_opts = None ) : " " " Create specified model " " " class Meta : # Using type (' Meta ' , ... ) gives a dictproxy error during model creation pass if app_label : # app_label must be set using the Meta inner class setattr ( Meta , ' app_label ' , app_label ) # Update Meta with any options that were provided if options is not None : for key , value in options .
iteritems ( ) : setattr ( Meta , key , value ) #
Set up a dictionary to simulate declarations within a class attrs = { ' __module__ ' : module , ' Meta ' : Meta } #
Add in any fields that were provided if fields : attrs .
update ( fields ) # Create the class , which automatically triggers ModelBase processing model = type ( name , ( models .
Model , ) , attrs ) # Create an Admin class if admin options were provided if admin_opts is not None : class Admin ( admin .
ModelAdmin ) : pass for key , value in admin_opts : setattr ( Admin , key , value ) admin .
site .
register ( model , Admin ) return model
This function provides everything necessary to make a fully functional Django model from scratch , even given data that 's not available until the application is up and running .
The arguments it takes work as follows :
name -
The name of the model to be created
- The name of the model to be created fields - A dictionary of fields the model will have ( managers and methods would go in this dictionary as well )
- A dictionary of fields the model will have ( managers and methods would go in this dictionary as well ) app_label - A custom application label for the model ( this does not have to exist in your project , but see the Admin drawback below )
- A custom application label for the model ( this does not have to exist in your project , but see the Admin drawback below ) module - An arbitrary module name to use as the model 's source ( prior to [ 5163 ] , this had to be a real module path that had in fact been loaded )
- An arbitrary module name to use as the model 's source ( prior to [ 5163 ] , this had to be a real module path that had in fact been loaded ) options - A dictionary of options , as if they were provided to the inner Meta class
- A dictionary of options , as if they were provided to the inner class admin_opts - A dictionary of admin options , as if they were provided to the Admin class ( again , see Admin drawback below )
A note about app_label and module : Django always needs an app_label for its own use .
If it 's not explicitly supplied , it will be pulled from part of the model 's __module__ attribute , so at least one of the two must always be provided .
Otherwise , you 'll get a KeyError : '' error when you try to create the model .
Supplying app_label will always work just fine , regardless of whether module is provided .
But if you supply only module , you 'll have to make sure that it lines up with an entry in INSTALLED_APPS , so that Django can determine app_label correctly .
Models can be created using this class with any number of features , as shown by the examples below .
>>> model = create_model ( ' Empty ' , app_label = ' dynamic ' ) >>> model .
__module__ '' >>> model .
_meta . app_label ' dynamic ' >>> len ( model .
_meta . fields ) # Remember , an " id " field is created automatically for each model 1
>>> fields = { ... ' first_name ' : models .
CharField ( max_length = 255 ) , ... ' last_name ' : models .
CharField ( max_length = 255 ) , ... ' __str__ ' : lambda self : ' %s %s ' ( self .
first_name , self .
last_name ) , ... } >>> options = { ... ' ordering ' : [ ' last_name ' , ' first_name ' ] , ... ' verbose_name ' : ' valued customer ' , ... } >>> admin_opts = {} #
An empty dictionary is equivalent to " class Admin : pass " >>> model = create_model ( ' Person ' , fields , ... options = options , ... admin_opts = admin_opts , ... app_label = ' fake_app ' , ... module = ' fake_project.fake_app.no_models ' , ... ) >>> model .
_meta . verbose_name_plural ' valued customers ' >>> len ( model .
_meta . fields ) # Remember , an " id " field is created automatically for each model 3
A database - driven approach
Much more useful , however , is the ability to manage models using data contained in other models .
This would allow model prototypes to be created and shared using the standard admin interface , even by users with no Python knowledge .
Consider the following models .
from django.core.validators import ValidationError class App ( models .
Model ) : name = models .
CharField ( max_length = 255 ) module = models .
CharField ( max_length = 255 ) def __str__ ( self ) : return self .
name class Model ( models .
Model ) : app = models .
ForeignKey ( App , related_name = ' models ' ) name = models .
CharField ( max_length = 255 ) def __str__ ( self ) : return self .
name def get_django_model ( self ) : " Returns a functional Django model based on current data " #
Get all associated fields into a list ready for dict ( ) fields = [ ( f . name , f . get_django_field ( ) ) for f in self .
fields . all ( ) ]
#
Use the create_model function defined above return create_model ( self .
name , dict ( fields ) , self .
app .
name , self .
app . module ) class Meta : unique_together = ( ( ' app ' , ' name ' ) , ) def is_valid_field ( self , field_data , all_data ) : if hasattr ( models , field_data ) and issubclass ( getattr ( models , field_data ) , models .
Field ) : #
It exists and is a proper field type return raise ValidationError ( " This is not a valid field type . " ) class Field ( models .
Model ) : model = models .
ForeignKey ( Model , related_name = ' fields ' ) name = models .
CharField ( max_length = 255 ) type = models .
CharField ( max_length = 255 , validators = [ is_valid_field ] ) def get_django_field ( self ) : " Returns the correct field type , instantiated with applicable settings " #
Get all associated settings into a list ready for dict ( ) settings = [ ( s . name , s . value ) for s in self .
settings . all ( ) ]
# Instantiate the field with the settings as ** kwargs return getattr ( models , self . type ) ( ** dict ( settings ) ) class Meta : unique_together = (( ' model ' , ' name ' ) , ) class Setting ( models .
Model ) : field = models .
ForeignKey ( Field , related_name = ' settings ' ) name = models .
CharField ( max_length = 255 ) value = models .
CharField ( max_length = 255 ) class Meta : unique_together = ( ( ' field ' , ' name ' ) , )
This does n't take Meta or Admin options into account , nor does it allow for the creation of any model methods , but it 's a decent example of how it could be done .
Now a model can be created based on a database - backed description , as simply as this ( but see the syncdb section for more details ) :
>>> model = Model . objects .
get ( app__name = ' fake_project ' , name = ' FakeModel ' ) >>> model < Model : FakeModel > >>> model .
_meta .
app_label ' fake_project ' >>> model .
objects . count () 45
Cloning existing models
There are some situations where it 's useful to copy existing models , make slight modifications , and have them available to Django .
One example of this is an AuditTrail and its article describes the techniques necessary to accomplish this .
Drawbacks
While dynamic model creation has incredible potential , it should not be considered a recommended way to go about model declarations .
Most projects wo n't find any value in it , and those that do have a bit of work making sure their definition scheme is robust enough for their needs .
In addition to the decision of whether to use them , there are a few other details that somewhat hinder their use .
Syncdb
The standard syncdb function provided by manage .
py relies on crawling through apps that are registered during Django 's startup .
This means that dynamic models ( likely ) wo n't even be found by the time syncdb runs .
Even if a dynamic model is found and loaded , its app_label ( whether calculated based on its __module__ or provided through Meta ) must match an entry in your INSTALLED_APPS setting in order to be processed properly .
This is by design , and should not be considered a bug of any kind .
It 's just a fact of life when dealing with models in this manner .
Without having a table in the database , however , dynamic models will be unable to perform any queries ; they just sit there looking shiny .
One workaround for basic models uses an internal portion of django.core .
management to install a basic table definition to the database .
def install ( model ) : from django.core .
management import sql , color from django.db import connection # Standard syncdb expects models to be in reliable locations , # so dynamic models need to bypass django.core.management.syncdb . #
On the plus side , this allows individual models to be installed # without installing the entire project structure .
#
On the other hand , this means that things like relationships and # indexes will have to be handled manually .
#
This installs only the basic table definition .
# disable terminal colors in the sql statements style = color .
no_style ( ) cursor = connection .
cursor ( ) statements , pending = sql .
sql_model_create ( model , style ) for sql in statements : cursor .
execute ( sql )
As the comments indicate , this will only create the single table definition , so proceed with caution if you use this function .
For a production environment , a more robust solution should be found .
< speculation type =" wild " >
Since this involves app_label , # 3591 might help , but more research is necessary on that .</ speculation >
Admin interface
Django 's built - in admin interface also relies on your project 's INSTALLED_APPS setting , so models created dynamically will not show up in the admin unless their app_label s match up with packages listed in INSTALLED_APPS .
This is again by design , and should not be considered a bug .
Applications which make use of dynamic models should either create a placeholder app and put it in the project settings , or create a custom data interface for accessing the dynamic models .
manage .py startapp my_placeholder
INSTALLED_APPS = ( ... ( ' myproject.myapp.my_placeholder ' ) , ... )
model = create_model ( ' Model ' , app_label = ' my_placeholder ' )
HINT : Use a placeholder app unless you really need more flexibility .
Geoff Lane 's predecessor , Brian , had a problem : none of the URLs their dataset started with " http : / / " .
This meant that , before displaying them in the UI , Brian would have to figure out a way to take the string " http : // " , and placed it front of every URL .
Give that requirement , how might you accomplish such a task ?
Here was Brian 's solution ...
static public string PrependProtocol ( string urlString ) { string protocolString = " //:ptth " ; CharEnumerator charEnumerator = protocolString.GetEnumerator ( ) ; while ( charEnumerator. MoveNext ( ) ) { char padleftChar = charEnumerator .
Current ; urlString = urlString.PadLeft(urlString.Length + 1 , padleftChar ) ; } return urlString ; }

cryptogon.com news – analysis – conspiracies
March 2nd , 2007
Brother , I ’ll drink to that !
Most people reading Cryptogon inside the U.S. / Britain are familiar with nonstop feelings of impending doom and frequently asking themselves questions like :
Am I next ?
Is this it ?
Can I escape ?
Is it too late ?
Has everyone gone nuts ?
Have I gone nuts ?
Is this job killing me ?
What booze is on sale ?
etc. etc .
That was what it was like inside my head for about two years before I bought my one way ticket to New Zealand .
What was the actual escape like for me ?
After a couple of hectic days of selecting what to take with me , and what to leave behind , the time arrived for me to get to the airport .
As I was groped and fondled by defenders of the Homeland at airport security , I went into a kind of dreamlike trace .
“ Will I make it out to the other side of this thing ? ” I wondered .
The cacophony of the checkpoint became a sort of languid hum .
The fat TSA employee started to move its lips , but I do n’t remember what it said .
I complied , on some instinctual level .
A few minutes later , I was standing just beyond the security checkpoint , holding my shoes and belt in one hand , and my falling down pants with the other .
I exchanged a couple of brief , humiliated , what - just - happened - to - us ? kind of looks with other travelers , many of whom were not Americans , and not used to being treated like that .
I walked to the appropriate Air New Zealand gate and sat down .
I took my mobile phone out and called a couple of people to say one last goodbye .
Then I called the voice mail system for my phone and changed the greeting to something close to this :
“ Hi , you have reached Kevin .
I have left the United States and do n’t have any plans to return .
Goodbye . ”
Minutes later , hundreds of people , including me , took our seats in the belly of the large white bird .
Minutes after that , it hurtled down the runway and out over the Pacific Ocean , veering South and West .
I ’ve never been able to sleep on aircraft before .
But I did on that flight .
Once I was in Auckland , I had to catch another flight to reach the Far North , my wife ( she went over a few weeks before me ) and my new family .
I walked to the domestic departures area in the Auckland airport and asked an Air New Zealand employee where the security checkpoint was , because I somehow wound up at the gate without passing through one .
“ There is no security checkpoint for domestic flights , sir . ”
You can imagine my shock at this remarkable statement .
“ There ’s no security checkpoint ? ! ” I asked .
“ Nope .
Not for domestic flights , ” she smiled .
I felt like dropping to the ground and kissing the polyester airport carpet , but I did n’t .
I took a seat and mumbled to myself , “ I ’m not even out of the airport and things already seem better here . ”
That was my first big epiphany in New Zealand , and they just kept happening .
( Maybe someday I ’ll write more about this .
In short , if you ’re having doubts about the lies you ’ve been taught all your life about the U.S. , run with those feelings .
Run for your life . )
When I read the story below , I wondered , “ How long has it been since I escaped America ? ”
As of today , I have been in New Zealand for exactly one year .
On reflection , I think back on my life in America as a vague and distant nightmare .
The United States has became a vast nut house inside a debtor prison .
I ’m still not over the euphoria of being out .
Via : joebageant.com :
It is near midnight and the dogs sleeping in the sand under my cabana , Rex and Pluto , emit happy , gurgling growls , as if chasing imaginary rabbits in their dreams .
I lie in bed just breathing in and breathing out and feeling so free that I ’ve laughed out loud a couple of times tonight , something I have never done in my life .
At least not while simply looking at the ceiling .
Tomorrow I will not worry about losing my ass in the declining real estate market .
I will not commute three nerve grinding hours a day , or nervously engorge myself in front of my laptop for hours on end .
Nor will I or wake up with the crimes of the empire running like adding machine tape in my head , annotated with all the ways I contributed to those crimes by participating in the American lifestyle .
After more than two years of effort , I ’m outta the gilded gulag , by damned , and tell myself that I have at last quit being part of the problem — or at least as much as much as anyone can without living stark naked in a Himalayan cave and toasting insects over a dung fire .
When I arrived in Belize a few weeks ago I vowed never to write about this country , mainly because the Americans I write to are more interested in American politics , religion , class issues and the Iraq war .
How the hell could anybody with more than an inch of forehead not be anxious over those things ?
But the contrast here is so stark it seems unavoidable to write about the view of America from Belize and Hopkins Village this one time .
I must say that from down here the Empire does not look much different .
No worse , no better .
But the stress and stench of the empire is less in this Caribbean breeze and the mark of the beast is sharper from a distance .
The effect of moving was immediate .
As one expat told me years ago what would happen , whole days go by when I do not think of America at all , much less rage against it , something I would previously considered impossible .

Beheaded man 's father : Revenge breeds revenge Michael Berg talks about the death of his son and al - Zarqawi A terror - linked Web site showed Nicholas Berg being beheaded , likely by Abu Musab al - Zarqawi .
YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Nicholas Berg George W. Bush Al Qaeda Iraq or or Create Your Own ( CNN ) -- The U.S. - led coalition 's No. 1 wanted man in Iraq , Abu Musab al - Zarqawi -- who conducted a campaign of insurgency bombings , beheadings and killings of Americans and Iraqi civilians -- was killed in a U.S. airstrike .
A gruesome video was posted on Islamic Web sites in May , 2004 , depicting a man believed to be al - Zarqawi beheading Nicholas Berg , an American businessman who was working in Iraq .
CNN anchor Soledad O'Brien talks to Nicholas Berg 's father , Michael Berg , by phone from Wilmington , Delaware , for his reaction to the news .
O'BRIEN : Mr. Berg , thank you for talking with us again .
It 's nice to have an opportunity to talk to you .
Of course , I 'm curious to know your reaction , as it is now confirmed that Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , the man who is widely credited and blamed for killing your son , Nicholas , is dead .
MICHAEL BERG :
Well , my reaction is I 'm sorry whenever any human being dies .
Zarqawi is a human being .
He has a family who are reacting just as my family reacted when Nick was killed , and I feel bad for that .
( Watch Berg compare Zarqawi to President Bush -- 1:44 ) I feel doubly bad , though , because Zarqawi is also a political figure , and his death will re-ignite yet another wave of revenge , and revenge is something that I do not follow , that I do want ask for , that I do not wish for against anybody .
And it can't end the cycle .
As long as people use violence to combat violence , we will always have violence .
O'BRIEN : I have to say , sir , I 'm surprised .
I know how devastated you and your family were , frankly , when Nick was killed in such a horrible , and brutal and public way .
BERG : Well , you should n't be surprised , because I have never indicated anything but forgiveness and peace in any interview on the air .
O'BRIEN : No , no .
And we have spoken before , and I 'm well aware of that .
But at some point , one would think , is there a moment when you say , ' I 'm glad he 's dead , the man who killed my son ' ?
BERG : No .
How can a human being be glad that another human being is dead ?
O'BRIEN : There have been family members who have weighed in , victims , who 've said that they do n't think he 's a martyr in heaven , that they think , frankly , he went straight to hell ...
You know , you talked about the fact that he 's become a political figure .
Are you concerned that he becomes a martyr and a hero and , in fact , invigorates the insurgency in Iraq ?
BERG : Of course .
When Nick was killed , I felt that I had nothing left to lose .
I 'm a pacifist , so I was n't going out murdering people .
But I am -- was not a risk - taking person , and yet now I 've done things that have endangered me tremendously .
I 've been shot at .
I 've been showed horrible pictures .
I 've been called all kinds of names and threatened by all kinds of people , and yet I feel that I have nothing left to lose , so I do those things .
Now , take someone who in 1991 , who maybe had their family killed by an American bomb , their support system whisked away from them , someone who , instead of being 59 , as I was when Nick died , was 5 - years - old or 10 - years - old .
And then if I were that person , might I not learn how to fly a plane into a building or strap a bag of bombs to my back ?
That 's what is happening every time we kill an Iraqi , every time we kill anyone , we are creating a large number of people who are going to want vengeance .
And , you know , when are we ever going to learn that that does n't work ?
O'BRIEN : There 's an alternate reading , which would say at some point , Iraqis will say the insurgency is not OK -- that they 'll be inspired by the death of Abu Musab al - Zarqawi in the sense of he was turned in , for example , we believe by his own No. 2 , No. 3 leadership in his ranks .
And , that 's actually them saying we do not want this kind of violence in our country .
Experts whom we 've spoken to this morning have said this is a critical moment where Iraqis need to figure out which direction the country is going to go .
That would be an alternate reading to the scenario you 're pointing to .
( Watch how Iraqi leaders cheered after learning about al - Zarqawi's death -- 4:31 ) BERG :
Yes , well , I do n't believe that scenario , because every time news of new atrocities committed by Americans in Iraq becomes public , more and more of the everyday Iraqi people who tried to hold out , who tried to be peaceful people lose it and join -- what we call the insurgency , and what I call the resistance , against the occupation of one sovereign nation .
O'BRIEN : There 's a theory that a struggle for democracy , you know ...
BERG : Democracy ?
Come on , you can't really believe that that 's a democracy there when the people who are running the elections are holding guns .
That 's not democracy .
O'BRIEN : There 's a theory that as they try to form some kind of government , that it 's going to be brutal , it 's going to be bloody , there 's going to be loss , and that 's the history of many countries -- and that 's just what a lot of people pay for what they believe will be better than what they had under Saddam Hussein .
BERG : Well , you know , I 'm not saying Saddam Hussein was a good man , but he 's no worse than George Bush .
Saddam Hussein did n't pull the trigger , did n't commit the rapes .
Neither did George Bush .
But both men are responsible for them under their reigns of terror .
( Watch I do n't buy that .
Iraq did not have al Qaeda in it .
Al Qaeda supposedly killed my son .
Under Saddam Hussein , no al Qaeda .
Under George Bush , al Qaeda .
Under Saddam Hussein , relative stability .
Under George Bush , instability .
Under Saddam Hussein , about 30,000 deaths a year .
Under George Bush , about 60,000 deaths a year .
I do n't get it .
Why is it better to have George Bush the king of Iraq rather than Saddam Hussein ?
O'BRIEN : Michael Berg is the father of Nicholas Berg , the young man , the young businessman who was beheaded so brutally in Iraq back in May of 2004 .

Government probes May ' Bankers Gone Wild ' incident RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday June 20 , 2007 Print This Email
This
The government is probing a federal agency 's golf outing after witnesses reported that a senior official tried to turn it into a " Girls Gone Wild " video , the Washington Post reports .
" People who work at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. -- the folks who oversee the nation 's financial institutions -- are often , and apparently most unfairly , stereotyped as boring pencil pushers , " Al Kamen reports for the Post at his " In The Loop " column .
Kamen continues , " They are , it turns out , a fun-loving crowd .
And there 's an internal investigation now into whether someone was having a bit too much fun at the division of information technology 's annual golf outing May 22 at Penderbrook Golf Club in Fairfax County . "
" The FDIC is looking into reports that a senior official in the 274 - employee division asked or offered to pay two women at the outing -- one of whom did n't work in that division -- to take off their blouses , which they did , " Kamen reports .
" The incident allegedly was seen by many of the people who attended , though it was unclear whether it occurred in the clubhouse or on one of the greens . "
Andrew Gray , the FDIC 's public affairs director , tells the paper , " The individuals that participated in this off - site event used their own resources and took official leave to attend .
However , since the event was publicized internally by staff within the Division of Technology , the FDIC has taken strong action to thoroughly investigate and determine the facts behind the allegations .
This investigation may be completed as early as this week , and full disciplinary action will be taken against individuals who are found to have behaved unprofessionally and inappropriately .
We expect all FDIC employees to adhere to the highest standards of professionalism . "
" And , at a minimum , to keep their clothes on , " Kamen mockingly adds .

libdvdcss2 and w32codecs for Ubuntu December 4 , 2005
Posted by Carthik in ubuntu
You need codecs ( decoders ) and software to read the contents of DVDs to be able to see multimedia files of different formats , as well as DVDs .
These software are provided free for use in Ubuntu – however due to restrictions on distributing these modules in countries like the USA , they are not always easy to find .
This post will tell you how to find them to install them on your Ubuntu computer .
The libdvdcss2 package helps you play dvds .
The w32 codecs package is used to play some media file formats in mplayer , xine etc .
Update :
The following instructions have been updated & work perfectly fine !
Some of the old repositories that do not work anymore have been moved to the very end of this post for archival purposes .
Last Updated : April 08 , 2007
Installation instructions for libdvdcss2 and w32codecs in Ubuntu
To add libdvdcss2 and win32 codecs to your Ubuntu installation , you have to add the Medibuntu package repository to your /etc/apt/sources .
list file .
To do this , you have to :
1 . Edit the file /etc/ apt / sources .list using either of the following commands in a terminal :
$ gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list to open it in the GUI text editor
or
$ sudo vim /etc/apt/sources .
list to open it in the Vim command line text editor
2 . Add the following lines to add the Medibuntu repository to the file :
## Medibuntu - Ubuntu 6.10 " edgy eft "
## Please report any bug on https://launchpad.net/products/medibuntu/+bugs
deb http://medibuntu.sos-sts.com/repo/ edgy free non-free
deb-src http://medibuntu.sos-sts.com/repo/ edgy free non-free
If you are running Feisty or some other release , other than edgy , replace the word “ edgy ” in both lines above with the name of the release you are using .
3 . Import the gpg key for the Medibuntu repository to ensure that the packages are installed without warnings / errors regarding trust :
To do this , run the following command from the terminal :
wget -q http://medibuntu.sos-sts.com/repo/medibuntu-key.gpg
- O- | sudo apt - key add -
4 . Now update the local list of packages to get the list of packages from the newly added Medibuntu repository :
In a terminal execute the following command :
sudo apt - get update
5 . Now you can install libdvdcss2 and w32 codecs using the following command :
sudo apt - get install libdvdcss 2 w32codecs
Note :
There are installation instructions on the Medibuntu page for Dapper and newer that are different – only because the instructions help you create a new sources .
list file without mucking around in the old sources .
list file .
Feel free to follow them instead .
I posted the old - style instructions that modifies the existing sources .
list file to ensure that the instructions work for everyone – those using Warty ( the first release ever ) through those using the latest release of Ubuntu .
There are a lot of wonderful packages provided by Medibuntu .
Feel free to install any other you like , or might want .
Just in case …
In case the medibuntu repositories go down , you can add and use Seveas ’ repositories .
You will then have to add similar line to the /etc / apt / sources .
list file , with the Seveas repository url etc.
Seveas ’ repository has a few mirrors as listed below :
http://free.linux.hp.com/~brett/seveas/freenx
( Sponsored by Brett Johnson )
http://seveas.imbrandon.com
( Sponsored by Brandon Holtsclaw )
http://mirror.ubuntulinux.nl/
( Sponsored by Niels Roosen )
http://seveas.theplayboymansion.net/seveas
( Sponsored by Henri Cook ( orion - hosting.co.uk )
http://mirror2.ubuntulinux.nl/
( Sponsored by Peter Lieverdink )
As a quick guide to using Seveas ’ repository instead of the Medibuntu repository , you should change the lines added to the sources .
list file to read like :
deb http://mirror.ubuntulinux.nl edgy - seveas all
deb-src http://mirror.ubuntulinux.nl edgy - seveas all
and the gpg -key add command will now be :
wget http://mirror.ubuntulinux.nl/1135D466.gpg
- O- | sudo apt - key add -
The other commands / steps can be modified as neccessary – it is not too difficult to figure it out , and the exercise is left to the reader for now 🙂
Old instructions
Note :
These do n’t work anymore – they are here more for archival purposes than anything else .
Update : you can add the PLF repository to your sources .
list to get the required multimedia codecs and binaries through apt - get ( Synaptic ) .
The line to add to your /etc/apt/ sources .
list file would be :
deb http://packages.freecontrib.org/ubuntu/plf/ breezy free non-free
After you have done this , do
$ sudo apt - get update
Now you can install the following using the PLF repository :
* w32codecs : A package of codecs needed to play multiple formats , notably DivX. ( disponible .

For the future , if the repositories above are not available , let me remind myself that I can find libdvdcss2 and w32 codecs specially built for Ubuntu at the following locations :
libdvdcss2 : ftp://cipherfunk.org/pub/packages/ubuntu/pool/main/libd/libdvdcss/
w32codecs : ftp://cipherfunk.org/pub/packages/ubuntu/pool/main/w/w32codecs/
These two are required for playing dvds and for playing various kinds of media files , such as .avi .wmv etc in Ubuntu , and these packages are hard to find for Ubuntu .
The Debian . debs usually work just fine , but it is good to have the Ubuntu .debs for these .

“ the road is one succession of dust , ruts , pits , and holes . ”
So wrote Dwight D. Eisenhower , then a young lieutenant colonel , in November 1919 , after heading out on a cross-country trip with a convoy of Army vehicles in order to test the viability of the nation ’s highways in case of a military emergency .
To this description of one major road across the west , Eisenhower added reports of impassable mud , unstable sand , and wooden bridges that cracked beneath the weight of the trucks .
In Illinois , the convoy “ started on dirt roads , and practically no more pavement was encountered until reaching California . ”
It took 62 days for the trucks to make the trip from Washington , D.C. , to San Francisco , and another 37 years for Ike to complete a quest , inspired by this youthful journey and by his World War II observations of Germany ’s autobahns , to build a national road system for the United States .
In 1956 , President Eisenhower signed the Federal - Aid Highway Act , which called for the federal and state governments to build 41,000 miles of high - quality roads across the nation , over rivers and gorges , swamps and deserts , over and through vast mountain ranges , in what would later be called the “ greatest public works project in human history . ”
So vital to the public interest did Eisenhower , an old - style fiscal conservative , consider the interstate highway system , he even authorized the federal government to assume 90 percent of the massive cost .
Fifty years to the day after Ike put his pen to the Highway Act , another Republican signed off on another historic highway project .
On June 29 , 2006 , Mitch Daniels , the former Bush administration official turned governor of Indiana , was greeted with a round of applause as he stepped into a conference room packed with reporters and state lawmakers .
The last of eight wire transfers had landed in the state ’s account , making it official : Indiana had received $ 3.8 billion from a foreign consortium made up of the Spanish construction firm Cintra and the Macquarie Infrastructure Group ( mig ) of Australia , and in exchange the state would hand over operation of the 157 - mile Indiana Toll Road for the next 75 years .
The arrangement would yield hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks for the consortium , which also received immunity from most local and state taxes in its contract with Indiana .
And , of course , the consortium would collect all the tolls , which it was allowed to raise to levels far beyond what Hoosiers had been used to .
By one calculation , the Toll Road would generate more than $ 11 billion over the 75 - year life of the contract , a nice return on mig- Cintra ’s $ 3.8 billion investment .
The deal to privatize the Toll Road had been almost a year in the making .
Proponents celebrated it as a no-pain , all - gain way to off - load maintenance expenses and mobilize new highway - building funds without raising taxes .
Opponents lambasted it as a major turn toward handing the nation ’s common property over to private firms , and at fire - sale prices to boot .
The one thing everyone agreed on was that the Indiana deal was just a prelude to a host of such efforts to come .
Across the nation , there is now talk of privatizing everything from the New York Thruway to the Ohio , Pennsylvania , and New Jersey turnpikes , as well as of inviting the private sector to build and operate highways and bridges from Alabama to Alaska .
More than 20 states have enacted legislation allowing public - private partnerships , or P3s , to run highways .
Robert Poole , the founder of the libertarian Reason Foundation and a longtime privatization advocate , estimates that some $ 25 billion in public - private highway deals are in the works — a remarkable figure given that as of 1991 , the total cost of the interstate highway system was estimated at $ 128.9 billion .
On the same day the Indiana Toll Road deal closed , another Australian toll road operator , Transurban , paid more than half a billion dollars for a 99 - year lease on Virginia ’s Pocahontas Parkway , and the Texas Transportation Commission green - lighted a $ 1.3 billion bid by Cintra and construction behemoth Zachry Construction to build and operate a 40 - mile toll road out of Austin .
Many similar deals are now on the horizon , and mig and Cintra are often part of them .
So is Goldman Sachs , the huge Wall Street firm that has played a remarkable role advising states on how to structure privatization deals — even while positioning itself to invest in the toll road market .
Goldman Sachs ’ role has not been lost on skeptics , who accuse the firm of playing both sides of the fence .
“ In essence , they ’re double - dipping , ” says Todd Spencer , executive vice president of the Owner - Operator Independent Drivers Association , a truckers ’ group that opposes toll road privatization .
“ They ’re basically in the middle , playing one side against the other , and it ’s really , really lucrative . ”
Despite such concerns , the privatization model has the full backing of the Bush administration .
Tyler Duvall , the U.S. Department of Transportation ’s assistant secretary for transportation policy , says dot has raised the idea with “ almost every state ” government and is working on sample legislation that states can use for such projects .
“ This is a ground battle in the United States right now , ” he says .
“ States just need to be convinced that this is basically something they should be considering . ”
The financial stakes are potentially huge .
“ You ’re buying the infrastructure of the economy , and it ’s enormously valuable , ” says John Schmidt , who served as associate attorney general in the Clinton administration and as counsel to the city of Chicago on the $ 1.8 billion privatization of the Chicago Skyway , the 7.8 - mile freeway that connects the Dan Ryan Expressway in the west to the Indiana Toll Road in the east .
“ [ Private road operators ] have n’t been able to get in here previously .
There ’s been a demand , and it ’s been bottled up because we just have n’t had privatized infrastructure in this country , so they ’ve been buying toll roads in Chile and in France .
Now , they suddenly have the opportunity to come into this country . ”
at the western end of the Indiana Toll Road , just over the Illinois border , the scenery rolls by like the lyrics to a particularly forlorn Bruce Springsteen song .
Passing over Wolf Lake , infamous in these parts as the site where “ thrill killers ” Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb dumped the body of 14 - year - old Bobby Franks in the 1920s , the highway skirts ghost factories and decaying main streets until , outside Gary , the smokestacks give way to cornfields and Christmas tree farms , and the scenery stays pastoral across the length of northern Indiana .
If you ’ve ever traveled cross-country on I - 90 , known here as the “ main street of the Midwest , ” you ’ve driven the Toll Road .
Privatizing this 157 - mile interstate artery was the brainchild of Indiana governor Mitch Daniels , a former Eli Lilly executive and the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget between 2001 and 2003 — a position in which he was known , for his budget - cutting fervor , as “ The Blade . ”
Daniels , by all accounts , began plotting the privatization of the Indiana Toll Road soon after he took office in January 2005 .
The new governor was inspired by Chicago ’s $ 1.8 billion Skyway deal but had something far bigger in mind .
Leasing out the Toll Road would be the centerpiece of his transportation plan , “ Major Moves , ” a name — borrowed from a Hank Williams Jr. album — that Daniels said he came up with while singing in the shower .
Under the plan , Indiana will spend nearly $ 12 billion over the next decade on highway construction projects funded , in part , by the proceeds from the Toll Road lease .
By September 2005 , the governor was soliciting bids for the project , with Goldman Sachs serving as the state ’s financial adviser — a role that would net the bank a $ 20 million advisory fee .
The winning company would maintain and improve the highway , with the lease agreement spelling out its responsibilities down to the maximum time allowed for clearing roadkill .
In return , the company would collect tolls , which it would be allowed to raise by a specified percentage each year after 2010 .
The deal ( including the 75 - year term chosen for the lease ) was structured so the companies would gain a huge tax advantage ; to further sweeten the pot , the state instituted the first toll increase in 20 years shortly before the agreement went through , nearly doubling the rate for passenger cars and gradually raising truck tolls 120 percent .
( The toll for cars was promptly frozen pending the installation of electronic tolling , sometime before mid-2008 ; in the meantime , the state is paying mig- Cintra the difference . )
Driving the Toll Road on a temperate late - summer morning , the sun squinting through a thick covering of stratus clouds , it was hard to find anyone who approved of Daniels ’ deal .
“ Our economy ’s already bad , ” said Amber Kruk , an 18 - year - old starting her shift at a Perkins just off the highway in South Bend .
“ We do n’t understand why we ’re giving this road to a foreign company . ”
Gassing up his flatbed at a service station off the Toll Road , 62 - year - old trucker Richard DeRohan said he runs the road less now because of the increased tolls .
“ It should have stayed in state hands , ” he said .
“ I did n’t like when they did it in Chicago .
It should be run by a public entity — they ’re the ones who created it . ”
In a New York Times op - ed published in May , not long after Indiana ’s state Legislature approved the Toll Road deal , Daniels acknowledged that public sentiment had run almost 2 - to - 1 against the idea , and then summarily dismissed the opposition : “ Their hearts were in the right place , but not their logic . ”
Indiana , he argued , “ very nearly tore up its equivalent of a Powerball check ” as Hoosiers convinced themselves “ either that our proposal borrowed from the future , or that it gave away a part of America to ‘ foreigners . ' ”
In fact , Daniels argued in a paper he wrote for the Reason Foundation last spring , “ any businessperson will recognize our decision here as the freeing of trapped value from an underperforming asset , to be redeployed into a better use with higher returns . ”
Yet his administration failed to commission an independent financial analysis of the Toll Road project until the deal was almost done — and when it did , internal emails obtained by Mother Jones show , the motivation was primarily political .
“ Current criticism from opposition is ‘ no independent analysis ’ and Scott and his team have kindly volunteered to fill this void , ” one high - level state official wrote in a February 2006 email , referring to Scott Nickerson , an executive at the accounting firm Crowe Chizek , which conducted the analysis .
The emails suggest that Daniels ’ administration remained preoccupied with how to deploy the analysis to best political advantage — for example , by releasing it through a third party , such as a think tank .
“ The Governor is of the opinion that in order for our response to be politically independent , he would prefer that Crowe not be formally engaged to do this work , ” one email states ( emphasis in original ) .
According to another , “ Upon further discussion , the group decided that it would be beneficial to be engaged by a separate entity to allow us to perform the consulting project and avoid the appearance of a lack of objective , independent examination . ”
In the end , the “ independent ” analysis , released just days before legislators were set to vote on Daniels ’ plan , found exactly what the state had been arguing all along — that the private - sector bid far surpassed what the state stood to earn on its own .
Near midnight on the final day of the legislative session , after contentious debate , the bill squeaked through the House in a 51 to 48 party - line vote .
Not everyone bought Crowe Chizek ’s conclusions , though .
Roger Skurski , a professor emeritus of economics at Notre Dame , analyzed the deal extensively on behalf of an Indiana law firm that brought suit to block the transaction .
( The lawsuit ultimately failed . )
It was Skurski who found that the value of the road , over a 75 - year term , could be as much as $ 11.38 billion ; in a letter to Rep.
Thomas Petri , the Wisconsin Republican who chaired the U.S. House Subcommittee on Highways , Transit , and Pipelines , the economist wrote that “ based on the State of Indiana ’s own studies and figures … it seems that the conclusion changes from ‘ deal ’ to ‘ no deal . ' ”
“ The public was ignored on this ; public opinion was ignored on this , ” says Dave Menzer , an organizer at Citizens Action Coalition , an Indianapolis - based advocacy group that also joined the anti-privatization suit .
“ I think that increasingly the public feels like what ’s driving politics , what ’s driving these decisions , is multinational corporations and deal - makers like Goldman Sachs , Merrill Lynch , and Morgan Stanley .
They ’re the ones making tens of millions of dollars ultimately at the public ’s expense . ”
Shortly after the coalition launched its campaign to stop the deal , Menzer says , its six phone lines lit up with callers from around the country seeking to help pay for the lawsuit .
In less than a month , it had helped raise nearly $ 120,000 toward the legal bills .
“ We saw so many different interests coming together saying that they did n’t like this , ” he says .
There were libertarians and Republicans , who felt the state was giving away too much for too little ; long - haul truckers , who viewed the deal as the first stage of a national trend that could threaten their livelihoods ; and environmentalists , who in the fine print of Daniels ’ “ Major Moves ” plan had noticed an effort to revive ( and possibly privatize ) a long - stalled project to construct Interstate 69 , the so - called nafta highway , through the farmlands of southern Indiana .
So why did Daniels insist on pushing the project through in the face of so much opposition ?
Daniels ’ office turned down Mother Jones ’ requests for an interview , but quite a few Hoosiers have come to believe that the governor could have been taking his cue from Washington .
In this scenario , Indiana , a bellwether state in many ways , would serve as a test case .
“ Working to make Indiana one of the first states to pave the way for road privatization , to make a bad pun , was definitely his motivation , ” Menzer says .
in mid-September , as the 61st United Nations General Assembly convened in New York , the Waldorf Astoria ’s dim , ornate lobby was teeming with diplomats and dignitaries who sat huddled in armchairs , conferring in a multitude of languages .
Rumor had it that President Bush himself had dropped by the hotel the night before .
Down the hall , in the chandeliered entryway that leads to the Waldorf ’s Park Avenue entrance , 300 sharply dressed men and women were carrying on a different sort of diplomacy .
These delegates , as they referred to themselves , were representatives from white - shoe investment banks and consultancies ; high - powered lawyers ; executives from the world ’s leading infrastructure companies ; and , sprinkled here and there , federal and state officials , who never seemed to go long without being pulled into a conversation and handed a business card .
They were at the Waldorf for North American ppp 2006 — a conference dedicated entirely to infrastructure privatization in the United States .
As the conference opened , on the morning of September 19 , Tom Nelthorpe , the editor of the trade magazine Project Finance , addressed the audience , drawing a laugh when he joked about pirates “ plundering the resources of the New World . ”
“ I hope you ’ll find today ’s varied program evidence of a more sophisticated approach , ” he said .
Emerging markets rarely emerge solely on their own , and would - be road operators have spent years working to convince state and local officials that privatization is a no-lose proposition .
It has created something of an echo - chamber effect , says John Foote , a senior fellow at Harvard ’s Kennedy School of Government who specializes in transportation issues .
“ If you ’ve got enough people whispering in the ears of governors and mayors and so forth saying that this is the greatest thing since sliced bread and do n’t miss the boat , pretty soon people start believing it . ”
Perhaps the most tireless of the privatization advocates is Mark Florian , the chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs ’ municipal finance division , who advised Chicago and Indiana on their toll road deals and says he has personally visited more than 35 statehouses to “ help spur the market . ”
Florian was a speaker at the Waldorf conference , and after his remarks in the hotel ’s lavish ballroom , the Goldman Sachs executive — who bears a mild resemblance to Stephen Colbert — was instantly mobbed , rock star style , by delegates , all of whom seemed to be on a first - name basis with him .
“ I at times tell my colleagues that I kind of feel like a missionary — out trying to sell the religion , ” Florian told Mother Jones .
“ We have been heavily invested in this . ”
Florian ’s employer is n’t just any old Wall Street firm .
It is one of the nation ’s most active and most profitable investment banks , and top Goldman Sachs officials have served in numerous administrations .
Last summer , President Bush tapped its ceo , Henry “ Hank ” Paulson , as secretary of the treasury .
Another former Goldman Sachs ceo is New Jersey governor Jon Corzine , who in September commissioned an analysis of whether state assets , including the New Jersey Turnpike , should be turned over to private companies .
In addition to advising Indiana on the Toll Road deal , Goldman Sachs has worked with Texas governor Rick Perry ’s administration on privatization projects , and according to Schmidt , the former adviser to the Chicago mayor ’s office , it was a Goldman Sachs representative who first pitched the city on the idea of leasing out the Skyway .
That deal , which yielded $ 9 million in fees for Goldman Sachs , was “ an eye - opener ” for the company , Florian recalls : “ That was a pretty phenomenal transaction .
As soon as we were involved in that and saw the potential application of doing this more broadly , we were very excited about doing that . ”
After the Skyway lease closed , Florian says , Goldman Sachs was inundated with calls from investors worldwide who wanted a piece of America ’s transportation infrastructure .
“ We said , ‘ Well , gee , if all these people are interested in investing , perhaps we can create a vehicle for them to invest through , ' ” he explains .
To that end , Goldman Sachs put together an infrastructure fund that , by the time Florian addressed the conference , had already surpassed its original $ 3 billion target .
Other investment firms , including Morgan Stanley and the Carlyle Group , began putting together their own funds .
So appealing is the infrastructure market that Goldman Sachs has made significant changes to its municipal finance group to better position itself for a coming boom .
When Goldman Sachs began advising Indiana on selling its toll road , it failed to mention to the state that it was putting together a fund whose sole purpose would be to pick up infrastructure for the best price possible in order to maximize returns for its investors .
Nor did the bank advertise the fact that , even as it was advising Indiana on how to get the best return , its Australian subsidiary ’s mutual funds were ratcheting up their positions in mig — becoming de facto investors in the deal .
“ The firm is an established adviser , but we also have this big investment arm , ” Florian told Mother Jones , arguing that Goldman Sachs ’ dual nature typically does n’t cause a problem in corporate deals .
“ But this is a trickier marketplace , and people are cognizant of that because it is so public .
It ’s so new … .
We ’re going to really feel our way along here . ”
A Goldman Sachs spokesman later contacted Mother Jones to stress that there is “ a wall ” between the firm ’s investment and advisory divisions .
“ Asset management makes its investment decisions independently of the rest of the firm , ” he said .
Asked whether the firm has a system to prevent conflicts of interest , the spokesman demurred .
Florian says Goldman
Sachs does have a system for avoiding conflicts in situations when Goldman is a principal investor in a deal .
“ We put in a voice mail and some information about that situation and what our role might be , and it literally goes around the world … .
It ’s a good system , but it ’s not always perfect . ”
Indeed , the system did n’t stop Goldman Sachs last spring from vying to advise the city of Chicago on a deal to privatize Midway airport — even as it was seeking , along with other partners , to take over British Airports Authority , one of the companies likely to bid on the airport .
“ One of the things we ’ve learned in these recent corporate scandals is that those firewalls may not be very soundproof , ” says Duane Windsor , a professor of business management at Rice University and an expert on business ethics .
“ There is a lot of leakage back and forth … that kind of problem where the motives are so mixed that it ’s hard to tell why you are getting a certain piece of advice .
“ There ’s no reason to think the people in these companies are abnormally honest , ” he adds wryly .
Dennis Enright , a principal at NW Financial Group , a New Jersey - based investment banking firm that advises municipal governments , says that in transactions involving vital public assets , investment banks such as Goldman Sachs should be carefully watched .
“ It does seem odd that they are effectively teeing up assets for their corporate clients to buy , ” he says .
“ In most situations , that would n’t be deemed ethical . ”
John Foote , the Kennedy School fellow , also suggests that Goldman Sachs has “ some decisions to make .
People do n’t want them playing on both sides of the fence . ”
So , we asked Florian , does Goldman Sachs want to be an adviser or an investor in the business of roads ?
“ Both , ” he replied .
since its emergence as a major political issue in the Reagan era , privatization has become a default option for politicians of both parties aiming to off - load everything from prisons and welfare offices to Social Security .
The movement has spawned its own industry of contractors , consultants , think tanks ( with the Reason Foundation in the lead ) , and lobbyists ; as a result , private companies now do everything from feeding soldiers in Iraq to taking welfare applications and even operating entire city halls for towns such as Sandy Springs , Georgia , a city of 85,000 that has outsourced its public works , administration , and finance to the Colorado - based firm ch2 m hill .
But the brass ring has long been seen to be the nation ’s enormous , and aging , infrastructure .
Roads , in particular , are ripe for the picking .
Congestion is increasing , and the Federal Highway Administration estimates that it will cost $ 50 billion a year above current levels of federal , state , and local highway funding to rehab existing bridges and roads over the next 16 years .
Where to get that money , without raising taxes ?
Privatization promises a quick fix — and a way to outsource difficult decisions , like raising tolls , to entities that do n’t have to worry about getting reelected .
More often than not , those entities are foreign — primarily because , unlike U.S. firms , foreign companies have years of experience operating private toll roads in South America , Europe , and Australia .
One of the biggest among them is mig , a $ 6 billion subsidiary of Macquarie Bank Ltd .
The company operates roads in the United Kingdom , Canada , and Germany , among other countries , but , as ceo Stephen Allen told the Australian TV show Business Sunday in 2005 , “ The attractive market to us is the U.S … .
We ’re well positioned in what we think could be a huge market . ”
The company ’s annual report offers an upbeat illustration of mig ‘s business : a picture of a sad - faced terrier alone in a living room at 6:10 p.m. ( “ Before ” ) ; a picture of the same terrier with attractive couple , in the same living room , same time ( “ After ” ) .
“ Our motorways deliver people to places faster than if they used the often heavily congested , slower alternative routes , ” the copy notes .
mig once owned 40 percent of Cintra ( Concesiones de Infraestructuras de Transporte , S.A. ) , a Spanish company whose holdings include 21 roads across Europe and the Americas .
Cintra ’s 2005 annual report describes the company as “ one of the world ’s leading private transportation infrastructure developers , ” and reassures investors that it offers the magical combination of high profits and “ a low risk profile . ”
Investors in toll roads face stable revenues as well as expenses — and , best of all , “ limited competition . ”
Indeed , private road operators often insist on noncompete clauses that limit governments from expanding nearby roads .
In 2003 , Orange County bought back the lease for a set of pay - to - drive express lanes in the median of Route 91 , just so it could finally expand the adjacent road .
Toll road companies can even get governments to do their enforcement for them :
In July 2004 , the consortium that owns Toronto ’s 407 etr , a 67 - mile highway that relies on transponders and cameras to collect tolls , sued the provincial government to force it to deny license plate renewals to motorists who had n’t paid their tolls .
In the end , the consortium , which included mig and Cintra , was successful .
Over the past few years , the federal government has rolled out the welcome mat for private road companies .
The 2005 highway bill changed the tax code to allow private firms to raise tax - exempt financing for road projects , something that only governments were able to do up to now .
( For congressional pork buffs , this was the same legislation that contained Alaska Republican congressman Don Young ’s “ bridge to nowhere , ” and that , by way of homage to Young ’s wife , Lu , was named the Safe , Accountable , Flexible , Efficient Transportation Equity Act — A Legacy for Users , a.k.a. safetea - lu . )
The bill also expanded eligibility for a transportation subsidy program that includes loan guarantees and lines of credit , and created a pilot program that lets participating states use tolling to finance interstate highway construction and invite private - sector participation on the projects .
“ It ’s a very , very sweet deal , ” says a veteran congressional transportation committee staffer who requested anonymity because of his role advising members on highway policy .
one morning last May , Congress took up the issue of highway privatization in a hearing of the House Subcommittee on Highways , Transit , and Pipelines .
In attendance were D.J. Gribbin , a former chief counsel to the Federal Highway Administration who went to work as a lobbyist for Macquarie early last year ; Goldman Sachs ’ Mark Florian ; and Governor Mitch Daniels , who was then a little more than a month away from sealing his historic deal with Cintra and mig .
Referring to Indiana ’s decision to privatize its toll road , Daniels told the committee that so far , no one in government has come up with a workable solution to patch the gap between transportation needs and available funding .
“ All across our state , hundreds of road and bridge projects have been promised for years , in some cases decades , with no source of funding and no hope of becoming reality unless bold new steps are taken … .
We looked at every option to address this funding shortfall , from raising the state gas tax [ to ] issuing more debt , increasing heavy truck fees , and increasing vehicle registration fees , to name just a few .
It was clear that very few of these 200 - plus projects would become reality on a business - as - usual basis . ”
He later remarked , “ Just as many business units are more valuable if separated from their conglomerate parent , an asset like a highway can be worth vastly more under different management . ”
The hearing was a fairly docile affair — that is , until Oregon ’s Peter DeFazio , the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee , got his turn questioning Daniels .
“ So you ’re saying that there ’s no political will to raise the tolls , ” he began , “ but if you enter into a binding contract which gives a private entity the right to infinitely raise tolls , then that ’ll happen — but politically you could n’t say we ’re going to go out and raise the tolls . ”
“ Well , you ’re a busy man , Congressman , ” Daniels responded dryly .
“ I do n’t expect you to understand our state . ”
“ No , sir .
I ’m just asking a question , ” DeFazio shot back , his voice rising .
“ Are we outsourcing political will to a private entity here ? ”
When DeFazio spoke with Mother Jones months later , he was still seething .
Daniels , he said , “ just screwed the state of Indiana and the people of the state of Indiana . ”
In his view , mig-Cintra has “ a license to print money here .
They do the deal , put money up front , turn around and go to a bank , which will gladly give them whatever they want , and pay themselves back , and they are left with equity and debt .
They are projecting that they already would have broken even around the 15th year .
So we ’ve committed an asset for 75 years and after 15 years the state could have been making money on it . ”
DeFazio continued , “ When you look at the Chicago Skyway , that ’s even worse .
They are not even reinvesting the proceeds of the sale in transportation .
They ’re using them for operating costs .
That would be like anybody selling their assets in order to live .
You ca n’t sell your assets very long to put food on the table — before long you ’re out of assets .
Chicago has sold an asset , which will be extraordinarily profitable for the company that got it . ”
DeFazio ’s take harkens back to Eisenhower and his vision of a national highway system as vital to economic development , commerce , and even national security .
“ It ’s a scam , basically , ” he says .
“ And you lose control of your transportation infrastructure .
It means you fragment the system ultimately .
It just does not make sense for an integrated national transportation system . ”
The transportation committee staffer echoes DeFazio ’s broad concerns .
“ You ’re replacing a federal - state partnership with a public - private partnership , ” he says , “ and the whole idea of developing a national transportation system may go by the wayside . ”
When asked whether private interests will begin to drive transportation decisions , including when and where roads are constructed , he responded , “ Absolutely .
They would definitely only go to where the profit is . ”
Just as the creation of a National Highway System promised , in Eisenhower ’s words , to “ change the face of America , ” so too could its demise .
Ralph Nader , too , has been vocal in opposing the privatization deals .
Last February he wrote a scathing letter to Mitch Daniels , comparing the toll road lease to the Louisiana Purchase , “ only Indiana is the France of this deal .
You are taking a minuscule up - front payment in return for a large downstream private profit to a foreign company which is being handed a captive customer base . ”
Nader says he and other consumer advocates were late to recognize the trend .
“ Who would have dreamed ” that the nation would begin actually selling off its core assets , he told Mother Jones .
“ That ’s new .
They caught everybody napping . ”
Some conservatives are also sounding the alarm .
Phyllis Schlafly , writing for the conservative publication Human Events in September 2006 , tore into the recent privatization deals under the colorful heading “ Greedy Politicians Seduced by Siren Song of Filthy Foreign Lucre . ”
“ Why the rush to sell our transportation systems to foreigners ? ” she queried .
“ ‘ Follow the money ’ explains all .
State and local governments pocket the money upfront and get to spend it here and now , so politicians can cover their runaway budget deficits and enjoy the political rewards of spending for new facilities .
They ignore the fact that U.S. citizens must pay tolls to foreign landlords for the next two or three or even four generations . ”
In some places , highway deals have already become campaign fodder :
In Texas , where Governor Rick Perry has proposed a $ 184 billion , 4,000 - mile network of toll roads , which is expected to be financed largely through public - private partnerships , the notion proved widely unpopular , and independent gubernatorial candidate Carole Keeton Strayhorn made the proposal a key target of her campaign .
“ I do n’t think the people want anything that is riddled with personal profiteering and enrichment , and this is riddled with all of the above , ” she told Mother Jones last July .
“ This is critical infrastructure and you are turning it over to a foreign company with a secret contract . ”
Perry has refused to release many of the details of the $ 1.3 billion contract his administration has signed with Cintra for a toll road from Austin to Seguin .
The Spanish company has enjoyed a cozy relationship with the governor ’s office : Perry ’s former legislative director , Dan Shelley , worked as a Cintra consultant and lobbyist prior to joining the governor ’s staff , and in September 2005 , he went back to work for Cintra .
Both he and his daughter , Jennifer Shelley - Rodriguez , now have lucrative contracts to lobby Texas legislators on the company ’s behalf .
More and more , the argument over private roads comes down simply to the bottom line .
Dennis Enright , the infrastructure expert at NW Financial , says the most common argument for privatization deals — that government simply can’t come up with the kind of big money private companies can mobilize — is a myth : “ If the public sector wants to raise $ 1.8 billion or $ 3.8 billion , they can do it themselves ” with standard financing techniques .
The problem with public - private deals , Enright argues , is that the companies will cherry - pick the most profitable roads and leave much of the public stuck in the slow lane .
He offers this hypothetical : “ If you want to go on the Chicago Skyway during rush hour , they can charge you a much higher price because it ’s premium travel time .
Now what does that do to the rest of the transportation system ?
It puts all of those people who ca n’t use the Skyway onto the adjacent roads .
Now the adjacent roads are backed up further .
Now [ the Skyway ] can charge even more because they have more of a time advantage . ”
Enright concludes ,
“ The private operator ’s fidelity is to his stockholders — not to the public transportation system , not to the people who use the road .
His duty is to get the most possible revenues out of the asset . ”
Enright ’s firm did a study showing that if a pricing scheme similar to the one agreed to in Chicago had been applied to New York ’s Holland Tunnel for the past 70 years , the toll would stand at $ 185 rather than the current $ 6 .
Higher tolls and a proliferation of private roads are certainly in the nation ’s future unless the federal government delivers some other solution to a looming funding crisis .
The federal highway trust fund , which is financed by the proceeds of the federal gas tax , is running out of money — in part because lawmakers have not dared to raise the tax , currently 18.4 cents per gallon , since the mid-’90s .
At this rate , the fund , which is the primary source of money for federal highways , will be spending more than it takes in by 2009 .
“ A question has been raised about what the proper federal role in transportation is , ” the transportation committee staffer says .
That question now faces Congress , which has responded , in trademark fashion , by creating a commission .
In 2005 , as lawmakers hefted safetea - lu onto the president ’s desk , they convened the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission , with the lofty mandate of exploring ways to “ preserve and enhance the surface transportation system to meet the needs of the United States for the 21st century . ”
The commission ’s chair is Transportation Secretary Mary Peters , who is , as dot ’ s Tyler Duvall puts it , a “ tremendous champion ” of privatization .
Joining her is Paul Weyrich , the founder of the Heritage Foundation — the conservative think tank that advocates privatization .
Another commission member , Cornell economist R. Rick Geddes , has suggested turning the U.S. Postal Service over to the private sector .
Geddes told Mother Jones that , while he is not yet sold on the idea of private highways , he is “ sympathetic ” to the model ; he said the commission ’s recommendations , due by July 1 , will likely suggest a number of “ tools in the toolbox . ”
DeFazio , however , fears the panel may have already made its choice .
“ My understanding is it ’s turning more and more and more toward a sole focus of how to justify the privatization of infrastructure — just like Bush ’s Social Security commission , ” he says .
“ You could n’t be on the commission to study the future of Social Security unless you signed off in favor of a privatization solution in the beginning .
It sounds like they ’re trying to pervert the commission we created to take the same direction . ”
How is it that your mind is capable of handling new situations you ’ve never previously encountered ?
How do you solve a problem you ’ve never solved before ?
Is this just the magic of consciousness , or is there an underlying process — or algorithm — your mind uses behind the scenes to deal with the unique experiences you encounter each day ?
And if there is a process , how can you use it to improve your ability to think ?
Computers are still very inflexible at solving problems they ’ve never seen , but your mind is not nearly so limited .
Without much difficulty you can converse with someone you ’ve never met before , read and understand something you ’ve never read before , or navigate a shopping mall you ’ve never visited before .
Your ability to handle new situations goes way beyond behavior though .
You can solve a problem entirely in your mind , even without taking any direct action .
Sometimes you ’re aware of the process , and sometimes it happens unconsciously , but either way there ’s a purely cognitive aspect to human intelligence that ’s independent of behavior .
I think you ’d agree that when trying to solve a new problem , the solution arises when you reach a certain level of understanding , even before you ’ve taken any action .
When a new insight , decision , or perspective is attained , the action steps may be very straightforward .
Certainly for some problems the physical implementation remains difficult , but that ’s usually because there are remaining sub- problems that have n’t yet been solved at a cognitive level .
For example , you may come to the awareness that the solution to your relationship problems is to break up with your current partner , and on one level that may in fact be a solution .
However , before you can implement that solution , you must solve a myriad of sub - problems such as how and when you ’ll inform your partner , who will move out , and so on .
A problem - solving exercise
Let ’s consider a simple , real - world problem , with the goal of gaining insight into the key aspects of human intelligence .
This exercise should be fairly easy for you .
Suppose I tell you I just moved into a new house , and I have a problem .
The lighting in my new home office is too dim .
What can I do to fix this ?
( This is an actual problem I must solve . )
Pause for a moment to think about how you ’d solve this problem .
When you have an idea of how you ’d solve it , continue reading .
I ’ll wait …
OK , good .
Even though the problem is very simple , and the preferred solution may seem obvious , there are many ways to solve it .
Perhaps the simplest solutions would be to install brighter light bulbs or add more lights .
But other valid solutions include selecting a different room for my home office or outsourcing the problem to a professional lighting expert .
And for every solution , there are more sub - problems to be solved , such as which specific lights and / or bulbs to buy , how many to buy , where to put them , where to buy them , how much to spend , etc .
But we ’re not really interested in the specific solution you came up with but rather the mental process you used to get there .
Take a moment to consider how you solved this problem .
What can you say about how your mind tackled it ?
There are many possibilities , but here are some of the more common patterns :
Instant knowing –
The answer just popped into your head as soon as you read the question .
You did n’t even have to think about it .
Multiple choice –
Two or more possibilities popped into your head , and you selected a preferred choice from among them .
Conscious analysis –
You read and re-read my statement of the problem and attempted to reason your way to an intelligent solution , perhaps considering my potential constraints such as time , cost , and available space .
More data needed –
You perceived my definition of the problem as inadequate and wanted to request more details , such as a photo of the room , a description of the work to be performed there , my personal lighting preferences , the color of the walls , etc .
Suspicion –
You figured this was probably a trick question and thought about how I might mislead you in order to make a point .
Apathy –
You did n’t care to answer the question at all and kept reading or skimming the article without bothering to clarify any particular solution .
There are lots of other possibilities too .
Perhaps your mind even used a hybrid approach that combined various elements of the items above .
Do n’t worry if you only have a partial awareness of how your mind actually tackled this problem .
Although your conscious mind is limited by the narrow bandwidth of your attention , your subconscious is n’t so limited .
Aspects of human intelligence
Regardless of what specific process you used , I assert that it involved several key elements , even if you refused to solve the problem at all :
Cognitive pre-processing –
As you read the text description of my problem , your mind took the raw sensory input arriving through your eyes and transformed it into an internal representation , one that exists only in your imagination .
Since this was a visual problem , perhaps you even visualized what my office might look like , or maybe you imagined a room with dim lighting .
Even if you did n’t visualize anything , you still had to “ load ” the problem into your mental RAM .
Take note that your mental representation of the problem is not the same thing as the actual physical reality it represents .
The problem as you know it is nothing but an imaginary construct in your mind .
Associative memory –
Once you formed an internal representation , your mind accessed memories it could associate with that representation .
You may recall some of the specific memories that surfaced , or they may have been very fuzzy .
Those memories may have been visual , auditory , kinesthetic , emotional , or completely abstract .
You may have recalled how you solved a similar problem , or you may have simply remembered that a good way to improve lighting is to install brighter bulbs .
You may also have pulled up associations telling you that the problem is too simplistic to bother with , or that most exercises found in articles are n’t worth your time .
You were n’t born with any of this knowledge .
Your mind stored the information you learned in the past , and you ’re able to recall that information now .
The knowledge may be clear or fuzzy , but it still resides in your memory .
Without access to your memories , it would be impossible for you to solve or even to understand the problem .
You ’d be like a newborn baby .
Pattern matching –
As your associated memories surface , your mind finds one or more potential solutions .
But how does it do this ?
Consider how remarkable this ability is .
After all , you ’ve probably never even seen my office .
My office is a unique room with unique lighting .
This is an entirely new problem , one that has never existed in quite the same form .
And yet you could probably solve this problem easily , even if you had to physically implement the solution too .
The reason you can solve it is that your mind is able to generalize the problem and match it with a generalized solution that ’s already stored in your memory .
It ’s able to reason by analogy that my problem is similar enough to other lighting problems with known solutions , and so a pattern match occurs .
Expectation –
Once your mind comes up with a potential solution , it forms expectations about what will happen if that solution is implemented .
These expectations come from associated memories about what happened in the past .
You may imagine the solution as a visualization of a room with brighter lighting , or you may simply access the expectation that you know your solution will work .
When your mind creates an expectation that matches its internal representation of the desired solution , you achieve clarity that the problem now has a solution .
How the human mind thinks
Let ’s compare human intelligence to the capabilities of modern computers in order to better understand why we consider human beings intelligent while the best AI available today remains relatively dumb , inflexible , and severely limited .
Can computers form their own internal representation of physical world phenomena ?
For the most part , yes .
Computers are capable of storing real - time sensory input in digital form , which can be pre-processed in a variety of ways , and those internal representations can be saved with high accuracy and reliability .
In some cases their input capabilities already exceed ours ; for example , a machine can process raw data from infrared sensors , and it can sense temperatures that would burn or freeze a human being .
With proper backups digital memories are significantly more permanent than human memory as well .
Can computers take advantage of associative memory ?
Although their associations may not be as rich as ours , again the answer is yes .
For example , this blog uses a relational database , which is capable of storing and retrieving associations between pieces of information .
You can click a link to an article , and the article will load because the link is internally associated with the article text , along with the article title , date of publication , and other data .
So computers are already capable of forming associations between anything they can store .
In fact , the whole Internet works on this principle — a hyperlink is an associative memory between some link text , a URL , and a computer data file such as an HTML web page .
Can computers form expectations ?
Yes , but only to a very limited extent because their ability to do so is severely hampered by their inflexibility at pattern matching .
While we would n’t normally think of computers as anticipating the future , they ’re at least capable of exhibiting the associated behavioral elements .
For example , the user interface on my computer is prepared to handle just about any input I might throw at it , even if the specific sequence of key presses , mouse movements , and button clicks is completely unique .
Consequently , its behavioral responses appear semi-intelligent .
Where computers are most lacking , however , is in their ability to adapt to the unexpected .
When computers experience something beyond their pre-programmed expectations , they fail ; human beings , on the other hand , are capable of learning and adapting to the new and unexpected .
Can computers perform pattern matching ?
If we ’re referring to general - purpose pattern - matching , today ’s answer must be a resounding no .
This is where human beings totally dominate computers .
Even the best artificial intelligence available today is no match for the pattern recognition capabilities of a child .
In very limited domains like speech recognition , artificial neural networks are still largely inadequate ( otherwise I ’d be using such software to dictate this article right now instead of shelving it in my closet ) .
Our ability to store and recognize patterns is why humans are able to solve so many problems that a supercomputer simply cannot solve .
Interestingly , our neurons take milliseconds to fire , while computers can execute instructions in less than a nanosecond .
Yet we can still recognize patterns in a split second that a computer can’t figure out with days of continuous processing .
More speed applied to today ’s AI wo n’t improve the situation much , except in puny baby steps .
And the reason is the unique way human beings store and process patterns .
Our pattern matching ability is also the heart of our ability to learn and adapt .
The primary reason computers are weak at learning is their inability to perform multi-purpose pattern matching .
Invariant representations
Computers store data in digital form .
They can pre-process , compress , and convert that data all they want , but the results are still digital .
Digital data is accurate , precise , and permanent , but the downside is that it is also extremely rigid .
A binary digit is either a one or a zero , on or off , yes or no .
Human beings , on the other hand , do not store data in digital form .
Our memories are not pixel perfect representations of reality .
They ’re fuzzy , imprecise , often inaccurate , and orders of magnitude slower to access than computer memory .
In many ways human memory seems totally inferior to digital data storage .
But its key strength lies in how those memories are stored , and as you ’ll see in a moment , this more than compensates for its many shortcomings .
Your mind stores and processes information in what are called invariant representations .
Invariant means unchanging .
As you go through life soaking up sensory experiences , your mind processes those experiences into its internal database .
But instead of storing every specific detail , your mind strives to identify and save general patterns .
It turns specific sensory data into abstract forms , and those abstract forms are the cornerstone of human intelligence .
An example of an invariant representation is a person .
A person is a concept that does n’t change much .
It may be hard to define in words , but your mind “ knows ” what a person is .
If I point to something in a room and ask you , “ Is that a person ? ” you could tell me in a split second .
You were n’t born knowing this — your mind learned this invariant representation from your many experiences dealing with specific people .
Your entire life ’s worth of knowledge is stored in your mind as associatively linked , hierarchically organized , invariant representations .
Specific to general to specific
A computer is forced to reason with specific data and algorithms , but human beings are wired with the ability to generalize from the specific , to store those general patterns , and to match those general patterns to new specific situations .
Learning is the process of experiencing specific sensory input , noticing general patterns , and storing those patterns as invariant representations .
For example , once you ’ve seen a number of cars , your mind identifies the pattern of “ car ” and then stores that pattern as an invariant representation .
The more cars you see , hear , feel , and smell , the richer the invariant representation your mind will store .
Anticipation is the process of applying invariant representations to specific situations , so now the flow goes from the general to the specific .
For example , when you see a specific car on the road that you ’ve never seen before , your mind is still able to recognize and label it as a car .
You do n’t need to process the complex sensory data from the car the same way you did the first time you saw a car .
Unless something is unusual about the car that conflicts with your expectations , you probably wo n’t even consciously notice it .
You may recognize that there ’s a downside to storing information in the form of invariant representations .
That downside is a loss of precision because invariants are only approximations of an ever - changing reality .
Consequently , with any invariant forms you ’ll encounter situations where you have trouble matching a specific instance of reality into a corresponding invariant form .
In practical terms this means you may encounter a person you have trouble classifying as male or female , a handwritten word you ca n’t recognize , or a film you are n’t sure should be labeled a comedy or a drama .
But despite these drawbacks , invariant representations of reality are incredibly powerful and useful .
Every letter , word , and idea you ’re perceiving right now is in fact being classified by your mind into invariant representations you ’ve already learned .
How we learn
Your mind is capable of learning both consciously and unconsciously , and it stores invariant representations at many levels .
For example , you can store the invariant forms of Corvettes , cars , motor vehicles , transportation , and so on .
As long as your expectations are met , this mental processing will usually be handled subconsciously .
However , whenever something occurs which does n’t meet your expectations , it will push through to grab your conscious attention .
Learning is what naturally occurs whenever your expectations are not met .
When you experience something new where you do n’t know what to expect , or when something occurs which conflicts with your expectations , your mind will strive to identify and store new patterns .
Your most vivid memories will be of those situations which on some level did n’t meet your mind ’s expectations .
Something unexpected occurred , something your mind could n’t match with one of its previously learned invariant representations .
When your experiences match your expectations , your mind will essentially discard the specific , low - level details of those events , and the memory will gradually fade into something fuzzier and less distinct .
The experiences you remember best are those which conflict with the routine .
I think the reason your mind stores the unexpected experiences in far greater detail than the routine ones is to give it the opportunity to later process those memories into invariant forms .
Your mind ca n’t figure out how to classify those experiences yet , so it just saves them for later .
It stores those memories at a higher resolution than normal .
Periodically you ’ll reload those memories when something triggers them , and this gives your mind additional chances to form a match .
You ’ll experience some of your biggest a- ha breakthroughs when your mind finally classifies an old memory into a new invariant representation .
For a traumatic experience , this may be perceived as an internal healing , since the mind can finally let go of the intense emotions .
Or it could lead to a sense of victimhood .
On the other hand , if your mind determines the best invariant representation for a batch of your experiences is to label you a perpetual victim , then it can just store the invariant victim pattern , and the specific memories that helped contribute to the identification of that pattern can be allowed to fade .
The essence of human intelligence
How intelligent you are — and how skilled you become at solving new problems and adapting to new circumstances — largely depends on your mind ’s ability to store and process invariant representations .
Intelligence is basically a matter of generalizing from specific experiences ( learning ) and applying those general patterns to new specific situations ( anticipation ) .
So you can say that becoming more intelligent is basically a matter of increasing the accuracy of your expectations under a wide variety of input .
Another way of saying this is that the more intelligent you become , the less you ’re surprised by reality .
This does n’t mean you know what ’s going to happen , just that what does happen falls within your reasonable expectations .
Consequently , if you were super - intelligent , nothing would really phase or shock you .
We do n’t consciously have to learn how to learn , since we ’re born with this capability .
Our sensory input gives us the raw data to start processing , and from there we spend our entire lives generalizing from the specific and then applying our generalizations to the specific .
The process never ends .
Ultimately we can trace all our knowledge back to our sensory input and the patterns we ’ve generalized from that input .
As odd as it may seem , we can not solve problems that we cannot link to invariant representations .
Even conscious reasoning relies on this process .
How to become smarter
Invariant representations are the building blocks of human intelligence .
Given the critical role of invariant representations , one route to greater intelligence is to increase your exposure to new experiences .
The more unique experiences you take in through your senses , the more invariant representations your mind will create and store .
This will provide you with a larger set of problem solving tools and a greater ability to adapt to new circumstances .
You ’ll begin to solve problems with ease that others find daunting .
Greater input variety not only allows you to learn more invariant representations — it will also hone your existing representations .
Experience creates expertise .
Consider Leonardo da Vinci , considered a genius by any reasonable standard .
He achieved competence in a diverse set of fields , including art , music , science , anatomy , engineering , architecture , and more .
While many would say such diverse interests were a symptom of his intelligence , I think it ’s more likely they were a key contributing factor .
By exposing himself to such a rich variety of input , Leonardo ’s mind would have created far more invariant representations than most people .
Additionally , his mind would have been able to form many more links between these representations .
This would have vastly amplified his problem - solving abilities .
Invariant representations learned from the study of one field often have creative applications in other fields .
Exposing yourself to the same types of input over and over again wo n’t increase your intelligence much at all .
You ’ll merely satisfy your mind ’s expectations instead of pushing it to form new patterns from new input .
Routine is the enemy of intelligence .
If you want to grow smarter , you must keep stirring things up .
Push yourself to do that which you fear .
Keep exposing yourself to new experiences , ideas , and input , and you will become smarter .
Your intelligence is not fixed unless your lifestyle is fixed .
In any given field , there ’s a great deal of myopia .
People who work in that field get stuck in their routines , and they just do n’t think very creatively most of the time .
For a while the routine patterns may work just fine , but when the inputs shift slightly ( which always happens eventually ) , those old patterns ( i.e. the old invariant representations ) become inaccurate , thereby increasing the chance of making errors in judgment .
Consider how the expansion of the Internet has impacted the world of business .
Lots of people are missing the boat because their invariant representations are outdated , or they do n’t have a rich enough set of invariant representations from other fields to be able to adapt to what ’s happening .
So they either avoid taking their businesses online , or they do it in a really dumb way that even web - savvy teens can recognize as plainly stupid .
Meanwhile , those people who ’ve been able to form more accurate and effective representations are able to intelligently leverage the Internet to take their businesses to new highs .
Recognize that all of our reasoning is done with our internalized , highly processed representations of reality , not with the hard facts of reality itself .
Even our sensory experiences occur entirely within our minds .
The more limited and inaccurate those internal representations are , the less intelligent we become .
Consequently , intelligence is not a fixed state of being — it ’s an ongoing process of learning and adapting to an ever - changing reality .
You ’d be amazed at how often invariant patterns from one field can be applied to another .
For example , I was able to improve my self - discipline by recognizing that building self - discipline is much like building muscle , so I applied the solution of progressive training to the field of self - discipline , and this helped me become a more disciplined person .
( Two years ago I wrote a series of articles on self - discipline to explain the how - to aspects if you ’re interested in learning more — I think they ’re still the most popular self - discipline articles online today . )
How to become dumber
Intelligence - wise the worst thing you can do is fall into a rut where your input remains essentially the same day after day and where very little surprises you .
This does n’t mean that every day is strictly identical — it just means your current experiences are similar enough to past experiences your mind has already classified into invariant representations , so your general expectations are almost always being met and you are n’t been pushed to learn anything new .
A good way to determine whether you ’ve fallen into this pattern is to attempt to list how many salient experiences you can identify from the previous 30 days .
Salient experiences are those that stand out in your mind , and you should n’t have to exert much effort to recall them .
If the past 30 days seem like a fuzzy blur of routine days you can barely recall with barely a handful of memorable spikes , even if you were engaged in a lot of activity , it ’s safe to say you ’re stuck in a rut .
This situation may be very common , but intelligence - wise it ’s not very healthy .
Ironically you may become highly intelligent within a limited and consistent environment , but you ’ll cripple your ability to adapt to new circumstances .
As soon as a major change occurs — and change is inevitable — you ’ll experience tremendous stress and will be weak in your ability to adapt to new circumstances .
The more new situations you experience , the greater your ability to adapt to ever - changing circumstances .
For a long - term employee , being laid off may come as a serious blow .
But for a long - term entrepreneur , losing a particular client is just par for the course .
The entrepreneur has learned invariant representations which make it easy to add new income streams , while the employee may have much lower intelligence in this area .
Similarly , people who interact socially with new people every day will develop much greater social intelligence than those who interact with the same people over and over .
Your challenge
Again , routine is the enemy of intelligence .
Going through the same morning ritual , working at the same place , doing the same type of work , interacting with the same people , eating the same foods , watching the same TV shows , and otherwise subscribing to the same predictable patterns will in fact make you less intelligent .
Routine is important for providing stability and security , but it should only provide the outer shell for tackling novel challenges each day .
Push yourself to take in new input , the likes of which you ’ve never previously experienced , and you will become smarter .
Ideally you ’ll want to tackle something new and non-routine at least once a day .
Read a new book , listen to a new song , walk around a new location , meet a new person , eat at a new restaurant , play a new game , install new software — do something that provides fresh , new input to your mind .
Over the next several days , begin to consciously recognize how your mind uses invariant representations in everything you do .
Notice the labels you assign to people , objects , and activities , such as boss , faucet , and paperwork .
Notice what other labels you associatively link to those representations .
Pay special attention to those representations that involve your identity .
How do you label yourself ?
Begin to question some of those representations .
Are they accurate ?
Could any of them be holding you back ?
How can you consciously improve upon those representations ?
A U.S. flag is seen moments after being set afire in a file photo .
Three Yale University students have been charged in a case involving the burning of a U.S. flag outside a Connecticut house , a court official said on Wednesday .
REUTERS / File
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Three Yale University students , including a Briton and a Greek national , have been charged in a case involving the burning of a U.S. flag outside a Connecticut house , a court official said on Wednesday .
Said Hyder Akbar , 23 , Nikolaos Angelopoulos , 19 , and Farhad Anklesaria , 19 , were arrested on Tuesday and charged in New Haven Superior Court with reckless endangerment , arson , breach of peace , criminal mischief and other offenses .
Police said the three torched a flag hanging from the porch of a house in New Haven near the Ivy League school .
Anklesaria is British and Angelopoulos is Greek .
Both are freshmen .
Akbar , a senior , was born in Pakistan but is a U.S. citizen , according to police and court documents .
Anklesaria and Angelopoulos turned over their passports .
Police gave no indication why they set fire to the flag .
The trio acknowledged it was a “ dumb thing to do ” when questioned by police , the New Haven Register reported .
They appeared in court in leg irons and handcuffs , the newspaper said .
Bail was set at $ 25,000 for Angelopoulos and Akbar , and $ 15,000 for Anklesaria , it added .
Akbar worked as an informal translator for U.S. forces during the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and later published a memoir , “ Come Back to Afghanistan , ” about his experiences there , the Yale Daily News reported .
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that flag burning was protected under constitutional free - speech guarantees , invalidating laws in 48 states and outraging veterans ’ groups and others who say that an important national symbol should be protected from defacement .
“ It makes me sick to my stomach to think that someone would burn the American flag , ” Marc Suraci , 37 , owner of the two - story house , told the Register , describing himself as “ very , very patriotic . ”
Kevin Alderman might not be a household name ( yet ) .
Most people are more familiar with his alter ego , Stroker Serpentine , the Second Life business mogul who built the first in - world sex bed – a digital bed with built - in sex position animations – and whose Amsterdam sim – a digital city – just sold on eBay for $ 50,000 .
I caught up with him by phone the day Amsterdam sold .
He was on a " Sopranos Tour " in New Jersey , but ducked into an alley near an ice cream shop to talk to me about why virtual property has real value and how sexuality and 3 - D go together like ice cream and Oreo cookies .
Wired News : Let 's start with the basics .
Who is Stroker Serpentine ?
Kevin Alderman : I get so involved in the character that Stroker really is more me than he is a character .
But let 's see .
Stroker is a pervert at large .
Erotic facilitator .
Pornographic mogul .
I like to think of myself in terms of being an adult friend finder , operating in an immersive environment where I can use my creative talents to bring people together .
Stroker is a character I developed three years ago within Second Life , and I started out with small events with like - minded individuals who also enjoyed the aspects of avie ( avatar ) erotica .
WN : Why would anyone pay $ 50,000 for a virtual property ?
Alderman :
Why would someone pay real money for something that does n't exist except on a server and a rack in San Francisco ?
I think because of the immersive nature of a virtual platform , and the ability to interact in real time with people from all walks of life and different environments and different cities across the globe .
It 's much better than a telephone because you have a visual representation , and we are tactile - visual creatures .
It 's the next best thing to real life , barring some type of cortical interface a la The Matrix .
Amsterdam is unique inasmuch ( as ) it was our first adult - oriented property within Second Life .
It was a favored hangout of the majority of Second Life escorts and developed a reputation as being salacious and erotic – and we developed it with that purpose in mind .
When you think about sexy cities , Amsterdam obviously comes to mind .
I used actual photographs of the city to lay out the sim and created textures based upon real landmarks .
The reason it sold for 50 K is because there will be no other Amsterdam within Second Life .
It 's like a unique URL – like Sex.com , which ( is worth ) millions of dollars .
The sim was bought by an investment group , which is in the Netherlands , and they see the potential for commercialization and marketing .
And people from the Netherlands are automatically going to be drawn to a sim named Amsterdam .
WN : What do you think about sexuality in virtual spaces ?
Alderman : I think it 's an inevitable progression .
Static web pages were great for information connectivity .
But ( in virtual worlds ) you make the paradigm leap away from something that is projected to you and toward something you create that represents yourself .
You impress your own psyche , motivations , creativity , sensuality onto a group of pixels and become quite attached to it .
It 's interesting how much freedom you get in that you do n't have any inhibitions to restrain you .
If you want to be a Gorean and prostitute yourself to a master or become their personal sex slave , then go for it .
If you want to be an escort in Amsterdam , or a domme , go for it .
So many freedoms – things you could n't normally do in real life or that you would love to do – the fantasy aspect is limitless .
Probably 60 percent of the women and men that come in - world at least try escorting or use the service because it 's the jumping off point , where you can explore your sexuality anonymously .
You can see what it is that Second Life has to offer in terms of avie erotica .
Until we get the cortical interface , this is the next best thing – and I 'm holding out for qDot ( to make the breakthrough ) .
WN : You sold Amsterdam in part because your focus has shifted to Eros .
What is Eros ?
Alderman :
We 're a grass - roots community of residents who like to push the envelope as to what is available to us within this 3 - D platform of Second Life .
We have regular group events where we get together and collaborate .
We dance – we do it naked , typically – and we brainstorm and try to develop avenues of expansion .
We talk about products we'd like to see developed , and specific animations that a group of people would like to see .
Every element – the Goreans , the Amazons , the furries – all have unique needs and requests .
We listen to them and then gather the animators , texture artists and builders , and ask : " How can we make this happen ? "
Eros is a complete experience .
It 's a community , it 's not just a place .
We 're all over the place , and we have events and sims and attitude .
And it 's a safe place to express yourself in a virtual environment – with no excuses and no explanations .
WN : How do you see Strokerz Toyz and your other adult developments in Second Life affecting the future of sexuality in - world ?
Alderman : Somebody 's gotta be the bad boy .
And it might as well be me .
This has been a progression for me over the years , from platform to platform and game to game .
I saw a need and I 'm filling that need .
The actual expansion of the " Serpentine Empire " is being motivated and instituted by customers and requests .
When people come to me and say , " You know what would really be cool ... , " we use that and expand on it .
And SexGen , which is our best - selling animation system – it's what we built our business on – was a combination of ideas and collaboration between a programmer , an animator and a pervert .
Stroker is just the icon .
The staff and the group members and the supporters are really the driving force .
They tell us what they would like to see and we do our damnedest to make it happen .

Faceless Invasion Does Montreal
Net Effect : No More Sexual Abuse
Pornography Is Not the Decider
Teledildonics Takes a Step
CHENJIAYUAN , China 
For many Chinese , an ancestor is someone to honor , but also someone whose needs must be maintained .
Families burn offerings of fake money or paper models of luxury cars in case an ancestor might need pocket change or a stylish ride in the netherworld .
But here in the parched canyons along the Yellow River known as the Loess Plateau , some parents with dead bachelor sons will go a step further .
To ensure a son ’s contentment in the afterlife , some grieving parents will search for a dead woman to be his bride and , once a corpse is obtained , bury the pair together as a married couple .
“ They happen pretty often , especially when teenagers or younger people die , ” said Yang Husheng , 48 , a traveling funeral director in the region who said he last attended such a funeral in the spring .
“ It ’s quite common .
I ’ve been in the business for seven or eight years , and I ’ve seen all sorts of things . ”
The rural folk custom , startling to Western sensibilities , is known as minghun , or afterlife marriage .
Scholars who have studied it say it is rooted in the Chinese form of ancestor worship , which holds that people continue to exist after death and that the living are obligated to tend to their wants  or risk the consequences .
Traditional Chinese beliefs also hold that an unmarried life is incomplete , which is why some parents worry that an unmarried dead son may be an unhappy one .
April 10 , 2007  --
Shaun Ellis gave up comfort , a family and the civilization that surrounded him , to live with wolves .
He is the founder of a wolf sanctuary at the Combe Martin Wildlife Park on England 's southwest coast .
" I was always drawn towards the animals more than I was a human society , " Ellis said .
At 42 years old , Ellis is 6 feet tall and powerfully built , with a weather - beaten face , piercing blue eyes and shoulder - length brown hair that he lets fall , loose and shaggy , when he is with the wolves .
A thin scar from a wolf bite extends beneath his right eye and along his cheekbone .
For someone whose life has been devoted to wolves , he looks the part .
In 2004 , when the lives of three pups at the sanctuary were at risk because their mother had stopped nursing them , Ellis decided to use years of knowledge he had accumulated to raise the captive pups himself by teaching them how to behave like wolves .
He moved in with the young pack and assumed the role of tutor and leader -- the alpha wolf .
The experiment was documented by a British television producer , Bernard Walton , whose footage will be broadcast next week on the National Geographic Channel .
" What was extraordinary was the relationships that developed between the different wolves and Shaun , " Walton said .
" He had refined everything down to a fine art -- to be a wolf . "
Interacting With the Subject
The fascination that led to Ellis ' experiment was born years ago , when Ellis , then an only child living on the east coast of England , awakened on a moonlit night to discover foxes playing among the horses in a field near his home .
" You could hear their giant hooves thundering across the ground , " Ellis said .
" So I ventured down to the wood line to find out exactly what was happening .
And the cause of their anxiety was this family of fox kits and their mother playing amongst the giant hooves of the horses .
And I guess that for me was the draw , the connection with nature . "
Ellis followed that connection single - mindedly .
He never finished high school .
In his teens he took a gamekeeping job .
After a stint in the army , he went to North America to spend time with the Nez Perce Indians , observing wild wolves and other animals .
While trained scientists study animals from a distance , through observation , so they do n't influence how the animals behave , Ellis was different .
He wanted to live among the wolves .
By working in animal parks when he returned to England , Ellis was able to learn through direct contact with wolf packs , albeit captive ones .
" What 's interesting is , I think that Shaun is like a nineteenth century naturalist of olden times , when you interact with your subject , " Walton said .
" In the twentieth century , that all changed . "
Learning the Language
Ellis did have an end game in mind .
Because many cultures have demonized wolves through film characters and fairy tales such as the " Wolf Man " and " Little Red Riding Hood , " Ellis wants to find ways in which wolves can more peacefully coexist with humans , especially in areas where they prey on livestock and create an economic burden for farmers and ranchers .
Ellis believes that by using information and techniques he has gathered through the time he spends with wolf packs , wolves can be influenced not to invade past certain human boundaries .
He chose to forego normal human contact , sometimes for days at a time , as a tutor to the three wolf pups at Combe Martin .
Thanks to his previous work , Ellis said he had learned to distinguish elements of wolf language .
Some of the first lessons the three pups got were in howling .
" The first call I usually give them is what we call a locating howl -- very high in pitch -- and it tells the young pups that no matter where they are , if they hear that , they come to me very quickly . "
Every pack member develops a signature howl that is unique to that animal , Ellis said .
" If the position that it holds in the pack changes , then its howl will change .
Everything depends up on the social positioning that these guys hold , and the howling is no different . "
' Intimate Associations '
One of the pups , named Tamaska , was particularly vocal .
" His reaction to being in trouble or getting hurt was to scream like a big child .
And he'd come running over to me very quickly and I 'd have to pick him up , put him under my neck and give him warmth .
Warmth is one of the ways that we use to say to the wolf that everything 's okay , you can calm down . "
Conservation biologist Dr. Chris Darimont of Canada 's Raincoast Conservation Society and the University of Victoria said that although the pups would have learned to howl on their own , " Shaun could have taught them certain howls , absolutely . "
Darimont has mixed feelings about the nature of Ellis ' work .
" I'm of the opinion that the best teachers of wolves are their parents and their older siblings in a traditional wild setting What Shaun is doing is not traditional Western science , but it does n't detract as much as one would think it does from what he 's been able draw from his very intimate associations with wolves that has rarely been done before . "
Darimont said he was impressed by scenes of Ellis eating at a deer carcass with the wolves , and growling to guard his portion of the kill and enforce the hierarchy of the pack .
' I Was Never Healthier '
" To be side by side , next to these carnivores with 1,500 pounds per square inch of biting pressure in a highly competitive environment -- this is a feast or famine lifestyle , " Darimont said .
" I 've seen his expressions , modifying his facial features , and it's the same thing that the wolves are doing .
It mimics wolf behavior close enough that it 's very , very effective . "
Ellis was n't eating raw meat from the animal carcasses , which were purchased and brought into the sanctuary for the wolves .
He had the organs he ate precooked , wrapped in plastic and placed back into the carcasses .
He then claimed and defended his food .
" I was never healthier , " Ellis said .
" Colds , flus , upset stomachs , internal problems never really became an issue .
I did pick up two bouts of worms , I have to admit that one . "
He also suffered what he said were accidental facial bites that resulted when two wolves on either side of him snapped at each other .
On such occasions , he left the compound briefly to see a doctor and receive stitches for the wound .
" In the early stages I would get stitched up , come back down again , and come in with the guys , " Ellis said .
" But very quickly they could smell something in the wound , so the wolves would just pluck out the stitches , very gently with their front incisors .
And [ I ] just sat there and let them do it because it 's their world .
They would open up the wound and thoroughly lick inside .
Every few hours they would come over and inspect the wound and clean it thoroughly , so much so that it would heal in a fraction of the time . "
Montana wolf biologist Dr. Kyran Kunkel said those healing powers would n't be unusual .
" They would have , within themselves , opportunities to heal in a way that 's evolved over time and that works for them .
So it would make sense , too , that it might also work for humans . "
The Human Family
Dr. Kunkel said that Ellis was not taking the type of risk involved in a famous incident in 2003 , when a naturalist and his girlfriend were killed by a grizzly bear .
" In terms of inflicting real harm , " Kunkel said , " I do n't think that was as big a concern with captive animals , and certainly not the concern you would have with a larger carnivore with claws like a grizzly bear . "
Ellis has four children from a long - term relationship that failed .
He said the work he does with wolves put a strain on his human family .
" You have to drive yourself away from human emotion , " Ellis said .
" When you leave here and try and join your family 's society , your emotion does n't come out with you .
You 're into a role that you provide with the wolves , and it takes a long time in the early stages to get out of that character and go into another one . "
Ellis said that in his dreams , he is sometimes a wolf instead of a human being .
" It 's almost like the wolf brings out the subconscious in you , a way of dealing with the world .
If I had a dream that caused me a problem or an anxiety , I would often find in that dream that I would appear as the wolf to deal with that problem .
If there was no anxiety , then normally [ I ] would be in human form . "
One way of dealing with the world and maintaining the pack structure while Ellis lived with the wolves was to keep a set of unwashed clothes that carried the odors of the pack -- the scents they knew him by .
He described it as a kind of wolf newspaper .
" This clothing actually contains all the information that surrounds their territory : where I 've been , how have I fed , have I made a kill ? "
' That Was His World '
Ellis did grow nostalgic for human contact .
In a visit to a pub near the wildlife park , he met and struck up a friendship with Helen Jeffs .
She said that the smell of Ellis ' work did n't deter her .
" When I met Shaun , that was his life , that was his world .
I knew that .
I could put up with that , no problem . "
Ellis could n't telephone her when he returned to the wolves , but Jeffs , who lived on the other side of a valley , was game for different types of communication .
" Shaun would howl with the pups , and then I would respond and howl back to him .
So we communicated by howling across the valley . "
Jeffs now lives and works with Ellis at the park .
As the wolves grew more independent , Ellis left the compound for an extended period of time that included a visit to Poland .
A farmer had complained about wild wolves preying on his livestock .
Ellis wanted to test some of his theories about using the wolves ' own techniques -- including howls that establish boundaries between rival packs -- to discourage them from entering human territories .
He asked a farmer to play recordings of territorial howls , the type that tell other wolves to stay away .
" They 're highly intelligent animals that will breach most problems , " Ellis said .
" But the one thing they will adhere to is the fact that where there is another wolf pack 's territory , you can't cross it . "
Ellis said that for six weeks after he began the experiment , the farmer reported no additional predation by wolves .
However , the experiment remains unproven and needs rigorous testing .
New Alpha Wolf
Biologists are of the same mind in wanting to minimize wolf - human conflicts .
" In many areas of the planet where wolves and humans still coexist , this is a dominant issue , " Darimont said .
" Whether it be wolves killing livestock or , conversely , humans killing wolves .
If there 's any way we can contribute to modification of behavior of the wolves , or the humans themselves , then this would be a valuable contribution .
And I think Shaun 's working towards that goal . "
Inevitably , Ellis ' relationship with the wolves at Combe Martin changed dramatically .
After his extended absence in Poland , Ellis returned to discover that the pack had chosen a new leader .
A wolf named Yana had become the alpha wolf .
Tamaska , the pup who had howled so desperately for Ellis ' comfort , assumed the role of a beta wolf , a kind of lieutenant whose strength may also make him a pack defender and enforcer .
Documentarian Bernard Walton watched with his cameras as Shaun returned and , for his own safety , approached the wolves he had mentored by assuming a submissive position .
" That was quite frightening , " Walton said .
" But he was able to get through it , and we all kind of sighed with relief . "
Ellis said he always had wanted the pack to supply its own leader , and he expected the takeover .
" This often happens within a fraternity of wolves .
There 's no malice and no remorse for any animal .
One of the hardest things I had to do was leave human emotions at that gate .
We just simply step down , and let a better , superior animal take our place . "
Now that he has gone full circle with the captive wolves , one of Ellis ' future ambitions is to somehow join a pack of wolves in the wild .
Darimont said he would n't recommend trying to cross that line .
" It would n't be something I 'd support .
My feeling , and it's a strong feeling , is that wild wolves should remain wild , and I do n't think we can justify joining a wild pack for the information it may offer . "
Kunkel agreed .
" I can't even think of a situation where it would be workable .
Because you 're in habitats and terrain [ where ] these animals do n't let humans , for the most part , get close to them . "
" I think I need them more than they need me , " Ellis said .
" I 've come to like them .
I wonder if they miss me when I leave .
I think the harsh reality for me is going to come when it 's time not to do this anymore , because what many people have come to class as savage , ruthless killer [ I 've ] come to know and love as family . "

A month ago , an Iranian general " disappeared " ( perhaps along with his family ) while in Turkey , and speculation is rampant .
Did Mossad or the CIA kidnap him or did he defect ?
In either case , he is a high - level intelligence source who could expose Iranian inner workings .
The Blotter :
" This is a fatal blow to Iranian intelligence , " said the source , explaining that Asgari knows sensitive information about Iran 's nuclear and military projects .
Iran called tens of its Revolutionary Guard agents working at embassies and cultural centers in Arab and European countries back to Tehran out of fear that Asgari might disclose secret information about their identities , according to the analyst .
There are conflicting reports about how and when Asgari disappeared .
The general , according to Turkish and Israeli press reports , arrived in Istanbul from Damascus on Feb .
7 . Initial reports speculated he may have been kidnapped because he failed to show up at a hotel that had been booked for him by two non-Turkish men .
The source , however , believes Asgari 's disappearance was prompted by the detention of five Iranians after the raid on their government 's liaison office in Irbil , Iraq in January .
Asgari , 63 , knew and may have worked with some of the detained men , said the analyst .
Asgari's years with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and the Iranian defense ministry would make him an invaluable source of information .
He was reportedly based in Lebanon in the 1990s and was in charge of ties with the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah .
Ha'aretz and the Jerusalem Post have weighed in , and Ynet reported that the Saudi newspaper al - Watan reported on the disappearance a week or so ago .
Makes you wonder if Abdullah and Ahmadinejad discussed the general 's disappearance during their summit last week .
By way of the New York Post , DEBKA adds this wrinkle :
Askari is believed to have taken part - or have links to - the armed group that stormed a U.S. - Iraqi command center in the holy city of Karbala on Jan. 20 and killed five U.S. troops , the Web site said .
The attackers wore military uniforms and used vehicles often driven by foreign dignitaries in an attempt to impersonate Americans .
A Middle East intelligence source said the United States could not let the outrage stand and had been hunting the general ever since , the Web site said .
Of course , it 's always good to take Debka with a vat of salt , but it looks like an interesting mystery nevertheless .
A ‘ doozy ’ of a campaign - finance violation
It ’s fairly routine for big campaigns to run afoul of some campaign - finance measure .
A campaign may miss a deadline , or misreport a donation , or exceed a spending limit .
In general , the Federal Election Commission notices , the candidate in question makes amends , and nary an eyebrow is raised .
But a $ 40 million excess in campaign spending is n’t just a clerical error .
The three Democrats on the Federal Election Commission revealed yesterday that they strongly believe President Bush exceeded legal spending limits during the 2004 presidential contest and that his campaign owes the government $ 40 million .
Their concerns spilled out during a vote to approve an audit of the Bush campaign ’s finances , which is conducted to make sure the campaign adhered to spending rules after accepting $ 74.6 million in public money for the 2004 general election .
The conflict apparently arose behind the scenes , but the FEC ’s audit of the Bush / Cheney 2004 campaign reportedly divided commissioners .
“ We had a disagreement on this audit , and it was a doozy , ” said one of the Democrats , Commissioner Ellen L. Weintraub .
At $ 40 million , I should say so .
What happened that allowed Bush ’s campaign to exceed spending limits by so much ?
It took a degree of Enron - like accounting — and some help from Bush ’s buddies .
The campaign spent $ 80 million on television ads it labeled “ hybrid ” ads — they promoted the president ’s bid for a second term , but also included references to Republican congressional candidates .
By throwing in House and Senate candidates , the Bush gang made up its own rule — the ads were only half about the president ’s campaign , so it meant the aides decided only half of the costs counted for financing purposes .
( The RNC reported the other half . )
This was particularly egregious because Bush participated in the public - financing system — after his convention , the president and his campaign team accepted the $ 74.6 million in public funds for the general election .
If they ’d played it straight , those “ hybrid ” ads that touted the president in key states / districts nationwide would never have run .
So why are we just now hearing about this ?
Because the Bush - appointed Republicans on the FEC rejected the Dems ’ concerns .
Commissioner Hans A. von Spakovsky , a Republican , [ said , ] “ There was no broken bargain , ” he said .
“ There was no violation of the law . ”
And who ’s Hans A. von Spakovsky ?
Barbara O’Brien reminds us of concerns from 2005 :
The most objectionable nominee is Hans von Spakovsky , a former Republican county chairman in Georgia and a political appointee at the Justice Department .
He is reported to have been involved in the maneuvering to overrule the career specialists who warned that the Texas gerrymandering orchestrated by Representative Tom DeLay violated minority voting rights .
Senators need the opportunity to delve into that , as well as reports of Mr. von Spakovsky ’s involvement in such voting rights abuses as the purging of voter rolls in Florida in the 2000 elections .
The Dems ’ objections were also blocked by Commissioner Michael E. Toner , who just so happened to be a former Bush attorney and counsel to the Republican National Committee .
Bush gets by with a little help from his friends , does n’t he ?
Cluster finds magnetic reconnection within giant swirls of plasma
6 December 2006
The Earth 's magnetic field protects our planet from the continuous stream of particles blown by the Sun : the solar wind .
However , there are ways for solar material to penetrate the Earth 's magnetic shield or magnetopause .
One of the most efficient mechanisms for such solar wind penetration is magnetic reconnection .
At the magnetopause , it occurs when Earth 's magnetic field lines interconnect with Interplanetary Magnetic Field ( IMF ) lines carried by the solar wind .
This allows solar material to enter along the connected field lines ( Animation 1 ) .
The Earth 's magnetic field lines are always oriented from the South to the North poles and are static .
In comparison the IMF is rather dynamic , changing orientation frequently .
When the B z component of the IMF is oriented southward , the IMF is anti-parallel to the geomagnetic field lines at the subsolar point ( the ' nose ' of the magnetopause facing the Sun ) .
In this case , magnetic reconnection can readily account for solar wind entry at the dayside magnetopause .
With a B z component of the IMF oriented northward , reconnection at the dayside magnetopause is highly unlikely .
However , measurements in space have shown that the plasma content of the outer magnetosphere increases during northward IMF , contrary to expectation if reconnection is the dominant transfer mechanism .
Under northward IMF conditions , the characteristics of the heart of the magnetosphere , a region called the plasma sheet , located around the Earth and extending significantly on the Earth 's nightside , are significantly modified .
Only a couple of hours of Northward IMF conditions are necessary for such a transition , where in - situ satellite observations show that the plasma sheet is cooler and denser than compared to the situation when the IMF is southward .
Under these northward IMF conditions , the plasma sheet is referred to as the cold and dense plasma sheet .
But what is behind its formation ?
Different mechanisms have been proposed .
One of them is the Kelvin - Helmholtz or ' wind over water ' Instability ( KHI ) , and occurs when two fluids are in motion with respect to one another .
In the magnetospheric environment , this situation is most likely to occur on the magnetospheric flanks .
According to simulations , plasma transport across the magnetopause is possible if the KHI has developed enough to form rolled - up vortices , or giant swirls , able to engulf plasmas from both sides of the magnetopause ( Image 1 ) .
The plasma transport itself is ensured by either the collapse of the vortex or the reconnection within such a vortex .
This theoretical mechanism was proposed in the 1950's by Jim Dungey from Imperial College ( London , UK ) , just before the space era .
Many encounters by spacecraft of vortex - like structures near the magnetopause have been reported since and interpreted as signatures of the Kelvin - Helmholtz instability and compared to numerical simulations ( see in particular Fairfield et al. , 2000 ; Otto et al. , 2000 ) .
However , observations by a single satellite do not allow for the full characterization of these KHIs : are the observations of a large amplitude wave structure or has the system developed to the unstable state where rolled - up vortices have formed ?
The ESA / NASA Cluster mission is the first mission of the space era composed of four satellites flying in formation able to tackle such problems .
Launched in 2000 , the concept proved successful .
On 12 August 2004 , Hiroshi Hasegawa and colleagues from New Hampshire University ( USA ) published in Nature the first detection with 4 spacecraft of rolled - up Kelvin - Helmholtz vortices on the dusk side of the magnetosphere .
In particular , the length scale of one of these vortices was estimated to be 40 000 km - 55 000 km , thanks to the use of Cluster data [ see related links on the right - hand side for the related ESA science news release of August 2004 : http://www.esa.int/esaSC/SEMTMDW4QWD_index_0.html].
However , no sign of magnetic reconnection or vortex collapse was found .
On 3 July 2001 , the four Cluster satellites were flying in formation along the dawn side of the magnetosphere when they observed large variations in all plasma parameters .
Dr. Katariina Nykyri from Imperial College conducted a detailed study on these data and linked these large variations to the presence of rolled - up Kelvin - Helmholtz vortices .
But this is not just another encounter of giant swirls of plasma induced by the KHI .
For the first time , the presence of magnetic reconnection was identified within such vortices .
Numerical simulations in 2 dimensions ( 2 - D ) , conducted by Nykyri and colleagues , were able to reproduce the Cluster observations in great detail and in particular , to show the presence of magnetic reconnection ( Image 2 and Animation 2 ) .
Published 20 October 2006 in Annales Geophysicae , this study reinforces the importance of this mechanism to enable solar wind material to penetrate the Earth 's magnetopause .
But this story is not over yet .
To better understand the importance of this phenomenon , further simulations , this time in 3D , are now planned .
" In 3 - D simulations , we will study the significance of plasma transport due to this mechanism and its effectiveness in the formation of the cold and dense plasmasheet on this day " , wrote Dr. Nykyri research associate at Imperial College at the time of this study , now assistant professor in Physics at Embry Riddle aeronautical University , Florida , USA .

Another crucial point is to perform a statistical study of the occurrence of the KHI on both flanks of the magnetosphere , in order to quantify the importance of this phenomenon .
The goal is simple : for given solar wind conditions , how much solar material data will swirl down into the magnetosphere via the Kelvin - Helmholtz instability .
This requires digging into the 6 years ( and counting ! ) of data accumulated by Cluster .
" Cluster data are public domain .
An on - going effort is financed by the European Space Agency to make it available online with the highest time resolution and quality .
The so - called Cluster Active Archive ( CAA ) is accessible at http://caa.estec.esa.int/
[ see related links on the right - hand side ] .
We are building a gold mine of magnetospheric data and we invite the whole world to use it " , says Philippe Escoubet Cluster project scientist of the European Space Agency .

Artist 's Statement Years ago I drew a cartoon called " Do n’t Mind Grandpa , " showing myself as an old man , appalling my adult children by using the word " pets " in front of my grandchildren and crankily defending the practice of pet ownership .
I ’ve thought a lot about the things for which we condemn our ancestors of only a few generations ago — opposing women ’s suffrage and civil rights , slave ownership — pretending to a moral superiority that I ’m not sure is justified .
It 's not like human nature has undergone any radical improvement in the last century .
I think that history will judge us unforgivingly for our heartless treatment of animals as commodities , and for the mass extinctions we ’re heedlessly causing .
The world ’s frogs and bees are inexplicably dying off .
We have driven the elephants insane with grief .
I 'm not suggesting that animals are as intelligent or worthy of the same legal rights as human beings , but they do have a capacity for suffering -- they certainly experience pain and fear , and , as someone who has to get his cat in a box to move twice a year , I would also argue dread -- and so , as beings with the capacity for empathy and compassion , we should maybe take pause at imprisoning and torturing them .
See David Foster Wallace ’s essay " Consider the Lobster , " from the collection of the same title , for a troubling meditation on this issue .
As someone who considers steamed crabs in summer one of life ’s greatest pleasures , I try not to think about this much .
Still , I also believe that our prehistoric ancestors would look on our maudlin concern for vanishing species like the Bengal Tiger with incomprehension .
Like :
You mean you ’ve finally killed off the tigers ?
Hooray !
Excellent !
Congratulations -- what a noble people you must be !
You have made a paradise on earth !
It may be that all the crimes of humanity for its entire history - - its savage wars , the slavery and rapine and torture , the extermination of races and eradication of cultures -- will pale in comparison to the ruination of the planet now being perpetrated by us .

My ex-girlfriend Sandi , now a science reporter for NPR , tells me that someone recently did a rough accounting of the sum total of copper on the planet , and calculated that approximately one third of the copper is still in the ground , another third is currently in use in construction , computers , etc. , and the last third is in landfills .
Did you catch that ?
One - third of the existing copper on this planet has been thrown out .

The great task of our generation and the ones to come after us will not be defeating Islamic terrorism --- I mean come one , if those penny - ante losers actually won they ’d all kill each other off in fourteen days flat -- it ’s figuring out how to build a modern but sustainable way of life that we can pass down to our descendants .
What ’s called Permaculture .
We do know how to do this , of course — we did it for millions of years before industrialization .
( See Daniel Quinn ’s Ishmael for further details . )
It ’s how to do it with six billion people on the planet without all of them living in squalid poverty and sickness that ’s the trick .
One thing we know is that we ’re not all going to get to live the way we Americans have been living for the last fifty years .
Which is why I do n’t see Americans being the pioneers in this great societal project .
At some point in the last hundred years we went from being a nation of fearless dreamers and inventors and explorers to fatassed infantile consumers .
No generation in the history of Man has ever been more ill - equipped to take care of itself .
I have explained to my friend Rob that in the event of the global collapse he envisions , my contingency plan is :
To die .
I am a frivolous person and will not last long in the post - industrial environment .

I am pleased to have finally found a place for it .
My colleague Ruben Bolling also drew a cartoon years ago brilliantly illustrating the exponential effect of stupid people reproducing more than smart people .
It showed one guy saying , " Maybe I ’d better get a condom , " and , one generation later , his offspring saying " Maybe I ’d better get a condom . "
In the other column , another guy was saying , " No way !
I do n’t use those things , " and , a generation later , his eight offspring were all saying " No way !
I do n’t use those things ! "

As if anybody in America could spell " dysgenics " on a picket sign . )
Panel 4 is a commentary on the caprices of aesthetic fashion , which once considered Conrad a writer of boys ’ adventure books and forgot all about Herman Melville for thirty years .
The Victorian prose of a hundred years ago sounds ridiculously purple and turgid to us ; perhaps our post - Hemingway minimalism will sound as affected and foolish .
Who knows what aesthetic crimes we ’ll be judged guilty of a hundred years from now ?

According to recent research , tiny clusters of atoms known as quantum dots may be excellent media for quantum teleportation , a physics phenomenon in which information – in the form of a quantum state , a very specific mathematical “ signature ” of an atom – can be transmitted almost instantaneously to a distant location without having to physically travel through space .
Teleportation is one facet of quantum information science , a developing field that could have a major impact on computing and communications .
Here , researchers focus on semiconductor quantum dots containing as few as a thousand atoms of a semiconducting element , such as silicon , and having diameters as small as one nanometer .
They are often referred to as “ artificial atoms ” because their behavior can be quite similar to a single atom .
For example , a semiconductor quantum dot's electrons can be confined in a way similar to how a single atom 's electrons are bound .
Therefore , a quantum dot can be described by a single quantum state , despite consisting of hundreds or thousands of atoms .
Researchers Leong Chuan Kwek and K.W. Choo of Nanyang Technological University in Singapore modeled a teleportation system consisting of two quantum dots .
They first investigated how the fidelity of the teleportation process would be affected by quantum “ entanglement ” – when two or more quantum states have to be described with reference to each other , even when spatially separated .
The model revealed that the entanglement of the dots is proportional to the fidelity : as one increases , the other increases .
Kwek and Choo then developed general equations that would yield a suitable magnetic field , dot - to - dot distance , and temperature ( which would all depend on the size of the dots and other variables ) such that the fidelity of the system would be better than the average fidelity of non-quantum communications .
“ Our work provides some preliminary estimates on the way self - assembled quantum dots might be fabricated in terms of inter - dot distances for experiments at room temperature , ” Kwek told PhysOrg.com .
He and Choo also studied how the system would handle “ decoherence , ” the often unavoidable interaction of a quantum system with its environment , which compromises the transfer process .
Decoherence is one major issue facing quantum computing .
Two decoherence models show , however , that the quantum - dot system could still function under a moderate amount of decoherence .
Finally , the researchers used the model to study a quantum - state transfer or swapping of states between two quantum dots , an ability necessary for quantum information processing .
They determined that a “ perfect ” transfer is possible using a quantum - dot teleportation system , meaning that the transferred quantum state is exactly the same as the initial quantum state of the first dot .

The RIAA is asking for additional cooperation from ISPs in getting customers targeted by the RIAA 's file - sharing sting to cooperate , according to a letter recently leaked to P2P attorney Ray Beckerman .
In it , the RIAA lays out its vision for how it would like ISPs to cooperate with its efforts to identify and sue those accused of sharing music over P2P networks .
This includes communicating a standing offer of a $ 1,000 settlement discount should the subscriber settle before a lawsuit is filed against him or her .
The letter also discloses plans for a settlement website that will launch later this year .
MediaSentry , the RIAA 's investigative arm , typically identifies suspected copyright infringers by IP address .
One of the record labels whose music was discovered in a shared folder then becomes the lead plaintiff in a John Doe lawsuit .
Via the discovery process , the ISP is then forced to turn over the name and address of the account owner who was using the IP address at the time of the alleged infringement .
At that point , the John Doe case is discontinued and the label sues the individual fingered by the ISP .
Bypassing the courts
The RIAA wants to do an end run around this process , getting ISPs to start the collection agency work by sending out letters to the owners of IP addresses allegedly used for infringement .
If the recipient of a such a letter contacts the RIAA , the labels get their positive ID and the chance to extract a sizable settlement without having to resort to the legal system .
In its letter ( which has all information that would identify the recipient blacked out ) , the RIAA outlines how it would like ISPs ' help in its continued attacks against suspected file sharers .
One of the big problems from the RIAA 's perspective is that of the ISPs ' communications .
" Whether in a notice to a subscriber at the preservation or Doe stage , or in subsequent communication with subscribers , " the RIAA writes , " it is vital that you avoid providing incorrect or misleading information . "
Instead , ISPs should use a model letter written by the RIAA to let subscribers know what 's going on .
<< ISP >> has received a notice from the Recording Industry Association of America ( " RIAA " ) requesting that we preserve documents regarding your identity .
The RIAA has indicated that it intends to file a lawsuit and seek leave to serve a subpoena upon << ISP >> requiring disclosure of documents that identify the user located at an IP address that our files indicate was assigned to you at the time identified by the RIAA .
If you have an questions regarding why the RIAA is interested in your account , please contact the record companies ' representatives by phone at ( 913 ) 234-8181 , by facsimile at ( 913 ) 234-81812 , or by email at info@SettlementInformationLine.com
Please be advised that if the RIAA follows this notice with a subpoena , we will forward a copy of that subpoena to you but we will be legally obligated to provide the requested information .
Our purpose in sending you this letter is to provide you with advance notice of the RIAA 's request .
<< ISP >> is not taking any action against you , and there is no need for you to communicate with us regarding this issue .
ISPs are cautioned against letting their customer service staff provide misinformation to subscribers .
They are told to " refrain from issuing opinions about the validity of the copyright claims . "
The RIAA also asks to be promptly notified if an ISP believes it has mistakenly identified a customer in an attempt to avoid further embarrassments .
Call now !
Operators are standing by !
The RIAA will also be providing the ISPs with another letter they can send to their subscribers , this one notifying them of the possibility of an early , out - of - court settlement .
" We have heard repeatedly from targets that they want the ability to settle as early as possible at the lowest amount possible , " according to the letter .
" To accommodate this request , we are instituting a new Pre -Doe settlement option that will allow infringers to settle at a discounted rate if they do so prior to our filing a Doe suit . "
There 's a catch : in order to be eligible for the Pre - Doe settlement option and $ 1,000 savings , ISPs will have to hold on to its log files for at least 180 days .
This gives the RIAA ample time to pursue a lawsuit and subpoena if the suspected infringer elects not to enter a settlement .
The letter also outlines what exactly the RIAA wants in response to a subpoena , should a lawsuit become necessary .
First , the music labels want an ISP to examine its log files " as completely and carefully as possible " before responding .
The labels also want the most up - to - date contact information , as well as the log files used to identify the subscriber .
Ill communication
The last request contains a troubling admission by the RIAA : " We are taking this step to address the occasional problem we have had where an ISP does not maintain the log files and cannot later exculpate a subscriber who claims to have been misidentified . "
In other words , the RIAA has targeted the wrong people in the past due to its heavy reliance on US ISPs to accurately identify people with shared music folders on Kazaa or other P2P networks .
Later this year , the RIAA will launch a new website intended to " facilitate " early settlements .
Once www.p2plawsuits.comwhich was just registered on January 23  comes online , it will provide consumers with information about the RIAA 's lawsuits and how to enter into a costly settlement in order to avoid litigation .
We contacted the RIAA to determine if the letter was indeed authentic and received no response prior to running this story .
If nothing else , the letter illustrates the degree to which the RIAA wants to be able to get settlements from its targets without having to resort to even a John Doe lawsuit .
The RIAA also anticipates stepping up the pace of its lawsuits against suspected file sharers , telling ISPs that the labels will soon resume sending them " early preservation notices " that are precursors to a lawsuit .

According to observations by NASA 's Chandra X-ray Observatory and ground - based optical telescopes , the supernova SN 2006gy is the brightest and most energetic stellar explosion ever recorded and may be a long - sought new type of explosion .

The brightest stellar explosion ever recorded may be a long - sought new type of supernova , according to observations by NASA 's Chandra X-ray Observatory and ground - based optical telescopes .
This discovery indicates that violent explosions of extremely massive stars were relatively common in the early universe , and that a similar explosion may be ready to go off in our own Galaxy .
" This was a truly monstrous explosion , a hundred times more energetic than a typical supernova , " said Nathan Smith of the University of California at Berkeley , who led a team of astronomers from California and the University of Texas .
" That means the star that exploded might have been as massive as a star can get , about 150 times that of our Sun .
We 've never seen that before . "
Astronomers think many of the first generation of stars were this massive , and , therefore , this new supernova may provide a rare glimpse of how the first stars died .
It is unprecedented , however , to find such a massive star and witness its death in the local Universe .
The discovery of the supernova , known as SN 2006gy , provides evidence that the death of such massive stars is fundamentally different from theoretical predictions .
" Of all exploding stars ever observed , this was the king , " said Alex Filippenko , leader of the ground - based observations at the Lick Observatory in California and the Keck Observatory in Hawaii .
" We were astonished to see how bright it got , and how long it lasted . "
The Chandra observation allowed the team to rule out the most likely alternative explanation for the supernova , namely that it was an explosion of a white dwarf star with a mass only slightly higher than the Sun into a dense , hydrogen - rich environment .
In that event , SN 2006gy should have been 1,000 times brighter in X - rays than what Chandra detected .
" This provides strong evidence that SN 2006gy was , in fact , the death of an extremely massive star , " said Dave Pooley of U.C. Berkeley who led the Chandra observations .
The star that produced SN 2006gy apparently expelled a large amount of mass prior to exploding .
This eruption is similar to one seen from Eta Carinae , a massive star in our Galaxy , raising suspicion that Eta Carinae may be poised to explode as a supernova .
Although SN 2006gy is intrinsically the brightest supernova ever , it is in the galaxy NGC 1260 some 240 million light years away .
However , Eta Carinae is only about 7500 light years away in our own Milky Way galaxy .
" We do n't know for sure if Eta Carinae will explode soon , but we had better keep a close eye on it just in case , " said Mario Livio of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , who was not involved in the research .
" Eta Carinae 's explosion could be the best star - show in the history of modern civilization . "
Supernovas usually occur when massive stars exhaust their fuel and collapse under their own gravity .
In this case of SN 2006gy , astronomers think that a very different effect may have triggered the explosion .
Under some conditions , the core of a massive star produces so much gamma-ray light that some of the energy from the radiation is converted into particle and anti-particle pairs .
The resulting drop in energy causes the star to collapse under its own huge gravity .
After this violent collapse , runaway thermonuclear reactions ensue and the star explodes , spewing the remains into space .
The SN 2006gy data suggest that spectacular supernovas from the first stars -- rather than complete collapse to a black hole -- may be more common than previously believed .
" In terms of the effect on the early Universe , there 's a huge difference between these two possibilities , " said Smith .
" One pollutes the galaxy with large quantities of newly made elements and the other locks them up forever in a black hole . "

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- Running what is in effect an ad for talent , Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett , 76 , says in the company 's just - released annual report that he plans to hire a younger person - or perhaps more than one - to understudy him in managing Berkshire 's investments .
Buffett hopes to find , he says , a candidate to " succeed me as Berkshire 's chief investment officer when the need for someone to do that arises . "
In the same section of the annual report , Buffett writes , " I feel terrific and , according to all measurable indicators , am in excellent health . "
Jesting about his infamous non-diet , he adds , " It 's amazing what Cherry Coke and hamburgers will do for a fellow . "
Buffett says the plan to hire an investment manager was discussed fully at Berkshire 's October board meeting and recognizes that the company 's succession plans on the investment side of its business are not well - developed .
In contrast , he says , repeating a statement he has made previously , Berkshire has three outstanding candidates - all much younger than he - to replace him as CEO .
The board , he writes , " knows exactly who should take over if I should die tonight . "
Picking the right person to hire on the investment side will not be easy , Buffett says .
" We need someone genetically programmed , " he specifies , " to avoid serious risks , including those never before encountered . "
Other talents he will be looking for , he says , are " independent thinking , emotional stability , and a keen understanding of both human and institutional behavior . "
Buffett adds that Berkshire will face a special problem in keeping the person it hires .
" Being able to list Berkshire on a resume , " he says , " would materially enhance the marketability of an investment manager .
We will need , therefore , to be sure we can retain our choice , even though he or she could leave and make much more money elsewhere . "
Buffett mentions Lou Simpson , 70 , who has managed the investments of Berkshire subsidiary GEICO for more than 25 years and whom Buffett sees as his investment backstop right now , as the type of person Berkshire would hope to hire .
Buffett says that though Simpson " has earned large amounts , " he could have left long ago for a much more lucrative spot if " money alone had been the object . "
Says Buffett : " We need to find a younger person or two made of the same stuff . "
Buffett says that he will be helped in his search for someone to hire by Simpson and by Berkshire 's vice - chairman , Charles Munger .
At the end of 2006 , Berkshire had $ 61 billion in equity investments ; $ 28 billion in fixed - income securities ; and cash holdings of $ 43 billion .

Bush administration officials said Tuesday that they were reviewing proposed changes to the way the 34 - year - old Endangered Species
Act is enforced , a move that critics say would weaken the law in ways that a Republican majority in Congress was unable to do .
A draft of suggested changes , which was leaked Tuesday , would reduce protection for wildlife habitat and transfer some authority over vulnerable species to states .
Acting under orders from Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne , who has long fought for changes in the law , U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director H. Dale Hall said he had asked his senior field staff to evaluate proposals in the draft by policy advisors in the Departments of Interior and Commerce , which oversee almost 1,300 imperiled species .
“ What we ’re attempting to do is to update our implementation of the existing law , ” said Hall , who said any changes would not need to be approved by Congress and would be signed by Kempthorne or a representative .

“ The act is written or not written by Congress , but we have the responsibility to implement the law through regulations and policies .
We ’re trying to bring consistency and clarity .
That has been a significant problem from one area of the country to another , ” Hall said .
Hall made his comments after environmental groups and the online journal Salon.com published a draft version of the proposals Tuesday .
He said that the version was “ a beginning point ” circulated internally to eight senior Fish and Wildlife staff in early February , and that it had changed a great deal since .
He refused to make public the current version , saying he wanted his staff to be free from “ outside interference ” while they evaluated possible changes .
He and a Wildlife Service spokesman said that if any of the ideas were formally proposed , they would be posted online and there would be an opportunity for public comment .
“ It ’s sort of a work in progress , ” spokesman Chris Tollefson said .
“ Nothing is proposed at this point ; we ’re still working through this . ”

Contending that the act penalized property owners and made the cost of public works projects prohibitive , House Republicans in particular have been trying to make changes since 1995 .
Last year , the House and Senate failed to agree on changes that proponents said could have helped speed approvals for dams , housing developments , highways and other projects where protected species live .
Changes in the act could have a significant effect in California , which has the second - highest number of endangered species in the nation after Hawaii .
Congressional staffers said Tuesday that they were studying the draft and could not immediately comment .
Senate environment and public works chairwoman Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif . ) issued a brief statement , saying : “ I will vigorously oppose any weakening of the Endangered Species Act , which has saved the American bald eagle , and which is now playing a role in saving the polar bear . ”
Environmental groups said the draft changes would cripple the law .

“ Taken together , this proposal would fundamentally gut the purpose and the intent of the Endangered Species Act .
Fewer species would be protected , the standards intended to help them survive and recover would be fundamentally weakened , and very likely more species will go extinct , ” said Jan Hasselman , an attorney with Earthjustice .
Since Bush became president , 57 species have been declared endangered , usually as a result of lawsuits -- fewer than any president since the law was signed by President Nixon in 1973 .
Damien Schiff , an attorney with the Pacific Legal Foundation representing landowners and developers battling endangered species restrictions , said of the draft : “ It ’s certainly not a gutting of the Endangered Species Act .
It is at most an incremental change that might provide moderate or small benefits to the regulated community . ”
He said that under the version made public , plans for dams to provide electricity and irrigation for farming could proceed with less hindrance even if endangered or threatened species were present .
He said that in an extreme case , it was possible a species could become extinct , but only if it was determined that a greater public value such as providing water or power was being served .

The draft contains language from Kempthorne ’s proposed 1998 legislation and from a controversial bill by former Rep. Richard W. Pombo ( R - Tracy ) , both of which died in Congress .
Kempthorne could not be reached for comment Tuesday .
Fish and Wildlife Service spokesman Tollefson said of the proposals : “ The initial work was done before Mr. Kempthorne took office , but really the impetus happened when he came .
He has ... had a special interest in the Endangered Species
Act for a long time , and he asked [ Fish and Wildlife chief ]
Dale [ Hall ] to figure out a way to take a look at the act and figure out what we could do . ”

Stephen King 's favourite book is The Golden Argosy
Around 125 leading writers listed their top ten works of literature for a book called The Top Ten , out next month .
Leo Tolstoy appeared twice in the top 20 , with Anna Karenina in first place and War and Peace in third .
Gustave 's Flaubert 's Madame Bovary was in second place , Vladimir Nabokov 's Lolita was fourth , and Mark Twain 's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn fifth .
Shakespeare was the highest rated British author , coming sixth with Hamlet , and reaching 18th place with King Lear .
Booker prize
The only woman to make the top ten was George Eliot with Middlemarch .
Carey , who has won the Booker prize twice , picked Madame Bovary as his all time top book .
Thomas Keneally , who won the Booker for Schindler 's Ark , listed Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte as his favourite novel .
Horror writer King chose The Golden Argosy - an anthology of 55 short stories from authors including Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald - as his favourite , with The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in second .
He bought his copy of The Golden Argosy in a sale for $ 2.25 in 1955 .
" At the time I only had $ 4 and spending over half of it on one book was a hard decision , " King said .
" I never regretted it .
[ It ] taught me more about good writing than all the classes I have ever taken , " he added .
Feynman vs. The Abacus
This is an excerpt from the chapter " Lucky Numbers " , in Surely , You 're Joking , Mr. Feynman ! , Edward Hutchings ed. , W. W. Norton , ISBN : 0-393-31604-1 .
The setting is Brazil ; the narrator is Richard Feynman .
A Japanese man came into the restaurant .
I had seen him before , wandering around ; he was trying to sell abacuses .
He started to talk to the waiters , and challenged them :
He said he could add numbers faster than any of them could do .
The waiters did n't want to lose face , so they said , " Yeah , yeah .
Why do n't you go over and challenge the customer over there ? "
The man came over .
I protested , " But I do n't speak Portuguese well ! "
The waiters laughed .
" The numbers are easy , " they said .
They brought me a paper and pencil .
The man asked a waiter to call out some numbers to add .
He beat me hollow , because while I was writing the numbers down , he was already adding them as he went along .
I suggested that the waiter write down two identical lists of numbers and hand them to us at the same time .
It did n't make much difference .
He still beat me by quite a bit .
However , the man got a little bit excited : he wanted to prove himself some more .
" Multiplicação ! " he said .
Somebody wrote down a problem .
He beat me again , but not by much , because I 'm pretty good at products .
The man then made a mistake : he proposed we go on to division .
What he did n't realize was , the harder the problem , the better chance I had .
We both did a long division problem .
It was a tie .
The bothered the hell out of the Japanese man , because he was apparently well trained on the abacus , and here he was almost beaten by this customer in a restaurant .
" Raios cubicos ! " he says with a vengeance .
Cube roots !
He wants to do cube roots by arithmetic .
It 's hard to find a more difficult fundamental problem in arithmetic .
It must have been his topnotch exercise in abacus - land .
He writes down a number on some paper any old number  and I still remember it : 1729.03 .
He starts working on it , mumbling and grumbling : " Mmmmmmagmmmmbrrr "  he 's working like a demon !
He 's poring away , doing this cube root .
Meanwhile I 'm just sitting there .
One of the waiters says , " What are you doing ? " .
I point to my head .
" Thinking ! " I say .
I write down 12 on the paper .
After a little while I 've got 12.002 .
The man with the abacus wipes the sweat off his forehead : " Twelve ! " he says .
" Oh , no ! " I say .
" More digits !
More digits ! "
I know that in taking a cube root by arithmetic , each new digit is even more work that the one before .
It 's a hard job .
He buries himself again , grunting " Rrrrgrrrrmmmmmm ... , " while I add on two more digits .
He finally lifts his head to say , " 12.01 ! "
The waiter are all excited and happy .
They tell the man , " Look !
He does it only by thinking , and you need an abacus !
He 's got more digits ! "
He was completely washed out , and left , humiliated .
The waiters congratulated each other .
How did the customer beat the abacus ?
The number was 1729.03 .
I happened to know that a cubic foot contains 1728 cubic inches , so the answer is a tiny bit more than 12 .
The excess , 1.03 is only one part in nearly 2000 , and I had learned in calculus that for small fractions , the cube root 's excess is one - third of the number 's excess .
So all I had to do is find the fraction 1/1728 , and multiply by 4 ( divide by 3 and multiply by 12 ) .
So I was able to pull out a whole lot of digits that way .
A few weeks later , the man came into the cocktail lounge of the hotel I was staying at .
He recognized me and came over .
" Tell me , " he said , " how were you able to do that cube - root problem so fast ? "
I started to explain that it was an approximate method , and had to do with the percentage of error .
" Suppose you had given me 28 .
Now the cube root of 27 is 3 ... "
He picks up his abacus : zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 
" Oh yes , " he says .
I realized something : he does n't know numbers .
With the abacus , you do n't have to memorize a lot of arithmetic combinations ; all you have to do is to learn to push the little beads up and down .
You do n't have to memorize 9+7=16 ; you just know that when you add 9 , you push a ten 's bead up and pull a one 's bead down .
So we 're slower at basic arithmetic , but we know numbers .
Furthermore , the whole idea of an approximate method was beyond him , even though a cubic root often cannot be computed exactly by any method .
So I never could teach him how I did cube roots or explain how lucky I was that he happened to choose 1729.03 .
The Ebola virus is extremely virulent , killing 50 - 90 % of victims ( Image : NIH )
The Ebola virus may have killed more than 5000 gorillas in West Africa , enough to send them into extinction if people continue to hunt them too , researchers say .
The virus is spreading from one group of the already endangered animals to another , the international team of experts report today in the journal Science
And it appears to be spreading faster than it is among humans .
" The Zaire strain of Ebola virus killed about 5000 gorillas in our study area alone , " write primatologist Dr Magdalena Bermejo of the University of Barcelona in Spain and colleagues .
Ebola haemorrhagic fever is one of the most virulent viruses ever seen , killing 50 - 90 % of victims .
The World Health Organization says that it killed 1200 people infected between its discovery in 1976 and 2004 .
The virus is transmitted by direct contact with blood , organs or other bodily fluids .
There is no cure or good treatment , although several groups are working on vaccines .
Several experts have noted that chimpanzees and gorillas are also killed by the virus , and suspect that people may have caught it from infected apes , perhaps when hunting them .
But it is not clear whether the gorillas are infecting one another , or being repeatedly infected and reinfected by another species of animal , perhaps a bat .
Bermejo's team has been studying a group of western gorillas in the Lossi Sanctuary in northwest Republic of Congo .
" By 2002 we had identified 10 social groups with 143 individuals , " they write .
In 2001 and 2002 , several outbreaks of Ebola had begun killing people along the Gabon - Congo border .
By October 2002 , the researchers had found 32 dead gorillas , and of the 12 they tested for Ebola , nine were positive . " [ Bermejo ] knew these animals individually , and in the course of three months they all died , " says Dr Peter Walsh , an ecologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , who worked on the study .
Eventually the researchers counted 221 dead gorillas .
Based on what they and other experts knew , Walsh extrapolated what the total impact must be to come up with the estimate of 5500 gorillas killed by Ebola in that area .
He says no one knows precisely how many gorillas are in the world and how many have died .
" But I know what 's the typical mortality rate in those areas that are affected .
It 's an educated guess .
A quarter of the gorillas in the world have died from Ebola in the last 12 years .
It 's huge , " Walsh says .
" Add commercial hunting to the mix , and we have a recipe for rapid ecological extinction , " the researchers write .
Their report supports a study published in July that showed gorillas were spreading the virus within their social groups .
" Our work is complementary to that ; we have shown it is spreading between groups , " Walsh says .
Walsh says gorilla groups share territories , often eating fruit from the same tree , although at different times .
Faeces from a sick gorilla could easily infect other gorillas .
Gorillas and chimpanzees also touch and handle the bodies of other apes when they find them , something known to transmit Ebola between humans .
"
The issue here is that there is a certain amount of work that needs to be done to take these vaccines that already exist and put them into gorillas , " Walsh says .
Is it a better mousetrap ?
Probably not .
But it 's pretty dang cool , and any hack that calls for a solenoid and a bucket as its main ingredients is alright in our book .
The mousetrap is triggered by infrared emitter / detector pairs , with the enclosure holding the electronics standing right over the bait .
When the mouse ( or other hapless victim ) interrupts one of the IR pairs , the electromagnet releases the bucket and the mouse is trapped .
We 're pretty convinced this is an optimal situation for the mouse , since he gets fed , does n't get his neck snapped , and ends up at a rave when it 's all over -- peep the video after the break to see what we mean .

Forget Jedi Knights and distant , computer - generated worlds - the new frontline in the battle against the Empire is Wisconsin , where fearless law enforcement operatives have been purging the streets of shifty - looking Galactic Stormtroopers bearing laser rifles .
Yup , the good burghers of Janesville can tonight sleep sounder in their beds after locals alerted officers to a possible armed robbery at the Ramada Inn .
The suspected armed perp was kitted out in full stormtrooper uniform and , as Sergeant Kay Nikolaus of the Janesville Police Department put it : " Apparently some people who saw him felt there was a threat . "
What they had n't seen , however , was the marquee outside the Ramada Hotel which carried a banner announcing the JVL - CON science fiction convention - a bit of a give - away .
Event organiser Joann Lewandowski told the Janesville Gazette : " It was kind of silly but kind of understandable . "
Officers duly advised the stormtrooper to " leave the plastic laser gun inside " .
Reports that they later busted Darth Vader for acting suspiciously with a light sabre in a local convenience store are unconfirmed . ®
The American people know that Bush 's war in Iraq is a disaster .
The punditry may fall for the Bush spin , but it 's not working on most people .
What Harry Reid said this week is what a lot of people are thinking .
Congress is finally catching up with the American people on Iraq , Bush never will :
A fight between the U.S. Congress and President George W. Bush over the Iraq war is set to come to a head this week when Democrats are expected to send him $ 100 billion to pay for continuing combat while setting timetables for withdrawing troops .
Bush has promised to veto any bill setting dates for removing U.S. combat soldiers from the Iraq war , now in its fifth year .
But when a Democratic - controlled panel of Senate and House of Representatives members meets on Monday to iron out differences between their respective bills , the product is expected to contain 2008 withdrawal dates .
Many lawmakers have been speculating those dates might be nonbinding , as sketched out by a Senate - passed bill .
" The longer we continue down the president 's path , the further we will be from responsibly ending this war , " said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , who on Thursday said the war in Iraq was " lost . "
On CNN this morning , Bill Schneider showed us this stat from their latest poll .
The American people have had it :
I 've been working on some ideas for procedural graphics recently .
For the non-programmers out there , that means graphics that are designed ( not just drawn ) by computer programs , not by humans .
I 've found a very productive ( and free ) way to experiment , using Python to write the code , and POV - Ray to draw the results .
The one drawback is that POV - Ray is not a real - time renderer .
I.e. it takes a few seconds to draw the scene , so you can't move around in it interactively .
That aside , using just a few scripts you get an efficient workflow with fast turnaround .
I 'm using Python more and more .
At this point , it 's my default language , because I 'm so productive in it , versus C++.
I 've got a custom vector math module and a simple renderer ( both co-written with blu ) that are written in C++ , but wrapped for Python , using SWIG .
At some point , I 'll switch over to the real - time renderer , but at this point using POV - Ray lets me concentrate on just the new procedural research .
The one Lisp feature I miss in Python is full - powered macros .
Sometimes you just need to generate code .
C++'s macros and template - metaprogramming are pathetic and horribly complicated by comparison .
That said , some really smart programmers , like Andrei Alexandrescu , have gone to heroic lengths to show the possibilities of template metaprogramming .
Unfortunately , you 're still limited by the fact that this is n't C++'s strong suit .
In the end , macro programming and template meta- programming are just special cases of metaprogramming .
Using a language that has strong support for text - manipulation ( like Python , or Perl ) , it 's not too difficult to just generate program text using the language .
Unfortunately , you do n't have the clean integration that Lisp 's use of S - expressions ( i.e. transparent access to the syntax tree ) provides .
POV - Ray defines the scene to be drawn using a simple textual scripting language .
I wrote a bunch of code to generate POV - Ray code for scene objects .
Apparently , there 's already a module out there to generate POV - Ray code using Python code , written by Simon Burton .
I like the way it 's designed ; it makes great use of Python 's keyword arguments .
The only drawback is that it generates the output file right away .
I 'd prefer to have a graph representing the scene , then have the option to output to a string , and then to a file .
Kind of retained - mode versus immediate mode .
At any rate , that module is lower - level than what I 'm doing , but it 's a neat substrate to layer on top of .
I 'll probably move my code on top of a modified version of this layer , and upload my changes to the base layer .
For some amazing graphics demos using procedural graphics , check out this stuff by the farbrausch demo - group : and of course , fr-025 : the.popular.demo
These demos were created with various version of their interactive procedural - generation tool , werkzeug
Of course , a lot of this stuff was done 15 years ago , in Lisp , by Karl Sims Finally , for some impressive games using procedural techniques , check out ABA Games by Kenta Cho .
He even provides source - code .
It 's written in D , but that 'll have to wait for another post .

EU states will have to embrace wind , solar and hydroelectric power
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said Europe was now able to lead the way on climate change .
The 27 EU states will each decide how they contribute to meeting a 20 % boost overall in renewable fuel use by 2020 .
The measures could include a ban on filament light bulbs by 2010 , forcing people to switch to fluorescent bulbs .
The bulbs last longer but more are more expensive to buy .
In another key measure , agreed on Thursday , EU leaders said they would cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20 % from 1990 levels by 2020 .
BBC world affairs correspondent Nick Childs says there is an air of real achievement in Brussels .
But , he says , the compromises over each nation 's share of the burden in reaching the targets have yet to be negotiated , meaning the hard decisions may still lie ahead .
' Crucial issue '
Mr Barroso described the agreement as historic , saying it was the most significant in which he had played a part .
" We can say to the rest of the world , Europe is taking the lead , you should join us in fighting climate change , " he said .
" It gives Europe a clear leadership position on this crucial issue facing the world . "
Looking ahead to the G8 summit of industrialised nations in June , Mr Blair said the European deal would give " a good chance " of getting the US , China and India on board too .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel , who chaired the two - day summit , also welcomed the package of binding measures .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The EU deal on climate change is totally unnecessary , given that Man is not causing global warming
Andrew Howlett , Manchester
Send us your comments Barroso defends ' gas guzzler '
" We can avoid what could well be a human calamity . "
The EU plan involves :
A 10 % minimum target on the use of bio-fuels in transport by 2020
A commitment to increase use of solar , wind and hydroelectric power
A possible ban on incandescent bulbs - with filaments - in offices , street lights and private homes by the end of the decade
EU officials are working on a directive that would compel the use of modern low - energy fluorescent light bulbs .
It could come into force as early as next year .
The Australian government announced similar plans to phase out old - style filament bulbs last month .
Nuclear concession
The statement on renewable energy sources allows flexibility in how each country contributes to the overall target for the EU .
EU leaders will negotiate on how the overall target is reached
The final text allayed their fears by stating that " differentiated national overall targets " for renewables would be set , " with due regard to a fair and adequate allocation taking account of different national starting points " .
In what is viewed as a concession to France , the text recognises the contribution of nuclear energy in " meeting the growing concerns about safety of energy supply and carbon dioxide emissions reductions " .
However , it also highlights safety concerns , stating that " nuclear safety and security " should be " paramount in the decision - making process " .
It is thought the EU could offer to extend its 20 % target for emissions cuts to 30 % if other heavy polluters like the US , China and India come on board .

In a major change of policy for a record label , EMI announced today that it will begin selling songs without copy protection through Apple 's iTunes music store .
The announcement was made at an event in London this lunchtime attended by Apple 's chief executive , Steve Jobs , and Eric Nicoli , his counterpart at EMI .
They announced that from May EMI 's entire music and video catalogue will be available without the anti-piracy technology that currently restricts how people can copy and listen to their digital music tracks .
" It 's clear to us that interoperability is important to music buyers and is a key to unlocking and energizing the digital business , " said Mr Nicoli .
Mr Jobs explained said the songs will cost 99 p , compared with the 79 p charged for DRM - protected versions .
They will be encoded at 256 kbps , making them better quality instead of 128 kbps used for the standard songs .
In February Mr Jobs called on the music labels to stop using this technology , called Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) , saying that he wanted iTunes to only sell DRM - free music .
EMI is the first label to heed Mr Jobs 's call .
DRM is controversial because it restricts how a song that has been legally purchased can be played .
For example , a track bought on iTunes and encoded with Apple 's FairPlay DRM will work on an iPod but not on rival digital music players .
News of EMI 's press conference sparked speculation that music by the Beatles may finally be available online .
Unlike almost all other major acts , the Beatles have so far declined to offer their songs for sale on the web .
However , this position does not appear to have changed .

THE WAR ON HYPE / America 's fleecing in the name of security
Rest easy , America .
As a response to the Sept. 11 attacks , the Princeton , N.J. , Fire Department now owns Nautilus exercise equipment , free weights and a Bowflex machine .
The police dogs of Columbus , Ohio , are protected by Kevlar vests , thank God. Mason County , Wash. , is the proud owner of a half - dozen state - of - the - art emergency radios ( never mind that they are incompatible with existing county radios ) .
All of these crucial purchases -- and many more like them -- were paid for with homeland security grants .
Does n't it make you feel more secure that $ 100,000 in such money went to fund the federal Child Pornography Tipline ?
That $ 38 million went to cover fire claims related to the April 2001 Cerro Grande fire in New Mexico ?
And that $ 2.5 billion went to " highway security " -- that is , building and improving roads ?
Since Sept. 11 , 2001 , Congress has appropriated nearly $ 207 billion to protect us from terrorism .
Total homeland security spending in 2006 will be at least $ 50 billion , split between the Department of Homeland Security and many other agencies , including , improbably , the Environmental Protection Agency , the Department of Commerce and NASA .
But far from making us more secure , the money is being allocated like so much pork .
While the Department of Homeland Security is finally making some improvements in how it allocates resources , much more needs to be done , especially by Congress .
Indeed , as the above examples suggest , states and cities are spending federal homeland security grants on pet projects that have little or nothing to do with security .
State and local officials fight over who will get the biggest share of the money , regardless of whether they have a legitimate claim to it .
Hence , of the top 10 grant recipients , only the District of Columbia also appears on a list of the 10 places most at risk of attack ( see table below ) .
The U.S. Virgin Islands receives more per capita in homeland security spending ( $ 104.35 ) than does Washington , D.C. ( $ 34.16 ) .
So do Guam ( $ 90.36 ) , the Northern Mariana Islands ( $ 54 ) , Wyoming ( $ 37.74 ) and American Samoa ( $ 37.54 ) .
And do n't think high - risk cities necessarily spend their money wisely :
The District of Columbia , for instance , used the first wave of homeland security aid as " seed money " for a computerized car - towing system Mayor Anthony Williams had promised for three years to help combat fraud by private towing companies .
The city also used $ 100,000 in homeland security money to fund the mayor 's popular summer jobs program .
When Congress is n't doling out cash indiscriminately , it 's overreacting to yesterday 's attacks instead of concentrating on cost - effective defenses against the most likely current threats .
In the days after Sept. 11 , Congress created the Transportation Security Administration , a 45,000 - employee bureaucracy that spends more than the FBI or Secret Service and accounts for 10 percent of the total homeland security spending .
The Transportation Security Administration , which is part of the Department of Homeland Security , has still not figured out a comprehensive plan to screen airplane cargo for explosives .
More to the point , the simple and relatively cheap solution of hardening cockpit doors has made Sept. 11 - style hijackings virtually impossible .
In the aftermath of the two attacks on the London subway system in July , lawmakers and lobbyists proposed increases from $ 100 million to $ 6 billion in funding to secure public transportation .
Yet if the London bombings teach us anything , it 's that throwing money at transit security is unlikely to have an impact .
After decades of combating Irish Republican Army terrorists , the London subway system is known to be one of the best protected in the world , but the large public investment in surveillance did not prevent the two terrorist attacks .
The second incident occurred even while the system was in maximum alert mode .
Experts agree that options are limited , if not nonexistent , for preventing such strikes .
So why spend money on it ?
If Congress were serious about homeland security , it would scrap the requirement that every state be guaranteed a part of the homeland security budget , abolish all grants to state and local governments , ban all earmarks from homeland security bills , and create better oversight for its homeland security spending .
These steps would root out wasteful spending and ensure that funds were allocated based on risk rather than politics .
In 2004 , the members of the independent Sept. 11 Commission stated that the current system is in danger of turning homeland security funding into pork - barrel spending and making security subsidies just another state entitlement program .
They suggested that homeland security funding be based strictly on an assessment of risks .
Their conclusions , mainly ignored by lawmakers , did cause public debate .
Greater public outrage about the deeply flawed spending process may have encouraged the Department of Homeland Security to become a stronger advocate for reform ideas unpopular in the pork - hungry Congress .
The greatest potential for reform today is coming from the department itself , which spends more than half of all homeland security funds .
Following the Sept. 11 Commission 's recommendations , it has started pushing for a complete overhaul of the grant formula and a more risk - based approach to homeland security in general .
A possible sign of that new attitude is the Transportation Security Administration 's recent decision to allow passengers to carry some knives onto airplanes .
It certainly is n't enough , but it 's a step in the right direction of focusing on actual risks .
Meanwhile , the department 's inspector general has produced several extensive reports exposing bad practices and suggesting ways to curb wasteful spending .
If Congress is waiting for guidance before it acts , it need wait no longer .
The operation lasted several hours
The woman had lost her nose , lips and chin after being savaged by a dog .
In the controversial operation , tissues , muscles , arteries and veins were taken from a brain - dead donor and attached to the patient 's lower face .
Doctors stress the woman will not look like her donor , but nor will she look like she did before the attack - instead she will have a " hybrid " face .
This is the first face transplant using skin from another person
Iain Hutchison , Barts and the London Hospital
Q&A : First face transplant
It has been technically possible to carry out such a transplant for some years , with teams in the US , the UK and France researching the procedure .
Skin from another person 's face is better for transplants as it will be a better match than skin from another part of the patient 's body , which could have a different texture or colour .
But the ethical concerns of a face transplant , and the psychological impact to the patient of looking different has held teams back .
Concerns relating to immunosuppression , psychological impact and the consequence of technical failure have so far prevented ethical approval of the procedure in the UK , though doctors here are fully able to perform transplants .
' Gravely disfigured '
The 38 - year - old French patient , from the French town of Valenciennes , underwent extensive counseling before her operation .
The operation took place over the weekend in Amiens , and is believed to have lasted approximately five hours
The French magazine Le Point reports that the tissues , muscles , arteries and veins needed for the transplant were taken from a multi- organ donor in the northern city of Lille , who was brain - dead .
The operations were carried out by a team led by Professor Bernard Devauchelle and Professor Jean Michel Dubernard .
In a statement , the hospital said the woman had been gravely disfigured in the attack in May this year .
She has been unable to speak or eat properly since .
It added that the woman - who wishes to remain anonymous - was in " excellent general health " and said the graft looked normal
It is not clear whether an individual could be left worse off in the event that a face transplant failed
Stephen Wigmore , British Transplantation Society
Live donors
Like any other transplant patient , the woman will have to take immunosuppressant drugs to help her body cope with the donated tissue .
Doctors working in the field say many could benefit from the procedure , including 10,000 burns victims in the UK .
Iain Hutchison , an oral - facial surgeon at Barts and the London Hospital , said : " This is the first face transplant using skin from another person . "
But there are medical , and ethical , concerns of facial transplants .
Mr Hutchison , who is chief executive of Saving Faces - the Facial Surgery Research Foundation , warned blood vessels in the donated tissue could clot , the immunosuppressants could fail - and would increase the patient 's risk of cancer . "
Mr Hutchison added there were ethical and moral issues around donating facial tissue .

" Where donors would come from is one issue that would have to be considered .
" The transplant would have to come from a beating heart donor .
So , say your sister was in intensive care , you would have to agree to allow their face to be removed before the ventilator was switched off . "
Stephen Wigmore , chair of British Transplantation Society 's ethics committee , said : " The extent of facial expression which will occur in the long term is unknown .
" The skin tends to promote rejection by the immune system very strongly and immunosuppression is likely to need to be kept at high levels for prolonged periods of time .
" It is not clear whether an individual could be left worse off in the event that a face transplant failed . "
Mr Michael Earley , a member of the Royal College of Surgeon 's facial transplantation working party , said : " If successful , this is a major breakthrough in facial reconstruction .
" It appears that this has been a partial face transplant incorporating the nose and lips ; therefore issues relating to similarity in appearance between donor and recipient are unlikely to be a major problem .
" We wish the patient and the team a successful outcome and look forward to learning more about the details of the procedure which could be a major step forward for the facially disfigured . "
As Nicole noted yesterday , Bush 's recess appointment for Sam Fox is pretty offensive .
But as ridiculous as the Fox stunt is , let ’s also not overlook the other two recess appointments the president made , which were just as bad .
For example , the president appointed Andrew Biggs to serve as the next deputy commissioner of Social Security , despite the fact that Biggs is an aggressive advocate of privatizing the Social Security system .
His nomination in November was considered ridiculous by Senate Democrats , and with this recess appointment yesterday , Bush effectively announced that he no longer wants to even consider negotiations over reforming the system .
And then there ’s Susan Dudley , who Bush appointed to oversee federal regulatory policy at the Office of Management and Budget , despite her anti-regulatory career at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University .
The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs holds sway over federal regulatory agencies like the EPA and helps set regulatory policy for a wide range of issues , from workplace safety to water quality ....
As the director of regulatory studies at the industry - backed Mercatus Center she has worked to oppose vital public health regulation as a “ hidden tax ” that hinders profits .
Some of her targets have included EPA health standards for smog , opposition to lower - polluting cars , opposition to air bags , and opposition to stronger regulations for arsenic in drinking water .
For some reason , the Senate had some concerns about her nomination .
The White House not only does n’t care about the concerns , it also decided it does n’t care about the constitutional nomination process .
The Bush gang knows no limits ; they have no shame .

Bending a Soccer Ball -- Mathematically
June 2006
A few weeks ago , Dana Mackenzie contacted me and asked if I could create some graphics for an article in American Scientist " The Topology and Combinatorics of Soccer Balls " , by Dieter Kotschick , that Dana was editing at this time .
Using various code pieces from the GuideBooks about tori , polyhedra , knots , Riemann surfaces , and the Weierstrass elliptic function ( especially Graphics : 2.1.5 , 2.3.2 , 2.3.4 , 2.3.7 , Solution 2.2 , 2.18 , Numerics : 1.12.2 , Symbolics : Solution 1.23 , 3.9 , 3.3 , 3.4 ) , I created the graphics shown in the article .
As steps towards the graphics , the following animations were created .
See also : the " Soccer to soccer " movie that shows the construction of a triple cover of a Riemann sphere .
( On Google Animations )
Smooth morphing a torus into double - covered soccer ball
The animation ( 3.8 MB , Quicktime .mov ) shows how a torus is continuously deformed into two concentric soccer balls of identical size and orientation .
No tearing of the surface occurs in this transition .
The typically black pentagons of a soccer ball are colored differently for easy visual tracking of the morphing .
The two final , staggered soccer balls are connected at four points at vertices of four of the twelve black pentagons .
More technically , the animation shows a smooth homotopy between the identity map and the map f( z ) , where
Here ( z ; , g 2 , g 3 ) is the Weierstrass 's elliptic function .
The function is a doubly - periodic function and its natural domain is a period parallelogram in the complex z - plane .
The period parallelogram is canonically mapped to a torus embedded in .
The map f( z ) maps a period parallelogram to the whole complex plane twice .
The complex plane is visualized through its Riemann sphere with a soccer tiling .
The parameters g 2 and g 3 are complicated algebraic numbers and are chosen to make four vertices of the soccer ball branch points of the inverse map .
The soccer ball tiling is oriented such that one vertex is the north pole , and one vertex of the pentagon that touches the North pole is on the Eastmost meridian .
Morphing a slit soccer ball into a torus
The animation ( 4.9MB , Quicktime .mov ) shows how to transform a soccer ball with slits along two of its edges into a torus .
Any two edges of equal type can be chosen .
The two edges used were chosen to obtain a not - too - large stretching / compression of the pentagons / hexagons on the resulting torus .
The morphing is based on a homotopy between a sphere and the stretched projection of the sphere onto a tube along a quarter circle ( in toroidal coordinates ) connecting the centers of the two slits .
The tube is glued together at its two end ( originally the two slits on the soccer ball surface ) to form a torus .
Smooth morphing of a trefoil knot into a double - covered soccer ball
The animation ( 6.8MB , Quicktime .mov ) shows a smooth homotopy between the identity map and the map f( z ) from above .
Three copies of the tiling from animation 1 are periodically repeated along the trefoil knot and then simultaneously mapped onto the Riemann sphere representing the soccer ball .
This means that in the final graphics three pairs of soccer balls are coinciding .
Folding a soccer ball from paper
The animation ( 3.1MB , Quicktime .mov ) shows how to fold a soccer ball from a piece of paper .
The ( final ) soccer ball is held fixed in space and the flat net of pentagons and hexagons is wound around it .
A ' breathing ' soccer ball
The animation ( 2.9MB , Quicktime .mov ) shows how the faces of a truncated icosahedron behave when the map → / is applied to its faces .
Depending on the sign of α , the faces either bulge in or out .
For α=1 , the round soccerball is recovered .
Moving a trefoil knot surface into hexa soccer ball
The animation ( 5.3MB , Quicktime .mov ) shows another possibility to create a soccer ball from a trefoil knot with appropriate tiling .
The elements of the tiling on the trefoil knot are first moved radially away from the knot and are then moved ( and simultaneously shrunk ) towards their position on the soccer ball according to the above map f( z ) .

It was the second conviction for Ahmet Turk in a week
A court in Diyarbakir said Ahmet Turk 's use of " Sayin " - meaning " esteemed " - implied respect for Ocalan .
Ocalan is serving a life sentence after he was found guilty of treason for leading the Kurdish armed campaign in which more than 30,000 people died .
Ahmet Turk leads a pro-Kurdish party .
He is reportedly considering an appeal .
The term " Sayin " is also sometimes translated simply as " Mr " .
Ahmet Turk was sentenced by the court on a charge of supporting a criminal in a speech he made in January 2006 .
It was the second conviction for the leader of the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party ( DTP ) in seven days .
Last week , Ahmet Turk - alongside with a DTP deputy leader - was sentenced to 18 months in prison for distributing party materials in the Kurdish language .
Turkish law allows distribution of political literature only in Turkish .
' Harassment campaign '
Tuesday 's ruling against Ahmet Turk is the latest in a wave of legal proceedings against his party , the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Istanbul says .
Abdullah Ocalan was captured in 1999
According to one tally , more than 50 DTP members of the pro-Kurdish DTP have been arrested and at least seven senior officials charged in less than a fortnight , our correspondent says .
Party officials argue they are victims of a sustained campaign of harassment , saying the authorities are trying to close the party down before a general election later this year .
The DTP campaigns for greater cultural and political rights for Turkey 's large Kurdish population , our correspondent says .
But she says the party is viewed with deep suspicion by Turkish nationalists , who argue it is closely tied to the Kurdish separatist cause .
Party leaders insist they support a united Turkey and an end to violent conflict .
NASHVILLE -- Lillie Mae Bradford is downright proud of her criminal record , but she would n't mind an official pardon .
The 77 - year - old woman from Montgomery , Ala. , got arrested for disorderly conduct in 1951 for walking to the front of a bus and asking for a transfer .
Black passengers were not allowed up front then .
" I thought to myself , ' If you do n't stand up for your rights now , you never will , ' " she recalled .
Long after the South 's segregation laws were declared unconstitutional , charges against Bradford and other blacks have remained on their records .
But that could change as some Southern states move to offer pardons to those convicted of acts of civil disobedience during the civil rights movement .
Last year , Alabama became first state to pass the Rosa Parks
Act , which gives people the option of having their records expunged , and Tennessee 's version won final approval in the Legislature yesterday and awaits the governor 's signature .
A similar measure failed in Florida .
" Unlawful assembly , disorderly conduct , refusal to move -- all of these were catchall charges under Jim Crow , " said Representative Thad McClammy , a black Montgomery Democrat who sponsored the Alabama law .
" A lot of these followed individuals throughout their lifetime , and they should n't be criminalized . "
Bradford , a retired school custodian , knows that having her record cleared now wo n't have any real effect , but she wants to apply for a pardon certificate anyway .
" I want to have it removed , frame it , and put it on the wall , " Bradford said .
" It will show I was arrested fighting for my rights . "
The Alabama law grants a pardon , but sends the criminal record to the state archives to be used in museums or for other educational purposes .
Tennessee 's proposal would allow a person to have his or her record destroyed , unless that person requests it be preserved for public display .
Both states also would allow posthumous pardons .
That could apply to Parks , whose arrest in 1955 for refusing to give up her seat to a white man on a Montgomery , Ala. , bus led to the Montgomery bus boycott , which established the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as a national figure .
Parks died in 2005 .
McClammy said he plans to contact Parks ' s estate about a pardon for her .

Gabriele Renzi :
che bello , mi distraggo per un po ’ e Microsoft , AOL e Digg adottano OpenID , mentre phpbb e wordpress ammiccano tramite mod e plugin .
Tim Bray :
Unless I ’m missing something .
For a coincidence ( I really do n't remember what drove me to do it ) , a while ago I register to MyOpenID and so now I can identify myself as piccinini .
myopenid.com and , trough delegation , as superfluo.org .
which , if no other , is pretty cool ( in response to Tim Bray 's What Could I Use It For Today ?
question ;-) ) .
But I 'm missing something about OpenID too and I 'm going to share these doubts with my readers ( have I readers ??!! ) .
A short story : I discovered OpenID about 6 month ago while I was evaluating authentication methods for a new public web application .
It immediately appeared to me as a very clever and exciting idea so I would be happy to adopt it .
From another side , I wanted to follow a REST architectural style and these two requisites seemed to me very hard to conciliate and so , having already enough problems in my ToDo list , I gave up with OpenID .
Back to present , I still retain that it's a great idea but I wonder how can it be used RESTfully .
Let me explain why in 4 steps :
to obey the RESTful principles your application should be stateless ; this means that you have n't a user session where to save authentication credentials ; this , in turn , implies that you have to authenticate every request ; if Open Id is part of the game , this means that for every request you have to contact an Open Id server to check the user credentials .
In my opinion this is impracticable in most of the real situations .
Obviously I could be completely wrong , am I ?
In such case , how is it possible to use OpenID in a RESTful way ?
Back when I did my first evaluation I searched quickly ( very very quickly , honestly speaking ) but found nothing .
White House : Do Vermont impeachment resolutions occur monthly ?
Ron Brynaert
Published : Wednesday April 25 , 2007 Print This Email This Deputy Press Secretary Dana Perino mocked impeachment motions being undertaken by a Democratic Congressman and Vermont 's state senate during a White House press briefing Wednesday afternoon .
" Now that the word ' impeachment ' has popped up in DC or elsewhere in the country , how seriously does the administration take those calls ? "
Perino was asked by a White House correspondent .
" How seriously do we take Representative Kucinich's --" said Perino before being cut off by the reporter , who noted , " Well , there 's that and the decision by the assembly in Vermont . "
Perino responded , " The assembly of the what ? "
" In Vermont , the resolution by -- in the state of Vermont , " the reporter informed her .
Perino said that she was unaware that Vermont 's state senate had voted to pass the symbolic resolution to get Congressional members to pursue Articles of Impeachment against President Bush and Vice President Cheney for their roles in such issues as the hyping of false WMD intelligent before , during and after the invasion of Iraq , presidential signing statements , and the US Attorney firings .
" Oh , I did n't even know there was a resolution in the state of Vermont , " Perino said .
" Is that a monthly occurrence ?
You know , I do n't know .
The president and the vice president have served honorably , and I do n't think there 's any merit to those impeachment claims . "
Perino concluded the briefing before responding to the follow - up questions : " Would you rather have anyone than Kucinich call for impeachment ?
Is there anyone else you 'd rather have than Kucinich ? "
Later this afternoon , Vermont 's House rejected the impeachment resolution .
" On a roll call vote of 60 - 87 , the House voted against the resolution that the Senate passed last week , " the Rutland Herald reports .
" That vote came as hundreds of supporters of the resolution were gathered at the Statehouse to lobby for the measure 's passage . "
On Tuesday , RAW STORY reported on Kucinich 's impeachment actions ( link ) , and a story about Californian Progressives pushing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to put impeachment back on the table can be read at this link .
Excerpts from Rutland Herald article : # Rep. Thomas Koch , R - Barre Town , was the first legislator to speak out against the resolution on the floor Wednesday .
Passing the resolution would add to the acrimony of modern politics and not make our troops any safer ,  he said .
 One of the lessons we learned from the Clinton impeachment is that it should not be treated lightly ,  Koch said .
 It ought to be reserved for the most egregious , most urgent high crimes and misdemeanors .
It should not be about whether or not you support the president or the war . 
Rep. David Sunderland , R- Rutland Town , questioned if Bushs alleged misdeeds rose to the level of impeachment .
To prove his point , he referenced congressional testimony indicating that the president has the right to wiretap terrorists  and read statements from prominent Democrats on the threat Saddam Hussein posed to the world .
 I dont think it is the intent to impeach these other individuals based on statements made and actions taken based on the best information available at the time ,  Sunderland said .
Democrats siding with House Speaker Gaye Symington in opposing the measure included Rep. David Deen of Westminister .
He noted that while he does not support this administration ,  the current hearings and investigations in the U.S. Congress are working .
… because he did n’t get the government ’s permission .
Roger Bean , 60 , was arrested on Tuesday and held on a $ US6,000 bond .
Bean performed denture fittings and made false teeth in his garage , charging just $ US200 for a full set of dentures , a procedure that typically costs more than $ US2,000 , authorities said .
But he was not licensed to practice in Florida .
Palm Beach County Sheriff ’s detective Don Zumpano said there were “ health risks with operating this type of facility outside of your house ” , adding that Bean ’s workspace was “ filthy ” .
Neighbours and clients , however , praised Bean for saving them thousands of dollars .
Whether it be by learning from questions asked by friends they held internationally , like “ Can you Buy Crest Whitening in the UK “ , and applying that to their own needs , or through obtaining dentures from the man in question .
Ron St. Mary , 73 , head of the neighbourhood crime watch , said Bean is no criminal .
“ He ’s helping the old people who do n’t have a few dollars , ” he said .
“ I think the world of him . ”
Truthfully , he was n’t quite a dentist .
Much like the hair - braiders , Bean was simply providing a service that some dentists provide , that does n’t really require the full training a dentist requires , for a much smaller fee .
Nor did anyone think he was a licensed dentist , if he was working out of his “ filthy garage ” .
But consumers understood that he could fit them for dentures for $ 200 , while “ real ” dentists would charge 10 times as much .
Now , I ’m not sure how much training it really takes to fit a mold and put together some dentures .
But I did n’t hear any information in this story that suggests customers were complaining .
What I do know , however , is that to become a dentist like those that work at cosmetic dentist San Diego is much more in - depth than just fitting dentures .
You learn enough to be entrusted with prescribing medicine and administering anesthesia , something that Bean did not do .
However , if you are thinking about getting dentures , then you might want to take a look at something like this dentures nyc here .
When you hear about something like this , you have to ask yourself who is helped .
People who need dentures do n’t seem to benefit .
On the contrary , it ’s dentists , who have now shut down a competitor and can charge 10 times what he charged for the same service .
Who benefits from licensing ?
Is it the consumer ?
Nope… Milton Friedman laid it out quite succinctly :
State licensing rules limits entry into the professions , thereby allowing professionals to charge higher fees than if competition were more open .
That ( more than the public interest ) is why professionals love licensing .
Roger Bean ’s methods were not the correct way to achieve success in dentistry .
A legitimate business may want to consider using the services of a dental marketing company to help support and sustain growth .
You can learn more about marketing strategies for dentists online , and avoid falling to the pitfalls exhibited by Roger Bean ’s demise .
While you may think that stopping Roger Bean protects the public , I ’d ask you to look at those old people who ca n’t afford $ 2000 for dentures .
Does stopping Bean really help them ?
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - A suicide bomber killed eight people in the Iraqi parliament on Thursday , brazenly penetrating to the heart of Baghdad ’s Green Zone to launch the deadliest strike yet in the heavily fortified compound .
Defying a two - month - old U.S. - Iraqi security crackdown , the bomber slipped through multiple armed checkpoints to reach the heart of the zone , a 10 sq km ( 4 sq miles ) area housing parliament , government offices and many embassies .
U.S. military spokesman Major - General William Caldwell said initial reports showed eight had been killed and 20 wounded in the blast which tore through a cafe where lawmakers were having lunch .
State television said three of the dead were lawmakers .
Caldwell said the blast bore the hallmarks of Sunni Islamist al Qaeda , resurgent in recent weeks despite the crackdown by tens of thousands of Iraqi and U.S. troops .
Footage of the blast broadcast on Iraq ’s al - Hurra television station showed a Shi’ite MP being interviewed when suddenly a loud blast sent him ducking for cover .
Clouds of dust and debris swirled through the building as people shouted and tried to make their way out down stairwells .
U.S. President George W. Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki , who is on a trip to the Far East , condemned the attack on the parliament , housed in a former conference centre .
“ It reminds us though that there is an enemy willing to bomb innocent people in a symbol of democracy , ” Bush said .
A truck bomb also killed at least seven people on Sarafiya bridge in northern Baghdad , a main artery linking east and west Baghdad , destroying most of the steel structure and sending several cars plunging into the River Tigris below .
How explosives were smuggled into the Green Zone is likely to be the focus of an investigation .
They would have had to pass through an outer checkpoint manned by U.S. and Iraqi troops and multiple inner checkpoints guarded by security contractors and foreign troops that are part of the U.S. - led coalition .
Iraqi military spokesman Brigadier General Qassim Moussawi , said it appeared to have been a well - planned operation that had taken advantage of “ a deficiency in one of the security points ” .
A review of procedures would need to be carried out , he said .
WHO HAD ACCESS ?
Entry to the conference centre is restricted to accredited parliamentary staff , deputies , security guards and journalists .
Only MPs , police and kitchen staff can access the cafeteria .
Two Shi’ite lawmakers said the metal detector used at the VIP entrance was working , but a Sunni legislator said when he arrived there was a power cut and bags were being manually searched .
A Reuters cameraman said the scanner at a second entrance used by staff and journalists was operating .

“ We are trying to backtrack all the systems to see how somebody was able to get a suicide vest in ... we are looking at who had access there , ” Caldwell told Reuters by telephone .
The U.S. military said this month that two explosives vests were found in the zone .
A suspected third vest was known to have been missing and a hunt was launched to find it .
An Iraqi official said another suspected bomb had been found nearby and detonated .

The SITE Institute , a private U.S. organisation that tracks militant activity , questioned media reports that al Qaeda had claimed responsibility for the attack , saying the claim had been posted on a Web site not used by the group .
A Reuters cameraman said the blast took place at the cashier ’s register in the cafe , near parliament ’s assembly hall .
“ I saw a ball of fire and heard a huge , loud explosion .
There were pieces of flesh floating in the air , ” said the cameraman , who was lightly wounded in the arm .
Militants have rarely carried out attacks inside the zone , although it has come under increasing rocket and mortar attack .
A rocket landed close to a building where Maliki and U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon were speaking last month .
In the worst previous bomb attack in the zone , two al Qaeda bombers killed five people , including three Americans , in 2004 .

How to Ace a Job Interview
Job interviews are a tough nut to crack .
You have a short period of time to convince total strangers that you ’re the right candidate for them .
Follow the tips below and your interview may end with a job offer .
1 ) Be Humble
No one likes a pompous ass !
A recent mistake I ’ve witnessed is trying to exude confidence but instead coming across as a cocky know it all .
Be sure to convey your knowledge and experience but do n’t turn them off by acting as though you ’re the best thing that ’s ever happened to your industry .
2) Be Google - Proof
The inevitable question always follows an interview , “ Has anyone Googled them yet ? ”
Do n’t share anything online that you would n’t want a prospective boss to know .
I know of several cases where a promising applicant ruined their chances of being hired by details they revealed on their website .
3 ) Be Honest
If you do n’t know the answer to a question , just say so .
If they ask you to rate yourself on certain skills , keep it real .
Otherwise they ’ll probe further and you ’ll lose credibility once they break through the facade .
4 ) Know Yourself
My boss always asks some variation of the question , “ What 5 words best describe you ” or “ What 5 words would your previous boss use to describe you . ”
Who do you think comes across better , someone who can list off their strengths right away or someone who stares at the wall trying to figure out how to explain who they are ?
Make sure you can back your up claims , read the next tip for more on this .
5 ) Always Know Why
An answer to a question often leads to another question .
If you make a claim about yourself or your skills , make sure you can explain your answer to the interviewer .
If you say “ Java is the best development language hands down ” but ca n’t come up with a reason for your opinion then you ’re just full of hot air .
6 ) Share the Love
It ’s important to figure out who the decision maker is in a group interview and sell yourself to them .
However , avoid addressing all your answers and face time to them .
What if you picked the wrong person ?
Or what if the boss will only hire based on a consensus from the team ?
For example , after a recent interview , our boss left it up to the three team leads whether we wanted the candidate .
7 ) Keep Skeletons in the Closet
Beware questions like “ Describe your worst job ever ” or “ Tell me about a bad experience you had with a co-worker or customer and how you handled it . ”
Keep the answer short , to the point , and free of bad mouthing .
Rambling on about your former boss or complaining about a previous co-worker puts a negative spin on things and may bring up questions in the minds of your interview panel .
8 ) Curb Appeal
Show off your skills .
Provide a link to your web - based portfolio before the interview and make sure you reference it during the interview as well .
You ’ll have a limited amount of face time ; give your prospective employer a chance to review what you ’re capable of both before and after the interview .
9 ) Go on the Offensive
End the interview with questions of your own .
In addition to answering your questions it reminds the interviewers that you ’re a valuable asset who is evaluating them as well .
Suddenly they are trying to sell themselves to you , not a bad way to end the interview .
10 ) Make a Connection
Make use of any personal details you pick up on during the interview .
As you shake everyone ’s hand on the way out bring up these tidbits and it will stick in their head .
Wish them well with their new baby son Joshua or good luck on their upcoming project .
They ’ll notice your attention to detail and by human nature will appreciate the kind gesture .
There you have it , 10 tips to help you nail the interview for the job you always wanted .

Scientists have turned water into ice in nanoseconds , which means really , really fast .
That 's not the most interesting part , though .
The ice is hotter than boiling water .
The experiment was done at the Sandia National Laboratories ' huge Z machine , which generates temperatures hotter than the sun ( setting a record here on Earth ) and where researchers test what we know about those plain vanilla " phases " in textbooks : solid , liquid and gas .
" The three phases of water as we know them — cold ice , room temperature liquid , and hot vapor — are actually only a small part of water ’s repertory of states , " said Sandia researcher Daniel Dolan .
" Compressing water customarily heats it .
But under extreme compression , it is easier for dense water to enter its solid phase [ ice ] than maintain the more energetic liquid phase [ water ] . "
Ice is odd .
Most things shrink when they get cold , and so they take up less space as solids than as liquids .
But regular ice , of course , takes up more space than water .
A simple experiment of putting a ( preferably cheap ) full water bottle in the freeze overnight will demonstrate this .
In the new experiment , however , the volume of " water shrank abruptly and discontinuously , consistent with the formation of almost every known form of ice except the ordinary kind , " according to a Sandia statement Thursday .
Apparently , there are at least 11 other types of ice that most of us do n't know about .
They 're classified by how they behave at certain temperatures and pressures .
You might have heard of one : Supercooled water can be below 32 degrees but not frozen .
Problem is , scientists do n't know the specifics of all these states .
Hence the Sandia research .
Dolan said the work " helps us understand materials at extreme conditions . "
He was surprised by how quickly the water froze .
Rapid compression — around 70,000 times normal atmospheric pressure in a tiny fraction of a second — caused the rapid freezing , he figures .
When the pressure was relieved , the ice melted .
" Apparently it ’s virtually impossible to keep water from freezing at pressures beyond 70,000 atmospheres , " Dolan said .
That 's good to know , for people who are trying to solve water 's many mysteries .
NO ONE seems to care about the upcoming attack on the World Trade Center site .
Why ?
Because it wo n’t involve villains with box cutters .
Instead , it will involve melting ice sheets that swell the oceans and turn that particular block of lower Manhattan into an aquarium .
The odds of this happening in the next few decades are better than the odds that a disgruntled Saudi will sneak onto an airplane and detonate a shoe bomb .
And yet our government will spend billions of dollars this year to prevent global terrorism and ... well , essentially nothing to prevent global warming .
Why are we less worried about the more likely disaster ?
Because the human brain evolved to respond to threats that have four features -- features that terrorism has and that global warming lacks .
First , global warming lacks a mustache .
No , really .
We are social mammals whose brains are highly specialized for thinking about others .
Understanding what others are up to -- what they know and want , what they are doing and planning -- has been so crucial to the survival of our species that our brains have developed an obsession with all things human .
We think about people and their intentions ; talk about them ; look for and remember them .

That ’s why we worry more about anthrax ( with an annual death toll of roughly zero ) than influenza ( with an annual death toll of a quarter - million to a half - million people ) .
Influenza is a natural accident , anthrax is an intentional action , and the smallest action captures our attention in a way that the largest accident does n’t .
If two airplanes had been hit by lightning and crashed into a New York skyscraper , few of us would be able to name the date on which it happened .
Global warming is n’t trying to kill us , and that ’s a shame .
If climate change had been visited on us by a brutal dictator or an evil empire , the war on warming would be this nation ’s top priority .
The second reason why global warming does n’t put our brains on orange alert is that it does n’t violate our moral sensibilities .
It does n’t cause our blood to boil ( at least not figuratively ) because it does n’t force us to entertain thoughts that we find indecent , impious or repulsive .
When people feel insulted or disgusted , they generally do something about it , such as whacking each other over the head , or voting .
Moral emotions are the brain ’s call to action .
Although all human societies have moral rules about food and sex , none has a moral rule about atmospheric chemistry .
And so we are outraged about every breach of protocol except Kyoto .
Yes , global warming is bad , but it does n’t make us feel nauseated or angry or disgraced , and thus we do n’t feel compelled to rail against it as we do against other momentous threats to our species , such as flag burning .
The fact is that if climate change were caused by gay sex , or by the practice of eating kittens , millions of protesters would be massing in the streets .

The third reason why global warming does n’t trigger our concern is that we see it as a threat to our futures -- not our afternoons .
Like all animals , people are quick to respond to clear and present danger , which is why it takes us just a few milliseconds to duck when a wayward baseball comes speeding toward our eyes .
The brain is a beautifully engineered get - out - of - the - way machine that constantly scans the environment for things out of whose way it should right now get .
That ’s what brains did for several hundred million years -- and then , just a few million years ago , the mammalian brain learned a new trick : to predict the timing and location of dangers before they actually happened .
Our ability to duck that which is not yet coming is one of the brain ’s most stunning innovations , and we would n’t have dental floss or 401 ( k ) plans without it .
But this innovation is in the early stages of development .
The application that allows us to respond to visible baseballs is ancient and reliable , but the add - on utility that allows us to respond to threats that loom in an unseen future is still in beta testing .
We have n’t quite gotten the knack of treating the future like the present it will soon become because we ’ve only been practicing for a few million years .
If global warming took out an eye every now and then , OSHA would regulate it into nonexistence .

There is a fourth reason why we just ca n’t seem to get worked up about global warming .
The human brain is exquisitely sensitive to changes in light , sound , temperature , pressure , size , weight and just about everything else .
But if the rate of change is slow enough , the change will go undetected .
If the low hum of a refrigerator were to increase in pitch over the course of several weeks , the appliance could be singing soprano by the end of the month and no one would be the wiser .
Because we barely notice changes that happen gradually , we accept gradual changes that we would reject if they happened abruptly .
The density of Los Angeles traffic has increased dramatically in the last few decades , and citizens have tolerated it with only the obligatory grumbling .
Had that change happened on a single day last summer , Angelenos would have shut down the city , called in the National Guard and lynched every politician they could get their hands on .
Environmentalists despair that global warming is happening so fast .
In fact , it is n’t happening fast enough .
If President Bush could jump in a time machine and experience a single day in 2056 , he ’d return to the present shocked and awed , prepared to do anything it took to solve the problem ..
The human brain is a remarkable device that was designed to rise to special occasions .
We are the progeny of people who hunted and gathered , whose lives were brief and whose greatest threat was a man with a stick .
When terrorists attack , we respond with crushing force and firm resolve , just as our ancestors would have .
Global warming is a deadly threat precisely because it fails to trip the brain ’s alarm , leaving us soundly asleep in a burning bed .

It remains to be seen whether we can learn to rise to new occasions .
Work on the world ’s first human - made species is well under way at a research complex in Rockville , Md. , and scientists in Canada have been quietly conducting experiments to help bring such a creature to life .
Robert Holt , head of sequencing for the Genome Science Centre at the University of British Columbia , is leading efforts at his Vancouver lab to play a key role in the production of the first synthetic life form — a microbe made from scratch .
The project is being spearheaded by U.S. scientist Craig Venter , who gained fame in his former job as head of Celera Genomics , which completed a privately - owned map of the human genome in 2000 .
Dr. Venter , 59 , has since shifted his focus from determining the chemical sequences that encode life to trying to design and build it : “ We ’re going from reading to writing the genetic code , ” he said in an interview .
The work is an extreme example of a burgeoning new field in science known as synthetic biology .
It relies on advances in computer technology that permit the easy assembly of the chemical bits , known as nucleotides , that make up DNA .
Several scientific groups are trying to make genes that do not exist in nature , in hopes of constructing microbes that perform useful tasks , such as producing industrial chemicals , clean energy or drugs .
Dr. Venter and his colleagues are pushing the technology to its limits by trying to put together an entirely synthetic genome .
“ We have these genetic codes that we have been determining , so part of the proof [ that they encode an organism ] is reproducing the chromosome and seeing if it produces the same result , ” he said .
The Venter team is starting small , working to construct a simpler version of the bacteria known as Mycoplasma genitalium , a common resident of the human reproductive tract .
They hope to determine the minimum number of genes required to breathe life into an organism .
M. genitalium is a single - cell bacterium with just one chromosome and 517 genes .
But the Venter team is paring the recipe down and believes their version will be able to survive with as few as 250 to 400 genes — each of which they are making themselves , one chemical piece at a time .

When the February issue of Wired Magazine debuted with a new logo , we explained inside the magazine that it “ obeys the Law of Optical Volumes . ”
We were being coy –many readers went scurrying to Wikipedia and Google to investigate this curious law , only to find … nothing .
Here ’s the skinny :
The Law of Optical Volumes is Wired creative director Scott Dadich ’s term for a typography rule that governs the spacing of characters within a font .
The theory behind it has been evident on newsstands for years now , thanks in part to typography guru Jonathan Hoefler , whose firm Hoefler & Frere - Jones designed Wired ’s new typefaces used throughout the magazine .
You can also see Hoefler ’s work at typography.com – or in The Wall Street Journal , Esquire and Martha Stewart Living .
And here ’s a definition :
The Law of Optical Volumes states that the area between any two letters in a word must be of equal measure throughout the word , and remain consistent throughout the body of text .
The Law boils down to the science of kerning .
In typography jargon , kerning is the act of adjusting the space between two letters to make words and sentences lay out more evenly .
For example in the word “ VAST , ” there is usually reduced space between the V and A , and maybe extra space between the S and T.
Otherwise the “ VA ” would seem too far apart and the “ ST ” would seem cramped .
The formal definition for a font includes not only the shape of each letter , but also a series of * kerning pairs * that specify a customized distance between certain pairs of letters , such as the “ Yo ” in “ You . ”
Without the adjusted spacing , these pairs appear too far apart or too close together .
Typographers strive to balance letters so that the area of space between each pair of letters is identical .
The premise is that human eyes unwittingly measure that area to decide how far apart each pair is .
If Scott were more of a geometry wonk , he ’d have dubbed it the Law of Optical Areas rather than volumes , but that does n’t sound as imposing .
Traditional fonts usually included several hundred kerning pairs .
Hoefler & Frere - Jones ’ fonts are super - fussy - they can include 10,000 pairs to get every combo of letters exactly right .
In the font example shown below , notice how the size of the yellow area between each pair of letters in the word “ colophon ” is adjusted to be the same .
The same goes for Wired ’s new logo .
It alternates between letters without and with serifs , yet the area between each pair of letters is about the same , thanks to the serifs on the I and E and lack thereof on the W , R and D .
This equivalence makes the logo easier to see and read across a crowded supermarket aisle .
The alternating fonts also make the letters seem to blink on and off as you read them from left to right , in emulation of digital ones and zeroes .
Unfortunately this advanced , scientific approach to font layout is still only available in ink on paper .
Web fonts in 2007 still do n’t have kerning pairs .
We do n’t know why .
To see and appreciate the Law in action beyond our logo , you ’ll need to pick up a copy of the magazine .
UPDATE : I 'm completely wrong !

McCain : Iraqi government can't order U.S. withdrawal David Edwards and Josh Catone
Published : Sunday May 13 , 2007 Print This Email This On NBC's Meet the Press this morning John McCain told host Tim Russert that the Democrats ' plan of setting a date for withdrawal from Iraq " would lead to ... an enormously challenging situation as a result . "
" But , Senator , " Russert countered , " the Iraqi parliament , a majority of the Iraqi parliament , has signed a petition asking for a date certain for withdrawal of American troops .
If the Iraqi parliament wants it , a majority in the Congress want it ... then why do you stand there and say , ' No , you can't have it ' ? "
McCain replied that he understands " that if the American people do n't continue to support this effort that [ the US ] will be forced to withdraw " but his job as a senator is to tell the American people that his assessment is that withdrawal would be " catastrophic . "
Staying in Iraq , he said , is the best course of action " in our nation 's national security interest . "
" But the duly elected people 's bodies , the U.S. Congress and the Iraqi parliament , say they want a troop withdrawal , " pressed Russert .
" That 's more than a poll .
Is n't that the voice of the people ? "
" Well , the -- as far as the Iraqi parliament is concerned , the Iraqi government obviously does n't feel that way , their -- the representatives in their government , " replied McCain , seemingly dismissing the Iraqi parliament 's ability to govern its own country .
" Second of all , " he continued , " there is some , a certain amount of domestic political calculations involved there in what the Iraqi , quote , ' parliament ' said .
The Iraqi parliament has their ability to , to voice their views , and I respect them . "
Later , when asked if he would be " in favor of a referendum amongst the Iraqi people to make a decision as to whether US troops should stay or leave , " McCain appeared to contradict himself .
" No , no more than I should - - would have a referendum in the United States of America as to whether Iraqi troops should leave , or whether we should be in or out of NATO , or any other issue .
The Iraqi government is an elected government , and they are functioning , " he said , implying that the parliament he had mocked earlier as able only to give opinions was fully functional .
The following video clips are from NBC's Meet the Press .
A transcript of the clip is below : SEN .
McCAIN : Are al - Qaeda being shoved out of Baghdad into areas outside of Baghdad ?
Yes .
And are there problems in those areas ?
Look , this is long and hard and difficult , and I 've said it for a long time .
And it 's no last throes , it 's no mission accomplished , it 's no few dead - enders .
It 's long and hard and tough .
We are experiencing some successes .
Do we have to experience more ?
Yes .
But to do what the Democrats want to do , and that 's set a date for withdrawal , even those who opposed the war from the beginning do n't think that that would lead to anything but an enormously challenging situation as a result .
MR .
RUSSERT : But , senator , the Iraqi parliament , a majority of the Iraqi parliament , has signed a petition asking for a date certain for withdrawal of American troops .
If the Iraqi parliament wants it , a majority in the Congress want it ...
SEN .
McCAIN : Mm-hmm .
MR. RUSSERT : ... then why do you stand there and say , " No , you can't have it " ?
SEN .
McCAIN : Because it 's my job to give my best estimate to the American people , no matter what the political calculations may be , as to what 's the best in our nation 's national security interest .
Young men and women are risking their lives as we speak in , in , in Iraq .
And I know that they will be in greater harm 's way if we withdraw from Iraq , as we keep debating over and over and over again .
And I know what 's best , in my mind , in my experience , in my knowledge , in my inspiration , as to what 's best for this country .
So political calculations such as polls , I understand that if the American people do n't continue to support this effort that we will be forced to withdraw .
But it 's also my obligation to tell the American people and my constituents in Arizona that I represent , what the consequences of failure will be ; and I believe they will be catastrophic .
MR .
RUSSERT : But the duly elected people 's bodies , the U.S. Congress and the Iraqi parliament , say they want a troop withdrawal .
That 's more than a poll .
Is n't that the voice of the people ?
SEN .
McCAIN : Well , the -- as far as the Iraqi parliament is concerned , the Iraqi government obviously does n't feel that way , their -- the representatives in their government .
Second of all , there is some , a certain amount of domestic political calculations involved there in what the Iraqi , quote , " parliament " said .
The Iraqi parliament has their ability to , to voice their views , and I respect them .
And I , as I say , I - - I 'll repeat again , I understand how democracies work .
I saw it in Vietnam .
I saw it in Vietnam .
.... MR .
RUSSERT : The Iraqi parliament says they want to take a two - month vacation while our men and women shed their blood .
SEN .
McCAIN : I am , I am unalterably opposed to it .
One of the real difficulties we face in this conflict , obviously , is whether the Maliki government will act as an inclusive government , and whether the Maliki government will do the things that are necessary to be done .
And I 'm very concerned about it .
All of us are very concerned about it .
This government has to pass the oil revenue sharing law .
This government has to pass de-Baathification .
They have to declare elections in the provinces so that Sunni , who now want to take part in the electoral process , can have their representatives .
MR .
RUSSERT : They 've had four years to do this .
SEN .
McCAIN : They have had this time , and they have done some things .
It took us about 100 and some years before we had a bloody civil war to decide the future of our country .
This is a fledgling democracy .
I 'm not , I 'm not making excuses for it , but they have not been in this business before .
And yet that does not change the fact that , in my view , unless they act , it could jeopardize what is already in jeopardy .
MR .
RUSSERT : Would you be in favor of a referendum amongst the Iraqi people to make a decision as to whether U.S. troops should stay or leave ?
SEN .
McCAIN : No , no more than I should -- would have a referendum in the United States of America as to whether Iraqi troops should leave , or whether we should be in or out of NATO , or any other issue .
The Iraqi government is an elected government , and they are functioning .
And so why we would need a , quote , " referendum " is no more necessary in this country as in that one .
Does the Maliki government have to act more effectively , more inclusively ?
Absolutely they do , and it's of great concern , and I think it 's one of the great vulnerabilities as we try to move forward and succeed there .
Now , what 's success ?
Economic , political and social progress , which can only be obtained in an environment of security .
Neighborhoods in Baghdad are safer .
They 're not safe , but they are safer than they were before .
And the government has to function more effectively , and then the Iraqi military and police take over those responsibilities as we gradually withdraw .
That 's the recipe for success .
.... SEN McCAIN : ... With this new strategy -- and it is a strategy , not a surge -- we have been able to see significant improvement .
Enough improvement ?
Probably not .
But at least we 're seeing some progress .
And our commanders on the ground are saying that the Iraqi military is functioning far more effectively , effective , and we are seeing progress there .
.... MR.
RUSSERT : General Petraeus said this : " Any student of history recognizes there 's no military solution to a problem like that in Iraq , to the insurgency of Iraq . "
SEN .
McCAIN : And , you know , I 've had many conversations with General Petraeus and I do n't want to put words in his mouth , but he 'll also tell you that history shows us , any student of history will tell , you that in -- if - - unless you have an environment of security for the people to try to live normal lives , and the economic , politically - - political and social environment is able to grow and flourish , then you are doomed to failure .
So , when you say it 's all we -- it 's all up to the Iraqis , that 's like saying a neighborhood that 's been taken over by gangs , it 's up to the people in the neighborhood .
We have to do whatever we can to provide them with an environment in which they can exist and begin to lead normal lives .
So Cheney goes to Australia and meets with John Howard who tells him that the Hicks case is killing him in Australia , and he may lose the next election because of it .
Hicks 's case is then railroaded to the front of the Gitmo kangaro court line , and put through a " legal " process almost ludicrously inept , with two of Hicks ' three lawyers thrown out on one day , then an abrupt plea - bargain , with a transparently insincere confession .
Hicks is then given a mere nine months in jail in Australia , before being set free .
Who negotiated the plea- bargain ?
Hicks ' lawyer .
Who did he negotiate with ?
Not the prosecutors , as would be normal , but Susan J. Crawford , the top military commission official .
Who is Susan J. Crawford ?
She served as Dick Cheney 's Inspector General while he was Defense Secretary .
Money quote :
As the deal developed in recent weeks , Air Force Col .
Morris Davis , the lead prosecutor for military commissions , and his team on the Hicks case were not in the loop .
Davis said he learned about the plea agreement Monday morning when the plea papers were presented to him , and he said the prosecution team was unaware that discussions had been taking place .
" We got it before lunchtime , before the first session , " Davis said at a news conference Friday night .
In an interview later , he said the approved sentence of nine months shocked him .
" I was n't considering anything that did n't have two digits , " he said , referring to a sentence of at least 10 years .
If you think this was in any way a legitimate court process , you 're smoking something even George Michael would pay a lot of money for .
It was a political deal , revealing the circus that the alleged Gitmo court system really is .
For good measure , Hicks has a gag - order imposed so that he will not be able to speak of his alleged torture and abuse until after Howard faces re-election .
Yes , we live in a banana republic .
It certainly is n't a country ruled by law .
It is ruled by one man and his accomplice .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Advocating the use of code coverage
I am somewhat fanatical about unit testing and code coverage .
The screen dumps to the right show the most recent results from running the unit tests in the core library of my hobby project [ footnote : sd ] .
As you can see , all my unit tests are passing and my code coverage right now is 100 % .
This library consists of 12,341 lines of algorithms , plus 5,819 lines of unit tests .
And yes , I 'm feeling rather smug about my code coverage being at 100 % . :-)
Code coverage is a controversial subject .
Gurus have been debating the related issues for decades .
I wo n't pretend to be one of those experts , but I see no reason not to pass along a few thoughts from my own experience in this area .
What is code coverage ?
A code coverage tool simply keeps track of which parts of your code get executed and which parts do not .
Usually , the results are granular down to the level of each line of code .
So in a typical situation , you launch your application with a code coverage tool configured to monitor it .
When you exit the application , the tool will produce a code coverage report which shows which lines of code were executed and which ones were not .
If you count the total number of lines which were executed and divide by the total number of lines which could have been executed , you get a percentage .
If you believe in code coverage , the higher the percentage , the better .
In practice , reaching 100 % is extremely rare .
Did I mention how smug I 'm feeling ? :-)
The use of a code coverage tool is usually combined with the use of some kind of automated test suite .
Without automated testing , a code coverage tool merely tells you which features a human user remembered to use .
Such a tool is far more useful when it is measuring how complete your test suite is with respect to the code you have written .
What should the coverage goal be ?
Some folks would say that a goal of 100 % coverage is pathological .
They have a point .
As you write more and more tests and your coverage number gets higher and higher , you start experiencing the law of diminishing returns .
Those last few percentage points are tough to hit .
It can take a lot of effort to come up with enough unit tests to get all the way to 100 percent .
Lots of successful projects have been done with test suites that cover only 85 - 95 percent of the code .
[ footnote : none ]
Others would argue that the goal should always be 100 % coverage and no less .
Personally , I would stop short of such a recommendation , but for this particular project of mine , getting full coverage has been worth the effort .
Raising the percentage
How did I get to 100 % ?
First , let me give credit to the fine tools I 've been using :
For my unit tests , I am using NUnit .
For measuring code coverage , I am using NCover .
For viewing the results , I am using NCoverExplorer .
For integrating all these things with Visual Studio 2005 , I am using TestDriven .
NET .
The truth is that 100 % coverage was not my goal .
I have generally tried to keep the percentage anywhere above 95 .
But every so often I would just add another unit test when I did n't feel like coding a new feature .
When I got to 99 % , I started wondering what it would take to get all the way to 100 .
Whatever your goal , the basic technique for increasing your code coverage is n't rocket science .
Here 's what I did :
Look at some code which is not being tested .
Think about how to reach that code .
If the code can be reached , write a test case to make it happen .
If the code can never actually be reached , then it 's not needed .
Remove the code and put in some kind of an assertion to make sure .
Repeat these steps until your coverage level is where you want it to be .
Forced code reviews
One of my favorite things about code coverage is that it forces you to look at your code .
All too often we write code and nothing but a compiler ever looks at it again .
In fact , were I to argue that everyone should have 100 % code coverage as their goal , I would build my argument on two main points :
1. Getting your code coverage to 100 % will force you to review the parts of your code which probably need to be looked at .
2 . If you just can't find a way to get your coverage to 100 % , there 's a good chance that the uncovered part of your code is simply wrong in some way .
I 'm too much of a pragmatist to make that argument , but it tempts me . :-)
In my case , code coverage forced me to look at my code and realize that some of my coding practices were n't very smart .
For example , consider the following snippet :
if ( condition1 )
{
return result1 ;
}
else if ( condition2 )
{
return result2 ;
}
else if ( condition3 )
{
return result3 ;
}
In this case , suppose that I know for certain that one of the three conditions ( condition1 , condition2 or condition3 ) must be true .
It should be impossible for the code to fall through all three of these if statements .
Unfortunately , my C# compiler does n't know that , and it gripes about the fact that not all code paths return a value .
So I append the following :
else
{
throw new Exception ( " Should Never Happen " ) ;
}
Now the compiler is happy , but my code coverage tool is not .
Unsurprisingly , the line which contains the string " Should Never Happen " never actually gets executed .
Throwing an exception is n't really the best way to handle a situation which should never happen .
That 's what assertions are for :
if ( condition1 )
{
return result1 ;
}
else if ( condition2 )
{
return result2 ;
}
else
{
Debug.Assert( condition3 ) ;
return result3 ;
}
Instead of checking for condition3 explicitly with an if statement , I simply assume that condition3 must be true when both condition1 and condition2 were found to be false .
And to be safe , I throw in a Debug .
Assert so in my non-release builds I will get a big ugly dialog box if the unthinkable happens and all three conditions are actually false .
Now I can get full code coverage of this snippet by simply writing unit tests which cause all three conditions to happen .
But increased code coverage of this snippet is not the only result of my efforts .
The other good news is that my revised snippet is simply better .
It is smaller and faster .
[ footnote : perf ]
Regression testing
Code coverage and automated testing go hand - in - hand .
In my experience , the most important benefit I have gained from applying these disciplines together is regression testing .
Regression testing is simply the act of testing to see if your code somehow got broken .
The code used to work , but now it does n't .
It has regressed .
When this lamentable situation happens , we want to know about it as quickly as possible .
All experienced developers know that even though every code change is well - intentioned , every code change carries the risk of consequences that were not intended .
Code tends to get brittle , and then it breaks when we try to bend it .
I cannot imagine trying to build a solid modeling engine without a comprehensive suite of automated tests .
For example , one of the most troublesome areas of my project is performing intersection operations on 3D objects .
When my app wants to drill a hole in a board , it constructs a cylinder , positions it inside the board , and performs a " subtract " operation .
In getting this code to work , I have seen a seemingly endless stream of special cases .
Very often when I fixed the code to handle a new situation , it broke something that was previously working just fine .
Without unit tests and code coverage to tell me when my code regressed , I suspect I would simply churn forever in an endless game of whack - a- mole .
Different circumstances
I suspect that now at least one of my readers is asking , " How can automated testing and code coverage possibly be important when neither of them is mentioned on The Joel Test ? " :-)
I 'll admit that automated testing and code coverage are more important for some projects than for others .
My library of computational geometry algorithms is a natural place to apply code coverage and automated testing .
Most of my test cases are very straightforward .
Create a 3D model of a 5 - inch cube .
Verify that the volume is 125 cubic inches .
Create a model of a 3 - inch cube .
Subtract it from the other one .
Verify that the resulting model 's volume is 98 cubic inches .
These are algorithms .
They do n't really have any outside dependencies .
They are either correct or they are not .
External dependencies and oddball technologies make automated testing harder :
I am currently not testing the GUI sections of my code , so I do n't have to complain about TestComplete not having WPF support yet [ footnote : aqa ] .
My library does n't use networking or I / O of any kind , so I do n't have to deal with setting up servers .
My code is all C# , so NCover just works well for me and I do n't have to wonder if there are any code coverage tools for T - SQL or VBA .
So I acknowledge that code coverage will not fit all scenarios quite as nicely as it fits mine .
If code coverage deserves to be on the Joel Test , it is certainly less deserving than something like source control .
I can imagine a situation where a smart team might choose not to do code coverage .
I cannot picture any team that chooses not to use source control without thinking of them all as clueless bozos .
Still , I believe that most of the time , anything you invest in automated testing will produce worthwhile returns .
[ footnote : invest ]
Fooling yourself
Every now and then , I meet somebody who thinks that a body of code is perfect if its unit tests all pass with 100 % code coverage .
This obviously is n't true .
Code coverage can only tell you how much of your code is being tested .
It can not tell you how much code you still need to write .
And in turn , some folks think that because 100 % code coverage cannot be understood to mean 100 % correctness , then code coverage is n't worth anything at all .
To me , that 's like saying we should never talk about the temperature outside because by itself it is not a reliable way of determining how nice the weather is .
Unit testing and code coverage are tools .
They provide us a way of increasing the quality of our code , but 100 % code coverage certainly does not mean 100 % code quality .
If you want a complete QA effort , one which offers you high confidence that your code is reliably doing whatever you want it to do , then unit testing and code coverage are just a small part of the story .
There are many other tools and techniques you should consider .
Covering without testing
For some parts of my code , I was diligent .
I wrote unit tests that were deliberately designed to exercise all the cases I could think of .
For example , I have some code that calculates the intersection of two 2D polygons .
One of my unit tests for this code contains a bunch of different situations involving two rectangles :
Two rectangles that are far apart
Two rectangles that share an edge
Two rectangles that share a vertex
Two rectangles that intersect with no overlapping edges and no shared vertices
Two rectangles , one inside the other , sharing part of an edge
Two rectangles , one inside the other , sharing part of two edges
Two rectangles , one inside the other , sharing part of three edges
Two rectangles that are really the same rectangle
Two rectangles , one inside the other , but they do n't touch
In this situation and several others like it , I practiced Test Driven Development .
I wrote the test cases first and then I wrote the implementation and worked on it until all the tests were green .
But I 'll confess that in other situations , I am not always so thorough .
Sometimes I write a unit test that does nothing but force some code to be executed with one simple case .
This makes my code coverage number look good , but it does n't really test my code very well .
For example , I have a method that takes a solid model and produces the data structures necessary for creating an animated display .
In my unit tests I call this method only once .
This method is n't really being exercised .
The edge cases are n't being explored .
I have n't written any abusive unit tests which try to cause this method to fail .
This trick is something I call " covering without testing " .
It 's better than nothing , since I do gain the benefits of some regression testing on that method .
But obviously the coverage is thicker in some places than in others .
My code coverage is 100 % , but the truth is that this particular method might be robust , or it might not .
I do n't really know .
And if you thought that example was bad ...
My code coverage is 100 % , but there are even worse skeletons in my closet .
Specifically , I know of one piece of code which is definitely not robust .
Furthermore , it 's probably an order of magnitude slower than it needs to be .
For the rest of this particular story , see my guest entry over on The Daily WTF which ran on 14 September 2006 .
Alex Papadimoulis was on vacation .
I was honored that he asked me to be guest editor for a day , so I wrote up something on a piece of my computational geometry code which is really quite heinous .
But hey , my code coverage is 100 % , right ? :-)
Bottom Line
Like I said , I am somewhat fanatical about automated testing and code coverage .
I enthusiastically recommend using them .
But use them wisely .
Testing guru Brian Marick said it best :
Code coverage tools are " only helpful if they 're used to enhance thought , not replace it " ( PDF ) .

Heck , lots of successful projects have been done with no code coverage discipline at all .

Private security contractor Blackwater opened fire in standoff with Iraq forces , paper to report RAW STORY
Published : Saturday May 26 , 2007 Print This Email This " Employees of Blackwater USA , a private security firm under contract to the State Department , opened fire on the streets of Baghdad twice in two days last week , and one of the incidents provoked an armed standoff between the security contractors and Iraqi forces , U.S. and Iraqi officials said , " the Washington Post will report on Sunday page ones , according to an advance copy of the article acquired by RAW STORY .
Excerpts : # A Blackwater guard shot and killed an Iraqi driver Thursday near the Interior Ministry , according to three U.S. officials and one Iraqi official who were briefed on the incident but spoke on condition of anonymity because of a pending investigation .
On Wednesday , a Blackwater - protected convoy was ambushed in Baghdad , triggering a furious battle in which the security contractors , U.S. and Iraqi troops and AH - 64 Apache attack helicopters were firing in a congested downtown area .
Blackwater confirmed on Thursday that its employees were involved in two shootings but said there were no casualties in either incident , according to a company official who declined to be identified because of the firm 's policy of not addressing incidents publicly .

Reduce your Linux memory footprint
A few tweaks can boost performance
A much - touted benefit of Linux is that it is more efficient than Microsoft® Windows® , and will therefore perform better on less than cutting - edge hardware .
This performance makes Linux a very attractive upgrade for the many people who have old Windows 98 - era boxes still sitting around that are no longer being treated to the latest and greatest software ( particularly security patches ) .
The truth of the matter , however , is that while the Linux kernel can still be configured to be reasonably small and efficient , as new computers have increased in power , many Linux desktop environments ( such as KDE and GNOME ) have added lots of features .
Consequently , the default install of most distributions offer a less than stellar level of performance when installed on older hardware .
The same is true of many modern applications also --
Web browsers such as Firefox and office suites such as OpenOffice are fully featured , but trying to run them on a machine with 128 MB of RAM can be a painful experience !
So what is the answer ?
Throw away all of your old hardware and upgrade ?
Install a Linux distribution from circa 1995 ?
( If you decide to go that route , I recall having a good experience with Linux - FT . )
Never fear : as those in the Linux community have known for years , a great strength ( some would say the great strength ) of the Linux kernel and Linux distributions in general lies in their ability to be customized .
This article delves into how you can tailor your Linux systems for better performance on modest hardware .
Thanks for the memory
In most cases , the single most important factor in desktop operating system performance is the amount of system memory available .
It 's all well and good to have a fast processor , but if there is n't enough physical memory to keep that processor utilized , the system will spend all its time shuffling data between physical memory and swap space ( a condition known as thrashing ) and the CPU will spend most of its time idle .
For older systems , therefore , adding extra memory is usually the easiest way to improve performance .
There are a number of reasons why this may not be possible , however , ranging from a lack of free slots , to a scarcity of affordable RAM for some systems ( particularly laptops or RAMBUS - based systems ) , to an understandable reluctance to spend more money on an aging system .
If you are unable or unwilling to upgrade your RAM , the next best thing is to reduce the RAM requirements on your system .
This article shows you five simple steps to memory nirvana for your Linux machine .
Step 1 : Choose the right desktop environment
Your single most important choice is the Linux distribution and desktop environment ( DE ) you 're going to install .
While these are two distinct choices , the choice of distribution can affect the choice of DE .
There is nothing stopping you from installing , say , Fluxbox on Ubuntu ; however , you 'll find that life is a lot easier if you simply use the default DE that comes with your distribution .
In the scenario in this article , the goal is to find a simple desktop - oriented distribution that is easy for new users .
I have started off with Ubuntu 6.10 , which comes with GNOME 2.16 .
For my base system , I have chosen an old machine with an 800MHz processor and 256MB of RAM .
I will execute each of my tests twice , once booting as normal with the full 256MB of RAM and once with mem=128 M appended to the kernel line , which forces the kernel to only recognize 128 MB of the physical memory .
This effectively allows me to examine both a 256MB machine and a 128MB machine without actually using a second physical machine ( or repeatedly physically removing the RAM chips from my machine and then putting them back in ) .
This kernel - line option provides a close enough approximation of how a 128 MB machine will behave ; note , however that if you really have only 128MB , you may experience additional complications -- for instance , with Ubuntu you must use an install disk different from the common one for machines with less than 192MB of RAM .
To get a base level of memory usage , I booted the system , logged in to the desktop , and started a terminal ( in the rest of this article , I 'll refer to this setup as my base level ) ; then I checked the amount of free memory using the free command , with the results as shown in Listing 1 .
Listing 1 .
Base level for Ubuntu on a 256MB machine
ubuntu # free total used free shared buffers cached Mem : 255988 231704 24284 0 6432 139292 -/+ buffers / cache : 85980 170008 Swap : 746980 0 746980
The first line indicates that , out of 256MB of RAM , 231MB is " in use . "
The next line shows us that while 231MB is being used , only 86 MB of this is actually being used by applications ; the rest is being used for buffers and cache .
The most important part of this listing for assessing performance is the Swap line ; this shows us that we are n't currently using any swap , which suggests that we do n't really have any memory problems at the moment .
The system is able to fit everything into physical memory without having to resort to slow , disk - based swap space .
Next , to get an idea of what the system would look like under normal day - to - day use , I fired up a Web browser ( Firefox 2.0 ) and pointed it to developerWorks , connected an instant messaging client ( Gaim ) to MSN , and used the file manager to browse to a folder and open a reasonably sized Microsoft Word - formatted document in OpenOffice .
( In the rest of this article , I 'll refer to this setup as my light usage level . )
Once everything had loaded , the output of the free command looked like Listing 2 .
Listing 2 . Light usage level for Ubuntu on a 256MB machine
ubuntu # free total used free shared buffers cached Mem : 255988 252196 3792 0 21276 87500 -/+ buffers / cache : 143420 112568 Swap : 746980 18676 728304
You can see that things are getting a little leaner in the memory department .
Now applications have used 143MB of physical memory , with the rest of being used for buffers ; in addition , the system now needs to make use of 18 MB of swap .
The system generally seemed quite usable under these light office task conditions , but there is n't much head room , and I would n't like to start doing anything more demanding , such as editing large digital photos or video , as the system would soon begin to crawl .
To get an idea of how the system would perform with only 128MB , I then rebooted and added mem=128 M to the kernel line , as I described above .
At the same base level state illustrated in Listing 1 , with 128MB of RAM I got the results shown in Listing 3 .
Listing 3 . Base level for Ubuntu on a 128MB machine
ubuntu # free total used free shared buffers cached Mem : 126100 121464 4636 0 1636 37000 -/+ buffers / cache : 82828 43272 Swap : 746980 17924 729056
You can see now that with 128MB , I am already eating into swap , and I have n't actually started doing anything yet .
Starting my simple set of applications produced the results shown in Listing 4 .
Listing 4 . Light usage for Ubuntu on a 128MB machine
ubuntu # free total used free shared buffers cached Mem : 126100 123608 2492 0 392 51208 -/+ buffers / cache : 72008 54092 Swap : 746980 98452 648528
As you can probably predict from these numbers , the machine is now a lot less responsive under normal use -- it is still just about usable for these simple tasks , but the disk is being accessed very frequently and I certainly would n't like to use it as my main machine .
You can see that the total amount of application memory required is approximately 170MB , but only 72 MB will fit into physical memory , and so 98 MB is relegated to swap .
This helps explain the lack of system responsiveness !
For my next set of tests , I decided to use Xubuntu , a distro from a Ubuntu - associated project .
This distribution is quite similar to Ubuntu , but uses the Xfce 4.4 Beta 2 DE instead of GNOME .
Unlike the more popular GNOME and KDE projects , which concentrate on maximum functionality , Xfce is designed to be lightweight , so it should hopefully be a better match for aging hardware .
We 'll perform the same tests with this distribution that we performed with Ubuntu .
You can see in Listing 5 that the base DE uses approximately 25 MB less application memory , and also eats significantly less into buffers and cache ( which may imply that there is less file activity ) than Ubuntu .
Listing 5 . Base level for Xubuntu on a 256MB machine
xubuntu # free total used free shared buffers cached Mem : 255988 170964 85024 0 6004 104700 -/+ buffers / cache : 60260 195728 Swap : 746980 0 746980
In Listing 6 , we start up our suite of test applications again ( Web browser , IM client , and word processor ) .
You can see that the memory use appears to be around 20 MB less than Ubuntu required for the same set of apps ( 126 in physical memory and 17 in swap for a total of 143 versus 143 + 18 for a total of 161 ) .
Listing 6 . Light usage level for Xubuntu on a 256MB machine
xubuntu # free total used free shared buffers cached Mem : 255988 252180 3808 0 1972 124008 -/+ buffers / cache : 126200 129788 Swap : 746980 16956 730024
Listing 7 illustrates base level usage with only 128 MB of RAM .
My memory - limited system is much happier this time around , with no swap being used yet .
Listing 7 .
Base level for Xubuntu on a 128MB machine
xubuntu # free total used free shared buffers cached Mem : 126100 123228 2872 0 4252 60484 -/+ buffers / cache : 58492 67608 Swap : 746980 0 746980
In Listing 8 , we start the apps up again .
The system is still much better off here than with Ubuntu , but it is still using significant amounts of swap , and the machine is still a bit sluggish ( albeit less so than under Ubuntu ) .
Listing 8 . Light usage level for Xubuntu on a 128MB machine
xubuntu # free total used free shared buffers cached Mem : 126100 123980 2120 0 468 56276 -/+ buffers / cache : 67236 58864 Swap : 746980 64516 682464
As you can see from these numbers , Xubuntu generally used less memory across the board ; so if you only have 128MB ( or less ) to work with , it is probably a good choice for your system .
One great thing about Linux distributions is that they generally do n't cost anything , so it 's easy to download several and try them out for a while to see which you prefer and how they all perform on your hardware .
If you have very limited hardware , you may wan to look at a distribution like Damn Small Linux , which claims to run on systems with specs as low as a 486DX processor with 16MB of RAM .
As I have a little more breathing room in my 256MB system , and am generally a KDE kind of guy , I have gone with another Ubuntu derivative , called Kubuntu , which is KDE based and seems to sit somewhere in between Xubuntu and Ubuntu in terms of memory use .
For reference , Listing 9 illustrates the base usage for Kubuntu .
Listing 9 .
Base level for Kubuntu on a 256MB machine
kubuntu # free total used free shared buffers cached Mem : 255988 244736 11252 0 7612 160008 -/+ buffers / cache : 77116 178872 Swap : 746980 0 746980
Step 2 : Choose appropriate apps
Once you have settled on a distribution , the next thing you can streamline is the set of applications you are going to use .
The memory requirements of different applications can vary greatly ; sometimes you face a trade - off between size and functionality , but in other cases even functionally equivalent applications can have vastly different memory requirements .
In order to measure memory usage for the purpose of this article , I will used the tool exmap .
This tool is more accurate than ps or top because it takes into account shared libraries in use by multiple applications .
For example , if two applications are using the same shared library , which takes up 1MB of memory , ps will show both apps using 1MB of extra memory , whereas exmap more correctly shows each app using 500 KB .
This greater accuracy is particularly important for assessing desktop environments such as KDE and GNOME , which make very heavy use of libraries shared between applications .
For each application I discuss in the following sections , I measured the resident and effective resident values produced by exmap .
The resident value represents the total amount of physical memory in use by the process , including shared libraries that are in use by other processes , and is typical of the sort of value you would expect from ps or top .
The effective resident value is the value with shared library allocations shared evenly among all the processes that are using them ; this is a much more accurate view of the system memory being consumed by a given process .
Note also that , when determining the total memory footprint of a process , you should also take into account the mapped and effective mapped values , which are parts of the process that have been placed in swap .
The mapped values are analogous to the resident values , but for pages in swap rather than in physical memory , So for a view that does n't compensate for shared libraries , you would add the resident and mapped values together ; for a view compensating for shared libraries , you would add the effective resident and effective mapped values together .
I did not record these values in the ensuing tables because , for all of my tests , none of the processes were in swap , and so the output of the exmap command had a value of zero for those columns .
Web browsers
For each browser in Table 1 , I launched the application , opened the developerWorks homepage , and waited for it to fully render .
The results are shown in Table 1 .
Table 1 . Comparison of Web browser memory usage
Application Effective resident memory ( KB ) Resident memory ( KB ) Firefox 27708 35068 Opera 20477 27816 Konqueror 13479 29748 Dillo 2776 6888 Lynx 1101 1540
From this table , you can see that there is a very large range in memory usage , with the most memory - hungry browser ( Firefox ) using approximately 27 times more memory than the most frugal ( Lynx ) .
This is n't really a fair comparison , as Lynx is not really functionally equivalent ( it does not even display graphics , for instance ) , but it does show that , depending upon your requirements , you can vastly reduce your memory usage .
Even among the first three browsers listed in Table 1 , which are more or less functionally equivalent to one another , Opera uses approximately two - thirds the amount of memory of Firefox , and Konqueror uses less than half of Firefox 's memory .
For modest use requirements , Dillo may provide a good compromise between a fully featured browser and the austerity of Lynx .
Dillo provides a GUI ; it is fairly limited in its default state , however , and does n't even support SSL without an additional plugin !
Note also that when we compare the shared memory use , Konqueror performs much better than Firefox , using around 14 MB less memory ; if we look at the total use , however , while Konqueror still does better than Firefox , it does n't do so by such a wide margin -- only by 5 MB or so .
This is because Konqueror makes heavy use of shared KDE libraries that are loaded into lots of applications , as I am using the KDE desktop .
If I were not using any other KDE apps , however , Opera would be a better choice than KDE .
We 'll discuss this issue in more detail later .
Word processors
To test word processors , I loaded the same Microsoft Word - formatted document I used in my first test into the word processors listed in Table 2 .
Table 2 . Comparison of word processor memory usage
Application Effective resident memory ( KB ) Resident memory ( KB ) OpenOffice Writer 70114 81960 AbiWord 58029 65224 KWord ( from KOffice ) 46512 60096
You can clearly see from these numbers that OpenOffice Writer uses much more memory than KWord or AbiWord .
After OpenOffice , KWord did the best job of rendering the Microsoft Word - formatted document correctly .
While AbiWord was able to open the document successfully , there were a few problems rendering it correctly , so if interoperability with Microsoft Office is important to you , you may be better off sticking to OpenOffice .
Instant messaging clients
To test instant messaging , I logged into my MSN Messenger account using the IM clients outlined in Table 3 .
Table 3 . Comparison of IM client memory usage
Application Effective resident memory ( KB ) Resident memory ( KB ) aMSN 18455 20344 Gaim 13456 21464 Kopete 10988 24176 KMess 7154 19660
Here , Kmess came out best for me and was a reasonable choice , as I was only interested in connecting to MSN .
If you need to use other services , then Kopete looks like the best choice .
Note , however , that the application 's memory usage may increase if you 're using a different IM protocols ; also , Kmess is an integrated KDE app , so if you are n't using KDE , then Gaim may be a better choice for you .
Lather , rinse , repeat
Now that you know how to analyze the memory use of your applications , you can simply repeat the process for all the application types you 're interested in , trying out the various options available until you find the choice with the lowest memory requirements that still meets your needs functionally .
As you will have noticed in the Web - browsing section above , it is often the case that the best memory savings come from using an app that is tightly integrated with your desktop environment .
This is because such apps make heavy use of shared libraries that are embedded into the DE and are most likely already loaded .
For instance , Konqueror is the file manager for KDE as well as a Web browser ; hence , it uses much less memory than Firefox when run on a KDE system , because much of its functionality is already loaded by other apps .
Similarly , if you then wanted to use an RSS aggregator , Akregator may be a good choice , as it will most likely use those same libraries again .
Thus , if you are concerned about memory usage , it is important that you perform these tests on your own system , because it is generally hard to get a sense of which application will use less memory on your system by looking at other people 's benchmarks .
This fact may have implications for your choice of DE .
If you really want to use Konqueror , for instance , it is probably most efficient to use KDE as your DE .
Similarly , if you are a GNOME user , you may want to think twice before you use that simple little KDE app you 've had your eye on , as it is likely to load a whole host of libraries that only it will make use of .
Step 3 : Remove unwanted services and settings
Once you have chosen a distribution , desktop environment , and selection of apps , what else can you do to further reduce your memory use ?
To answer this question , you will need to dig down a little deeper and configure your system .
Armed with exmap , you can analyze what is running on the system and try to remove the things you do n't need and configure the things you do .
A good place to begin is with the services that are started automatically when the system boots -- though you need to be careful here so as to not remove anything that is necessary for your system to run .
You will need to do some research into what is required by your particular distribution , and on how services are configured , as this will vary by distribution .
Some distributions are worse than others , starting by default lots of unneeded services such as Web servers and so on that eat up memory .
Beyond system services , you may also wish to look at how the DE is configured , as it may well be starting services which are not needed .
My Kubuntu box did n't seem to be starting too many unneeded services , but a quick look at the process list did show a few obvious things , which I was able to remove :
HPLIP ( 4.4MB ) : Services for HP printers and scanners .
Unneeded as no such devices are connected to this computer .
( 4.4MB ) : Services for HP printers and scanners .
Unneeded as no such devices are connected to this computer .
cupsd ( 1.1MB ) : A printer daemon .
Not needed as no printer is attached to this computer .
( 1.1MB ) : A printer daemon .
Not needed as no printer is attached to this computer .
kbluetoothd ( 3.2MB ) : The KDE Bluetooth daemon .
Not needed because this computer does n't have Bluetooth connectivity .
( 3.2MB ) : The KDE Bluetooth daemon .
Not needed because this computer does n't have Bluetooth connectivity .
klipper ( 1.7MB ) : The KDE clipboard tool .
I do n't care for this particular tool , so I disabled it .
( 1.7MB ) : The KDE clipboard tool .
I do n't care for this particular tool , so I disabled it .
KMix ( 4.1MB ) : The KDE audio mixer .
Does n't need to be running all the time , as I adjust volume via external speakers .
Just five minutes of configuration yielded memory savings of around 14MB -- not bad from a starting point of around 77MB !
It is worth digging around in the settings of your DE as well as the larger apps you use , as some may have settings that will affect the amount of memory they use .
For instance , by reducing the number of virtual desktops , you have may save some memory , particularly if you are using large bitmaps as backdrops .
Turning off some of the fancy eye - candy effects may help too .
Step 4 : Have appropriate expectations
When running older hardware , it is important to be appreciative of the limitations of the machine and work appropriately .
For instance , if you want to edit a collection of photos , do n't open them all at the same time .
This will only eat up memory unnecessarily .
You would have a much easier time of it opening them one by one and closing them afterwards .
Similarly , if you are trying to capture and edit some video , consider capturing individual scenes rather than the whole lot at once ; and if you are creating a large document that will contain illustrations , do n't add them in until you have finished with the text .
Step 5 : Optimize your system
The final step is to look at the deep guts of your system and see if you can shave any memory off anywhere .
There are lots of opportunities , but the law of diminishing returns will start to apply , and for most people the amount of pain and work will not be worth it .
Still , here are some of the things that you might consider :
Recompile the kernel with only the specific drivers for your hardware .
Most mainstream distributions are tailored for a wide range of hardware , so they often include support for vast swathes of hardware that you are n't using .
This may yield some benefit , though it is likely that most of the hardware support is in the form of modules that wo n't be loaded if they are not required .
Recompiling certain apps or libraries so that they are optimized for size and targeted to the specific CPU you are using can yield some memory gains .
The Gentoo distribution is perfect for this , as you can easily recompile some or all of your system with the precise compilation flags you choose .
Unfortunately , this is likely to be quite a lengthy process on an old machine .
Recompiling apps and libraries with specific features removed can also reduce their memory requirement .
Gentoo is again a good idea here because it includes the concept of USE flags , which allow you to easily build your system with application features disabled .
The size of applications can be significantly reduced in this way -- apps are generally released with support for a large number of file formats , codecs , and so on , which often pull in libraries to provide the actual support .
If you know that you never want to read , say , JPEG files , you can specify this in Gentoo ( via USE = " - jpeg " ) , and any applications that deal with graphics will be compiled without JPEG support and will most likely have a smaller memory overhead .
Recent 2.6 kernels have a swappiness parameter that can be tuned at runtime .
This parameter determines the likelihood that applications will be moved to swap instead of the cache or buffers being reduced -- we saw in our early tests that it is common for applications to be swapped out while large chunks of physical memory are still reserved for caches .
By reducing the tendency to swap out , the cache will be reduced and more apps are likely to stay in memory .
Whether or not this move will actually make your machine run faster will very much depend on what apps you are running , however .
It may make the machine seem more responsive if you are constantly swapping between applications , because they are more likely to be resident in memory ; however , if you have a task that reads and writes to disk a lot , then it is likely to be slower .
In general , reducing swappiness will make your system more responsive for interactive apps but will slow down overall throughput .
Conclusion
The ideas in this article may help you breathe life ( and some additional security ) into your old machines and make better use of Linux on aging hardware .
The measurements show that an 800 - MHz /256 - MB machine can house a perfectly usable Linux desktop for light office and home tasks such as e-mail , browsing the Web , word processing , and so on .
With a little tweaking and experimentation , even a 128 MB machine can serve as a reasonably comfortable desktop computer .
While the main focus of this article has been to achieve a functional desktop on reasonably limited hardware , you can also apply the same principles to most sectors of Linux use .
No matter how much memory your latest super machine has , you will soon find new apps to fill it with .
By applying these techniques , you may be able to squeeze that little extra performance out of your overloaded servers or gain some insight into the memory use within your own applications .
