HELENA , Mont . - A Montana judge says it 's not a worker 's fault he got mauled by a grizzly bear at a tourist attraction , even if he smoked marijuana before trying to feed the animal .
Brock Hopkins acknowledged smoking pot before arriving to work at Great Bear Adventures on Nov. 2 , 2007 .
When he entered the bear 's pen , he was attacked and had to be hospitalized .
The owner of the attraction near Glacier National Park says Hopkins was a volunteer and that his use of marijuana caused the accident .
But Judge James Jeremiah Shea of the state Workers ' Compensation Court ruled last month that Hopkins is eligible for benefits .
Shea found that Hopkins was paid , and therefore he 's an employee .
The judge also concluded Hopkins ' use of marijuana was not the main cause of the attack .

Heather returned to the states , her father ill with cancer .
Alone and bored , I remained in London to finish my final year at Goldsmiths .
From the sleep of childhood and all its aimless memories , an old computer game returned to haunt me .
My first recollection was a flashback at the airport , triggered by a scent : the same carpet deodorizer my mother used to use when I was a kid .
Transported away from the echoes of Heathrow 's PA system and the hubbub of waiting travelers , I found myself back in my old bedroom .
A child sat at at the machine , intent on the controls .
Deja vu crept over me .
Pixels shone like gemstones in darkness .
Phosphors moved over the face of the deep and formed into random landscapes .
Every play was different , a 64Kb window onto a universe of iterations .
Music , naked square waves , rang out .
I 'd forgotten that place for a decade , but it had not forgotten me .
In the blackness of the monitor 's glass , I caught my younger self 's eye ; a chill tightened my skin and I was back in the airport terminal , staring at the contrails of my fiancée 's flight home .
In the days and weeks after , old neurons warmed like dusty lamps .
I tried to look it up on the internet , but the game 's name escaped me : this point of frustration , perhaps , helped turn curiosity into obsession .
Weird memories crept into my daydreams .
Sometimes these were vivid , declaring themselves the lost foundations of my personal mythology .
Others were so evasive as to seem like tricks of the mind 's eye , the subsconscious inventing internal unities at the final threshold of adolescence .
The oddest thing was that as a youngster , I 'd hardly cared for the thing .
It was just one of dozens borrowed from someone or other and copied on the double tape deck , the act of piracy its own transgressive reward .
Here 's what I remembered of the scenario : a deposed king , stricken by amnesia , wandered the Orient in search of his former life .
The genre was graphic adventure , each scene a single picture surrounded by the words - -" get , " " move , " " look , " and so on -- that one could select to take actions .
Most haunting of all was the game 's final stumper , in a place called the Garden of Cyrus , before a huge gate embellished with a giant cross .
Though the game 's ruins and cities were different with each play , progress past this certain point was always impossible .
Beyond it was a chapel .
This was the final location , and within it lay the secret of the protagonist 's identity .
Between study all - nighters , my Pentium II , armed with Amstrad CPC emulation software , powered through dozens of downloaded candidates as the hunt went on .
Though I still had the original hardware , back at my parents ' place , my tape collection was discarded long ago .
The main discussion group of the day , comp.sys.amstrad.8bit , was no help .
I eventually got a bite on a web - based forum ( cpc464.com , or perhaps CPC Zone ) with a livelier community .
" Can you name this game ? " is an irksome way of introducing oneself to a retrogaming forum , but the regulars there were tolerant and helpful .
And within hours of my first post , I had replies .
" That is definitely Kobayashi Naru , by Mastertronic , " one respondent wrote , followed by others ' agreement .
" Venom , " offered another .
The matter seemed solved , one way or the other .
But the latter title lacked the randomized world , the garden , the gate , and the story I remembered .
The other game 's controls were visual icons , not words .
Disappointed , I returned to the forum .
Further requests gathered recommendations for titles I 'd already discounted -- except one , from the same guy who suggested Venom .
" Eastern Cross ?
I remember something like that in an old Amstrad mag , " he wrote .
The name struck a bell , sent me into a dream : my old room again , as if to verify it .
My bedclothes were black and red ; on the wall was a painting of an Iguanadon , the corners flat against globs of adhesive tack , signed ROBERT 1984 with a big copyright symbol .
" I 'm pretty sure that 's your game .
I do n't have a scanner , so give me your address and I 'll post you a copy when I get a chance to dig it out . "
Two weeks later , a large package , stuffed with newspaper clippings and magazines , arrived at my apartment in South London .
Oddly , there was no return address .
I thanked him on the forum , but got no reply .
In fact , I do n't think I saw another message from him again .
Given what happened later , I can't help but wonder why .
The pile of 8 - bit computing stuff made for slow work , the nostalgic thrill soon dulled by the dense irrelevance of almost all of it .
But I found what I was looking for .
A flaked and yellow clipping from The Surrey Comet depicted a teen - aged boy , hunched over a CPC in a small room , his face in profile and partly in shadow .
On the monitor ran the game , scrolled halfway up with what looked like code underneath it .
The text pushed the scene line by line off the top of the screen .
The photo caption read " David M. Ward of Lower Ashtead works on his first computer game , Nestor 's Cross , scheduled for release later this year by Golden Games .
Only 15 years old , Ward has been programming since he was twelve . "
I slept well for the first time in a while .
†
" How 's Raiman holding up ? " " We do n't know what to do .
It 's not that it 's sudden , it just seems ... so unfair . "
A faint echo on the line made Heather 's voice seem even more distant .
Her father 's cancer was successfully removed , but it had already moved to the liver .
On the scans , there was a dark shape ; in surgery , it was found to be on the hepatic artery and thus inoperable .
" Does he , you know , have long ? "
" The doctor said he should go home and enjoy what 's left . "
I said nothing for a long while .
Then , " I love you . "
" We 're going to get a second opinion . " †
Back on the 'net , there were no references to any game called " Nestor 's Cross " to be found , but that was no longer a surprise .
Ashtead , of course , was still in Surrey county , England .
The phone directory offered nothing for anyone called Ward or the business .
A trip to the college library got me the publisher 's old address , a P.O. Box in nearby Leatherhead , from a late - 80s business directory .
The Leatherhead and District Chamber of Commerce did n't know a thing about it .
I read up on the Nestorians , but it offered no hints , of course , about the author .
Armed with the name of the game , its programmer , and the publisher , however , I returned to the boards .
Among the nopes and the LOLs and people who told me to give it up already , one poster dug out an excerpt from an interview or letter column in the short - lived " CPC Attack ! " magazine : " This is in issue 3 of CPC attack .
perhaps your man ?
Q : What happened to programming prodigy David Ward ?
A : No idea .
A preview of his first game was sent to mags , but we never saw it on the shelves and never heard from him again .
Sometimes , that 's how the chips fall .
Maybe the kids at Amstrad Action know more . "
From there I spread my wings , added notices to dozens of web - boards , to anything even tangenitally associated with retrogaming , game publishing or the region .
I found the email address of an " S. Ward , " who had been listed as the founder of the company .
Within a week , I received a reply best left to speak for itself : " From : srward@XXXXX.demon.co.uk
To : rbeschizza@XXX.com
Subject : GAME
Yes , I see your emails on the amstrad page .
Well done .
You figured out something about that old thing .
Good for you .
We never even sent it out to the duplicators , so I have no idea how you got one .
But you know what .
It 's none of your business .
This was nearly 15 years ago now and its all put to rest .
" Strung out from my studies -- university finals in just a few weeks -- and from researching this thing , my reply was defensive , asking to know who he was .
The comeback was sharp : " This is Simon Ward .
I 'm Mike 's dad .
I set up the company to publish his game but it was never done .
Happy now ?
Why are you so interested ???
This was years and years ago .
If you know what 's good for you leave it alone . "
I stared at it .
Everything in it seemed to imply a dozen possibilities , beginning at weird and going downhill .
For me , though , the key was in just one word : " Mike . "
David , then , was n't the name he used .
Right there in his dad 's anger -- and right there in the electoral register -- that middlie initial stared me in the face .
They now lived in Epsom , just a couple of miles from the town he grew up in .
Baerely an hour away from me .
Just one change on the trains at West Croydon .
If I just wanted an answer to my questions about the game , I could have written a letter .
But instant gratification has ways to make you move .
Besides , it 's easy to follow whispers of the problems in other people 's lives .
So I stood up , left the flat , and went there .
Ward lived just off the A24 near Epsom General , in a long row of ground - level flats flanked by well - kept lawns .
Whitewashed cement blocks , designed to stop cars mounting the pavement , lined the street .
Wheelchair ramps led to every door .
An old couple peered out from their home .
It took me a long time to find Ward 's place , as the number had fallen off the door ; I knocked on his next - door neighbor 's by mistake at first .
The elderly woman within cast me a vicious look .
Finally certain of his address , I rang the bell .
Inside , tinny 1980s pop music approached , as if from headphones turned up too high .
It stopped with a loud mechanical click .
The door opened wide .
A sunken replica of the teenager from the photograph lingered behind it .
Ward looked at my chest , without saying hello and without meeting my eyes .
In his left hand was an old yellow walkman .
A cord coiled tight from it around one of his fingers , then up to the headphones .
" Hi ... Mike , " I said , embarrassed .
An ingratiating smile formed on my lips .
" I 'm a fan of your game .
I 'm really sorry to bother you , I know this is a bit weird , but is it poss ... "
My voice trailed off .
He still did n't meet my gaze .
His face , his eyes , his bottom lip were slack , as if he were deaf , or not aware of what I said .
" What happens in the last scene ? " I persisted .
" The copy I had -- you ca n't get past the gate !
Why did you make it impossible to get to the chapel ? "
I asked a few more questions , but nothing even seemed to register .
An uncomfortable silence descended .
Frustrated , I ducked a little , tried to catch his attention with a wave of my hand .
" Mike ? David ? " I said .
He swayed a little , nodded subtly and compulsively in a way that normal people do not .
" David , " I said again , little more than a whisper .
" What happened to you ? "
He met my eyes . †
Heather 's father died in 2002 , after it metastasized again .
They opened him up one last time to find his stomach covered in thousands of tiny mutations .
She and her father had reconnected in his final months .
At the end , everyone was there .
By then , I 'd long since graduated and joined them in New Mexico .
But in the hospital room , I still felt like an interloper , hovering on the periphery as Raiman 's wife and daughters shared his last moments .
Painkillers had already taken everything except his breath , leaving only the slowing murmurs and the memories .
Memories .
The air was thick with their power , as if this was the moment when they truly mattered , their recitation the guarantee of an afterlife .
When he died , silence took them .
I helped an orderly move him off the bed and onto a gurney .
In the months and years after Raiman 's death , those shared recollections , so precisely defined at the end , slipped away .
Whatever remained of the past became a different thing in each of those who knew him .
Only when something is gone for good can it exist in many places .
A chorus of many voices singing apart , each with its own cherished moments , its own strange and insidious regrets .
" Do you remember that stupid old game you were obsessed with ? "
Heather said , years later .
" It 's a bit like that .
The more you think about it , the more you make up in your head .
And eventually , you can't even remember what you loved the most . " †
No sooner had Ward met my eyes than he closed the door .
Surprised , my nose inches from the wood , I heard the music start up again .
The squeak of tires and a shout rattled out behind me , and I turned to to see a middle - aged man haul himself out of a Land Rover in the car park opposite the main road .
He wore a waxed coat .
His face was red with anger ; he yelled something at me .
Traffic blocked his way .
I heard the door click open again and a hard edge pressed into the palm of my hand .
I turned back .
David Michael
Ward looked at me .
An odd expression crossed his face for the briefest moment as the door shut again .
Then he was gone .
He 'd given me a cassette tape .
Written on it was " 80s CLASSICS / MADONNA . "
I gaped at the absurdity of it .
" You 're that fellow off the computer , are n't you ? " the red - faced man shouted .
He closed in .
Ward 's father , I guessed .
" Just who the hell do you think you are ?
Leave him alone .
Just leave him alone .
He does n't need anything from you . "
I backed off .
He moved between me and the door .
A grey fuzz of fair hair lingered around his temples .
It was all I could do to mumble apologies over and over again .
" Satisfied ? " he said .
" What do you care about that stupid game ? "
" He did n't ...
I 'm sorry , I did n't mean to ... I did n't know . "
" Just get lost before I call the ... " he said , his voice a baleful whine .
Something in it was not quite right .
A note of anxiety emanated from the word he did not say .
" You people should spend less time in front of a bloody screen and more time ... reading real things . "
I shuffled away and tried not to look back .
As I turned a high - hedged corner , Ward 's dad unlocked and opened the door .
Curiosity lingered despite my guilt and embarrassment .
On the way home , I examined the tape .
A Maxell C60 , it was ancient and well - worn , the trim of its faded label a pale and pencil - scored blue .
As soon as I ducked into my flat , I threw it into the stereo and hit play .
Just in case .
Madonna .
Lucky Star and Borderline , Burning Up and I Know It .
A clunk at the end of side A as the player reversed itself .
And there it was on the other side , the datastream .
An even lead - in at 1,000 baud , followed by a shrill lick at 2,000 .
I pressed stop as soon as I heard it , then sat in the silence of my room .
The game .
A copy given to me by its author .
Not the one that got into the wild , the broken one that could n't be finished -- the original .
What did the father think , I wondered , when he realized his son had locked the world out of its final scene ?
All that work , and no public release ?
It made no sense .
Three days later , I was back at my parents ' house .
Amid the attic 's dark clutter , I found the Amstrad 's box , torn white creases wandering across the glossy black cardboard .
I hauled it down the ladder .
Within was the 20 - year old machine ; out it came , my reflection distant and gray in the CRT .
The cassette tape slid in .
RUN .
Data screeched .
And within an hour or two , the Garden of Cyrus loomed .
I faced the gate .
" This place yields only to the bearer 's name .
Speak ! " it said .
The answer was always abundantly clear from clues spread throughout the game , which was steeped in medieval mythology .
You are Prester John , king of the fabled Christian east .
That answer never worked , though , back then -- those advance copies were evidently incomplete or locked , the final scene inaccessible .
With a feeling of infinite triumph , my fingers set across the keys .
I had a complete copy , handed to me by its own author : whetever Ward 's secret was , he wanted me to know it .
PRESTER JOHN Nothing happened .
I tried again .
The same reply -- the same as it always was : " Nothing happens . "
PRESTER .
JOHN .
KING JOHN .
JOHN PRESTER .
I must have entered each a hundred times as a kid .
THE BEARER .
Nothing .
It was just as broken as the one I remembered .
Progress was impossible .
Enraged , I slapped open the Amstrad 's deck and flung the tape at the wall .
It cracked off the brick and fell in halves onto my old bedroom 's floor .
Dark tape rolled across the carpet , led by a white plastic cog .
For a long while I glared at the remains , at the plastic casing and its sun-bleached label .
I blinked , then laughed .
All along , I 'd recited the answer I remembered , rather than the one I was asked for .
The one I could never have figured out as a child .
I swung back to the Amstrad .
The game was still running -- lacking a cartridge 's built - in hardware , tape software must spool into the system memory before it can execute .
MADONNA
The bearer of Christ .
My screen faded as fast as a Zilog Z80 permits .
A new scene formed , and years of wonder faded .
I was in a tiny dark church , bathed in color from stained glass windows .
A book rested on a lectern , the chamber 's only furnishing .
What had that strange , broken boy placed there ?
I do n't recall what I 'd expected , exactly , except something awful , a cipher for the unspeakable , something in his life he could not bring himself to express in plain words .
That was why his father never published it -- and why he was so angry at my interest .
Every circumstance seemed to focus on that point .
Ward knew , at the end , that a puzzle solves nothing for its creator : it just mirrors what it conceals .
A mystery might seem a safe place to store evil , but it is n't .
It ca n't be .
But I was wrong , of course .
There was no tangled diary , no dark answer to David Michael Ward 's predicament .
As I selected the icons for EXAMINE and BOOK , I saw that all of these enigmas were imagined .
It dawned on me that nothing was ever missing from the version I 'd found and played back in the 1980s ; then as now , I simply had n't figured out the answer .
Ward had simply made obvious to me what was obvious to most : damaged as he is , his final look at me had been a smile , full of knowing .
The game ended with just a single word .
CONGRATULATIONS !

Jos. A. Beard – Valuable Gang of Young Negroes ( 1840 )
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan June 29 , 2010  --
Afghanistan 's government and Pakistan 's military and intelligence services are moving forward toward cutting deals with senior Afghan insurgents , filling a vacuum created by American skepticism .
In the last few weeks senior Afghan officials have met with the head of Pakistan 's army and the Inter - Services Intelligence , or ISI , to talk about the Haqqani network and the Quetta Shura , two leading Afghan insurgent groups whose leadership are believed to be hiding inside Pakistan .
The Afghan government has tried to seize momentum created by a recent peace assembly in Kabul , and Pakistan has quickly become more willing to talk after the forced resignations of two senior Afghan officials skeptical of reconciliation efforts , according to Afghan and Pakistani officials .
At the same time , the United States has become increasingly publicly doubtful of the concept of reconciling with high - level insurgent leaders .
Afghan officials seem nonplussed by the American skepticism , and are moving forward on multiple fronts , despite the American insistence that talks begin only after the U.S. military creates momentum in the Taliban 's heartland .
" The biggest tragedy for the United States is , ' Why are we not in the middle of things ? , ' " says a senior Afghan government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the government 's reconciliation efforts .

A Western official in Afghanistan says he believes the Karzai government is losing faith in the West 's ability to bring security to Afghanistan , and is therefore increasing its attempts to reach out to Pakistan to create peace talks .
The official said the Karzai government 's latest indication of a lack of Western commitment to Afghanistan came from British Prime Minister David Cameron , who last weekend announced he wanted all British troops out of Afghanistan within five years .
Believing the only way to bring peace in Afghanistan is cutting a political deal , the Afghan government has been working with the Pakistani military and the ISI to begin dialogues with senior insurgent leaders .
The focus right now seems to be on the father / son team of Jalaluddin and Siraj Haqqani , who live in the Pakistani tribal areas and largely control a corridor from eastern Afghanistan all the way into Kabul .

Pakistan May Be Key to Taliban Negotiations
" We do n't need to deal with Haqqani directly .
We can deal with the ISI , " says the senior Afghan government official .
The ISI and the Pakistani military have long maintained links to the Haqqani network , which , unlike other terror groups , have never attacked targets in Pakistan .
That has meant the relationship remains intact .
" Pakistan has the ultimate card for the Afghan solution , " said a Pakistani intelligence official .
Siraj Haqqani , who is an experienced negotiator and will likely expect something in return for any deal , has been directly involved in the talks , the intelligence official said .
Asked how far along the talks were , the Afghan senior official would only say that the talks with the Pakistani leadership and the Haqqani network " are all the way to the top . "
The United States encourages the bilateral dialogue between Pakistan and Afghanistan , but is nowhere near ready for Siraj Haqqani to be part of talks .
American officials blame the Haqqani network for nearly all major attacks in Kabul , countless attacks on American soldiers in eastern Afghanistan , and sheltering senior al Qaeda leaders in North Waziristan , the Pakistani tribal area .
The general U.S. skepticism toward talking to its enemies has become increasingly public .
CIA Director Leon Panetta went farther than most American officials recently when he said told ABC's Jake Tapper on " This Week " that reconciliation efforts were a non-starter until the United States made more progress in Afghanistan .
" We have seen no evidence that they are truly interested in reconciliation where they would surrender their arms , where they would denounce al - Qaeda , where they would really try to become part of that society , " Panetta said .
" We 've seen no evidence of that and very frankly , my view is that with regards to reconciliation , unless they 're convinced that the United States is going to win and that they 're going to be defeated , I think it 's very difficult to proceed with a reconciliation that 's going to be meaningful , " Panetta added .
But Afghan and Pakistani officials dismiss that thinking , with one calling it a " false premise . "
Karzai to Announce High Council of Peace
" If you know Afghans , you know that thinking is wrong , " says the Afghan senior official .
" If you make an Afghan feel weak , then you end up forcing him to be the opposite of what the U.S. thinks he will become . "
For their part , the Pakistanis seem to have concluded that Karzai was becoming more serious about including them on reintegration talks .
Last month , the head of Afghan 's spy agency , Amrullah Saleh , and Interior Minister Hanif Atmar both resigned after a contentious meeting with Karzai during which he doubted their abilities to bring security to the country .
Although Karzai and his staff have denied that the two officials ' resignations had anything to do with reconciliation efforts , Pakistan saw the resignations as " Karzai beginning to communicate " with Pakistan , according to a senior Pakistani official .
" With these kinds of people around , there could not be rapprochement .
They were completely biased toward the Indians , " says the Pakistani official , who requested anonymity to discuss reconciliation efforts .
" The stumbling blocks have been removed . "
In the next few days Karzai will announce the creation of the High Council of Peace , the first time that the government has announced an official strategy for low - level reintegration and high level reconciliation and the funding to go along with it , according to Karzai 's spokesman , Waheed Omer .
The U.S. has been waiting for the announcement in order to institutionalize what have been " ad hoc " and " uneven " efforts so far to reintegrate low - level fighters back into society , according to a senior military official .
Since the beginning of the year , commanders have been allowed to purse reintegration and conflict resolution " however they wanted to , " but " until there was a program , there 's not a lot we could do , " the senior U.S. military official says .
For the foreseeable future , those low - level efforts seem to be the only ones that the United States will be willing to pursue .
Afghanistan and Pakistan , meanwhile , continue to become more serious about high - level reconciliation .
U.S. civilian and military officials agree that Pakistan can help deliver the Haqqani network to the negotiating table .
But they are more skeptical Pakistan can do the same with the Taliban leadership council believed to be centered in the Pakistani cities of Quetta and Karachi , in part because many mid-level commanders in Afghanistan are not as closely connected to Taliban leader Mullah Omar as their predecessors were .
Taliban Talks Worry Afghan Minorities
For that reason , they say , reconciliation talks are not likely to proceed beyond early stages until the United States supports them .
The Afghan leadership seems to be getting impatient .
" We 're very comfortable with these issues .
But it 's going to be extremely difficult without having the U.S. on board , " laments the senior Afghan official .
At the same time , American officials and many Afghan politicians are worried that reconciliation with insurgents will come at the expense of Afghanistan 's minority groups .
Leaders from the country 's Tajik and Hazara communities are beginning to come out against what they see as Karzai 's single - minded focus on reconciling insurgents , who are predominantly ethnic Pashtuns .
They complain that Karzai , who is also Pashtun , is making decisions behind closed doors and shutting out the democratically elected parliament
" President Karzai would like to bring some of his friends on board who are with Taliban now .
He has been influenced by his personal emotions rather than politics , " says Fauzia Kofi , a leading Tajik member of parliament from northeast Afghanistan .
" Reconciliation will not result with peace in Afghanistan .
Peace is a result of democracy .
You have to involve everyone in that process . "
Some American officials admit that they worry reconciliation might encourage Tajik - Pashtun ethnic violence .
" It has the potential to really tear this country apart , " Admiral Mullen told The New York Times last week .
" That 's not what we are going to permit . "

Why was B.C. Premier Gordon Campbell hanging out with global billionaires at the 58th annual Bilderberg Meeting in Sitges , Spain ?
And why did n’t he tell the world he was going ?
After all , he went to a beautiful place , made some new friends , and the food had to be good .
But Campbell has n’t posted even a tweet ’s worth about it on his Facebook page .
Is n’t that something social media is for ?
To tell your friends about your latest neat trip ?
A photo in today ’s Guardian newspaper shows Campbell among a covey of other official Bilderburg participants .
He was there with other political figures including the finance minister of debt bedeviled Greece ( George Papaconstantinou ) , two past architects of U.S. war policies ( Henry Kissinger and Richard Perle ) , and Larry Summers , top economic advisor to U.S. president Obama .
The list also includes powerful heads of giant multi-national corporations including Microsoft , Coca - cola , Google and Goldman Sachs International .
The annual meeting of the Bilderberg group is secretive and by invitation only , and therefore ready fodder for conspiracy theorists .
The Georgia Straight first reported on June 6 , that Campbell was on a " leaked list " of Bilderberg participants this year .
( The Tyee today found the same list on the Bilderberg website . )
On Sunday , The Vancouver Sun gained what it termed a " brief interview " with Campbell , noting the premier would " not go into specific detail about what was discussed . "
Campbell did say , " We talked about the economy , we talked about trade , we talked about health care and the challenges that health care presents to all economies with the changing demographic . "
" We talked about how is it possible to feed the world and what are the barriers that are in the way of us actually accomplishing that goal . "
" Everybody is connected now with international trade .
Everyone will be affected by what happens with the European currencies and that 's a significant issue everyone is concerned about . "
UBC professor of international law Michael Byers , a federal New Democrat who has run for Member of Parliament in Vancouver , would like Campbell to be more forthcoming about the goal and results of his four days spent with the Bilderbergers , paid for by citizens of B.C .
" One does n't need to be a conspiracy theorist to be concerned that the Premier of B.C. is attending secret meetings with the power brokers of global capitalism , including Henry Kissinger and Peter Sutherland , the chairman of Goldman Sachs International .
These are people who see countries as commodities , available for take - over and trade -- along with their natural resources -- without regard for the interests or opinions of their citizens . "
Byers added , " The parallel with Paul Gross ' 2004 CBC drama ‘ H20 ’ is particularly disturbing .
There , the Bilderberg Group engineered the rise to power of a Canadian prime minister -- and the incorporation of Canada into the United States -- in return for the commercialization and export of Canada 's freshwater .
Gordon Campbell is commercializing B.C.'s fresh water so that multinational corporations can export hydroelectricity to California .
So what 's the quid pro quo ?
Does it only come later , in the form of lucrative positions on the boards of Bilderberg - associated companies ?
Or has some of it already arrived ? "
Maybe CBC anchor Peter Mansbridge will have the story .
He attended this year ’s Bilderberg meeting , too , along with fellow Canadians Indigo Books chair Heather Riesman and TD Bank Financial Group Deputy Chair Frank McKenna .

In recent years , oil giant BP PLC used a well design that has been called " risky " by Congressional investigators in more than one out of three of its deepwater wells in the Gulf of Mexico , significantly more often than most peers , a Wall Street Journal analysis of federal data shows .
The design was used on the well that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20 , killing 11 workers and causing America 's worst offshore oil spill .
The only other major well design , which is more expensive , includes more safeguards against a natural - gas blowout of the kind that destroyed the Deepwater Horizon .
A Journal analysis of records provided by the U.S. Minerals Management Service shows that BP used the less costly design — called " long string " — on 35 % of its deepwater wells since July 2003 , the earliest date the well - design data were available .
Anadarko Petroleum Corp. , a minority partner of BP's in the destroyed well , used it on 42 % of its deepwater Gulf wells , though it says it does n't do so in wells of the type drilled by BP .
Both companies used the design much more often , on average , than other major Gulf drillers .
Out of 218 deepwater wells in the Gulf drilled since July 2003 , 26 % used the long - string design .
It derives its name from its use of a single , long " string " of pipe from the sea floor to the bottom of the well .
FORT MORGAN , Ala . --
A boat captain working in the oil spill response died from a gunshot wound this morning .
William Allen Kruse , born 1955 , was the captain of The Rookie , a charter fishing boat normally based in Orange Beach , said Deputy Baldwin County Coroner Rod Steade .
Steade said the deckhands were on the docks and heard a gunshot and went back on and found him dead on the " flying bridge . "
The boat was docked at the Gulf Shores Yacht Club & Marina at Fort Morgan , which is on the north side of Ala. 180 about 1.5 miles east of Fort Morgan .
The marina manager confirmed that the shooting had taken place there .
Followup : Death ruled suicide ; friend says he 's surprised something like this did n't happen sooner .
" I 'm very sorry to announce the death this morning of a captain in the vessel of opportunity program at Fort Morgan , Alabama , " said U.S. Coast Guard Commander Chuck Diorio , a spokesman for the joint information center at the Mobile command post .
" Our hearts go out to his family and the Gulf Coast community .
There are many facts that need to be determined surrounding this . "
Diorio said the Gulf Shores Police Department was conducting an investigation .
Tatiana Reina wanted to graduate in the worst way — and she did .
The 21 - year - old was enrolled at Lafayette HS in Bensonhurst , Brooklyn , for six years with a dismal record marked by truancy and failing grades .
She faked her own graduation in 2007 , donning a cap and gown and sneaking into the receiving line .
Faced with “ aging out ” of the school system this year , she got a last chance and still did n’t bother going to class .
“ She was a no - show all year , ” a school insider said .
Regulations call for at least 90 percent attendance to be promoted or to graduate .
But that did n’t stop the principal , Jacqueline Boswell , from granting Reina a diploma .
In June , Reina showed up for the last five days and was given some health and chemistry assignments in the guidance office , school staffers said .
“ She sat at a computer and Googled her answers , ” a worker said .
Finally , teachers were pressured into giving Reina — and a half - dozen other failing students — minimally passing grades of 65 , the equivalent of a “ D , ” to get the credits needed to graduate , sources told The Post .
“ They ’re giving out diplomas like it ’s a lemonade stand , ” one disgusted staffer said .
The city Department of Education referred The Post ’s findings to its Office of Special Investigation , said spokesman Danny Kanner .
What happened at Lafayette HS , one of five city high schools that closed their doors for the last time last week , is not a fluke , critics say .
“ This is happening all over the city , especially at closing schools , ” said Leonie Haimson , executive director of Class Size Matters .
“ If you ’re a principal or a teacher and your chances of getting another job depend on how many kids you successfully graduate , the vast majority will give these kids credit , whether they deserve it not , ”
That ’s exactly what a Lafayette teacher did , describing “ coercion ” by an assistant principal .
“ I was told to consider raising a failing grade because the principal might not give me a favorable recommendation , ” said the distraught teacher , who admitted changing a final grade of 55 to 65 .
The teacher also said Principal Boswell brought the student ’s mother into the classroom and then asked if the kid ’s grade would be changed .
Boswell refused to speak to The Post .
Reina first entered Lafayette in June 2004 .
Four years later , her credits fell short .
But she bought a cap and gown and “ snuck into the line ” to walk on stage .
A staffer noticed , but told the announcer to call out her name so as not to “ make a scene . ”
Reina , like the others , was handed a piece of paper with instructions to pick up her diploma later .
Still enrolled at Lafayette in 2008 , Reina flunked everything but Spanish , earning a single credit and then another in summer school , records show .
She then enrolled in Borough of Manhattan Community College , a CUNY campus , but got kicked out when officials finally got her high - school transcript .
So she returned to Lafayette last year .
On Jan. 12 , a school day , she was arrested for buying goods at Bloomingdale ’s at Roosevelt Field , LI , with $ 400 in fake traveler ’s checks ; the felony charge is pending .
She failed everything until the second term , when she snagged the last two required credits .
“ I got my diploma ! ” she said last week , but did n’t want to comment further .
Asked about her atrocious attendance , she explained , “ There was n’t no problem .
I just did n’t go . ”

“ Techmeme is our go - to primary source , ” said Marshall Kirkpatrick , an editor and lead blogger at ReadWriteWeb , a tech blog .
He visits Techmeme up to 15 times a day on his computer and phone , and requires his blog ’s other writers to track it for breaking news .
Some aggregation sites , like Google News , rely on software to crawl the Web and spot key words in news stories .
This model is fast , but it often misses nuances and different interpretations or developments on the news .
Others , like Digg , ask anyone on the Web to suggest stories , and many readers use Twitter as a user - generated newsfeed .
These sites can be amateurish ( the link that got the most votes on Digg on a recent morning was a video of someone falling on rollerblades ) .
Still others , like Arts & Letters Daily and the Romenesko news media blog of the Poynter Institute , rely on human editors to gather the important stories of the day .
Individuals who filter the news bring more editorial expertise , but they are often slower and less comprehensive than a computer , and it is difficult to expand the service to other topics .
“ We ’re more interested in quality than we are in beating other people with deadlines , ” said Denis Dutton , the editor of Arts & Letters Daily , which is owned by the Chronicle of Higher Education .
It posts three new stories a day and six on Mondays , and sometimes they are a few days old .
Techmeme combines all three strategies , automatically searching the Web , employing editors and accepting tips from readers .
Other sites , including Blogrunner , an aggregation site owned by The New York Times Company , also use several of these strategies .
In 2004 , Mr. Rivera had received a doctorate in computer science and was working at Intel when he observed that it was difficult to monitor all the blogs sprouting across the Web .
He started Memeorandum as an automatic aggregator searching for the political news articles that were most linked to by other sites .
All fifteen panels .
No do n’t that just beat all .
What if BP Never Stopped the Oil in the Gulf of Mexico ?
Engineers say blown - out well could leak for years if not stopped .
June 4 , 2010  -- BP said today that its latest try to control the oil spilling into the Gulf of Mexico may be working .
It has lowered a large cap over the blown - out well , 5,000 feet below the surface of the Gulf , in hopes of siphoning off the escaping oil .
" I am actually pretty confident this is going to work , " BP COO Doug Suttles said on " Good Morning America . "
" It probably wo n't capture all of the flow but it should capture the vast majority . "
But this is the seventh attempt to stop the well since the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded and burned on April 20 , six weeks ago , and all the others have ended in disappointment .
Which raised a question :
What if nothing worked at all ?
What if the oil just kept coming out of the ground until it stopped naturally ?
How long would it take ?
What would be the consequences ?
The quick answer is that they would be severe -- though nobody is quite sure how much oil might escape because nobody , even at BP , is sure how much is down there .
" It 's huge .
It 's a big oil field , " said Roger Anderson , an oil geophysicist at the Earth Institute of Columbia University .
" If 20,000 barrels a day are escaping , it could stay there for years , then drop off .
It could flow at a small rate for a very , very long time . "
Calls to more than a dozen experts yielded similar answers : it might be years , not months , if nothing stops the gusher , but it would not stretch into a decade .
Many engineers and agencies said they would prefer not to guess .
The theoretical question -- what if the oil were allowed to stop on its own -- is not something that the federal government , states along the Gulf Coast , or BP would even consider .
The eyes of the world are on the ongoing disaster , and BP is drilling relief wells to divert the leaking oil if nothing else works .
The company has said it should be done by August .
The government said Thursday that 30,000 people are involved in the effort to control the oil and clean up the mess .
" People are pretty confident that the relief well (s ) will work , if nothing else , " said Eric Adams of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in an e-mail to ABC News .
" Of course they wo n't be finished until August , which is 2 - plus months away .
At 12,000 to 19,000 barrels of oil per day , that is , of course , a lot of oil . "
Vast Underwater Oil Field
The Deepwater Horizon was drilling a so - called exploratory well when the accident happened .
Eleven workers on the platform never were seen again and are believed to have died .
The underground formation that the rig was probing has been estimated to hold anywhere from 50 million to a billion barrels of oil that could be extracted economically .
" Not all the oil would flow out due to what the oil field types would call ' natural bridging ' of the well -- that means self - plugging , " said Ian MacDonald , an oceanographer at Florida State University who has been studying the size of the spill .
" Nonetheless , there is no immediate prospect of ' running out ' of oil and gas that can get out if they can't plug this damned thing . "
What if BP Never Stopped the Oil ?
Where would the oil go ?
Computer models developed by the federally - funded National Center for Atmospheric Research showed that if parts of the floating slick spread into the powerful Loop Current near Florida 's Gulf Coast , oil could be drawn around the Florida peninsula , up the Eastern Seaboard and out into the Atlantic Ocean .
Some oil naturally would be consumed by microorganisms or degraded by sunlight and wave action , but oil might also wash ashore from Louisiana to Florida and up to the Carolinas .
Past experience in the Gulf of Mexico has been sobering .
In 1979 , a Mexican - owned rig called Ixtoc - 1 suffered a blowout and collapsed , and 140 million gallons of oil escaped into the water .
Pemex , the Mexican oil company , drilled two relief wells -- and even then oil kept escaping for three months after the first one was finished .
Engineers say major oil accidents are relatively rare , considering the amount of crude that is pumped out of the ground around the world .
But the technology to bring a blown well under control has not greatly advanced since the Ixtoc accident , which remains the world 's largest .
President Obama , on his third visit to Louisiana since the BP accident , said today , " It is way too early to be optimistic . "

Jayant Patel has been sentenced to seven years in jail for the manslaughter of three patients at Bundaberg 's Base Hospital in southern Queensland between 2003 and 2005 and will be eligible for parole after three - and - a - half - years .
Prosecutors had asked Justice John Byrne to jail the 60 - year - old former surgeon for more than 10 years after his convictions for three counts of manslaughter and one of grievous bodily harm .
Patel 's lawyers said a four to five - year jail sentence was warranted , given Patel 's lack of criminal history , the public vilification he has suffered since returning to Australia and that jail would be particularly harsh for Patel .
Patel had pleaded not guilty to the manslaughter of 75 - year - old Mervyn Morris , 77 - year - old Gerardus Kemps and 46 - year - old James Phillips .
He also pleaded not guilty to causing grievous bodily harm to 63 - year - old Ian Vowles during his time working as a surgeon .
Justice Byrne briefly recounted Patel 's treatment of the four men involved before telling Patel he had shown repeated serious disregard for the welfare of his patients .
He said that while the absence of any intention by Patel to harm his patients was significant , the jury 's verdicts meant Patel had shown such moral guilt that he deserved to be punished as a criminal .
Justice Byrne told Patel that the legal system must make it clear that the community , acting through the court , denounced his repeated serious disregard for the welfare of his patients .
He said Patel 's judgment in taking each patient to surgery was so thoroughly reprehensible that he deserved to be punished as a criminal .
During the sentencing in Brisbane 's Supreme Court , Justice Byrne reminded Patel of the restrictions that were placed on him in the United States by the board of medical examiners in Oregon and that those restrictions showed that there was respectable medical opinion that his level of surgical competence required him to obtain second opinions .
Patel was also reminded that he told no - one about that order in Bundaberg - not the hospital administrators , medical staff or his patients .
Justice Byrne said he took into account as mitigating factors that prison would be particularly harsh for Patel given his notoriety and that Patel spent six months in jail in the US while awaiting extradition .
Patel will be eligible for parole after serving half of his sentence .
' Happy with outcome '
Gerardus Kemps ' widow , Judy Kemps , said it was just fine by her that Patel would spend years behind bars .
" That 's fine by me , I 'm very happy with the outcome , you could n't have wished for better , " she said .
" For me the conviction was the main thing .
He 's been found guilty and whatever they do after that it does n't worry me .
" My only aim has always been to stop him from doing further damage . "
Former Patel patient Beryl Crosby - who is also an advocate for patients who suffered at the hands of the former surgeon - said she is thrilled to know he will spend seven years in jail for his crimes .
Another former patient , Linda Parsons , endured a botched hernia operation .
She said she was overjoyed with the sentence , but it was the guilty verdict that mattered most .
" I was never concerned with how long he got .
I was after the guilty verdict , " she said .
" I just feel like five years of my life has been lifted away and I feel very teary right now . "
Whistleblower Toni Hoffman says the sentence is suitable .
" Our society has spoken and it's a good result .
[ There are ] a lot of lessons to be learnt , " she said .
" Our legal system has to reflect us as a society and our needs as a society and at the moment it 's done that , so I think we should just be grateful for that . "
Patel has been remanded in custody since the guilty verdict on Tuesday .
The jury took six - and - a- half days to reach the verdict and handed down its decision in the Supreme Court in Brisbane .
Lengthy trial
The defence claimed Patel had always acted in the best interests of his patients , who had consented to the operations .
But prosecutor Ross Martin , who characterised Patel as a " bad surgeon motivated by ego and suffering from lack of insight " , urged the jury to return guilty verdicts on all charges .
He told the jury the trial was about " judgments " and that Patel 's negligence extended to his poor decisions about when to operate , and his choices about appropriate post - operative care .
In summing up last Wednesday , Justice Byrne reminded the jury that Mr Martin neatly summarised the Crown 's allegations when he said : " Over 19 to 20 months there had been poor decision - making , misdiagnosis , performing surgery on patients who could not withstand it , performing surgery at the wrong hospital and the removal of healthy organs " .
However , Patel 's defence team had urged the jury to find Patel not guilty , saying he always acted in the best interests of his patients .
Defence barrister Michael Byrne , QC , told the jury much of the evidence presented by the crown during the marathon trial had been fuelled by " a great deal of second - guessing and use of hindsight " .
" With hindsight it may have been the wrong call [ to operate on Mr Kemps ] but that does not make the decision criminally negligent , " Mr Byrne said .
Justice Byrne warned the jury against using the benefit of hindsight in making their judgment about whether or not Patel was criminally negligent in proceeding with the operations .
Patel 's Supreme Court trial began in Brisbane in March 2010 and has become one of the longest Supreme Court criminal trials in Queensland 's history .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A new , longer - lasting “ morning - after ” pill to prevent unwanted pregnancy appears to work with no unexpected side effects , U.S. health regulatory staff said in documents released on Tuesday .
Data shows the one - pill treatment , called ella and made by French drugmaker HRA Pharma , is effective when taken as many as five days after unprotected sex , Food and Drug Administration staff reviewers said in documents released ahead of a public meeting on the drug scheduled for Thursday .
At the meeting , an FDA panel of outside experts will decide whether to recommend the agency approve the emergency contraceptive for the U.S. market .
If approved , Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc would sell the drug in the United States .
HRA Pharma ’s drug , approved last year in Europe under the name ellaOne , has re-ignited debate over “ morning - after ” pills in the United States , where reproductive issues are a constant political issue .
Women ’s health advocates have welcomed the potential for another contraceptive option , but some critics contend the drug is more akin to the abortion pill , sold by Danco Laboratories as Mifeprex and also known as RU - 486 or mifepristone .
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd sells a rival product , called Plan B , a two - pill regimen with generic competition from Watson ’s Next Choice .
Teva also sells a one - pill version of Plan B .
Both versions of Plan B , which are available over the counter for women at least 17 years of age , have only been proven to work for up to 72 hours after intercourse .
“ There is a medical need for an efficient emergency contraceptive product which acts consistently over a prolonged time period , ” HRA Pharma said in a separate document released by the FDA .
The drugmaker has said its pill , also known by its chemical name ulipristal , works primarily by preventing ovulation of a woman ’s egg .
But the drug ’s effect on the lining of the uterus -- critical for a fertilized egg to develop -- may also play a role , according to its label in Europe .
FDA staff scientists , in their review , concurred .
The agency ’s reviewers also said the company ’s studies showed no unexpected side effects in women , although reports of nausea , headache and abdominal pain were common .
It was not clear what effect the drug had , if any , when a woman still became pregnant despite taking it , they added .
“ Data on pregnancy outcomes after EC ( emergency contraceptive ) failure with ulipristal were too limited to draw any definitive conclusions regarding the effect of ulipristal on an established pregnancy or fetal development , ” they wrote .
“ MORE LEEWAY ”
Emergency contraceptive pills have been available in the United States for more than a decade .
Plan B , or levonorgestrel , was first approved in 1999 .
Efforts in 2001 to make it available without a prescription stirred fierce opposition from conservatives , and the bid stalled under the George W. Bush administration .
Democrats angered by the delay threatened to block Bush ’s nominee to run the FDA .
Easier access to the drug won approval in 2006 .
HRA is not seeking to sell ella without a doctor ’s prescription .
Advocates for women ’s health have applauded the possibility of additional contraceptive options , saying a longer - lasting product could help women who want to avoid pregnancy .
For ella , “ while you ’re going to have to go and get a prescription for it , it gives you a little bit more leeway in terms of putting your ability to put your life on hold and get this healthcare need taken care of , ” said Amy Allina , program and policy director for the National Women ’s Health Network .
Cost is also an issue .
With Plan B sold over the counter , most women have to pay for the drug themselves -- roughly $ 50 -- rather than have their health insurance cover it , Allina said .
Anti-abortion groups oppose HRA Pharma ’s drug , saying it is closer chemically to mifepristone than Plan B and pressing the FDA to reject the product .
Like mifepristone , ella is a type of drug known as a selective progesterone receptor modulator ( SPRM ) that interferes with the hormone progesterone , which is critical for pregnancy .
If it is approved , it should be clearly labeled as an abortifacient , which would limit its distribution , the American Association of Pro Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists said in a letter to the FDA earlier this month .
“ There is no doubt that ulipristal acts an abortifacient because the drug blocks progesterone receptors at three critical areas , ” an action that “ interferes with the hormone action of progesterone to prepare the endometrium for implantation and to support the early pregnancy , ” the group wrote .
Proponents agree that ella is similar chemically to mifepristone but say the dose given does not interfere with a pregnancy already underway .
“ There ’s just no evidence that it causes abortion , ” said Baylor College of Medicine professor Paul Fine , who also serves as medical director for Planned Parenthood in Houston and Southeast Texas .
On Thursday , the FDA ’s advisers will weigh HRA Pharma ’s data and offer recommendations before the agency later makes its approval decision .
Watson shares were up 50 cents , or 1.2 percent , to $ 43.20 in morning trade .
Teva shares were up 6 cents to $ 53.34 in New York .
Najiba scrabbles through cupboards frantic for something sweet .
She claws at her mother , urging her to help .
Najiba , though only 13 years old , lives in the Sanga Amaj drug addiction rehab clinic in Kabul with her mother , Zainab – who is also an opium addict , a habit acquired from her husband and passed on to her daughter .
“ When she was born , she kept crying , so after two months or so I started giving her opium to keep her quiet , ” says Zainab .
( Her and Najiba ’s names have been changed to protect their privacy . )
The result is a drug dependency that Najiba is now desperately fighting .
Yet she is neither alone among Afghan children addicted to opium , nor among the worst affected .
For starters , she ’s one of a small minority getting professional help .
Opium as a pacifier
Opium is used in parts of Afghanistan to quiet babies and , in poorer households without access to medical help , to relieve pain – trends exacerbated by decades of conflict .
Economic pressures and fragmented families have meant that women have less help at home and are more likely to give opium to cranky children , to free themselves up to do housework .
“ Opium is sometimes used as a child - rearing method , ” says Preeti Shah , a Narcotics Affairs Officer of the US Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs ( INL ) in Kabul .
The conflict has also left people with deep physical psychological wounds , which they try to numb with narcotics .
A two - year pilot study by the INL on drug addiction and household toxicity in Afghanistan found that babies as young as nine months were testing positive for narcotics , says Thom Browne , deputy director of the INL ’s anticrime programs .
It also found that in many cases , the level of toxicity in young children was several times higher than that in adult heroin users .
The study , which looked at 30 households in three provinces , will be expanded to cover 2,000 households in 22 provinces next year .
While other countries also face cases of babies born with addiction , in Afghanistan the problem deepens as parents continue to administer drugs to their children .
According to a recent report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) , up to half of drug users surveyed gave their children opium .
The INL found in their study of Afghan drug users ’ homes significant samples of opium in the air , bedding , eating utensils , toys , and other items that children come into contact with .
Treatment as taboo
Treating drug addiction is not easy anywhere , but is especially difficult in Afghanistan because of social and cultural stigmas against females going outside the home .
Many families are reluctant to let women come and stay at Sanga Amaj for the 45 - day treatment period , let alone the preferred 90 - day period , says Latifa Hamidi , the doctor who oversees the clinic .
Even surveying women proved near impossible – they constituted only 3 percent of the UNODC ’s sample size .
Even more helpful would be treat the entire family , says Gilberto Gerra , the UNODC ’s chief of drug prevention .
Otherwise , “ if a woman goes back to a home where her husband is using drugs , the risk of relapse is very high . ”
Although cultural taboos prohibit men and women being treated together , the INL hopes to build treatment centers for men and women near one another , to allow family members to visit one another .
Sanga Amaj , which opened in 2007 , represents a step in that direction , by treating women and their children together .
The clinic ’s 33 patients include 15 children , the youngest of whom is 3 years old .
Zainab and Najiba have been here for two weeks .
In addition to attending group therapy sessions and receiving medical treatment , during they day they exercise , sit in religion classes , and learn skills like sewing and embroidery .
At the end of their time , they will go home to Zainab ’s husband , who has already undergone treatment .
If Zainab and Najiba stay clean , they will be entitled to free medicine from the clinic .
Facilities like Sanga Amaj are few .
Kabul only has four , which can handle about 100 patients .
Of Afghanistan ’s 1 million drug users , at least 90 percent have no access to treatment , according to the UNODC .
Expanding treatment facilities would require considerable foreign aid and expertise , but does not rank high on donors ’ list of priorities .
These include instead ending the poppy farming and drug trade that make Afghanistan the supplier of 90 percent of the world ’s opium .
“ Afghanistan is known for being a supply country , ” says Ms. Shah .
“ It is time to recognize it is a demand country as well . ”

( CNN ) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez Sunday said his country will stop exporting oil to the United States if there is a military attack stemming from escalating tensions between Venezuela and Colombia .
Speaking at a political rally , Chavez warned of a military attack from Colombia , and accused the United States of being behind such an attack .
" The Yankee empire has no limit to its manipulation , " Chavez said .
Colombia and Venezuela are at odds over accusations that Colombian rebels have found refuge in Venezuela .
Colombia called an emergency meeting of the Organization of American States last week , in which it provided photos that it said were evidence of camps belonging to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -- known by its Spanish abbreviation , FARC -- in Venezuela .
Venezuela denies the accusations , and in response broke off diplomatic ties with the neighboring country .
If there is an attack from Colombia , Chavez said Sunday , Venezuela would stop supplying oil to the United States , " even if we have to eat rocks " because of the repercussions .
" That would be a response of dignity and high caliber , " Chavez said .
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration , Venezuela is the fifth - largest supplier of crude oil to the United States , delivering an average of 894,000 barrels of oil per day .
He also warned there would be " internal measures " in Venezuela against the opposition and media in case of a war .
He accused opposition governors of being in contact with the Colombian military .
Chavez said Venezuela rejected the possibility of any foreign guerrilla or paramilitary group to operate in his country .
Colombia has accused Chavez of supporting the rebels , and Chavez has said Colombian officials and right - wing paramilitary units have plotted his assassination .
Security analysts say FARC guerrillas operate mostly in Colombia but have carried out extortion , kidnappings and other activities in Venezuela , Panama and Ecuador .
FARC is said to traffic in cocaine to finance its insurgency .
Colombia has also accused another neighbor , Ecuador , of giving refuge to rebels .
In 2008 , Colombia carried out a raid in Ecuadorian territory that resulted in the killing of a top FARC leader .
Last week was not the first time Chavez cut off diplomatic ties with Colombia .
A year ago , Chavez " froze " the nations ' relationship over Colombian accusations that Venezuelan weapons had made it into the hands of rebels .
Colombia said it had evidence that shoulder - fired anti-tank weapons recovered from FARC guerrillas were of Venezuelan origin .
Venezuela denied the allegations and said the rebels may have stolen the weapons from a Venezuelan base .
Wall Street Journal : “ The order was short , swift , and largely flew under the radar ”
Last winter ’s Supreme Court decision in the Citizens United case , which lifted restrictions on corporate spending in elections , had been widely anticipated and aroused immediate outrage .
It appears , however , that Citizens United was far from the last move in what the Wall Street Journal describes as the Court ’s sweeping “ overhaul of the nation ’s campaign - financing laws . ”

In a brief , one - page decision issued on Tuesday , the Supreme Court cut off additional matching funds for three Arizona candidates who are participating in that state ’s public campaign finance system for the upcoming August 24 primary , thereby significantly benefiting a fourth candidate who has not accepted public financing .
“ Suddenly , three candidates , including Gov. Jan Brewer , can no longer receive public funds they had counted on to run against a free - spending wealthy opponent , ” the New York Times explained in an editorial titled “ Keeping Politics Safe for the Rich . ”
“ It seems likely that the Roberts court will use this case to continue its destruction of the laws and systems set up in recent decades to reduce the influence of big money in politics , ” the Times continued .
“ By the time it is finished , millionaires and corporations will have regained an enormous voice in American politics , at the expense of candidates who have to raise money the old - fashioned way and , ultimately , at the expense of voters . ”
Under Arizona ’s Clean Elections program , which was enacted in 1998 following a gambling - related bribery scandal , if one candidate in a state election decides to forego public funding in order to seek large private donations , the other candidates become entitled to additional matching funds .
Several conservative candidates had challenged this system on the grounds that it “ chilled ” their freedom of speech by giving them a motivation to limit their own private spending .
The challengers were represented by a lawyer from the Institute for Justice , a libertarian public interest firm , funded by right - wing foundations , which seeks to eliminate all government regulation of business .

Although a District Court initially ruled in the plaintiffs ’ favor , the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overruled that decision in May , saying that the matching funds impose no more than a “ minimal burden ” on free speech rights and that this is justified in light of Arizona ’s “ long history ” of political corruption .
The plaintiffs sought an emergency stay of the decision from the Supreme Court , and that has now been granted .
The plaintiffs intend further to seek a full review of the case by the Court , which would almost certainly have the effect of preventing the use of matching funds in next fall ’s general election , since a ruling would probably not come until after November .
Any such ruling could derail similar public campaign financing systems in other states , as well .
Because what the Times described as “ the court ’s reckless order muscling into the race ” simply granted a stay on a lower court decision , there was no indication as to the grounds for the order or whether there were any dissents .
“ An opinion explaining its reasoning will have to wait until the next term , ” the Times noted , “ assuming it takes the case , but by that time the stateÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s general election will be over and its model campaign finance system substantially demolished . ”

According to the Washington Post , “ Brewer and other gubernatorial candidates who agreed to public financing will see their expected money drop from a little more than $ 2.1 million to $ 707,447 under the state formula .
Businessman Buz Mills , a privately funded candidate in the Republican primary , already has spent nearly $ 2.3 million . ”
“ We think this will throw the Arizona election cycle into chaos , ” David Donnelly of the group Public Campaign told the Post .
“ The court is preventing them from running the campaign they signed up to run . ”
A DARWIN restaurant owner has launched a tirade against a group of mothers - suggesting they " keep their legs closed " - after one diner brought her 11 - week - old baby to his eatery .
He then accused one woman of having " saggy tits " and suggested another had a " floppy c ... " .
Tramontana restaurant owner John Spellman refused to discuss the incident with the Northern Territory News yesterday .
" Who cares , " he said when asked about the matter .
Health worker Katie , 35 , who asked not to have her surname published , said she booked the dinner for five women - including a mother with a newborn - on Wednesday night at the exclusive $ 1.7 million Italian restaurant .
" I rang in the morning to make sure we could bring a pram , because some places you can 't , " she said .
" As we walked out , he yelled out ' you ladies better keep your legs together or you will end up like your friend ' . "
Public servant Amy , 27 , was also with the group and confronted Mr Spellman about his comments .
" He went on about how he had two women in his establishment with babies , and he thought he was on best behaviour , considering the other woman started breast feeding , " she said .
" When I called him a bastard , he said my friend had saggy tits .
And I probably had a floppy ' c ' .
He actually used the word . "
Mr Spellman gained worldwide attention earlier this year when he charged patrons $ 10 for wearing thongs .
When a customer complained , he took a $ 10 note out of the register and said : " Buy yourself a hamburger " .
Interested in Android but think you need to buy a new phone to try it out ?
Actually , your Windows Mobile phone may already have the capability of running Android .
Today we show you how and the type of phone you ’ll need .
Update :
This article was written 5 years ago , and as far as we know this process does n’t work anymore on modern phones .
It ’s certainly possible that you can still run Android on a Windows mobile phone , but we do n’t have a good solution to give you .
We recommend asking about your specific phone model over on the XDA Developer forums .
Installing Android
To run Android you will need a microSD card that is not SDHC ( typically a card less than 2GB ) and a supported Windows Mobile phone ( see below ) .
You can check your microSD card compatibility by looking at the card to see if it shows the “ HC ” label .
The microSD card will need to be formatted in FAT32 .
Plug the microSD card into the computer and right click on it and choose format .
Note : Formatting a microSD drive will erase everything on that drive .
Make sure you have any important files backed up before you format it .
Now that the microSD card is formatted , the first step to installing Android is finding the right Android port for your phone ( see below ) .
You will need to find the port that works on your phone as well as the version of Android you want to run .
Versions start at 1.0 but typically you will find ports for version 1.6 or 2.1 .
Once you have found the right port for your phone and Android version you want to use , extract the files to a folder using 7 - zip .
After the files have extracted there should be a folder called “ andboot ” .
Go into the andboot folder and there will be another folder called “ startup config ” or “ startup ” .
Open this folder and you will need to find the right startup .
txt file for your phone .
Inside each folder will be a single “ startup.txt ” file .
Copy the file for your phone model to the root of the andboot folder .
This file will tell Android what type of hardware you have , how big your screen is , how much RAM your phone has etc .
so it is very important to choose the right file .
If you are confused on what these phone names are please read below on finding your phone model .
Once you have moved the correct startup .
txt file to the andboot folder , copy the entire andboot folder to the root of your newly formatted microSD card .
Plug the microSD card back in the phone and open the file browser on your phone and browse to the memory card .
Make sure the phone is plugged into power before the next few steps because on some phones running on battery may cause the phone to hang .
Open the andboot folder and run haret.exe .
If the right startup . txt file is in the root of the andboot folder you should be able to click “ Run ” and you will get a quick loading screen while haret turns off Windows Mobile and starts up Android .
You should get some scrolling text and probably a nice Android logo while the phone boots up the first time .
Note :
The first boot is going to take a considerably longer time than subsequent boots .
and you may need to calibrate your screen during the boot process so make sure you keep an eye on it .
Once the basic Linux settings are done your new “ Android ” phone will boot to a welcome screen so you can walk through the rest of the settings like setting up your email account .
Tip :
If you are running Android on a phone that does not have an active data plan but does have wifi , you can get around the startup screen by tapping on the welcome screen in this order : top left corner , top right corner , bottom right corner , bottom left corner then tap the Android logo .
You can then enable wifi and join a network and set up your gmail account manually .
It is usually recommended that you leave your phone alone while it syncs your information for at least 10 minutes .
Once the initial syncing is done the phone should start running faster and you can play around with installing apps .
If you do n’t wait for the phone to fully sync you may have problems with apps crashing prematurely and a force close dialog popping up .
Change any settings and install any apps you want , they will be saved to your memory card and ready on next boot .
All phones that run Android from the microSD card will automatically boot Windows Mobile when the phone restarts .
To run Android again , just open the file browser and run haret . exe again .
Android Ports
There are a few different Android ports for Windows Mobile devices and each one supports a different family of device ; each family of device has a varying amount of hardware support .
Most phones will support the touch screen , hardware buttons , cell phone radio , and data connection , but some ports may not support bluetooth , GPS , or power management .
This is not a complete list of Android ports available , but it should cover the most popular Windows Mobile phones .
Almost all Android development on Windows Mobile phones started with the development on theHTC Touch ( also known as the HTC Vogue and the Verizon xv6900 ) .
The HTC Touch has 100 % of the hardware features working and even some features that were not available in official Windows Mobile ROMs .
One of the main differences between Android for the Touch and Android for every other phone is the Touch allows for Android to be flashed to the phone ’s ROM ( NAND memory ) .
This was a big break through for Android development and has increased battery life and speed greatly .
Running Android on the Touch can be done following the steps above but it is recommended to run Android by flashing the phones NAND memory .
To learn how to do that , start at the Android Touch FAQ thread at XDA - Developers .
Android ports for the HTC Touch can also be used on the following phones with varying success .
HTC Nike ( Neon )
HTC Polaris ( Touch Cruise )
HTC Kaiser ( TyTN II )
HTC Titan ( Mogul , xv6800 )
Note : HTC phones all have proper names that come from HTC and in many cases each carrier will give the phone its own branding and rename the phone to something else .
For example , the HTC Titan was called the Mogul on Sprint and the xv6800 on Verizon .
To find the Android port for your phone , start by finding the proper HTC name of your device .
Start on HTC ’s site to discover your device ’s official name .
XDAndroid supports the most popular touch screen HTC Windows Mobile phones and if you bought a touch screen HTC Windows Mobile phone within the past year , most likely this port will support your phone .
XDAndroid runs directly from the phones microSD memory card on the following phones :
Touch Pro ( Fuze , RAPH , RAPH800 , RAPH500 )
Touch Diamond ( DIAMOND , DIAM500 )
Touch HD ( BLACKSTONE )
GSM Touch Pro2 ( TILT2 , RHODIUM , RHOD400 , RHOD500 )
GSM Touch Diamond2 ( TOPAZ )
Andromnia is an Android port for Samsung devices .
Currently this port is in the pre-alpha stages and things like the headset speaker does not work .
But if you want to test it out it supports the following phones :
Samsung i900 ( GSM , supported worldwide )
Samsung i910 ( CDMA , used by Verizon in the US )
Samsung i780 ( Mirage )
Samsung i907 ( AT&T Epix )
Wing Linux is n’t as quickly developed as XDAndroid but should get the job done if your phone is n’t supported by any other port .
Wing Linux supports the following phones to varying degrees :
HTC Artemis
HTC Elf , HTC Elfin
HTC Excalibur , T - Mobile Dash
HTC Gene , HTC P3400
HTC Herald , T - Mobile Wing
HTC Opal , HTC Touch Viva
HTC Pharos
HTC Prophet
HTC Startrek
HTC Wizard
Asus P320 , Galaxi Mini
You may also want to look at threads for the following phones to check the status of Android on these phones .
Sony Xperia 1
HTC Leo ( HD2 )

If you have n't been watching Rachel Maddow 's stellar reporting on Afghanistan , get thee to The Maddow Blog and watch the clips there .
Her remarkable reports are worth every second of the time you spend to watch .
This is the first time I 've seen a journalist really try to get beyond the basics of the Afghan war and into the details of what our military is actually doing , what they hope to accomplish , and how they 're going about accomplishing it .
Rachel Maddow is hardly a hawk , so part of the remarkable quality of her reporting is seeing her come to an understanding that much of what 's being done involves helping people , not killing them .
This clearly does n't fit the story they want to tell on The Today Show .
Watch the video as Rachel is questioned about the July deadline and the supposed " delayed Kandahar strategy . "
Maddow 's answers are clear :
You 're not going to see a war movie in Kandahar , and the deadline is an absolute necessity to keep pressure on the Afghan government to get in line and work to get the people they govern on board .
But watch Ann Curry try to get her to get all rah-rah about combat and the deadline .
CURRY : In fact , let 's talk about that .
It 's a year from now that the US troops are scheduled to leave .
We 're 104 months into this war , Afghanistan is now the longest war in US history .
June was the deadliest month in the war with 60 Americans killed , Rachel .
And so is this president 's deadline of leaving a year from now , beginning to withdraw a year from now , actually realistic ?
Translated : FOX thinks a deadline is foolish .
Do n't you think so too , Rachel ?
And Rachel 's answer is perfect , because it 's the truth and it makes sense .
That July deadline is n't just there for show :
MADDOW : There have been a lot of critics who have said that that deadline does n't make sense in terms of military strategy .
But I think that 's only true if you think of war , this kind of war , as if it 's some kind of D - Day every day .
It 's really not like that .
Counterinsurgency does n't look like that .
The point of this counterinsurgency strategy is to set up an Afghan government so that Afghanistan is essentially hardened against the Taliban coming back into power and against them link -- them -- Afghanistan again linking up with these extremist groups .
The deadline is not for military strategy in pure military terms .
The deadline is so the Afghan government feels like they 've really got to get their act together and stand up and get it done .
I have to tell you that , you know , the counterinsurgency doctrine may not work .
It may not work no matter what we do to set up -- try to set up Afghan government here .
But it definitely wo n't work without a deadline , at least in Kandahar , not based on what I 've seen after this latest embedding .
Undeterred , Curry pivots back to the " major offensive " theme , looking for some affirmation of war movie - style blood and guts fighting :
CURRY : You 've been talking about community building there in Kandahar , the city of Kandahar proper .
But Richard has been just reporting that part of General Petraeus ' strategy , new strategy , will be to intensify the fight against the Taliban .
So what are you learning there about how fierce the combat in the wider region might be in the coming months ?
MADDOW : Well , we saw some , I think , foreshadowing of it in the Helmand province fighting that we saw starting in mid-February , led by the US Marines and also by British forces .
There will definitely be highly kinetic combat operations in areas outside Kandahar city sometime between now and the end of the year .
However , that 's not the whole operation in Kandahar .
Really , the bulk of what 's happening in Kandahar is trying to set up law and order there , trying to link people with their government and hopefully link Kandahar government with Kabul .
The -- linking Kandahar to Kabul is something that historically would be rather unique in this country .
It 's a very ambitious doctrine .
But we should n't expect this to be something that 's decided on the basis of the success of those combat operations .
Counterinsurgency is much more about governance than it is just about house to house or orchard to orchard fighting .
And be sure to watch the end where Rachel really shows respect for the troops , their abilities , and her belief that if it can be done at all , they will do it .
It may not fit the mainline narrative , but it feels much closer to the truth .
The six - month election recount that turned former " Saturday Night Live " comedian Al Franken into a U.S. senator may have been decided by convicted felons who voted illegally in Minnesota 's Twin Cities .
That 's the finding of an 18 - month study conducted by Minnesota Majority , a conservative watchdog group , which found that at least 341 convicted felons in largely Democratic Minneapolis - St.
Paul voted illegally in the 2008 Senate race between Franken , a Democrat , and his Republican opponent , then - incumbent Sen. Norm Coleman .
The final recount vote in the race , determined six months after Election Day , showed Franken beat Coleman by 312 votes -- fewer votes than the number of felons whose illegal ballots were counted , according to Minnesota Majority 's newly released study , which matched publicly available conviction lists with voting records .
Furthermore , the report charges that efforts to get state and federal authorities to act on its findings have been " stonewalled . "
" We are n't trying to change the result of the last election .
That legally can't be done , " said Dan McGrath , Minnesota Majority 's executive director .
" We are just trying to make sure the integrity of the next election is n't compromised . "
He said his group was largely ignored when it turned over a list of hundreds of names to prosecutors in two of the state 's largest counties , Ramsey and Hennepin , where fraud seemed to be the greatest .
A spokesman for both county attorneys ' offices belittled the information , saying it was " just plain wrong " and full of errors , which prompted the group to go back and start an in - depth look at the records .
" What we did this time is irrefutable , " McGrath said .
" We took the voting lists and matched them with conviction lists and then went back to the records and found the roster lists , where voters sign in before walking to the voting booth , and matched them by hand .
" The only way we can be wrong is if someone with the same first , middle and last names , same year of birth as the felon , and living in the same community , has voted .
And that is n't very likely . "
The report said that in Hennepin County , which in includes Minneapolis , 899 suspected felons had been matched on the county 's voting records , and the review showed 289 voters were conclusively matched to felon records .
The report says only three people in the county have been charged with voter fraud so far .
A representative of the Hennepin County attorney 's office , who declined to give her name , said " there was no one in the office today to talk about the charges . "
But the report got a far different review in Ramsey County , which contains St. Paul .
Phil Carruthers of the Ramsey County attorney 's office said his agency had taken the charges " very seriously " and found that the Minnesota Majority " had done a good job in their review . "
The report says that in Ramsey , 460 names on voting records were matched with felon lists , and a further review found 52 were conclusive matches .
Carruthers attributed differences in the numbers to Minnesota Majority 's lack of access to nonpublic information , such as exact birth dates and other court records .
For example , he said , " public records might show a felon was given 10 years probation , but internal records the county attorney has might show that the probation period was cut to five and the felon was eligible to vote . "
Carruthers said Ramsey County is still investigating all the names and has asked that more investigators be hired to complete the process .
" So far we have charged 28 people with felonies , have 17 more under review and have 182 cases still open , " he said .
" And there is a good chance we may match or even exceed their numbers . "
McGrath says the report shows that more still has to be done .
" Prosecutors have to act more swiftly in prosecuting cases from the 2008 election to deter fraud in the future , " he said , " and the state has to make sure that existing system , that flags convicted felons so voting officials can challenge them at the ballot , is effective .
In 90 percent of the cases we looked at , the felons were n't flagged . "
" If the state had done that , " he said , " things might be very different today . "
Gay Hate Crimes Double in Canada
The number of crimes motivated by sexual orientation in Canada more than doubled from 2007 to 2008 , according to the latest numbers from Statistics Canada .
Crimes against gays increased from 71 incidents in 2007 to 159 in 2008 .
Also disturbing is that in 75 % of those instances , hate crimes were described as violent , involving assault or the uttering of threats .
According to the LGBT human rights organization Egale Canada , an estimated 75 % of hate crimes against LGBT people go unreported .
In response to the report , Egale Canada executive director Helen Kennedy called for improved diversity education in Canada 's schools .
In an interview following Barack Obama ’s momentous presidential victory , Nobel Prize - winning economist Paul Krugman was asked what he ’d like to hear in the new president ’s Inaugural Address .
“ I want him to call for something like a new New Deal , ” he offered .
“ Look , we ’ve gone off the rails .
Not everything ’s been bad these past couple of decades , but we lost sight of having a society that works for everybody , we lost sight of a society that provides basic security .
We need to recapture some of those values that have made us successful . ”
Krugman was talking about liberalism – a recaptured kind .
We as Canadians tend to view politics south of the border as alternate swinging between Republicans and Democrats , but it is , in fact , longer in scope .
American politics alternates between thirty - year periods of the ideas of your on your own and the idea that we ’re all in this together .
The strange thing about classical liberalism is that it embraced both these concepts .
Understood in its historical context , liberalism is all about individual freedom .
But at the same time it ’s about how a free and personally enlightened people come together to build societies that are both innovative and collective .
Regardless , the absolute epicenter of liberal thought is the individual – everything else plays out from there .
The institution of government , then , is seen as both a safeguard and an empowerer of the individual citizen .
I realize that this might be boring to some , but it ’s a necessary base for us to build if we are to conceive of why liberalism in Canada , especially in its political emanation – the Liberal Party of Canada – has lost its way .
Liberalism ’s arrival on the heels of the Enlightenment turned prevailing wisdom on its head .
Almost from humanity ’s beginning it was assumed that people lived for the sake of the State and its rulers .
Suddenly Liberals were saying that the opposite was true .
People possessed rights by natural law and governments received their sanction from those individuals .
Put another way : government is not the giver of rights to the people because , in reality , the people are the source of legitimacy and authority of the government .
It was a novel concept , and with the steady rise in economies it became the prevailing view in Western democracies .
Coming into our present age , liberalism still challenges us to apply our rational minds to our respective environments .
Life requires freedom if it is to be progressive , and that freedom gives humans the rights to property and to the retention of their income .
It is for this reason that governments are created – to protect these inalienable rights of the individual .
So much for this first history lesson .
Putting it in today ’s context , it would logically mean that the essential meaning of liberalism today would be found in the empowerment of the individual .
Yet following a history as Canada ’s “ natural governing party , ” today ’s Liberal Party spends an inordinate amount of time talking about institutional politics and policy as opposed to the key role of the citizen as an agent of progress .
One of our key weaknesses as a national party at present is our distance – physical , emotional , empathetic – from the average lives of citizens .
Gone are the days when the Liberal Party could attract candidates from unions , social agencies , environmental groups , anti-poverty advocates , and even small business associations .
This hurts , but it ’s true .
Like it or not , today ’s Liberal Party is often viewed as elitist , out of touch with daily pressures of average people and groups .
Perhaps its having power that does this , because the Conservative Party itself has put increasing distance between itself and its grassroots base , much to the chagrin of many in the party .
Liberals must confront this peril of distance if they are again to achieve relevance .
If the power of the individual is the true basis of Liberal philosophy , then just defending policy wo n’t cut it – we have to once again reach out and touch the individual citizen .
American humourist Henry Mencken once observed , “ The Liberals have many tails , and chase them all . ”
And that indeed is our present predicament .
We have a multitude of policies but no one philosophy ; a plethora of concerns but no cause ; an army of advisors but few advocates .
We are at present a corporate idea with no citizens .
It ’s either back to the individual citizen or recurring years in the wildnerness .

A NASA Scientist Answers the Top 20 Questions About 2012
PUBLIC CONCERN ABOUT DOOMSDAY IN December 2012 has blossomed into a major new presence on the Internet .
This fear has begun to invade cable TV and Hollywood , and it is rapidly spreading internationally .
The hoax originally concerned a return of the fictitious planet Nibiru in 2012 , but it received a big boost when conspiracy theory websites began to link it to the end of the Mayan calendar long count at the winter solstice ( December 21 ) of 2012 .
Over the past year , many unrelated groups have joined the doomsday chorus , including Nostradamus advocates , a wide variety of eschatological Christian , Native American , and spiritualist sects , and those who fear comet and asteroid impacts or violent solar storms .
At the time of this writing there are more than 175 books listed on Amazon.com dealing with the 2012 doomsday .
The most popular topics are the Mayan calendar and spiritual predictions that the disaster in 2012 will usher in a new age of happiness and spiritual growth .
Quite a few authors are cashing in with manuals on how to survive 2012 .
As this hoax spreads , many more doomsday scenarios are being suggested , mostly unrelated to Nibiru .
These include a reversal of the Earth ’s magnetic field , severe solar storms associated with the 11 - year solar cycle ( which may peak in 2012 ) , a reversal of Earth ’s rotation axis , a 90 - degree flip of the rotation axis , bombardment by large comets or asteroids , bombardment by gamma rays , or various unspecified lethal rays coming from the center of the Milky Way Galaxy or the “ dark rift ” seen in a nearby galactic spiral arm .
A major theme has become celestial alignments : supposedly the Sun will align with the galactic center ( or maybe with the Milky Way Dark Rift ) on December 21 , 2012 , subjecting us to mysterious and potentially deadly forces .
Unlike most pseudoscience stories , there seems to be no factual core on which the Nibiru - 2012 hoax has been constructed .
This is different from , for example , the claims of aliens and a crashed UFO at Roswell , New Mexico .
The alien stories are a fabrication , but the core fact is that an instrumented balloon did crash in Roswell on July 7 , 1947 .
There is no similar factual core to Nibiru — just dubious “ predictions ” from psychics , or the Mayans , or Nostradamus .
The rest is pure fiction .
I answer questions from the public submitted online to a NASA website , and over the past two years the Nibiru - 2012 doomsday has become the dominant topic people ask about .
Many are curious about things they have seen on the Internet or TV , but many are also angry about supposed government cover-ups .
As one wrote “ Why are you lying about Nibiru ?
Everyone knows it is coming . ”
Others are genuinely frightened that the world will end just three years from now .
My frustration in answering questions piecemeal motivates this “ Twenty Questions ” format to organize the facts and shine a skeptical light on this accumulation of myths and hoaxes .
1 . What is the origin of the prediction that the world will end in December 2012 ?
The story started with claims that Nibiru , a supposed planet discovered by the Sumerians , is headed toward Earth .
Zecharia Sitchin , who writes fiction about the ancient Mesopotamian civilization of Sumer , claimed in several books ( e.g. , The Twelfth Planet , published in 1976 ) that he has found and translated Sumerian documents that identify the planet Nibiru , orbiting the Sun every 3600 years .
These Sumerian fables include stories of “ ancient astronauts ” visiting Earth from a civilization of aliens called the Anunnaki .
Then Nancy Lieder , a self - declared psychic who claims she is channeling aliens , wrote on her website Zetatalk that the inhabitants of a fictional planet around the star Zeta Reticuli warned her that the Earth was in danger from Planet X or Nibiru .
This catastrophe was initially predicted for May 2003 , but when nothing happened the doomsday date was recalculated ( a standard procedure for doomsdayers ) and moved forward to December 2012 .
Only recently have these two fables been linked to the end of the Mayan long - count at the winter solstice in 2012 — hence the predicted doomsday date of December 21 , 2012 .
2 . The Sumerians were the first great civilization , and they made many accurate astronomical predictions , including the existence of the planets Uranus , Neptune and Pluto .
So why should we not believe their predictions about Nibiru ?
Nibiru is a name from Babylonian astrology sometimes associated with the god Marduk .
Nibiru appears as a minor character in the Babylonian creation poem Enuma Elish as recorded in the library of Assurbanipal , King of Assyria ( 668–627 BCE ) .
Sumer flourished much earlier , from about the 23rd century to the 17th century BCE .
The claims that Nibiru is a planet and was known to the Sumerians are contradicted by scholars who ( unlike Zecharia Sitchin ) study and translate the written records of ancient Mesopotamia .
Sumer was indeed a great civilization , important for the development of agriculture , water management , urban life , and especially writing .
However , they left few astronomical records and they most certainly did not know about Uranus , Neptune or Pluto .
They also had no understanding that the planets orbited the Sun , an idea that first developed in ancient Greece two millennia after the end of Sumer .
Claims that Sumerians had a sophisticated astronomy , or that they even had a god named Nibiru , are the product of Sitchin ’s imagination .
3 . How can you deny the existence of Nibiru when NASA discovered it in 1983 and the story appeared in leading newspapers ?
At that time you called it Planet X , and later it was named Xena or Eris .
IRAS ( the NASA Infrared Astronomy Satellite , which carried out a sky survey for 10 months in 1983 ) discovered many infrared sources , but none of them was Nibiru or Planet X or any other objects in the outer solar system .
Briefly , IRAS cataloged 350,000 infrared sources , and initially many of these sources were unidentified ( which was the point , of course , of making such a survey ) .
All of these observations have been followed up by subsequent studies with more powerful instruments both on the ground and in space .
The rumor about a “ tenth planet ” erupted in 1984 after a scientific paper was published in Astrophysical Journal Letters titled “ Unidentified point sources in the IRAS minisurvey , ” which discussed several infrared sources with “ no counterparts . ”
But these “ mystery objects ” were subsequently found to be distant galaxies ( except one , which was a wisp of “ infrared cirrus ” ) , as published in 1987 .
No IRAS source has ever turned out to be a planet .
A good discussion of this whole issue is to be found on Phil Plait ’s website .
The bottom line is that Nibiru is a myth , with no basis in fact .
To an astronomer , persistent claims about a planet that is “ nearby ” but “ invisible ” are just plain silly .
4 . Maybe we should be asking about Planet X or Eris , not Nibiru .
Why does NASA keep secret the orbit of Eris ?
“ Planet X ” is an oxymoron when applied to a real object .
The generic term has been used by astronomers over the past century for a possible or suspected object .
Once the object is found , it is given a real name , as was done with Pluto and Eris , both of which were once referred to as Planet X .
If a new object turns out to be not real , or not a planet , then you wo n’t hear about it again .
If it is real , it is no longer called Planet X . Eris is one of several dwarf planets recently found by astronomers in the outer solar system , all of them on normal orbits that will never bring them near Earth .
Like Pluto , Eris is smaller than our Moon .
It is very far away , and its orbit never brings it closer than about 4 billion miles .
There is no secret about Eris or its orbit , as you can easily verify by googling it or looking it up in Wikipedia .
5 . Do you deny that NASA built a South Pole Telescope ( SPT ) to track Nibiru ?
Why else would they build a telescope at the South Pole ?
There is a telescope at the South Pole , but it was not built by NASA and it is not used to study Nibiru .
The South Pole Telescope is supported by the National Science Foundation , and it is a radio telescope , not an optical instrument .
It can not take visible light images or photos .
You can look it up on Wikipedia .
The Antarctic is a great place for astronomical infrared and short - wave - radio observations , and it also has the advantage that objects can be observed continuously without the interference of the day - night cycle .
I should add that it is impossible to imagine a way in which an object can be seen only from the South Pole .
Even if it were due south of the Earth , it could be seen from the entire southern hemisphere .
6 . There are many photos and videos of Nibiru on the Internet .
Is n’t that proof that it exists ?
The great majority of the photos and videos on the Internet are of some feature near the Sun ( apparently supporting the claim that Nibiru has been hiding behind the Sun for the past several years ) .
These are actually false images of the Sun caused by internal reflections in the lens , often called lens flare .
You can identify them easily by the fact that they appear diametrically opposite the real solar image , as if reflected across the center of the image .
This is especially obvious in videos , where as the camera moves , the false image dances about always exactly opposite the real image .
Similar lens flare is a source of many UFO photos taken at night with strong light sources such as streetlights in the frame .
I am surprised that more people do n’t recognize this common photo artifact .
I am also amazed that these photos showing something nearly as large and bright as the Sun ( a “ second sun ” ) are accepted together with claims made on some of the same websites that Nibiru is too faint to be seen or photographed except with large telescopes .
One widely reported telescopic photo shows two views of an expanding gas cloud far beyond the solar system , which is not moving ; you can see this from the fact that the stars are the same in both pictures .
A sharp - eyed reader on my website identified these photos as a gas shell around the star V838 Mon. Wikipedia has a nice write - up and a beautiful photo of it from the Hubble .
Another high school student was initially impressed by posted images of a red blob that were said to be of Nibiru .
Then he worked out in his Photoshop class how to make just such pictures starting from scratch .
One video posted in summer 2008 on YouTube shows a guy standing in his kitchen claiming that one of the objects discovered by NASA ’s x-ray telescope is Nibiru .
What is his evidence ?
That since this false - color x-ray image released by NASA is blue , this must really be a nearby planet with an ocean .
This would be hilarious if it were not used to frighten people .
7 . Can you explain the fact that the area at ( 5h 53 m 27s , - 6 10 ′ 58 ″ ) has been blackened out in Google Sky and Microsoft Telescope ?
People suggest that these have been blackened out because those are the co-ordinates where Nibiru is located at present .
Several people have asked me about this blank rectangle in Orion in Google Sky , which is a presentation of images from the Sloan Digital Survey .
This ca n’t be a “ hiding place ” for Nibiru , since it is a part of the sky that could be seen from almost everywhere on the Earth in the winter of 2007 –08 when much of the talk about Nibiru began .
Plus , that would contradict the claims that Nibiru was hiding behind the Sun or that it could be seen only from the southern hemisphere .
But I too was curious about this blank rectangle , so I asked a friend who is a senior scientist at Google .
He replied that he “ found out that the missing data is due to a processing error in the image stitching program we use to display the Sloan survey images .
The team assures me that in the next run through , this will be fixed ! ”
8 . If the government knew about Nibiru , would n’t they keep it a secret to avoid panic ?
Is n’t it the government ’s job to keep the population at ease ?
There are many objectives of government , but they do not include keeping the population at ease .
My experience is that sometimes parts of the government do just the opposite , as in the frequent references to various terrorist threats or warnings about driving accidents on long holiday weekends , which are no more dangerous than any other time .
There is a long history of associating bad things with political opponents ( older readers will remember the “ missile gap ” in the 1960 election , younger ones will note the many current references to who is or is not keeping the U.S. safe from terrorists ) .
Further , social scientists have pointed out that many of our concepts of public panic are the product of Hollywood , while in the real world people have a good record of helping each other in a time of danger .
I think everyone also recognizes that keeping bad news secret usually backfires , making the issue even worse when the facts finally come out .
And in the case of Nibiru , these facts would come out very soon indeed .
Even if it wanted to , however , the government could not keep Nibiru a secret .
If Nibiru were real , it would be tracked by thousands of astronomers , amateurs as well as professionals .
These astronomers are spread all over the world .
I know the astronomy community , and these scientists would not keep a secret even if ordered to .
You just ca n’t hide a planet on its way into the inner solar system !
9 . Why does the Mayan calendar say the world will end in 2012 ?
I have heard that they have been pretty accurate in the past with other planetary predictions .
How can you be sure you know more than they did ?
Calendars exist for keeping track of the passage of time , not for predicting the future .
The Mayan astronomers were clever , and they developed a very complex calendar .
Ancient calendars are interesting to historians , but of course they cannot match the ability we have today to keep track of time , or the precision of the calendars currently in use .
The main point , however , is that calendars , whether contemporary or ancient , cannot predict the future of our planet or warn of things to happen on a specific date such as 2012 .
I note that my desk calendar ends much sooner , on December 31 , 2009 , but I do not interpret this as a prediction of Armageddon .
It is just the beginning of a new year .
10 .
What is the polar shift theory ?
Is it true that the Earth ’s crust does a 180 - degree rotation around the core in a matter of days if not hours ?
Does this have something to do with our solar system dipping beneath the galactic equator ?
A reversal in the rotation of Earth is impossible .
It has never happened and never will .
There are slow movements of the continents ( for example Antarctica was near the equator hundreds of millions of years ago ) , but that is irrelevant to claims of reversal of the rotational poles .
However , many of the disaster websites pull a bait - and - switch to fool people .
They claim a relationship between the rotation and the magnetic field of Earth , which does change irregularly with a magnetic reversal taking place , on average , every 400,000 years .
As far as we know , such a magnetic reversal does not cause any harm to life on Earth .
A magnetic reversal is very unlikely to happen in the next few millennia , anyway .
But the 2012ers falsely claim that a magnetic reversal is coming soon ( in 2012 of course ) and that this is the same as , or will trigger , a reversal of Earth ’s rotational poles .
The bottom line is this : ( a ) rotation direction and magnetic polarity are not related ; ( b ) there is no reason to expect a reversal of magnetic polarity any time soon , or to anticipate any bad effects on life when it does eventually happen ; ( c ) a sudden shift in the rotational pole with disastrous consequences is impossible .
Also , none of this has anything to do with the galactic equator or any of the other nonsense about alignments that appears on many of the doomsday websites .
11 . When most of the planets align in 2012 and planet Earth is in the center of the Milky Way , what will the effects of this be on planet Earth ?
Could it cause a pole shift , and if so what could we expect ?
There is no planet alignment in 2012 or any other time in the next several decades .
As to the Earth being in the center of the Milky Way , I do n’t know what this phrase means .
If they are referring to the Milky Way Galaxy , we are some 30,000 light years from the center of this spiral galaxy .
We circle the galactic center in a period of 225 –250 million years , always keeping approximately the same distance .
Concerning a pole shift , I also do n’t know what this means .
If it means some sudden change in the position of the pole ( that is , the rotation axis of the Earth ) , then that is impossible , as noted above .
What many websites do discuss is the alignment of the Earth and Sun with the center of the Milky Way in the constellation of Sagittarius .
This happens every December , with no bad consequences , and there is no reason to expect 2012 to be different from any other year .
12 . When the Sun and the Earth line up on the galactic plane at the same time with the black hole being in the center could n’t that cause something to happen , due to the fact that the black hole has such a strong gravitational pull ?
There is a supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy , and like any concentration of mass it exerts gravitational force on the rest of the galaxy .
However , the galactic center is very far away , approximately 30,000 light years , so it has negligible effects on our solar system and Earth .
There are no special forces from the galactic plane or the galactic center .
The only important force that acts on the Earth is the gravitation of the Sun and Moon .
As far as the influence of the galactic plane , there is nothing special about this location .
The last time the Earth was in the galactic plane was several million years ago .
Claims that we are about to cross the galactic plane are untrue .
13 . I am scared about the fact that the Earth will enter the Dark Rift in the Milky Way .
What will this do ?
Will the Earth be swallowed up ?
The “ dark rift ” is a popular name for the broad and diffuse dust clouds in the inner arm of the Milky Way Galaxy , which block our view of the galactic center .
The entire “ galactic alignment ” scare is ridiculous .
Late in December the Sun is always approximately in the direction of the center of the Galaxy as seen from the Earth , but so what ?
Apparently the scaremongers have decided to use these meaningless phrases about “ alignments ” and the “ dark rift ” and “ photon belt ” precisely because they are not understood by the public .
As far as the safety of the Earth is concerned , the important threats are from global warming and loss of biological diversity , and perhaps someday from collision with an asteroid or comet , not the pseudoscientific claims about 2012 .
14 . I have heard that the Earth ’s magnetic field will flip in 2012 just when the strongest level of solar storms in history is predicted to take place .
Will this kill us or destroy our civilization ?
Near solar maximum ( which happens approximately every 11 years ) , there are many more solar flares and coronal mass ejections than near solar minimum .
Flares and mass ejections are no danger for humans or other life on Earth .
They could endanger astronauts in deep space or on the Moon , and this is something that NASA must learn to deal with , but it is not a problem for us .
Large outbursts can interrupt radio transmissions , cause bright displays of the aurora ( Northern and Southern Lights ) , and damage the electronics of some satellites in space .
Today many satellites are designed to deal with this possibility , for example by switching off some of their more delicate circuits and going into a “ safe ” mode for a few hours .
In extreme cases solar activity can also disrupt electrical transmissions on the ground , possibly leading to electrical blackouts , but this is rare .
The last solar maximum occurred in 2001 , so the next one was predicted for around 2012 , 11 years later .
However , the most recent solar minimum was unusual , with a period of a couple of years with almost no sunspots or other indications of solar activity , so scientists now guess that the next maximum will be delayed , perhaps to 2013 .
However , the details of the solar cycle remain basically unpredictable .
It is true that the Earth ’s magnetic field protects us by creating a large region in space , called the Earth ’s magnetosphere , within which most of the material ejected from the Sun is captured or deflected , but there is no reason to expect a reversal of magnetic polarity any time soon .
These magnetic reversals happen , on average , only once in 400,000 years .
15 . I am confused about a report on the Fox News website that in 2012 a “ Powerful Solar Storm Could Shut Down U.S. for Months . ”
They referred to a report from the National Academy of Sciences that was commissioned and paid for by NASA .
If nothing is going to happen as a result of the event in 2012 , why would NASA allow such nonsense to be reported ?
NASA is pleased with the National Research Council report on heliophysics .
As noted , this report includes a worst - case analysis of what could happen today if there were a repetition of the biggest solar storm ever recorded ( in 1859 ) .
The problem is the way such information can be used out of context .
There is no reason to expect such a large solar storm in the near future , certainly not in 2012 specifically .
The reference to “ the event in 2012 ” illustrates this problem .
There is no prediction of an “ event in 2012 . ”
We do n’t even know if the next solar maximum will take place in that year .
The whole 2012 disaster scenario is a hoax , fueled by ads for the Hollywood science - fiction disaster film 2012 .
I can only hope that most people are able to distinguish Hollywood film plots from reality .
16 .
All my school friends are telling me that we are all going to die in the year 2012 due to a meteor hitting Earth .
Is this true ?
The Earth has always been subject to impacts by comets and asteroids ( as has the Moon , as you can see because it has no atmosphere to erode the impact craters ) , although big hits are very rare .
The last big impact was 65 million years ago , and that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs .
Today NASA astronomers are carrying out the Spaceguard Survey to find any large near - Earth asteroids long before they hit .
We have already determined that there are no threatening asteroids as large as the one that killed the dinosaurs .
All this work is done openly with the discoveries posted every day on the NASA NEO Program Office website , so anyone can see that nothing is predicted to hit in 2012 .
17 . If Nibiru is a hoax , why does n’t NASA issue a denial ?
How can you permit these stories to circulate and frighten people ?
Why does n’t the U.S. government do something about it !
If you go to the NASA home page , nasa.gov , you will see many stories that expose the Nibiru - 2012 hoax .
Try searching nasa.com under “ Nibiru ” or “ 2012 ” .
There is not much more that NASA can do .
These hoaxes have nothing to do with NASA and are not based on NASA data , so we as an agency are not directly involved .
But scientists , both within NASA and outside , recognize that this hoax with its effort to frighten people is a distraction from more important scientific concerns , such as global warming and loss of biological diversity .
We live in a country where there is freedom of speech , and that includes the freedom to lie .
We should be glad there are no censors .
But if we will use common sense we can recognize the lies .
As we approach 2012 , the lies will be come even more obvious .
18 . Can you prove to me that Nibiru is a hoax ?
There are so many reports that something terrible will happen in 2012 .
I need proof because the government and NASA are keeping so much from us .
Such questions should be put to the doomsday advocates to prove that what they are saying is true , not to NASA to prove it is false .
If someone claimed on the Internet that there were 50 - foot tall purple elephants walking through Cleveland , would anyone expect NASA to prove this wrong ?
The burden of proof falls on those who make wild claims .
Remember the often - quoted comment from Carl Sagan that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence .
However , I think that astronomers have reached the point where we can offer extremely strong arguments that Nibiru does not exist .
A large planet ( or a brown dwarf ) in our solar system would have been known to astronomers for many years , both indirectly from its gravitational perturbations on other objects and by direct detection in the infrared .
The NASA Infrared Astronomy Satellite ( IRAS ) carried out the first allsky survey in 1983 , and several subsequent surveys would also have seen Nibiru if it were there .
Further , if a large mass passed through the inner solar system every 3600 years , we would see its disruptive effects on the orbits of the inner planets , and we do n’t .
But do n’t take my word for it .
Just use common sense .
Have you seen Nibiru ?
In 2008 many websites said it would be visible to the naked eye in spring 2009 .
If a large planet or brown dwarf were headed for the inner solar system in 2012 , it would already be tracked by thousands of astronomers , both professional and amateur , all over the world .
Do you know any amateur astronomers who are watching it ?
Have you seen any photos or discussion of it in the big popular astronomy magazines such as Astronomy or Sky & Telescope ?
Just think about it .
No one could hide something like Nibiru if it existed .
19 .
What about the scary ads for the new film 2012 ?
They tell us to look at these Internet sites to verify the doomsday threat .
The pseudoscientific claims about Nibiru and a doomsday in 2012 , together with distrust of the government , are being amplified by publicity for the new film from Columbia Pictures titled 2012 , to be released in November 2009 .
The film ’s trailer , appearing in theaters and on their website , shows a tidal wave breaking over the Himalayas , with the following words : “ How would the governments of our planet prepare 6 billion people for the end of the world ?
[ long pause ]
They would n’t .
[ long pause ]
Find out the Truth .
Google search 2012 . ”
The film publicity includes a faux scientific website for “ The Institute for Human Continuity ” , which is entirely fictitious .
According to this website , the IHC is dedicated to scientific research and public preparedness .
Its mission is the survival of humanity .
The website explains that the Institute was founded in 1978 by international leaders of government , business , and science .
They say that in 2004 , IHC scientists confirmed with 94 % certainty that the world would be destroyed in 2012 .
This website encourages people to register for a lottery to select those who will be saved ; a colleague submitted the name of her cat , which was accepted .
According to Wikipedia , creating this sort of fake website is a new advertising technique called “ Viral Marketing , ” by analogy with computer viruses .
20 .
Is it possible that the influx of questions you describe is part of some kind of campaign for a book or movie , in the hopes that the volume of denials is taken as more “ evidence ” that there is a conspiracy ?
I ask myself the same questions every day , as the volume of mail I receive about Nibiru ( along with various alignments and pole shifts ) keeps increasing — now more than 20 per week .
Clearly there is money to be made from people ’s fear about an approaching doomsday .
Many websites are selling books and tapes about Nibiru or even “ survival kits . ”
It is all very sad , given the many real issues such as global warming and the financial collapse on which our attentions should be focused .
In the final chapter of a new astronomy book ( The Hunt for Planet X ) Govert Shilling writes : “ There is plenty to do for the debunkers — the archaeologists and astronomers who take a long and skeptical look at the tidal wave of Nibiru nonsense and explain with scientific precision what is wrong with this cosmic fairy - tale .
They will have their work cut out in the next few years .
And on December 22 , 2012 there will be a new pseudoscientific cock - and - bull story making the rounds and the whole circus will start all over again , because no matter how many new celestial bodies are found in our solar system , there will always be a need for a mysterious Planet X . ”

The survival expert Ray Mears was enlisted by police to hunt down the fugitive gunman Raoul Moat during the seven - day search in the Northumberland countryside , it emerged today .
A Northumbria police spokeswoman confirmed the extraordinary news that Mears had been involved in the manhunt , but refused to elaborate on his role .
" We can confirm Ray Mears did assist in this investigation , as did several other agencies and specialists , " she said .
Mears , a 46 - year - old TV presenter and author of the Outdoor Survival Handbook , is believed to have helped track Moat 's movements after he fled his makeshift camp near the village of Rothbury , and after the gunman declared " war " on police in a rambling letter .
The survival expert refused to comment about his role in the search .
But his presence will inevitably lead to further questions by critics who claimed the force mishandled the investigation .
A member of the public spotted Moat , a 37 - year - old former nightclub bouncer , in the village on 9 July and called police .
Moat died early the next day after a six - hour standoff with armed officers .
A week earlier , he had shot his ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart , 22 , and murdered her boyfriend , Chris Brown , 29 .
Within 24 hours , he went on to shoot PC David Rathband in the face .
The policeman , who was blinded in the attack , left hospital today .
An Independent Police Complaints Commission inquiry is already under way into the firing of two Xrep Tasers by West Yorkshire police marksmen at around the same time Moat apparently shot himself .
The weapons , with a much longer range than normal Tasers , were not approved for use and were undergoing testing by the Home Office .
During the search , officers from other forces across England and Wales , snipers from Scotland Yard 's elite C019 firearms unit , helicopters and armoured vehicles from Northern Ireland were drafted in to Northumberland .
An RAF Tornado equipped with infra-red equipment , more commonly in use in Afghanistan , also made surveillance sweeps over the area .
Rathband , a 42 - year - old father of two , insisted today he harboured no bitterness .
He said : " My facial injuries have all been sorted by the plastics team at the hospital and it's just a case of allowing my jaw and face and stuff to knit together . "
So far , 20 people have been arrested in connection with the case – the latest being two men and two women who were bailed today after they were questioned on suspicion of assisting Moat .
Facebook vigilante posts 6,000 photos of convicted paedophiles and sex offenders online as ' invaluable tool for parents '
Chris Wittwer has posted the names and photographs of 6,000 convicted sex offenders on Facebook
A vigilante is celebrating after completing a database of 6,000 convicted sex offenders and paedophiles across every county in Britain and posting their names and photographs on Facebook .
Chris Wittwer said he has created the largest photographic gallery ' in the world ' after spending ' every waking hour ' gathering police mugshots of registered sex offenders .
Nearly 18,000 people have joined his Facebook groups since the 34 - year - old started compiling the huge online bank two years ago .
A total of 44 groups on the social networking site feature 5,930 names and photographs of sex criminals who have been convicted in Britain 's courts .
Mr Wittwer , from Exeter , who works as a warehouse operator said today : ' I feel really proud .
' It 's quite an achievement and if it helps people spot sex offenders living in their area , who are a known risk to children , then I 've done a good thing .
' It 's a really big project - way bigger than anything before like the other site RatBook .
' But it 's not a question of being a hate mob , it 's the simple fact that on the national sex offenders register you can access some information but you can't see the faces of those who commit the crimes .
' With my groups you can see the picture of the offender , their name , the date of their offence and where they were resident at the time .
' Because of the repeat nature of many child sex offences it is an invaluable tool for parents who want to keep a watching eye over their kids . '
Mr Wittwer had his first group closed down by police when he first started the venture two years ago for the county of Devon .
But the online portals were started back up again because the campaigner was able to show he was not breaking any laws by presenting information already in the public domain .
He has stuck religiously to only putting up details of convicted sex offenders by checking local newspapers and court records .
Nearly 18,000 people have joined his Facebook groups since the 34 - year - old started compiling the huge online bank two years ago
He then cross-references the name of a sex criminal against the national sex offenders register before giving himself the green light to put up the name .
He said : ' I definitely cross all the t's and dot the i's - nothing is left to chance .
' I use press releases from the police as well as local paper cuttings and newspapers ' own archives .
' No hearsay or unconfirmed allegations go on the site .
That 's how I 've been able to continue legally .
' The list is growing all the time - I cover 62 counties in all across England , Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland so I 'm constantly adding new names . '
Mr Wittwer says he gets 40 messages every day from people praising his work on the social networking site - with many victims turning to him for support .
He said : ' It 's very difficult when you get a victim asking for your help because I 'm not a qualified counsellor .
' All I can do is offer them a bit of advice and tell them where to turn to . '
But he said he has also come in for some hostility from actual sex offenders who have tracked him down and tried to attack him for what he has done .
He said : ' On a couple of occasions I have had paedophiles try and hunt me down .
I guess it 's an occupational hazard .
' They do n't want their names out there .
But fortunately it has n't come to anything . '
Mr Wittwer said he started his ' mission ' after working as a pub barman a few years ago where he found out about a regular who had been molesting a child .
He said : ' It created shockwaves and it sickened me .
I just wanted to do something about it .
This is my way of helping I suppose . '
He added proudly that his list actually helped track down one sex offender who had been spotted working in a local sweet shop - opposite a primary school .
He said : ' This particular person was on the sex offenders register but had failed to keep police informed of his movements .
' Thanks to my site he was recognised and when police caught up with him they found he had been abusing again .
He went back to jail .
He added : ' I 'm really pleased I 've managed to cover the whole UK now .
I 've just finished doing the last remaining places in Scotland last week but it will be an ongoing job to keep it up to date . '
The online groups have been a massive hit with users as the site states on its opening page : ' On this site we aim to expose the paedophiles , perverts and child abuse animals that infest our society today .
' Is it just and right what I am doing ?
I do n't care !
If I can help to save one child from these crimes then it has all been worth it .'
Group members have called on Mr Wittwer to release people 's addresses and some have even suggested torturing paedophiles .
But Facebook confirmed that he has done nothing wrong in the eyes of the social networking site , which has millions of users across the country .
A spokesman said : ' We want Facebook to be a place where people can openly discuss issues and express their views , while respecting the rights and feeling of others .
' It is within the terms of the site for users to express their views about a public figure , which includes views about someone who has been convicted of a crime and details related to the crime that are freely available in the media . '
The spokesman added : ' However , bullying and harassment of a private individual is against the terms of use of the site and any content or users found to be in violation will be removed .
' As a community , Facebook is highly self - regulating , and we encourage users to report questionable or offensive content .
' Facebook takes all complaints by users seriously and we have a dedicated team investigating these complaints and comments by users . '
A Kent Police spokesperson said : ' Any information taken from the internet and sites such as Facebook should be treated with caution as its authenticity cannot be confirmed .
' Part of Multi -Agency Public Protection Arrangements ( MAPPA ) includes assessing risk to members of the public and where they should be told about offenders in their community , we tell them .
' We encourage anyone with concerns about offenders to report the information to the police or through Crimestoppers .
' By providing the police and our partners with information , members of the public can help to protect themselves and others . '
Reports are emerging of a stabbing that occurred in Hall H at San Diego 's Comic - Con this afternoon before the " Paul " and " Cowboy and Aliens " panel .
The stabbing allegedly occurred over an argument between two men about seating .
After the jump , we have a Tweet Reel video that supposedly shows the alleged attacker being arrested .
As reported at USA Today , San Diego Police Sgt. Gary Mondesir said , " Two males got into a dispute and one male stabbed the other male with a pen around the eye socket .
Parademics arrived almost immediately and took the victim to the University of California / San Diego hospital .
The suspect was taken away .
" We had officers inside the convention center and they were there relatively quickly , and citizens had actually detained the suspect , " said Mondesir .

Image caption Unemployment soared in the Great Depression
The health inequality gap in Britain is greater than it was during the post - World War I slump and the Great Depression , a study suggests .
Despite the continued rise in life expectancy , it is well documented that the gap between richest and poorest has actually been widening in recent years .
Researchers from Sheffield and Bristol looked at early death rates since 1921 .
They found the current gap was greater than it was in the 1920s and 1930s , the British Medical Journal reports .
Stock market crash
The researchers analysed mortality data for England and Wales , obtained from the Office for National Statistics , and for Scotland , obtained from the General Register Office for Scotland .
Between 1999 to 2007 , for every 100 deaths before the age of 65 in the richest 10th of areas , there were 212 in the poorest 10th .
This compared with 191 deaths in the poorest areas from 1921 to 1930 and 185 deaths from 1931 to 1939 .
These decades cover probably the toughest economic and social period of the 20th century .
The 1920s and 1930s Britain was still struggling during the 1920s to recover from World War I .
Living standards had been driven down by low wages and high unemployment .
The Great Depression , therefore , could not have come at a worse time .
The 1930s saw Britain - and much of the rest of the world - slide into the largest and most profound depression ever seen .
The economy collapsed so much so that at one point a fifth of the workforce was unemployed .
Send us your comments
The UK spent the 1920s struggling to recover from WWI and was then caught up in the Great Depression of the following decade which was sparked by 1929 stock market crash in the US .
From that period onwards health inequalities started narrowing until the 1970s , the analysis showed .
Researchers said this was mainly due to the boom in manufacturing in the traditionally poorer parts of Britain .
But since then the gap has widened , particularly during the last 20 years .
This means that the pledge by the previous Labour government to reduce the inequality gap between 1997 and 2010 is almost certain to be missed .
Lead researcher Professor Danny Dorling said the findings were a " stark reminder " of the challenge facing the nation .
" Health and wealth are directly linked and , unless we tackle the income gap , we could well see life expectancy actually starting to fall for the first time in the poorest areas . "
Professor Sir Michael Marmot , a leading health inequalities expert who has advised both the government and World Health Organization , said : " There are two major challenges : to improve health for everybody and to reduce inequalities .
In Britain , we have done well on the first - not on the second .
" This should not be taken as a counsel of despair .
Over the last decade , life expectancy for the bottom quarter of the population increased significantly , but their health did not catch up with the average , because of persisting social and economic inequalities . "

H. P. Lovecraft 's stories , despite a ( sometimes deserved ) reputation for being uncinematic and exposition - heavy , have spawned a surprising number of film adaptations .
These run the gamut from clever and respectful tributes to cynical schlock .
Few have had any budget to speak of , and none but the most tenuously - linked have attained mainstream success , but all have a certain level of cult cachet .
Feature - Length Adaptations
Advertisement :
The Dunwich Horror ( 1970 ) .
Modernized version , heavy on sex and psychedelia but retaining many elements of the original story .
Still , Dean Stockwell 's mustache is probably the scariest part of the film .
The Horror of the title is represented as a huge red mass of ... stage smoke .
Also by Haller .
Humanoids From the Deep ( 1980 ) , an unacknowledged exploitation version of The Shadow Over Innsmouth .
Also by Corman .
The Unnamable ( 1988 ) and The Unnamable II ( 1992 , subtitled The Statement of Randolph Carter but also known as The Unnamable Returns ) .
Pulse Pounders ( 1988 ) .
Anthology with one segment based on " The Evil Clergyman , " in which Combs and Crampton appear again .
Not released until 2002 .
The Resurrected ( 1991 ) .
Based on The Case of Charles Dexter Ward .
A more faithful adaptation than The Haunted Palace , it retains the story 's premise and something of its structure while updating the setting and changing the POV character from a doctor to a PI hired by Ward's ( again , mysteriously existent ) wife .
The climactic investigation of Ward / Curwen 's subterranean laboratory hews surprisingly close to the original , and is almost as chilling .
Also known as Shatterbrain .
Director Dan O'Bannon 's original cut , never released , was titled The Ancestor .
Necronomicon ( 1993 ) .
Anthology with segments that are titled The Rats in the Walls ( only with no rats or cannibalism ) , " Cool Air " ( only with lots of sex ) , and The Whisperer in Darkness ( only with neither Mi-Go nor the hills of Vermont ; some viewers have suggested that it is actually an adaptation of a different Lovecraft story , " The Nameless City " ) .
The frame story stars Jeffrey Combs , in heavy prosthetic makeup , as Lovecraft himself .
The " Cool Air " segment stars a very cash - strapped David Warner .
Lurking Fear ( 1994 ) .
Semi -faithful but rather flat modernized adaptation , most notable for containing Combs 's sixth Lovecraftian role : he plays the drunken doctor , a character absent from the original story .
( A shortened cut of this film was incorporated into the 2004 anthology Tomb of Terror . )
Castle Freak ( 1995 ) .
Based on The Outsider .
Combs and Crampton reunite with Stuart Gordon .
Bleeders ( 1997 ) .
Based on The Lurking Fear .
Also known as Hemoglobin .
Cool Air ( 1999 ) starring Jack Donner .
In a similar vein to the HPLHS 's films , this 45 - minute black and white adaptation was deliberately made to have the look and feel of a 1930s talkie .
In an interesting bit of artistic license , the previously unnamed protagonist has become none other than Randolph Carter .
Due to the sheer brevity of the source material , this movie was a case of Adaptation Expansion .
It greatly fleshed out the personalties of the main characters , but remained otherwise faithful to the original story and is generally well - regarded among fans .
Dagon ( 2001 ) .
Based mostly on The Shadow Over Innsmouth , modernized and moved to Spain .
( The town of Innsmouth becomes Imboca . )
The Deep Ones are more octopodean than piscine , possibly as a concession to popular perception of Lovecraft 's mythos .
Moreover , the movie features a summoning of " Dagon " ( as a tentacled , toothy , octopoid monster , not as a giant Deep One ) as its climax , something which did n't happen in the original story , and adds a female love interest for the young male protagonist to rescue , treating the viewers to a scene of full frontal female nudity when she is about to be sacrificed to Dagon .
Directed by Stuart Gordon .
Cthulhu ( 2007 ) .
Actually based on The Shadow Over Innsmouth , moved to the Pacific Northwest and making the main character gay .
The director and writer stated that they were using the story as a metaphor for being gay , and later admitted not having much respect for horror , including Lovecraft , when they first started working on the film .
The Tomb ( 2007 ) .
Virtually unwatchable film with no organic connection to the short story .
Seems like a very confused ripoff of Saw , but it 's hard to be sure even of that : poor sound recording renders much of the dialogue incomprehensible .
According to IMDB , a version of The Whisperer in Darkness was made in 2007 .
, a version of The Whisperer in Darkness was made in 2007 .
Beyond the Dunwich Horror ( 2008 ) .
The Dunwich Horror .
Premiered on Syfy in October 2009 ( so you know it 's good ) .
No relation to the preceding .
Stars Jeffrey Combs as Wilbur Whateley ; Dean Stockwell , who played Wilbur in the 1970 version , also has a role .
Pickman 's Muse ( 2009 ) Based on " Haunter of the Dark " , and not " Pickman 's Model " as the title might imply .
An artist , Robert Pickman , becomes obsessed by visions of unworldly horror , revealed to him through an ancient artifact discovered in an abandoned church .
Starring Barret Walz ; directed by Robert Cappelletto .
Winner of the Brown Jenkin award , for Best Adaptation , at the 2009 H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival .
The Whisperer in Darkness ( 2011 ) .
The HP Lovecraft Historical Society 's followup to the above - mentioned The Call of Cthulhu , based on a similar conceit ; however , rather than being a silent film , this movie , in fitting with the original story 's publication date of 1931 , is a talkie .
Rather than a straight adaptation , like the previous film , this one is more of an expanded adaptation .
It depicts the events of the book , but where the book ends with the protagonists ' flight from Akeley 's farm and back home , the movie goes on to have him thwart a ritual preceding an Alien Invasion by the Mi-Go , and fight them in a mid-air combat scene .
Since the ending is no less Lovecraftian for it , general consensus is that the movie is , again , a loyal adaptation of the Mythos to film .
Available on DVD .
Short Film and Television Adaptations
" Pickman 's Model " and " Cool Air " ( both 1971 ) .
Segments from the second season of Night Gallery .
Both add love stories that are n't in the originals , but if you can get past that and the low production values that come with the territory of 1970s television , they 're pretty good .
" Pickman 's Model " ( 1981 ) .
Short film made by Cathy Welch .
It also contains a love interest , with the narrative being a story of previous events related to said love interest .
While low - budget , the film is shot in black and white and is very atmospheric , capturing Lovecraft 's mood well .
Out of Mind : The Stories of H.P. Lovecraft ( 1998 ) .
A 60 - minute Canadian film that mixes many stories of Lovecraft in a new story about a late 20th century man called Randolph Carter ( of course ) who receives a book from a great - uncle who died before he was born and who starts visiting his great - uncle 's memories in his dreams .
While taking liberties with Lovecraft 's stories , the movie tries to remain faithful to their themes and atmosphere .
Includes elements from Herbert West Reanimator , " The Case of Charles Dexter Ward " and " The Statement of Randolph Carter " .
Christopher Heyerdahl as Lovecraft makes an appearance , being visited by a dreaming Randolph Carter , wearing a shirt with his face on it .
Dreams in the Witch House ( 2005 ) .
An adaptation made by Stuart Gordon of the story of the same name for the Masters of Horror series .
Pretty loyal to the source material .
Pickman 's Model ( 2007 ) .
Chilean TV movie with very little connection to the story .
More of a slasher film than a true Lovecraft adaptation .
Escape from Midwich Valley ( 2014 ) .
A music video for a song by Carpenter Brut .
A loose adaptation of " The Shadow Over Innsmouth " , in which a woman visits the sinister port town and is confronted with a mystery from her past .
Viewable on YouTube .
The Music of Erich Zann ( 2016 ) , a short film that notably expands the story to make Erich an Arkham Sanitarium escapee and a Holocaust survivor .
Viewable on Youtube .

Sterilise the poor and bring back the workhouse : Public 's bizarre suggestions for spending cuts
It is yet another brainchild of the new open Coalition : A website that allows the public to suggest where public spending cuts can be made .
But once again the idea has fallen victim to a string of outlandish suggestions – just like the scheme asking which bad laws should be scrapped .
The Spending Challenge website has been bombarded with possibilities for savings but some are offensive and others simply bizarre – such as the proposal to limit the amount civil servants drink to stop them going to the toilet .
Bombarded :
The public have put up some bizarre suggestions on the Government 's ' Spending Challenge ' website
The writer suggested tea cups over 150 ml should be banned and ‘ fluid monitors ’ brought in to impose fines for transgressions , claiming it could save £ 11 billion a year .
Other suggestions include forcing the poor to be sterilised , calling for a return of the workhouse and forcing benefits claimants to work in sweatshops .
One poster , infuriated about the prospect of swingeing cuts , claimed the Office for Budget Responsibility should be renamed the Waffen SS .
And another demanded the Government ‘ stop spending our money on illegal wars and false accusations to justify stealing other countries ’ resources ’ .
The website was opened to the public last week to engage voters in how to make savings .
It is aimed at involving people in the move to save billions in public spending to help reduce the vast deficit .
The website is similar to the Your Freedom site that asks for ideas about which laws introduced by Labour should be axed .
It crashed after dozens of bizarre ideas were suggested , including lifting the ban on marrying a horse .
Shadow Treasury minister Angela Eagle yesterday branded the spending suggestions ‘ racist and offensive ’ .
At Commons question time , she asked for the ‘ drivel ’ to be removed and the website to be moderated .
Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander replied : ‘ Of course these are n’t ideas I would wish to promote . ’
But he defended the consultation process and insisted Labour had yet to come up with a single idea to cut back on the burgeoning budget deficit .
Mr Alexander said although he would not promote such ideas , he was surprised she had ‘ poured scorn ’ on the consultation process .
He said the consultation with public sector workers had brought forward 66,000 ideas on savings that could be made in their services .
This is Slovakia ’s first - ever appearance at a major international tournament , so you can be forgiven for knowing little about them .
That might be their biggest strength – the surprise factor .
Not only is their team as a whole relatively unknown , despite having won their qualification group ahead of Slovenia , but many of their players are relatively low - key .
Napoli ’s Marik Hamsik is unquestionably the star name and Martin Skrtel of Liverpool is well - known , but players like Vladimir Weiss and Mirolav Stoch have had relatively little time in the limelight , and defenders might be facing a threat they know little about .
Slovania played a fairly basic 4 - 4 - 2 shape throughout the qualifiers and that could continue at the World Cup , though there has been speculation they could switch to a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 .
The first XI
The back five will remain in place regardless of what happens ahead .
After an injury scare last week , Martin Skrtel has declared himself fit , and will partner Jan Durica in a fearsome central defensive duo .
The versatile Radoslav Zabavnik will slot in at right - back , whilst Marek Cech seems to have edged out Peter Pekarik at left - back .
The midfield depends , of course , on what formation Slovakia play .
Marik Hamsik will play an advanced role with Zdenko Strba holding if it ’s a two - man central midfield ; if the 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 is used , Hamsik will push forward .
The second defensive midfielder would have been Miroslav Karhan , but he has been ruled out through injury , so Jan Kozak and Kamil Kopunek will compete for the ( possible ) final midfield position .
The wide positions will be filled by Vladimir Weiss , ( son of the manager , also named Vladimir Weiss ) and Miroslav Stock , both 20 years of age , and 5′8 and 5′6 respectively , who provide pace and creativity from the flanks .
The first - choice upfront will be Stanislav Sestak , a hard - working player with a strong shot , whilst the popular but out - of - form Robert Vittek will partner him in a 4 - 4 - 2 .
Conclusion
Slovakia must hit the ground running with a victory over New Zealand to stand a chance of qualifying .
Although the 4 - 4 - 2 would generally be used over the 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 against weaker opponents , playing the former would surely play into the hands of New Zealand ’s 3 - 4 - 3 .
A 4-2-3- 1 against them , with the wide midfielders staying high up the pitch , might be the better option , and therefore that ’s the line - up depicted above .
The key players will obviously be the creative trio of Hamsik , Stoch and Weiss – the latter two with their pace and direct running on the flanks ; you can certainly imagine them giving the backlines of Paraguay and Italy a problem .
Italy have a habit of conceding crucial goals to Serie A players , and Hamsik in the final game would fit that bill perfectly .
Slovakia are a decent bet for a second round place .
Germany tore Argentina apart to book their place in the semi-finals and , for now at least , end Diego Maradona 's dream of winning the World Cup as coach to go with his victory as captain in 1986 .
Inspired by Bastian Schweinsteiger and two - goal hero Miroslav Klose , Joachim Loew 's side scored four times for the third game at this tournament in what was a devastating attacking display .
Klose found the net only three times in the Bundesliga all season in a miserable campaign for Bayern Munich but he has now beaten that tally at this tournament , as well as moving to within a goal of Ronaldo , who with 15 goals , is the all - time highest scorer at World Cup finals .
After Thomas Mueller 's early header , Germany coped with everything Argentina could throw at them before finishing off Maradona 's men with a lethal late burst .
Following Brazil 's self - destruction against the Dutch on Friday , Germany became the latest European team to see off a highly fancied South American side , and they move into the last four looking in good shape to become world champions for the first time since 1990 .
At times this win was reminiscent of the way Germany had ripped through England 's backline in the second round a week ago , with Argentina caught out by their speed and incisiveness on the counter - attack as they chased the game .
The only cloud on Germany 's horizon is that the impressive Mueller picked up a booking that means he will miss the last - four clash with Paraguay or Spain , but Loew still has much to savour from this match .
Mueller opened the scoring after only three minutes when Schweinsteiger swung in a free - kick from the left and he escaped the Argentina defence to beat Sergio Romero with a downward header that the keeper got a leg to but could not keep out .
Klose , who also won his 100th cap for Germany , should have made it 2 - 0 when Mueller broke into the area down the right and squared for him in front of goal .
But he fired wastefully over , not that it appeared to matter much at that point .
With Lionel Messi finding it difficult to impose himself on the game thanks to the close attention of Schweinsteiger , Argentina 's response was largely limited to shots from distance .
They did improve as half - time approached and Angel Di Maria and Gonzalo Higuain both forced Manuel Neuer into low saves , but Germany continued to threaten on the break .
Only after the interval did Argentina manage a spell of sustained pressure , and they threatened almost immediately when Di Maria let fly from outside the box and saw the ball fizz narrowly wide .
For a good 20 minutes , Maradona 's men dominated possession and Carlos Tevez had a shot blocked superbly blocked by Per Mertesacker while Germany keeper Neuer was kept busy as shots peppered his goal .
But , after wave after wave of Argentina attacks had been frustrated , Loew 's side hit back with a lethal sucker - punch to seal victory with two near - identical goals in quick succession .
First , Podolski burst into the box down the left and squared to give Klose the easiest of tap-ins to make it 2 - 0 , with the striker walking the ball over the line .
Then , with Argentina still rocking , Schweinsteiger weaved his way down the same flank and crossed for Arne Freidrich to bundle the ball in at the near post .
The game was up for the South American side , and neither the jaded Messi on the pitch nor Maradona off it could lift them for any sort of belated response .
Fittingly , the final word went to Klose , who volleyed home Germany 's fourth from Mesut Oezil 's cross in the last minute - his 14th World Cup goal - after the imperious Schweinsteiger had brought the ball forward again .
After another summer of loud belly - aching , moaning and groaning about how the NBA ’s one - and - done rule is methodically destroying college basketball as we know it , we ’re left with the fact that , in reality , only eleven players from the prep class of 2009 found their way into the 2010 NBA Draft pool .
As it turns out , approximately 90 % of the RSCI Top 100 players from last year ’s freshman class will return to play another season of college basketball in 2010 - 11 .
And this is not unusual .
In the four NBA Drafts where one - and - doners were forced to attend at least one year of college ( 2007 - 10 ) , there have been a total of 35 such players , or around nine per season .
There are obvious problems with the NBA ’s one - year rule that we wo n’t get into here , but we should n’t be losing our heads over what amounts to a handful of players each season .
And what about those players — how did it go for them ?
We can safely presume that if you ’re good enough to be one - and - done , a year in college probably worked out well enough for you ( ahem , Tommy Mason - Griffin excepted ) .
But we ’re more interested in the schools .
How did recruiting and ultimately matriculating a one - and - done player work out for those institutions ?
Put in real terms , was bringing a player like Derrick Favors on campus at Georgia Tech for one year worthwhile ?
What about Calipari ’s den of young Cats ?
You may recall that we did this school - centric analysis in each of the last three summers ( 2007 , 2008 , and 2009 ) , and the basic conclusion that we ’ve found is that one - and - done players have generally benefited their schools in the two areas that matter most : 1 ) wins ; and 2 ) marketability .
Let ’s take a closer look at this year ’s group .
2010 One-and - Dones
Kentucky – Well Worth It .
Say what you want about the meltdown of Calipari ’s Cats in the Elite Eight against a tougher , more experienced West Virginia team , but the fact that Kentucky brought in the # 1 recruiting class of 2009 and delivered on the implied promise that Cal ’s system develops NBA draft picks is why his cadre of one - and - dones ( John Wall , Eric Bledsoe , DeMarcus Cousins , Daniel Orton ) was well worth it .
And here ’s the what behind the why : four five - star prospects arrive in Lexington next year ( Enes Kanter , Brandon Knight , Doron Lamb , Terrence Jones ) and two more are signed on for 2011 ( Michael Gilchrist , Marquis Teague ) with several others lurking in the wings .
Not every one of these players will become a one - and - doner , so eventually Calipari will be able to season some experienced talent around his annual lottery pick arrivals ( see : 2008 Memphis ) to give himself a great chance to win that elusive national title .
As far as the difference in Q rating from the Gillispie era to now , it ’s like that $ 22 M / year Tiger Woods lost in endorsements since last November somehow ended up in Lexington as gold - plated streets .
UK has become the program du jour for the young , moneyed and hip , and when the head coach infamously stated that this year ’s NBA Draft night was the greatest night in the history of Kentucky basketball , he ’s referring to marketability .
The pitch : come to Lexington , play a fun style of uptempo basketball , win 30 - 35 games , market your brand on television through our deals with CBS and ESPN , have a shot to win a title , meet celebrities such as LeBron James and Drake , and end up shaking David Stern ’s hand in a year or two … not exactly fraught with hard decisions .
If Calipari can keep his program in the headlines for the right reasons , this class will be looked at as the tipping point for a whole new era of Kentucky basketball .
Definitely well worth it .
Marshall – Well Worth It .
If you recruit a player who was n’t even ranked in the RSCI top 100 and he ends up dominating your league as a freshman center to the point of becoming the Conference USA defensive POY and leading the nation in blocked shots , it was well worth it .
Hassan Whiteside ’s one year in Huntington led the Thundering Herd to its best season in over two decades , culminating in a fourth - place finish in CUSA , big late - season wins over UAB and Tulsa , and a quarterfinal appearance in the CIT .
For a program that has n’t been to the NCAAs since 1987 , any postseason appearance is a great year , and Whiteside ’s patrolling of the paint had no small part in it .
The unfortunate part of Whiteside ’s meteoric rise is that the Herd had such a good season that as a result it also lost its head coach Donnie Jones , which may impact the long - term marketability aspect of Whiteside ’s year there .
Nevertheless , we doubt anyone at Marshall regrets the year that both Whiteside and Jones resided in Huntington together , so we think that this was a huge boost for a mid-major program not used to having such players around .
Georgia Tech – Worth It . Paul Hewitt ’s program has been burned by one - and - dones before , notably in 2007 when both Thaddeus Young and Javaris Crittenton led an inconsistent but very talented Yellow Jackets team to its last NCAA Tournament appearance prior to 2010 .
We said at the time that the loss of those two players could set back his program a spell , and indeed it took three years and the arrival of all - world prospect Derrick Favors to carry Tech back to the Dance ( and presumably save Hewitt ’s job for at least another year ) .
Still , last year ’s team was also inconsistent ( an ugly hallmark of Hewitt ’s ) and short of a strong run to the ACC Tournament finals , the Jackets were not likely to have been Dancing .
Favors had solid numbers ( 12/8/2 BPG ) , including 21/18 against Maryland and 22/11 against Duke , but there was a lingering sense that the athletic big man had not quite figured it all out just yet .
This one is a very tough call , and it may change if the Tech program falls off again , but considering that GT had gone 27 - 36 ( 9 - 23 ACC ) in the previous two seasons and they were a possession away from winning the ACC Tournament against the eventual national champs , we ’re going to say that having Favors around for a single year was worth it ( conditional on Hewitt continuing to turn things around in Atlanta ) .
Kansas – Worth It .
On a team filled with offensive talent that many pundits , ourselves included , figured would cut down the nets in Indianapolis last year , it was the freshman Xavier Henry who often seemed the steady hand as some of his more experienced peers traded turns jacking up difficult shots ( Sherron Collins ) or hiding out underneath the basket ( Cole Aldrich ) .
Prior to the beginning of the season , we had serious concerns about comments made by Xavier and his father and , in particular , whether their seeming me - first attitude would negatively impact the loaded title contender .
It did n’t .
Rather , Henry seamlessly transitioned into Bill Self ’s system by starting nearly every game on the wing and becoming the 33 - win team ’s second - leading scorer ( taking and making mostly good shots ) .
In our view , it turned a Jayhawk squad from a really good team into a great one ( notwithstanding the Northern Iowa debacle ) , and it had the corollary effect of showing that Self can handle players with one - and - done aspirations ( and difficult family members ! ) such as Henry .
In fact , Self proved that he can showcase talent in a way that maximizes his team ’s potential while also exhibiting that his coaching style is n’t as deliberate and fixed as some might argue .
Therefore , we think that even though Kansas ’ season did n’t end as many had expected , Henry ’s one year in Lawrence was still worthwhile , as KU won games hand over fist and helped improve the marketability of the program .
Texas – Not Worth It .
This is a hard one because we recognize that not every one - and - done will be a Kevin Durant or even a John Wall , but much more was expected from Avery Bradley ( the top overall recruit by ESPNU ) and his team last season .
After a 17 - 0 start that had resulted in the Horns residing at the very top of the polls in mid-January , UT experienced a complete meltdown after they had seen their own blood .
Texas went 7 - 10 the rest of the way , bowed out in ugly defeats to Baylor and Wake Forest in March , and turned what looked to be potentially their best season ever into an unmitigated disaster .
Of course , the primary issue for Barnes ’ team last season was spotty point guard play , and Bradley appeared to struggle to adjust to his role as a combo guard in the system .
For example , he had more zero - assist games than five - plus ones , and he failed to hit a single three during the final four weeks of the season .
We wondered aloud last year if Texas simply had too many chefs in the kitchen — what with J’Covan Brown , Dogus Balbay and Jordan Hamilton all vying for backcourt minutes — and not one of them exceptional at fulfilling the duties of a traditional point guard .
The bottom line is this for Bradley : if Texas bounces back next season and the offense appears much more fluid , then his removal from Austin may be viewed by many as addition by subtraction .
For that reason , we think that his one - and - done season was n’t worth the headaches .
Cincinnati – Not Worth It .
If you ’re a program like Cincinnati trying to claw its way into the elite of the Big East standings for the first time , you expect that a top ten talent like Lance Stephenson will help get you there .
Instead , we now know for a fact that Mick Cronin ’s team was not markedly different that the one from the year before ( a sub -.500 Big East team ) , and we ’re not sure that Born Ready ’s year in the Queen City improved the marketability of that program to where other top prospects will want to follow him there .
There were always questions about his maturity and inability to make the simple pass rather than the spectacular one , but interestingly , when he told Cincinnati reporters that he was likely to stay in college for an additional year to work on his glaring weaknesses ( such as his 22 % conversion rate from beyond the arc ) , UC was going through a period of losing five of its last six regular season games .
Ultimately , the Bearcats made it to the NIT and won a game before losing to regional rival Dayton , but it ’s a significant difference from what UC fans were hoping for when Stephenson declared his intention to matriculate there last summer .
With a fairly young team set to return next year , Mick Cronin , like Barnes above , may be hoping for an addition - by - subtraction scenario as well .
Oklahoma – Ridiculously Not Worth It .
Where to begin with this mess ?
Not only was Oklahoma an absolute embarrassment to its brand with a team that basically quit halfway through the year ( losing its last nine games ) , but the two players who were one - and - dones were more apt to be described as rats fleeing a sinking ship than stars moving on to greener pastures .
Tiny Gallon and Tommy Mason - Griffin both had statistically solid freshman seasons , but neither wowed anyone to the point where they were considered legitimate pro candidates at this point .
After the season , Gallon admitted to taking money while he was in high school , while Mason - Griffin foolishly stayed in the draft without apparent realization that 5 ’ 11 combo guards who shoot 40 % from the field are in low demand at the next level .
It was no secret that Mason - Griffin clashed with head coach Jeff Capel on occasion , but his smarter move would have been to transfer rather than become the first one - and - done prospect to go undrafted .
Regardless of these two , OU is facing possible NCAA sanctions as a result of Gallon ’s misdeed among other allegations , and the program is certainly in no better shape now that these two players ( along with sophomore Willie Warren ) are gone .
You have to believe that Capel would take back the recruiting of these players if he could , because the resultant damage to the Sooner program is completely not worth it .
One-and - Dones : Historical Snapshot
With another year of evidence by which to assess the impact of one - and - done players on their schools , not much has changed .
As we said last year , our qualitative analysis showed that 54 % of one - and - dones ( 13 of 24 ) had been , at minimum , worthwhile to the school involved .
With seven of this year ’s eleven added to the total , we now find that 57 % ( 20 of 35 ) were worthwhile recruits , and 60 % of those players ( 12 of 20 ) were huge successes .
This means that nearly a third of one - and - done players have been what we would describe as “ well worth it ” for his school , and more than half of all were worth the risk .
Echoing the sentiment we outlined last season , the only conclusion that should be drawn from this , despite the paucity of Final Four appearances by one - and - doners , is that coaches who fail to recruit the very best talent are probably doing themselves a disservice .
The objective of every major program is to make Final Fours and win national championships , but the journey to get there has to be built on a foundation of talent , and successful one - and - dones can pay dividends in terms of future talent well beyond the scope of their W/ Ls while briefly on campus .

If it looks as though Sean Penn is just another Hollywood star courting headlines with a camera - ready cause , look again .
With a midlife milestone looming ( Penn turns 50 in August ) , his marriage to Robin Wright Penn seemingly finished ( “ She is a ghost to me now , ” he observes ) , and a teenage son , Hopper , having recovered from a life - threatening skateboard accident , the Oscar - winning actor decided to redirect his focus and his priorities .
Instead of shooting another film or hawking his latest (* Fair Game , * in which he portrays Ambassador Joseph Wilson , playing opposite Naomi Watts as “ outed ” C.I.A. agent Valerie Plame ) , Penn ended up committing himself to the people of Pétionville , a once - affluent Haitian suburb where he now runs a camp for 50,000 displaced earthquake survivors .
As * Vanity Fair ’*s July issue reveals in detail for the first time , a week after the quake hit last January — killing an estimated quarter of a million people —
Penn , a longtime political activist , joined forces with L.A. - based , Sarajevo - born philanthropist Diana Jenkins ( creating the humanitarian organization J/ P HRO ) , lined up crisis veteran Alison Thompson to assist in recruiting an A - team of relief volunteers , and flew from his home in Malibu to a ravaged hillside in Port - au - Prince — with a dozen doctors in tow .
Ever since , Penn , wearing camouflage khakis and carrying a Glock handgun , has been living in a tent not much larger than an army - surplus locker .
And this spring the actor and his organization — who toil alongside Haitian colleagues , fellow aid workers , and army rangers — were designated by their fellow NGOs and U.N. officials as the “ camp manager ” of the Pétionville facility .
Author Douglas Brinkley , the historian , V.F. contributing editor , and a decade - long acquaintance of Penn ’s ( the pair volunteered in New Orleans in 2005 shortly after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina ) , traces the humanitarian and personal motivations of the typically press-averse Penn , examining his desire to become an activist in the Phil Ochs mold .
“ I wanted to give back something more to help struggling people , but I did n’t know how best to do it , ” Penn tells Brinkley .
“ I was for 20 years in a relationship with Robin and 18 years with children .
I did n’t have time to commit to anything — for real — in places like Iraq , except to denounce the war .
But now I ’m single .

For the past five months , Penn ’s home base has been the sprawling tent city set up on the former Pétionville country club .
( He has left only for a short fund - raising swing , to attend the Oscars in March , and to testify about Haiti on Capitol Hill in May . )
As the camp has been buffeted by outbreaks of TB , malaria , dengue fever , and diphtheria , and as the rainy season threatens to bring new potential perils ( mud slides , disease , civil unrest ) , Penn spearheads relief efforts , helps relocate displaced families , and works to arrange deliveries of emergency medical supplies — in one instance coordinating with Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez to airlift in morphine and other drugs .
The U.S. military , it turns out , are among Penn ’s strongest supporters .
“ My politics are not in line with Sean Penn ’s , ” states Major General Simeon Trombitas , a frequent guest at J/P HRO compound .
“ But we are allied in trying to save lives and alleviate human suffering .
He is a doer and not a talker ... and I respect that immensely . ”
Lieutenant General P. K. Keen , deputy commander of the U.S. Southern Command , concurs : “ In a humanitarian crisis you can be a neutral — always pinching your knuckles white .
Or you can operate an NGO the way Mr. Penn does .…
He intuitively knew how to both work with the U.N. and break its bureaucracy down ....
I applaud the leadership he has shown .
He does n’t have to do this . ”
Okay , I think you guys will love this .
But hate that I do n’t have better pictures to show you .
This is for anyone who wanted to make the Cupcake Pops but did n’t feel up to the task .
They are based on the Red Velvet Cake Balls I ’ve made before .
These Cupcake Bites are just as cute and do n’t need a cookie cutter to shape .
But you will need a candy mold .
They are easy to find though .
As a matter of fact , here ’s a link .
So instead of lollipop sticks , you can package them in little boxes and wrap with ribbon .
So , if you ’re a first - time cake baller / cupcake popper , you may want to start with a cake mix and ready - made frosting .
( These proportions work right for me everytime . )
Then , you can try with your favorite cake and frosting recipe once you see how the proportions and texture should come out .
Here ’s what you do :
Easy Cupcake Bites
1 box cake mix ( cook as directed on box for 13 X 9 cake )
1 can cream cheese frosting ( 16 oz . )
1 package chocolate bark ( or candy melts for cupcake bottom )
Colored Candy Melts ( for cupcake top )
Candy Cup Mold
Sprinkles and m&ms for decoration
After cake is cooked and cooled completely , crumble into large bowl .
( The texture should be fine / fluffy ) Using the back of a large spoon , mix thoroughly with 1 can cream cheese frosting .
( It may be easier to use fingers to mix together , but be warned it will get messy . )
Roll mixture into quarter size balls ( make sure they are smaller in diameter than that of your candy mold ) and lay on wax paper covered cookie sheet .
Chill in the freezer for a few minutes , until they are slightly firm , not frozen .
Melt chocolate bark and candy melts in microwave per directions on package .
Using a spoon or squeeze bottle , fill each mold cavity with a small amount of chocolate .
Sorry , I did n’t think to measure how much .
But as soon as you fill the cavity , go ahead and place one of your rolled balls into it .
Carefully push it down until the force causes the chocolate to push up and fill in around the sides of the ball .
You may have to experiment with a couple to get the right amount .
Stop pushing once the chocolate reaches the top edge .
Place the mold tray filled with cupcakes in the freezer for just a few minutes to let the chocolate set .
Remove and then gently pull up on the cake ball top to release from candy mold .
Now , holding the bottom of the cupcake , dip the top in another color of melted chocolate .
Decorate .
And , probably impress your friends and family .
Makes about 50 .
Store in an airtight container and they will last for several days .
NASA 's " Moonbase Alpha " game puts players in the role of an astronaut trying to save a lunar base .
Here , the astronaut has replaced a broken power coupling and is tightening the power cable connections with a wrench .
Disaster unfolds rapidly at NASA 's fictional moon base in2025 .
A meteorite strike has damaged vital solar arrays that keep the lifesupport systems running , oxygen levels are dropping fast for astronauts inside thebase , and that darn repair robot just got stuck .
What 's a space explorer to do ?
Welcome to " MoonbaseAlpha , " NASA 's new free game now available for download for PC userson Valve 's Steam online gaming service .
Virtual explorers must try to restoreoxygen by repairing damaged solar arrays , power couplings and life supportsystems during a 25 - minute limit .
The game also allows up to six players to cooperativelyrace the clock online , and to tackle larger repair maps for a greaterchallenge .
Players can hop aboard a lunar rover to cross the longer distances .
" Moonbase Alpha " gives a taste of NASA 's ambitiousspace game , a massively multiplayer online game , called " Astronaut : Moon , Mars & Beyond , " where players would take on astronaut roles , such as a roboticist , and explore virtual versions of the moon and otherextraterrestrial locations .
" Moonbase Alpha " also represents a low - costinvestment for NASA , even if it's not a replacement for an actual rocket programthat can send astronauts back to the moon
" That 's the appeal of using games and simulations , because they let you do things that are wildly unaffordable [ in real life ] , " said Daniel Laughlin , project manager for NASA Learning Technologies at theagency 's Goddard Earth Science and Technology Center in Maryland .
Fixing a virtual moonbase
In " Moonbase Alpha " players jump straight intothe action after a brief cinematic that details the challenges at hand .
[ Video : Moonbase Alpha trailer ]
They control an astronaut who must visit an equipmentshed to get tools such as wrenches and welding torch to fix the base .
But theastronaut can only carry one tool at a time , which means players should choosewisely and drop off their tools in strategic central locations .
One of the more entertaining parts of " MoonbaseAlpha " comes from deploying and controlling a repair robot that is armedwith either a welding torch or a basic arm .
Driving the robot allows the playerto approach hazardous parts of the base to make repairs .
It 's possible todeploy both types of robots at once , even if the player can only control one ata time .
" Moonbase Alpha " also requires a bit ofprecision in its game interactions , so that a player 's astronaut may struggleto hook up a bulky power cable if it 's not aligned properly .
Likewise , therobot has the expected turning radius of a wheeled vehicle and does not turn ona dime .
Those small touches came as a pleasant surprise , exceptwhen the game controls defied player attempts .
The in - game cursor movement feltsluggish enough to make a robot repair mini - game that involved tracing circuitlines more challenging than expected .
Most of the player interaction takes place by focusing acentral target reticule and left - clicking to take action .
That works for themost part , aside from a few times when awkward camera angles may force theplayer to back up or move the astronaut around .
The trickiest part of " Moonbase Alpha " comesfrom figuring out just what the game wants players to do in a particular repairsituation .
That can become difficult during a first play - through withoutknowing what repair tools are needed for each case , and especially when everysecond counts .
Voiceovers drop a few hints about the movement controlsand what to do next , but many players may encounter some trial - and - error beforethey actually succeed in saving the base within the 25 - minute time limit .
Thegame does allow players to turn off the time limit , but at the cost of nothaving their score recorded on the game 's leader boards .
Virtual moon meets reality
The cancellation of NASA 's Constellationprogram that aimed to return astronauts to the moon prompted a debate amongNASA and the game developers about whether or not to shift the focus of " Moonbase Alpha " to Mars .
But that would have required changingalmost all the animations at a late stage of development .
Some people also worried that nationallawmakers might view the game as proof that NASA still wants to aim for themoon first .
Yet Laughlin pointed out that it's a video game , not a policydocument .
" What I have been told is that the moon is stillNASA 's future , just not in the immediate future , " Laughlin told SPACE.com .
" Moonbase Alpha " has already begun attractingattention from inside NASA .
Laughlin told of receiving calls from NASAscientists and engineers eager for their missions to appear in " Astronaut : Moon , Mars and Beyond . "
The tie - in of actual mission data could give futuregamers an extra dose of realism .
" People will come from projects and say hey , I wantmy Martian explorer or hypothetical Europa probe in there , " Laughlin said . " [ The game ] will expand as we get more missions signed on . "

La próxima guerra es , claro , la que se desarrollaría entre Irán e Israel , con el apoyo - no podría ser de otra manera - de Estados Unidos .
Obama ha repetido muchas veces que para él la solución ideal es la diplomática .
Lo que no parece tan claro es que para Benjamin Netanyahu y el Gobierno israelí esta sea también la mejor solución .
Curiosamente , el presidente demócrata no es santo de la devoción de Netanyahu ( un sentimiento recíproco que Obama comparte con Nicolás Sarkozy , que lo calificó de “ mentiroso insoportable “ ) , pese a que en política exterior la Administración Obama ha sido un aliado firme e inquebrantable del Estado judío - recordemos , por ejemplo , el veto estadounidense al reconocimiento de Palestina como Estado en la ONU o la retirada de fondos de la UNESCO tras la admisión de Palestina con una abrumadora mayoría - .
Irán está cerca de construir la bomba atómica .
Indudablemente , esto es una amenaza para Israel , Estado al que no reconoce la República Islámica de Irán y sobre el cual Ahmadineyad ha repetido en numerosas ocasiones que le gustaría ver borrado del mapa .
Además , una vez que Irán tenga la bomba queda abierto el camino para una peligrosísima carrera armamentística en la región .
Las monarquías suníes del Golfo no querrían ver bajo ninguna circunstancia cómo la República Islámica chií se convierte en el hegemón regional - ambición implícita del régimen de los ayatolás - .
Por otro lado , los precedentes para Irán son claros , teniendo en cuenta los recientes ejemplos de intervenciones occidentales en Irak o Libia .
La comparación entre Corea del Norte y Libia es totalmente esclarecedora : el armamento nuclear es el ‘ seguro de vida ’ para el régimen .
Con él están protegidos , sin él son vulnerables .
Paradójicamente , la amenaza viene al no tenerlo pero desearlo .
Israel ya está , de hecho , llevando a cabo una guerra secreta contra el programa nuclear iraní - desde ataques informáticos a asesinatos selectivos de científicos -.
La cuestión ahora es si vamos a pasar a palabras mayores .
Sin embargo , ¿podría un ataque israelí eliminar la amenaza ?
Como bien nos advierte Aaron David Miller en Foreign Policy , “ nadie puede impedir que Irán adquiera el arma nuclear salvo los propios iraníes ” .
La incertidumbre , además , es grande .
¿ Se levantará la población contra el Gobierno por su terquedad o , por el contrario , aflorará el nacionalismo y servirá como factor de unión para todos los iraníes al verse atacados por un enemigo externo ?
El resultado de un hipotético ataque israelí , como advierte Lluís Bassets , podría provocar el cierre del estrecho de Ormuz - acción que afectaría al precio del petróleo y al suministro de crudo mundial - .
Existe el riesgo , a su vez , de relanzar el sentimiento de antiamericanismo en la región , algo que Obama se había propuesto mitigar , tanto a través de su acción exterior como en sus famosos discursos de El Cairo y Yakarta .
Las previsiones apuntan a primavera o verano para el comienzo de los ataques .
La Unión Europea , por su parte , ya ha puesto en marcha importantes sanciones : el Consejo de Exteriores ha aprobado un embargo total a las exportaciones de petróleo iraní que entrará en vigor el 1 de julio de este año .
¿ Qué pasa si no funciona ?
Antonio López Istúriz , secretario general del Partido Popular Europeo , nos ha dicho en nuestro último podcast que Europa de verdad espera que funcione .
Sin embargo , como ha evaluado el Scorecard de ECFR , la política exterior europea respecto a Irán , pese a que las posiciones europeas están muy unidas , no obtiene los resultados esperados .
¿ La próxima guerra ?
Italy 's corruption police tape the Pope 's phone calls
Taped :
The Pope 's phonecalls were secretly recorded
Pope Benedict XVI has become the first Pope to be recorded during a corruption investigation by Italian police , it emerged yesterday .
The leader of the world 's two billion Roman Catholics was unwittingly recorded by officers who were listening in on a suspect 's mobile phone conversations .
The Pontiff made four telephone calls to Italy 's civil protection chief Guido Bertolaso following last year 's devastating earthquake in the centre of the country which left 300 people dead .
Bertolaso is at the centre of a corruption probe involving sexual favours and back handers for reconstruction projects in the L'Aquila region which was hit by the earthquake 14 months ago .
Pope Benedict is not suspected of any wrong doing - although Vatican officials are said to be furious that he was secretly taped - while it has also emerged that US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was also recorded speaking to Bertolaso .
Both had called Bertolaso to offer support and thanks for the efforts of his civil protection team who were providing rapid reaction relief in the devastated area .
Officers monitoring Bertolaso's mobile telephone were stunned when they heard the Pope 's private secretary Georg Ganswein call and say : ' Hello .
I have His Holiness the Pope on the line for you .'
The details of Pope Benedict 's intercepted calls emerged in several Italian newspapers today / yesterday but the content was not reported although it is believed to have been fairly mundane and complimentary .
Italians have got use to reading wiretaps during police investigations and they have caught out several big names including controversial Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi .
It is estimated that during the last ten years 30 million telephone calls have been secretly recorded by police and intelligence agencies across the country as part of various investigations .
Three years ago Berlusconi was famously recorded calling a TV chief and asking him to give parts to his favourite actresses who he described as ' my little butterflies ' .
Yesterday the Italian Senate ( Upper House ) passed a confidence vote on the telephone interception bill by 164 to 25 and it will now go to the Lower House for final approval .
Berlusconi's centre right majority won handsomely after the centre left opposition walked out in protest as they were called to vote describing the the bill as a ' gagging law ' .
The bill which would drastically reduce the justification for wire taps and also make publishing their contents in newspapers a crime .
Opposition MPs and newspapers have criticised the bill which they say is merely an attempt by Berlusconi to protect himself from future investigations - he is currently facing two corruption probes .
If passed the law will mean that special permission is needed to tap a member of the clergy or MP .
Today / yesterday no-on from the American Embassy in Rome was immediately available to comment on Mrs Clinton 's intercepted telephone call while a Vatican spokesman declined to comment officially .
However a Vatican insider said : ' To think that someone recorded Pope Benedict without him knowing is outrageous even if it is part of a police investigation . '
A police source said : ' The tapes containing the recordings of Pope Benedict and Mrs Clinton have been destroyed as they had no significance in the investigation of Bertolaso . '
ORLANDO , Fla. , March 24 ( UPI ) -- A British expatriate living in Florida said her dating Web site , which aims to connect people in the United States and Britain , has reached 1,500 members .
Rochelle Peachey of Orlando , who has lived in the United States for about 13 years , said ILoveYourAccent.com , a Web site aimed at connecting people with differing accents from opposite sides of the Atlantic , has amassed 1,500 profiles since it went live late last year , the Orlando ( Fla . ) Sentinel reported Wednesday .

" Really , the question is : How do I go beyond my circle of friends ? "
Peachey said .
" But it does n't have to be about dating .
There may be people who dream of going to London , but they do n't know anyone there and do n't have anyone to travel with .
Here , they can meet some people and travel to London , where they 'll know someone who can show them around . "
Peachey said membership on the site is currently free , but she may start charging $ 20 to $ 25 a month if it grows in popularity .
She said the site will soon have a feature allowing those browsing profiles to listen to voice clips and hear the accents for themselves .
The military considers them just another piece of equipment ; they even have service numbers tattooed inside their ears .
Soldiers often treat them as pets , playing with them and feeding them the junk food common on the remote bases of Afghanistan .
To their handlers , bomb - sniffing dogs are more like battle buddies .
“ I ’d trust Urmel over most people , ” Army Sgt. Tait Terzo said of his 4 - year - old Belgian Malinois ( service number : L - 424 ) .
Advertisement
At the same time , he said , if a bomb is lethal , better it kills a dog than a human .
“ I hate to say it , but I ’d rather lose a dog than a person , as much as it would hurt to lose Urmel , ” Terzo said .
For the last year , military working dogs -- Belgian Malinois , German shepherds and Labradors -- have been joining patrols in southern Afghanistan .
Their handlers say the dogs have detected homemade bombs , explosives , bomb - making factories , weapons and ammunition stockpiles .
The dogs are often the first line of defense for ground troops .
Homemade roadside bombs , known as improvised explosive devices , are the leading killer of U.S. forces here , accounting for 56 % of combat deaths this year .

A few soldiers are skeptical about how well the dogs detect expertly hidden bombs , but most say they feel safer when the animals lead foot patrols .
“ These dogs are saving lives , ” said U.S. Air Force Master Sgt. Jerry Wood , program manager for the working dog kennel at Kandahar air field , where no dogs or handlers have been killed despite the ubiquitous roadside bombs in southern Afghanistan .
“ Every bomb they find is one that wo n’t kill coalition forces . ”
Urmel has sniffed out at least 20 bombs or explosive caches over the last year .
Ted , a 6 - year - old chocolate Lab , has detected nearly 2,000 pounds of explosives .
On June 5 , Urmel and Terzo survived their first explosion when a roadside bomb detonated just after they passed by , slamming them to the ground but causing no serious injuries .
The bomb , hidden next to cow manure near a pomegranate orchard west of Kandahar , was planted too far off the dirt path for Urmel to detect it , Terzo said .

In November , Ted and his handler , Army Spc. Robert Sylvia , were near a homemade bomb in Kandahar city when it exploded .
Ted was n’t hurt , but Sylvia sustained a concussion .
In June , Ted sniffed out 30 pounds of homemade explosives hidden in a haystack in the Arghandab Valley , enough to make several bombs .
“ Yeah , that ’s right ; he found the needle in the haystack , ” Sylvia said .
Most of the animals are also trained attack dogs .

“ We call ‘em land sharks , ” Wood said .
“ They ’re mean , lean fighting machines . ”
Vincent , a disagreeable Belgian Malinois , has bitten several handlers .
He recently bit Army Sgt. Justin McGee , on the thigh , drawing blood .
“ Got too close to him , I guess , ” McGee said .
“ Or maybe that dog is just racist , ” he joked .
McGee is African American .

McGee was already nursing a sore shoulder , injured recently when a homemade bomb exploded while he and his dog were on patrol .
Almost every dog handler has been bitten more than once , usually in training .
Dogs and handlers train together for months before deploying in Afghanistan , where they train almost daily when they ’re not on patrol .
The dogs are bought as puppies from breeders worldwide .
For the last seven years , dogs have also come from a U.S. military breeding program at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas .
The dogs are taught to sit when they detect explosives so they do n’t start digging for buried bombs .
They work for rewards : a chew toy or snack in training , though never on patrol .
Advertisement
“ Ultimately , they ’re working for praise from their handler , ” Wood said .
“ That ’s what really drives them . ”
Terzo and Urmel have been together for three years .
They flew to Afghanistan on a commercial plane : Urmel in his own seat , fussed over by the cabin crew , who served him ice chips .
Belgian Malinois make the best working dogs , the handlers say .
They are leaner and more robust than the second - best breed , German shepherds .
“ The Malinois have very high drive and energy , ” Terzo said .
Advertisement
Most dogs work until they are 8 to 10 , though one 14 - year - old is still working .
On the other hand , one 4 - year - old had to be “ decertified , ” or retired .
“ Too much exposure to too many bad things , ” Wood said .
The dogs are watched closely for signs of stress or fear when they return to the kennel from patrols .
Handlers and veterinarians watch for a sudden change in behavior and try to determine the cause , such as separation anxiety when a handler goes on leave , or adverse reactions to an explosion .
( The military is conducting studies on possible post - traumatic stress syndrome in working dogs , Wood said ) .
Urmel handled his first bomb explosion well , Terzo said .
He ’s been exposed to many controlled detonations ; on a recent patrol , Urmel winced each time an explosives specialist screamed out “ Fire in the hole ! ” to announce a detonation .
Advertisement
“ He knows that phrase pretty well , ” Terzo said .
Urmel , the only kennel dog allowed to wander the handlers ’ working area beyond the locked cages , follows Terzo ’s every move , seeking his approval while accepting belly rubs from any available human .
But during attack training on the Kandahar base , Urmel becomes a snarling , lunging whirl .
As part of an exercise , Spc. Marcus Bernardy put on a thick , padded coat and played the role of a fleeing suspect .
Terzo released Urmel , who speeded after Bernardy , leaped to sink his teeth into a padded arm , and slammed the 205 - pound soldier to the ground .
Advertisement
Growling and clenching , Urmel hung fast until Terzo ordered him to release .
In a second exercise , Urmel again raced after Bernardy .
But this time , as the dog was about to leap and strike , Terzo shouted “ Out ! ” Urmel veered past Bernardy , doubled back , and hovered over the suspect , growling and slobbering .
Terzo smiled down at Bernardy , who was on his face in the dirt , sweating profusely .
“ Basically , ” Terzo said , “ he ’s a bullet we can call back . ”

SNOO adds 1 - 2+ hours of sleep per night for babies ... and their tired parents !
When SNOO detects crying , it automatically responds with increasing sound and motion , often calming fussing in under a minute !
Our one - of - a - kind swaddle secures babies safely on their backs , preventing risky rolling … for all nights and all naps .
The registration on her 1995 Toyota Camry has sometimes gone unpaid and she has only allowed herself a one - week holiday in Hobart in two years .
Her weekly outing is ten - pin bowling with friends .
Her struggle comes as a shock .
Despite being employed all her adult life , she now finds herself in the demographic sub-category called '' working poor ' ' .
A rapid surge in the cost of utilities , particularly the staples of electricity , water gas and phone , has forced Stacey and increasing numbers of others like her to join welfare recipients and pensioners in seeking help to pay those bills .
It is trend identified recently by Victoria 's Water and Energy Ombudsman , Fiona McLeod , who noted the number of people having their electricity cut off in the July to December period last year had doubled to 629 compared with the previous year .
This , she said , included a rising proportion of people in full - time jobs .
Ms McLeod said that costs of utilities , particularly electricity , presented a growing hardship issue nationwide .
Both Queensland and New South Wales raised domestic power prices by 13 per cent from July 1 .
In the case of NSW , that represents an increase in power charges of up to 42 per cent over three years .
Ms McLeod said increasing numbers of people were forced to go to their energy ombudsman for help in sorting out payments .
'' Suddenly people who might have been coping are needing welfare agencies and financial counsellors , '' says Ms McLeod .
'' In Victoria , electricity disconnections have doubled and gas disconnections have gone up 50 per cent . ''
And soon people on lower incomes are likely to need more help than ever to to pay utilities charges .
Sarah Wise , the general manager for policy research at Anglicare Victoria , says that electricity and water bills are likely to rise dramatically over the coming decade .
This will result from governments responding to the challenges of drought and climate change .
From this month , Victorian water bills are expected to rise by up to 20 per cent a year to pay the costs of infrastructure such as the desalination plant and north - south pipeline .
These costs have come as the state government tries to top up water supplies which have fallen due to decreased rainfall and the demands of an increasing population .
While the Rudd government was punished in the polls by parts of the electorate for delaying its emissions trading scheme , the delay represents a breather for Stacey and people like her .
Nonetheless , the state and federal governments are committed to reducing carbon dioxide emissions by generating more electricity using gas and wind power .
Both of these options point to significantly higher power bills in future because both technologies are more expensive than the greenhouse - intensive brown coal we mainly use now .
Gas is at least one - quarter more expensive and wind up to double the price due to its relatively high capital costs and its comparatively low energy output .
Dr Wise says she believes people already experiencing difficulties should not have to bear the weight of these increased costs .
'' There are ordinary decent people who are working full time on low incomes who can't make ends meet now .
This will push people over the edge , '' she says .
The state opposition claims the looming price rises will be exacerbated because government was lax in renewing infrastructure that might have eased the cost of supplying services such as water and electricity .
Opposition water supply spokesman Peter Walsh says he believes annual domestic water bills would increase to $ 1000 in some regions in the coming years .
'' Victorians will pay an average of $ 133 extra a year in their water bills to pay for the Wonthaggi desalination plant and the failed north - south pipeline , '' says Mr Walsh .
'' Despite the price increase , there will be no increase in concession rates making families , pensioners and low - income earners particularly vulnerable . ''
He says that the government had failed to act in its first seven years in office and then panicked .
By the time it got around to building the facilities , it had to pay premium prices for everything .
Stacey says she does n't understand global warming , but she does fear the impact of what might be done to her already overstretched budget .
It is not that she is careless or wasteful .
She rarely uses much heating or the air - conditioner in summer and has installed energy - saving fluorescent light bulbs .
She drinks little alcohol but , by her own admission , one of her biggest failings is that she smokes , a habit that has recently also become more expensive due to the federal government 's 25 per cent excise hike in the recent budget .
' ' I know it is stupid and I know I should n't smoke , but the more I am stressed , the more I do , '' says Stacey .
She says her problem is that while she can budget for most expenditure , unexpected events like a recent death in the family and the relentless rise of power charges mean she can't meet payments and gets behind .
The other big problem is Christmas .
Although she has resolved not to celebrate , she says it still sneaks up on her as a financial burden .
Her predicament began about 18 years ago with the depression - inspired suicide of her husband who worked as a wood machinist , and she was left with two young children to bring up .
It became more difficult when , like most Australians , she pursued the dream of home ownership , buying her current Sunbury three - bedroom brick veneer house on her single income with her two children living at home at the time .
Now her daughter has married and moved out , and her son , who works as a builder , still lives at home and helps with the bills but is saving to move out with his girlfriend .
In the past few years , life has become particularly tough .
When her son does leave , Stacey imagines she will have to sell the house and resettle in a caravan park .
'' It is not so bad , I have a friend doing it .
You rent space for one of these relocatable homes .
But after all these years ' work , I never thought I 'd end up in this position . ''
She said part of her problem was that a door - to - door salesman talked her into switching from her former energy provider on the promise of cheaper electricity .
'' I do n't know whether they really are cheaper , but they are certainly less understanding .
I seem to always be negotiating .
I get back on track and it works for a while , '' says Stacey .
Stacey says she was assisted in her situation by financial counsellors from the Uniting agency and while they had been able to renegotiate better terms for payments , she felt they were only delaying the inevitable .
'' I feel like I am drowning , I know I am going to lose my house . ''
In Preston , Hasan does n't own a house but he does have a rental home that he is now finding he can't afford to heat .
A Sunni Muslim from Iran , he is 43 and a single father with two children .
He was accepted into Australia as a refugee nine years ago , earns $ 31,000 a year as a labourer in a pasta factory and has lived in Preston for six years .
The address is part of his problem because while Hasan is still on a labourer 's wage , his suburb is rapidly gentrifying - sending his rent from $ 240 a week to $ 370 in the past year .
As well , when the ageing gas wall heater failed a year or so ago , the agents replaced it with a split - system , reverse - cycle air - conditioner , which was cheaper for them but is prohibitively dearer for Hasan to run .
It was also placed in the dining room , which means it does not effectively heat the rest of the house .
'' Each quarter the electricity bills were $ 400 and I could n't pay them .
Now I owe $ 1200 , '' he says .
Despite his problems , Hasan , who has been receiving financial assistance and counselling from Anglicare , says he does not regret coming to Australia .
But in living here he has had to resort to austerity measures that are unimaginable to many families : '' I 've just had to tell the kids we can't have heating this winter - they just have to rug up . ''

Chef discovers largest ever hoard of Roman coins in a field
For 1,800 years the story of the ' lost British emperor ' who defied ancient Rome has been merely a footnote in history books .
Carausius 's audacious seizure of power and seven - year reign over Britain and much of Gaul have largely been forgotten .
But thanks to the astonishing discovery of 52,000 Roman coins , new light is being shed on one of the most turbulent periods of our island story .
Hands covered in mud , Dave Crisp crouches down ( left ) in the field where he made the find .
And , right , he examines one of the 52,500 coins , dating to the 3rd century AD , he found Slowly but surely the pot of coins emerges from the field near Frome , in Somerset
Hundreds of the coins - buried in a gigantic clay jar and weighing as much as two men - bear the image of Carausius .
The discovery was made by hospital chef Dave Crisp using a metal detector .
The 63 - year - old unearthed 21 of the coins on a farm near Frome in Somerset before realising the find was so significant expert help was needed .
He called in archaeologists who set about the delicate task of excavating the site .
The pot was filled to the brim with 3rd century Roman coins , making the find one of the biggest ever in Britain
The coins are laid out on a table to be sorted .
One of the most important aspects of the hoard is that it contains a large group of coins of Carausius , who ruled Britain independently from AD 286 to AD 293
SO JUST WHO WAS EMPEROR CARAUSIUS ?
Hundreds of the coins discovered bear the image of Marcus Aurelius Carausius ( pictured below ) who seized power in Britain and northern France in the late third century and proclaimed himself emperor .
The Roman naval officer seized power in 286 and ruled until he was assassinated by his finance minister in 293 .
He came to prominence after distinguishing himself in a war against rebels in France .
With his naval background he was put in charge of a fleet whose aim was to destroy the pirates raiding the coasts of northern France and Belgian .
It was after he was accused of keeping some of the seized treasure for himself that he declared himself emperor .
Roger Bland , of the British Museum , said : ' The late third century A.D. was a time when Britain suffered barbarian invasions , economic crises and civil wars .
' Roman rule was finally stabilized when the Emperor Diocletian formed a coalition with the Emperor Maximian , which lasted 20 years .
This defeated the separatist regime which had been established in Britain by Carausius .
' This find presents us with an opportunity to put Carausius on the map .
School children across the country have been studying Roman Britain for decades , but are never taught about Carausius our lost British emperor . '
The hoard was then taken to the British Museum to be cleaned up and recorded .
The coins span 40 years from AD253 to AD293 and the great majority are ' radiates ' made from debased silver or bronze .
The hoard was the equivalent of four years of pay for a Roman legionary - and could now fetch at least £ 250,000 .
Weighing 350lb , the coins may have been buried as an offering for a good harvest or favourable weather .
Mr Crisp , 63 , today told how his detector gave a ' funny signal ' , prompting him to dig through the soil .
' I put my hand in , pulled out a bit of clay and there was a little Radial , a little bronze Roman coin , ' he said .
' Very , very small , about the size of my fingernail . '
He added : ' I have made many finds over the years , but this is my first major coin hoard . '
Initially , Mr Crisp unearthed 21 coins in the field near Frome in Somerset .
But when he came across the top of a pot , he began to realise the significance of his find .
Archaeologists set about the delicate task of excavating the 2ft tall pot and its contents .
The hoard was taken to the British Museum so that the coins could be cleaned and recorded .
' Leaving it in the ground for the archaeologists to excavate was a very hard decision to take , but as it had been there for 1,800 years I thought a few days more would not hurt , ' said Mr Crisp .
' My family thought I was mad to walk away and leave it . '
The coins were found in a large , well preserved pot around 18 inches across - a type of jar normally used for storing food .
The hoard includes more than 760 Carausius coins - the largest group ever found .
They include five rare silver denarii , the only coins of their type struck in the Roman Empire at that time .
Roger Bland , Head of Portable Antiquities and Treasure at the British Museum where the coins are going on display , said : ' This hoard , which is one of the largest ever found in Britain , has a huge amount to tell about the coinage and history of the period as we study over the next two years .
' The late 3rd Century AD was a time when Britain suffered barbarian invasions , economic crises and civil wars .
Roman rule was finally stabilised when the Emperor Diocletian formed a coalition with the Emperor Maximian , which lasted 20 years .
' This defeated the separatist regime which had been established in Britain by Carausius .
' This find presents us with an opportunity to put Carausius on the map .
School children across the country have been studying Roman Britain for decades , but are never taught about Carausius , our lost British emperor . '
Under the 1996 Treasure Act , anyone who finds a group of buried coins has to declare it to the coroner within two weeks .
If the coins are bought , as planned , by the Museum of Somerset , the reward will shared between Mr Crisp and the landowner .
A selection of the coins , found in April , is to go on display at the British Museum from July 22 until mid-August .
The largest hoard ever found in Britain contained 54,912 coins dating from 180 AD to 274AD and was found in two containers near Mildenhall , Wiltshire .
The 18in pot , buried in the field , was packed with coins and weighed around 25 stone
The find was in a field near the town of Frome in Somerset
Since the discovery in late April experts from the Portable Antiquities Scheme ( PAS ) at the British Museum have been sifting through the coins .
The coins were all contained in a single clay pot. , which although it only measured 18 inches across , would have weighed an estimated 25 stone .
The discovery of the Roman coins follows last year 's discovery of a hoard of Anglo - Saxon coins in central England .
The so - called Staffordshire Hoard included more than 1,500 objects , mostly made from gold .
' Because Mr Crisp resisted the temptation to dig up the coins , it has allowed archaeologists from Somerset County Council to carefully excavate the pot and its contents , ' said Anna Booth , local finds liaison officer .
The story of the excavation will be told in a new BBC Two series , Digging for Britain , which will be broadcast next month .

Genesis Breyer P - Orridge founder of the bands Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV has been an icon of the psychedelic and industrial rock music underworlds for some 30 - odd years .
S/he 's amassed a catalog of substantive and provocative sounds and visuals that draw influence from a wide swathe of musical and social sources , including the cut - up theories of personal friends William Burroughs and Brion Gysin .
With the prompting of worldwide followings , both bands have resurfaced over the years through tours and special one - off events , and Psychic TV 's current incarnation , PTV3 , has recently released the new CD / DVD set , Mr. Alien Brain vs. The Skinwalkers
It 's a pleasure to speak with the affable and imaginative P - Orridge , and our recent conversation touched on topics from the fanciful ( the possibilities of human hibernation ) to the tragic ( the loss of one 's life partner ) .
The latter is still particularly fresh since it 's just a year on since the passing of P - Orridge 's " other half , " Jaye Breyer ( best known as Lady Jaye ) , due to heart failure .
The two had previously embarked on a years - long pursuit of pandrogyny , undergoing painful plastic surgery procedures in order to become gender - neutral human beings that looked like each other .
As s/he explains , this was not about achieving a standard of beauty .
Once the body is no longer viewed as sacred , the possibilities are endless .
Pandrogyny is not a mainstream concept , so can you explain your process to a lay audience ?
The one thing that 's important to point out probably with pandrogyny is that it was never about beauty or trying to look in some way subjectively better .
It was always about trying to look like each other and not caring how it was measured in terms of aesthetics , you know ?
It was really interesting one day when we decided that I would have work done on my face and have cheek implants put in so my cheeks would be more like Jaye's .
We were standing in the bathroom , looking in the mirror before the surgery and saying out loud , " This is the face that you got naturally through DNA , and tomorrow you 'll have another face and you do n't even know what it 's gonna look like !
How weird is that ?
In 24 hours ' time , this face will have gone , and we do n't know what the other is gonna be . "
And then we just shrugged and thought , it does n't matter what it looks like !
It was an interesting moment to realize how arbitrary it really is , the way that we look .
So you did n't really have a hard time saying goodbye to your old face ?
No , not at all !
We wondered if we would , but no , not at all .
It 's really through this process that becomes apparent how the human body is just raw material , or as Lady Jaye would say , " a cheap suitcase ! "
It 's just there to move the brain around .
It gives you mobility and it gives you the ability to experience through the senses and to travel and expand consciousness by having the most options .
But it 's not the you you know when you 're thinking to yourself , you think " I this " or " I that ? "
That person that you talk to in your mind is you , that consciousness , that mind .
The body 's not you .
The body is just a container .
And that 's where the big disconnect has happened in the media here , and it 's happened in reverse .
That the body is you and the body is your logo , your brand , and the body has to be perfected in really traditional ways , which is very oppressive and is not the way to evolve change and grow as a species .
It 's regressive , it 's traveling back in times almost to medieval days , when women were just decorative property .
There 's a real strong aspect of that in the way people view looks and the body , especially in the west .
It 's a fascinating area , the clash between the ongoing war for the male to dominate the species and the new options that are becoming available to challenge that in new ways , as we 've been trying to do .
I still think it would be hard to let go of the face you had for so long , but it really was n't ?
Ultimately , it 's DNA that we 're talking about .
DNA is the software of the body .
We started out , because we were so crazy in love , just wanting to eat each other up , to become each other and become one .
And as we did that , we started to see that it was affecting us in ways that we did n't expect .
Really , we were just two parts of one whole ; the pandrogyne was the whole and we were each other 's other half .
DNA is really the new battleground for evolution .
If we want to survive as a species , if we want to hopefully colonize space and do incredible things , we have to completely reassess how the human body works and realize that it 's not sacred , it 's just stuff .
It 's time for us to step away from the prehistoric acceptance of the human body as it was and design ourselves .
Why can't we learn how to hibernate if we are going to go into space ?
Best way to travel to space is to be asleep for long journeys .
Animals hibernate , so it can't be that difficult .
I'm pro-hibernation , definitely .
Would n't that be great ?
Oh , I 'd love it !
And why not be cold - blooded , so you do n't have to worry about what you eat while you 're in space , or whatever ?
Why can't we have fur or feathers or scales or all kinds of things ?
And once we let go [ of the idea ] that the human body is a finished evolutionary object and we just see it as raw material that continues to evolve and change , then the possibilities of what we can become are amazing !
And that change in how we perceive ourselves as a species can then reflect back on social organizations and actually lead to positive change in society too .
We 've been through a long phase , for maybe 30 years or so , or even back to the Sixties , of people wanting to reclaim their individuality .
That 's why things like tattooing and piercing took off , [ because ] people were reasserting their rights to control their own bodies in the same way as [ being able to choose ] abortion was a way for people to have control over their own body .
For some reason , society has always tried to legislate and police people 's bodies .
So that must mean it 's a very powerful place .
The human body is a place of warfare in society .
If we can start to see ourselves as individuals , that 's the first battle .
And that 's been going on for quite a while now .
But what we feel is , that at a certain point , that separation into becoming a self - chosen individual somehow seems to require the responsibility to then re-enter and become part of the whole species again with the responsibility to guide , to explore , to propose new ideas and to set new examples .
If we do n't start to view ourselves as part of the human species , then we 're gonna doom ourselves .
If we separate , there 's friction , there 's violence , there 's bigotry and there 's conflicting ideas of social organization and politics and economics .
We 'll be trapped in this loop of competition and fear and paranoia .
We really feel very strongly that people have to let go of that obsession with self at some point and then use the power they 've regained by getting themselves back to actually give to society as a whole .
This would be a great moment in history for that to happen , especially here in America where we are at our most vulnerable economically .
Maybe Obama 's election is an indication that we 're more ready to think of ourselves collectively ?
Do you think Obama 's gonna make things better ?
I mean , are you hopeful ?
I am hopeful , but I 'm not under the illusion that anything will change overnight .
For example , I am shopping for health insurance and people keep telling me , " Obama 's gonna help you out . "
I think he might be able to help me out at some point , but I still need to figure something else out in the meantime , you know ?
It 's ludicrous because most of the countries in Europe have had universal health care for decades and they 've survived very healthily in the economy .
When you want to know what 's going on , look for the vested interests .
And it 's clear that pharmaceutical companies , the doctors ' associations , the hospitals , the health insurance companies none of them want universal health care .
They 're able to just blackmail and extort huge sums of money out of the current situation , why would they want it to change ?
The Clintons tried to bring in universal health care and they were shot down almost immediately .
There 's this huge inertia from these lobbyists and the corporations who just think in terms of their own profits and not the wellbeing of the nation .
And that 's going to be a real problem in the United States .
It shocks me that when people talk about having health insurance for everyone , a lot of people that you would n't expect go , " Well , that 's communism !
That 's socialism ! "
What ?
That 's humanism !
That 's a precious gift that a government can give to its people , housing and health care .
There has to be a huge rethink and that 's why it 's good that there 's someone like Obama .
For sure !
You 're originally from England but have lived in Brooklyn for quite some time .
Are you still happy living in this country , especially with a new administration coming in to power ?
Yeah .
My own country threw me out for seven years and treated me abysmally and took my archive and destroyed it .
There 's no Bill of Rights in England and it's interesting that it 's thought of as the home of democracy and yet the Queen is still the head of the church .
She 's still the head of the armed forces , she 's still the head of the police and she can still dismiss Parliament if she wants .
So they 've got the health care correct , but that 's about it ? [ laughs ]
Well , you can imagine that , probably if they could get away with it , the rich would probably like to get rid of the health burden .
But it 's too much a part of British life now .
When Britain joined the European Union , even the condition of membership was that they had to have a Bill of Rights .
And Britain refused , but were actually let in anyway as the exception .
But that says a lot that they would n't have one , that they did n't want people to have any real political rights or constitutional rights .
That 's very sad that there 's still this sense in the powers - that - be that the rest of the population is somehow inferior and almost a sub-species that has to be looked after despite the irritation that they cause .
It 's a very patronizing way of running a society and it's why these old bigotries are still entrenched : Racism and sexism and all the other bigotries .
They 're all entrenched in these old , outmoded , archaic institutions .
We are really at a crossroads , in my opinion :
We either regress into a new Dark Age , where everybody is just fighting each other for what little bit of resource there is or because somebody has a different view of God .
We 'll either do that or we 'll have to have a completely new , evolutionary rethink and take the miraculous abilities of humans to create and make technologies and tools that are amazing and almost beyond imagination and focus on the wellbeing of all and progress towards a new , utopian future .
There really does n't seem much point in being here if you 're not trying to make the world a better place .
I like the scenario you 're describing , if I may have a vote amongst the human population ? [ laughs ]
Well , thank you !
But yeah , America has been very kind to me .
It 's been much more tolerant of my ideas .
The fact that we can go to universities and give talks at Rutgers , they said that my lecture had the highest attendance of any lecture in the history of the university .
Now that 's really hopeful , is n't it ?
Yeah , that 's really something .
So there 's a definite groundswell amongst the youth .
They see through the stupidity and the pettiness and the obsession with status symbols and know there 's got to be another path .
We use the pandrogyne as a symbol of unity and inclusiveness .
It 's about similarities , not differences , and about absorbing lovingly everything , rather than separating from things and squabbling for a tiny bit of power .
Now , I have a bit of a stupid question , but how is pandrogyny received within the transgender community ?
Is it welcomed , or is there fear and distance placed between the two ?
That 's not a stupid question ; that 's actually a really good question .
It 's interesting because the transgender community has been the most resistant .
That 's what I would have guessed .
This is no way critical , we still do things to support the transgender community for example , there 's a halfway house for teenage trannies in New York and we give them beautiful designer clothes that we are not using .
But the difference in a way , as Jaye would explain it , is that transgendered people feel as if they 're a man trapped in a woman 's body or that they 're a woman trapped in a man 's body .
The pandrogyne just feels trapped in the body .
And there 's a certain part amongst transgendered people 's vision of themselves that they want to become another gender .
Our ideas are not about gender at all , although they can look that way .
There 's been this sense of feeling , not exactly threatened , but that we 're betraying their struggle for the right to change gender by not being so concerned about gender .
For them , that 's the big issue .
And we 're saying , it does n't matter .
That 's the only community that 's sort of been aggressive towards us , which surprised us at first .
We were n't expecting that at all .
But when you look back at the struggle they 've been through for any kind of acceptance , it 's been very recent that people are starting to be aware of that general issue through television programs and so on .
And it would be wrong to belittle that struggle that so many people have .
We 've been very fortunate , coming from a context where life is art and art is our life and we 're self - employed and so we can create our own fantasy life with the minimum interference .
Other people do n't have that , they 're trapped in mundane jobs and they 're trapped in small towns maybe and they suffer in terrible ways from violence and humiliation and ridicule .
But we 're not the enemy .
We 're there to embrace and include them , too .
It is time to reassess mental disorders , recognizing that these are disorders of brain circuits likely caused by development processes , according to a commentary in the May 19 issue of JAMA , a theme issue on mental health .
Thomas R. Insel , M.D. , Director , National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) , Bethesda , Md. , presented the commentary at a JAMA media briefing on mental health .
Dr. Insel and commentary co-author Philip S. Wang , M.D. , Dr.P.H. , Deputy Director , NIMH , write that compelling reasons to look for genes that confer risk for mental illness come from twin studies demonstrating high heritability for autism , schizophrenia , and bipolar disor­der .
" Although there have been notable findings from link­age and genome - wide association studies , with candidate genes and specific alleles [ an alternative form of a gene ] identified for each of the major mental disorders , those that have been replicated explain only a fraction of the heritability . "
The authors add that although many of the genes implicated are in­volved in brain development , copy number variants do not appear to be specific for illnesses in the current diagnostic scheme .
" Within families , the same copy number variant may be associated with schizophrenia in one person , bipolar disorder in another , and attention - deficit / hyperactivity disor­der in yet another .
The genetics of mental illness may really be the genetics of brain development , with different out­comes possible , depending on the biological and environmental context . "
" The same twin studies that point to high heritability also demonstrate the limits of genetics : environmental factors must be important for mental disorders , " they write .
" The advent of epigenomics , which can detect the molecular effects of expe­rience , may provide a powerful approach for understanding the critical effects of early - life events and environment on adult patterns of behavior . "
The authors note that genomics and epigenomics already point to diverse mo­lecular pathways that confer risk of mental illness .
" What binds these diverse molecular mechanisms together to yield clus­ters of symptoms recognized as the syndromes of psychi­atric disorders ?
Increasingly , clinical neuroscientists are iden­tifying specific circuits for major aspects of illness .
But just as the genetic variants do not map selectively onto current diagnostic categories , so , also , circuits seem to be associated with cognitive and behavioral functions , without a one - to - one correspondence to diagnosis . "
Emerging from systems neu­roscience are two noteworthy points , according to the authors .
" First , there seem to be emerging relationships be­tween genetic variation and development of neural circuits that mediate complex cognition and behavior , from re­ward to emotion regulation .
Second , the current diagnostic categories , based on clinical characteristics , do not seem to align well with findings from genetics and neuroscience . "
They add that reconceptualizing disorders of the mind as disorders of the brain has important implications for how and when to intervene .
Although mental illnesses are more likely neurodevelopmental rather than neurodegenerative disorders , the behavioral and cognitive manifestations that signify these as " mental " illnesses may be late stages of processes that start early in development .
" If genetics and neurosci­ence could provide rigorous , specific , early detection years before psychosis or depression , these illnesses might be redefined in terms of a trajectory .
As a result , interven­tions , rather than being ameliorative or rehabilitative , could become preemptive or even preventive .
But this transformation in diagnosis and treatment , which can be informed by recent progress in cardiovascular disease and cancer , will depend on an intense focus on the genetics and circuitry underlying mental illness to ensure new approaches to detecting risk , validating diagnosis , and developing novel interventions that may be based on alter­ing plasticity or retuning circuitry rather than neurotrans­mitter pharmacology . "
The authors add that even as new interventions are developed for anxi­ety disorders , recent discovery of genetic variants associ­ated with efficacy of existing behavioral treatments sug­gests new ways to tailor their use .
Examples such as this and others provide strong bases for hope that insights emerging from genetics and neuroscience will be translated into rational develop­ment of new robust and personalized treatments .
" With no validated biomarkers and too little in the way of novel medical treatments since 1980 , families need science to provide more than hope .
Genetics and neuroscience finally have the tools to transform the diag­nosis and treatment of mental illness , " the authors conclude .

On a recent summer day in San Francisco , the Tamale Lady celebrated her 57th birthday at Zeitgeist bar .
For the past 17 years , the Patron Saint of the Tamale - otherwise known as Virginia Ramos - has peddled her homemade tamales and motherly advice late into the night at bars in the Mission and South of Market .
A rockumentary , " Our Lady of Tamale , " has been made about her , not to mention a 50 - song tribute CD .
" I ( Heart ) The Tamale Lady " stickers adorn Critical Mass bikes and dive bars throughout the city .
What gave you the idea to start selling tamales ?
I needed to put seven kids through college , and I was n't making enough cleaning houses .
Was the extra income enough ?
Five went to college , and one is in the military , so I did all right .
How did you learn to make tamales ?
The church ladies in my little Mexican town , in Nayarit .
How did you get to San Francisco ?
I had a hard life , no parents to buy me food or anything .
I married at 14 because I had no place to go .
Then he started with alcohol , so my brother helped me move to California .
I worked cleaning houses until one by one I could bring my kids here .
How has your life changed since you 've been in the newspaper and a film ?
People give me a lot of congratulations , and companies like Dolby and Lucasfilm ask me to bring tamales .
Is it still a surprise when you show up in a bar , or can people follow you on Twitter now ?
I am all kind of places on the Internet .
Face ...
Face ... what 's that Face thing ?
I do n't know it , but my son put me on there , yeah .
He does the Twitter , too .
Have you expanded your menu ?
I still make chicken mole , pork , and vegetable , but I added bean and sweet potato , and bell pepper with cheese .
Chicken mole is still the best seller .
How many do you sell ?
I get up early in the morning , and make 100 .
I have a couple helpers .
I clean houses , then take a nap and start selling at 6 p.m. until the bars close .
Do you ever get any free time ?
If I do , I like to go to church .
To thank God. I go to St. Charles or St. Peter's .
I have saints at home , I do a little Santeria .
Do you have a pet ?
Josephine .
She 's a Lab mix / pit bull whatever .
Where do you live ?
In the Mission , honey !
What would you buy if you could ?
Maybe one day I will get enough money to open my own place .
Everybody could come in and I could join them in one place .
I could hug my people and make sure they do n't go to sleep hungry .
And tell them not to break themselves doing drugs .

One of Becky ’s recent posts raised the question of what separates agroecological farming from organic farming .
Although agroecological farming shares some of the same principals as organic farming , agroecology is not associated with a particular type of agriculture .
Conventional and organic farms alike can take an agroecological approach to managing farmland .
What Is Agroecology ?
Agroecology views agriculture from a ecological perspective .
Farmland , after all , is an ecosystem – a complex network in which every living and nonliving component of the system affects every other component , either directly or indirectly .
This ecosystem view of agriculture considers all of the services provided by farmland to humans – soil health , water quality , air quality , pest control , disease control , biodiversity , and so forth – in addition to food production .
Agroecological farming strives to create stable food production systems that are resilient to environmental perturbations such as climate change and disease .
The only way to achieve this goal is to go beyond thinking of farms as linear systems in which inputs ( acreage , fertilizer , pesticides , etc. ) influence output ( food yield ) , and start treating farmland as complex webs of ecological interactions .
Is Organic Food Agroecological ?
Not necessarily .
Most of the organic food you see in the grocery store is from industrial operations that do not think ecologically .
Instead of managing their farmland as ecosystems , large - scale organic farms focus solely on producing as much food as possible .
Sure , big organic farms do n’t use synthetic chemicals , but they do little to manage the ecosystem services provided by farmland .
They rely heavily on fossil fuels , erode soils , pollute water supplies , destroy native wildlife habitat , and so forth .
Intensive agriculture – even intensive organic agriculture – is generally a pretty environmentally destructive practice .
But if you go beyond the grocery store , you can find food from growers that are trying to manage their farmland as ecosystems .
There are plenty of small , alternative farms striving to create sustainable food production systems .
Farms that focus on restoring and maintaining soil health are less dependent on chemical inputs , because plants grown in healthy soil can better access their natural defenses to ward off pests and disease .
Farmers that think ecologically also tend to let their animals do a lot of the work for them .
By allowing animals to perform their natural behaviors , farmers can use livestock to enhance the farmland ecosystem .
For instance , chickens can be moved from field to field to clean up vegetable patches before a new crop is planted .
In addition to clearing out old vegetation , chickens eat insect pests , aerate the soil as they scratch for food , and leave each patch with an ample dose of fertilizer .
Pigs that are allowed to express their inherent piggyness – namely , rooting and wallowing – can be used to till a field or turn manure into compost .
Rotating different species of farm animals across pastures can reduce disease - risk in livestock while keeping pastures rich in nutrients and diverse in forage .
To find produce , dairy , or meat from this type of ecoagricultural farm , your best bet is to start talking to local farmers – visit your farmers market or join a CSA .
Can Conventional Farms Be Agroecological ?
It ’s not just small , alternative farms that are thinking ecologically .
Conventional , industrial farms can practice agroecology as well .
Some use synthetic chemicals only as a last resort , instead relying on biological management strategies – such as beneficial insect predators , crop rotation , and monitoring of fields for pests – to increase yield .
Understanding ecolabels is the best way to determine whether conventional produce is grown agroecologically .
Conventional and organic farms alike can also practice agroecology by setting aside a portion of their farmland for conservation .
Restoring farmland to natural habitat increases the number of native plant and animal species on farms , and can also repair important ecosystem functions .
Restored land can store atmospheric carbon dioxide , control erosion , detoxify soil , purify water , provide habitat for insect predators that keep pests at bay , and much more .
In a way , agroecology represents a different way of farming .
It ’s not necessarily organic , and it ’s not necessarily conventional .
Given how much land use is agricultural and how environmentally destructive agriculture can be , agroecology seems like the best solution to ensure the sustainability of food production and crucial ecosystem services .

The Gillard government and Australia ’s big three miners have made significant progress in talks about a resources tax compromise and are believed to have reached an agreement that would end one of the biggest government - private sector brawls in history .
It 's understood that BHP Billiton , Rio Tinto and Xstrata have agreed with the government now on the key elements of a new resources tax structure , including the creation of a new trigger point for the imposition of the tax , set at the 10 - year Commonwealth bond yield plus 7 per cent .
Shares of all major miners pared their losses on the news , with BHP , Rio and Fortescue Metal Group among those stocks to pick up , helping the overall market to trim its retreat for the day .
With Prime Minister Julia Gillard in far north Queensland today for the funeral of soldier private Ben Chuck killed in Afghanistan , the formal announcement of a deal could be held over .
The proposed new trigger point for the ' ' super profits ' ' tax to kick in is currently equal to a rate of about 12 per cent , around about the average cost of capital in the mining industry .
The original tax cut in above the bond yield only , currently just over about 5 per cent .
The government is also believed to have resolved the miners ' concerns that the tax will be retrospective in its application , by agreeing that the miners can inject their existing assets including the huge Pilbara iron ore mines and the rich east coast coal mines into the revised tax regime at market value .
This is a huge concession .
Retrospectivity , the rate at which the tax is imposed and the headline rate — set originally at 40 per cent — were the three key mining sector objections to the proposed new tax .
It was unclear at midday , east coast time , what deal had been struck on the headline rate , but the government is believed to have also given ground on this point , with people with knowledge of the talks saying the two sides were " nearly there " on an agreement .
Background : I have an idea for a podcast that tells the stories of the bravest , most daring , and most innovative men and women the world has known .
I picture this in a similar vein as Dan Carlin 's Hardcore History , i.e .
I want to give tons of context so my audience will understand the world in which these innovators lived .
( One of my goals is to dispel the notion that people in the past were foolish or backwards - minded , and I think context of the times is important . )
I'm aware there are a few resources of " badassery " on the internet , but I 'm not interested in the " Swear word kill shoot kill swear word SWEAR VERB F - BOMB YEAH !!!! " style adopted by most of these sites .
Also , I do n't inherently define a badass as a guy who killed a lot of other guys because of his huge testicles .
I 'm more interested in those who had a radical idea and stuck out their neck / reputation to prove it .
John Stapp is my favorite example and probably my first subject .
To keep it short , Air Force crash standards of his time dictated that the human body could not survive a force greater than 18 Gs .
John thought humans could survive greater , so he built a rocket sled , pushed it to ~600 mph , and brought it to a rapid halt .
To test this on humans , he strapped himself into the rocket sled and rode it a few dozen times .
Each run was at a higher speed , until he sustained a 42G stop , which struck him blind for 10 minutes after the test and made his eyeballs bleed .
Because of his work , the crash test dummy was invented , auto safety was improved , and he even coined Murphy 's Law .
( Other subjects : The Manhattan Project scientists , the space program , the guy who proved ulcers are caused by bacteria , anyone who put their well - being on the line to prove a crazy idea . )
I think the history of science is rife with stories of bravery by forgotten individuals that have long - lasting effects .
This fascinates me , and I want to tell these stories .
Who 's your badass of choice ?
What did they do ?
What are good resources to learn their story ?
What are good resources to learn about the times in which they lived ?
Why are they important ?
Bonus points for the following : - Obscurity - A new angle on a familiar story or individual - Resources that describe the context of the times , as I think that will be my greatest challenge - Resources for effective podcasting ( Easy enough to find on my own , but I 'm willing to collect as much advice as I can . )

Rangers have agreed to sell defender Danny Wilson to Liverpool in a deal worth up to £ 5 million .
Young Rangers defender poised to join Anfield club
Expected
Rangers have agreed to sell defender Danny Wilson to Liverpool in a deal worth up to £ 5 million .
The 18 - year - old , who came through the youth ranks at Ibrox before penning his first professional contract there three years ago , has been a target of the Anfield club for several months .
revealed earlier on Tuesday that Liverpool were in advanced stages of discussions with Rangers , with only the transfer fee left to agree on .
And the Ibrox club has now confirmed that Reds are set to complete the transfer after the youngster was pulled out of the Rangers squad that flew out to Australia for their pre-season tour on Tuesday .
" We have agreed a deal in principle with Liverpool for the transfer of Danny Wilson , " said Rangers chief executive Martin Bain on the club's .
" Liverpool 's offer will see the club receive £ 2 million up front with add - ons linked to games played , taking the total value of the deal to £ 5 million . "
The deal could be completed on Tuesday night , which would allow Wilson to join up with Reds at their training camp in Switzerland .
Rangers had expected Wilson to exit the Scottish club after the defender turned down a new contract offer .
" Danny was entering the final year of his contract with the club and had indicated that he felt it was in his interests to move on , " added Bain , who oversaw the £ 2 million sale of midfielder Kevin Thomson to Middlesbrough last week .
" Given that and the value of the offer from Liverpool , it was deemed appropriate to accept that offer given the player wanted to go .
" We are aware that with Kevin Thomson and Danny leaving the club in the last week that there is a need to add to the first team squad .
" Our efforts remain focused on doing that during this transfer window .
" We have been active in that regard with the resources that we have and we do recognise that we have to add to a squad that is light in numbers . "
( CNN ) --
The fate of the top U.S. military commander in Afghanistan hinges on his meeting Wednesday with President Barack Obama , who was " angry " after reading the general 's remarks about colleagues in a magazine profile to be published Friday .
Gen . Stanley McChrystal will likely resign , a Pentagon source who has ongoing contacts with the general said .
The " magnitude and graveness " of McChrystal 's mistake in conducting the interview for the article were " profound , " White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said McChrystal had " made a significant mistake and exercised poor judgment . "
McChrystal apologized Tuesday for the profile , in which he and his staff appear to mock top civilian officials , including the vice president .
Two defense officials said the general fired a press aide over the article , set to appear in Friday 's edition of Rolling Stone .
" I extend my sincerest apology for this profile .
It was a mistake reflecting poor judgment and should never have happened , " McChrystal said in a Pentagon statement .
" Throughout my career , I have lived by the principles of personal honor and professional integrity .
What is reflected in this article falls far short of that standard .
McChrystal has been recalled to Washington to explain his actions to the president .
He is expected to meet with Obama in the Oval Office on Wednesday , Gibbs said .
Gibbs refused to speculate about McChrystal 's fate , but told reporters " all options are on the table . "
Obama , questioned about McChrystal before a Cabinet meeting Tuesday afternoon , said he had not made a decision .
" I think it 's clear that the article in which he and his team appeared showed poor judgment , but I also want to make sure that I talk to him directly before I make that final decision , " he said .
McChrystal is prepared to resign if the president has lost confidence in him , a national security official told CNN .
Most of the Pentagon brass , the ofrficial said , hopes he will be upbraided by the commander - in - chief but sent back to continue the mission .
The White House will have more to say after Wednesday 's meeting , Gibbs said .
He noted , however , that McChrystal did not take part in a teleconference Obama had with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and other top officials on Tuesday .
Several elected officials have strongly criticized McChrystal but deferred to the president on the politically sensitive question of whether the general should keep his position .
A couple of key congressmen , however , have openly called for McChrystal 's removal .
In the profile , writer Michael Hastings writes that McChrystal and his staff had imagined ways of dismissing Vice President Joe Biden with a one - liner as they prepared for a question - and - answer session in Paris , France , in April .
The general had grown tired of questions about Biden since earlier dismissing a counterterrorism strategy the vice president had offered .
" ' Are you asking about Vice President Biden , ' McChrystal says with a laugh .
' Who 's that ? ' "
" ' Biden ? ' suggests a top adviser .
' Did you say : Bite Me ? ' "
McChrystal does not directly criticize Obama in the article , but Hastings writes that the general and Obama " failed to connect " from the outset .
Sources familiar with the meeting said McChrystal thought Obama looked " uncomfortable and intimidated " by the room full of top military officials , according to the article .
Later , McChrystal 's first one - on - one meeting with Obama " was a 10 - minute photo op , " Hastings writes , quoting an adviser to McChrystal .
" Obama clearly did n't know anything about him , who he was .
Here 's the guy who 's going to run his f--- ing war , but he did n't seem very engaged .
The Boss ( McChrystal ) was disappointed . "
The article goes on to paint McChrystal as a man who " has managed to piss off almost everyone with a stake in the conflict , " including U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry , special representative to Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke and national security adviser Jim Jones .
Obama is not named as one of McChrystal 's " team of rivals . "
Of Eikenberry , who railed against McChrystal 's strategy in Afghanistan in a cable leaked to The New York Times in January , the general is quoted as saying , " ' Here 's one that covers his flank for the history books .
Now if we fail , they can say , " I told you so . ' "
Hastings writes in the profile that McChrystal has a " special skepticism " for Holbrooke , the official in charge of reintegrating Taliban members into Afghan society and the administration 's point man for Afghanistan and Pakistan .
" At one point on his trip to Paris , McChrystal checks his BlackBerry , according to the article .
' Oh , not another e-mail from Holbrooke , ' he groans .
' I do n't even want to open it . '
He clicks on the message and reads the salutation out loud , then stuffs the BlackBerry back in his pocket , not bothering to conceal his annoyance .
" ' Make sure you do n't get any of that on your leg , ' an aide jokes , referring to the e-mail . "
Both Democrats and Republicans have been strongly critical of McChrystal in the wake of the story .
House Appropriations Committee chairman David Obey , D - Wisconsin , called McChrystal the latest in a " long list of reckless , renegade generals who have n't seemed to understand that their role is to implement policy , not design it . "
McChrystal is " contemptuous " of civilian authority and has demonstrated " a bull - headed refusal to take other people 's judgments into consideration . "
Sen . Byron Dorgan , D - North Dakota , became the first member of the Senate Democratic leadership to call for McChrystal to step down , telling CNN that the remarks were " unbelievably inappropriate and just can't be allowed to stand . "
Senate Armed Services Committee chairman Carl Levin , D - Michigan , deferred to Obama on the question of a possible McChrystal resignation .
He said the controversy was sending a message of " confusion " to troops in the field .
I think it has " a negative effect " on the war effort , he said .
Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman John Kerry , D - Massachusetts , urged a cooling off period before a final decision is rendered on the general .
My " impression is that all of us would be best served by just backing off and staying cool and calm and not sort of succumbing to the normal Washington twitter about this for the next 24 hours . "
Sens . John McCain of Arizona , Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Jim Webb of Virginia -- also key senators on defense and foreign policy issues -- were each strongly critical of McChrystal 's remarks , but noted that the general 's future is a decision for Obama to make .
Karzai weighed in from abroad , urging Obama to keep McChrystal as the U.S. commander in Afghanistan .
The government in Kabul believes McChrystal is a man of strong integrity who has a strong understanding of the Afghan people and their culture , Karzai spokesman Waheed Omar said .
A U.S. military official said Tuesday that McChrystal has spoken to Biden , Defense Secretary Robert Gates , Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Adm .
Mike Mullen and other officials referenced in the story , including Holbrooke , Eikenberry and Jones .
An official at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul said Eikenberry and McChrystal " are both fully committed " to Obama 's Afghan strategy and are working together to implement the plan .
" We have seen the article and General McChrystal has already spoken to it , " according to a statement from an embassy official , making reference to McChrystal 's apology .
" I have enormous respect and admiration for President Obama and his national security team , and for the civilian leaders and troops fighting this war and I remain committed to ensuring its successful outcome , " McChrystal said in the closing to his apology .
Rolling Stone executive editor Eric Bates , however , struck a less optimistic tone during an interview with CNN on Tuesday .
The comments made by McChrystal and other top military aides during the interview were " not off - the - cuff remarks , " he said .
They " knew what they were doing when they granted the access . "
The story shows " a deep division " and " war within the administration " over strategy in Afghanistan , he contended .
McChrystal and his staff " became aware " that the Rolling Stone article would be controversial before it was published , Hastings told CNN Tuesday .
He said he " got word from ( McChrystal 's ) staff ... that there was some concern " about possible fallout from the story .
Obama tapped McChrystal to head the U.S. military effort in Afghanistan in the spring of 2009 shortly after dismissing Gen. David McKiernan .

CHONGQING , China —
On a sweltering morning last month , a white - haired guide trudged up a muddy path , leading a group of scholars toward a bamboo grove on the outskirts of this western Chinese city .
The site , he said , was where a large portion of China ’s imperial treasures were once hidden inside several big wooden sheds .
“ They were stored right about here , ” Hu Changjian , a local museum official , said of the artifacts , an unparalleled collection of more than a million objects from the Forbidden City in Beijing , including fine paintings , calligraphy , jade and porcelain dating back centuries .
He added , “ We think they dug caves in the hills behind us to store some of the treasures . ”
Photographers and documentary filmmakers traveling with the group of scholars recorded the scene , as the scholars , clutching notepads , scampered up a hill in search of caves .
The scholars , from mainland China and Taiwan , were taking part in an extraordinary two - week research project , retracing the routes taken by the imperial treasures in the 1930s and 1940s , when they were being safeguarded from the ravages of civil war and Japanese aggression , not to mention floods , bandits and warlords .
Soaked Stormtroopers : Agents Cassels , Murphy , and Ruben
This mission took place on an incredibly rainy day .
Fortunately we were going to be underground for most of it , but our intrepid Stormtroopers got a little bit wet on the way to the mission .
The Stormtroopers were played by some of our friends at College Humor .
They had bought the costumes for a couple of great videos they produced , and were nice enough to loan them ( along with the Vader costume ) to us for the mission .
The Vader costume was really awesome .
It had like ten different components and included a remote control voice box that made the breathing sound effect .
It was a bit of a puzzle getting Agent Scordelis dressed , but we finally figured it out .
We used our beloved 6 - train stop at Brooklyn Bridge for the start of the mission .
We staggered our agents , sending Darth and the Stormtroopers ahead on one train to meet up with Leia later in a second train .
We planned to stage the mission several times over the course of a couple of hours .
If you ’ve got all those awesome costumes together , you better do it more than once !

Stormtroopers and Vader riding the staging car to their assigned stops
The mission started when Leia entered her train .
She had two full stops by herself before the other actors entered .
I created a book for Leia to read using a template I found online .
I printed out the fake cover and attached it to one of my favorite prank books , which just so happened to be the right size and color .
Agent Lindquist got a few funny looks from the passengers around her .
She was unmistakably Princess Leia with her hair buns and white robe .
Yet seeing one person in a costume on the subway is n’t all that strange .
Maybe she ’s going to a party ?
Unless you took the time to notice the book she was reading , you might not think too much of it .
The Stormtroopers got a nice reaction when they entered .
The car was n’t very crowded the first time we did it , but those who were there were laughing , particularly when the Stormtroopers grabbed Leia .
At the next stop , Vader ’s entrance got a great reaction .
Agent Scordelis entered the car with force and authority , but unfortunately did n’t account for the height of his helmet .
He knocked his head on the door when he entered !
It was hysterical , and we should have video of it in an upcoming “ outtakes ” video .
The people on the train went crazy for Vader .
I think they thought the joke was over once the Stormtroopers got on , but Vader just topped it so well .
One thing we learned is that almost every human will immediately take out their camera when they see Darth Vader .
We ’ve done lots of crazy missions on the subway over the years , but I have never seen so many people taking photographs of our performance .
How can you not take a photo of Darth Vader ?
It ’s impossible to resist !

After the agents exited , we reset to stage the mission again .
We were now closer to midtown , so we knew we ’d have a larger audience for the next run .
Leia about to enter her train for the 2nd run
This guy was completely perplexed ( as seen in the video )
Stormtroopers wait for the passengers to exit the train before entering .
Proper protocol !
My job during the mission was to act as Vader ’s handler , making sure Agent Scordelis was where he needed to be .
He did n’t have great visibility out of his mask , so someone needed to be there in case he needed help .
It felt like the two of us were on our own mini-mission .
It was hilarious to see Darth Vader standing all by himself at the end of a subway platform , patiently waiting on the train .
Vader got all kinds of funny looks from people as they passed by or gawked at him from across the tracks .
At one point , a young guy came up to him and said , “ Sith Lord , would it be OK if I took your photo ? ”
Vader ’s entrance the second time went much more smoothly ( he remembered to duck ! ) and the crowd roared when he appeared .

We staged the mission around four times in total , heading uptown as far as 125th Street , and then back down to Union Square .
It was fun watching the reactions of the passengers , young and old .
We encountered a few kids throughout the day , and not surprisingly they seemed to be the most excited by the mission .
Some seemed flat out amazed .

Stormtrooper Graveyard
We finally made it down to Union Square and the actors got out of their costumes , helmets littering the station floor .
It was a really fun afternoon .
It ’s always satisfying to see a subway car full of strangers come to life when something hilarious unexpectedly happens .
Folks were laughing and chatting with other passengers while they snapped away on their camera phones .
A good time was had by all .
Mission Accomplished .

Recently the movie Up in the Air won two Buzz Awards – for Movie / Film and People ’s Choice award .
The Buzz Awards go to the best in brand / media integration campaigns , brilliant product placement and innovative use of a medium for a promotion .
The Movie / Film award goes to the most memorable - yet natural - cameo by a brand in a motion picture , while the People ’s Choice award does n’t really need any explanation .
Did Up in the Air really deserve those two awards ?
The movie is about a corporate downsizer Ryan Bingham ( George Clooney ) and his travels from company to company .
The film follows his isolated life and the people he meets along the way .
There are three major brands involved in the movie ( you can see more examples here ) :
American Airlines
Hilton
Travelpro
Widespread reports from the web suggest that American Airlines and Hilton placements were not paid placements .
Even more , according to an article in Advertising Age , both companies are “ integrated - marketing partners ” for the film ( that also includes running sweepstakes related to the film on their websites ) .
Those partnerships were somehow different from traditional product placement – instead of paying for the placement in the movie , both companies allowed the crew to shoot the movie in Hilton hotels and American Airlines terminals and airplanes .
With these partnerships producers saved a lot of money ( the production budget for the movie was $ 25 million ) .
Well , the financial part of this deal makes sense .
What about the product placement itself ?
The movie script is made in such a way that it ’s absolutely necessary that Clooney flies a lot and spends the nights in hotels .
In this context Hilton and American were a natural fit ( the Walter Kirn book that the movie script is based on , had Clooney ’s character flying on a fictional Great West Airlines ) .
Because Clooney ’s character is a frequent flyer , it ’s obvious that he ’s loyal to one brand ( one airline ) and collecting miles is also something that you could expect from such person .
For this kind of flyers being loyal to a hotel chain is probably also very likely .
So , both brands fitted nicely and were easily integrated in the movie .
Well done .
The third major product placement was done by Travelpro , an American luggage manufacturer .
This is also a case of well executed placement .
Director Jason Reitman requested and received 70 pieces of Travelpro luggage .
The brand was seen in approximately 10 scenes and one scene was shot in a fictitious Travelpro store .
“ We were the sole luggage provider in the whole movie , ” said Rob Rankin , Travelpro CEO .
“ If someone ’s carrying a bag , the bag is ours . ”
Well , one bag was not theirs , but it was swapped for Travelpro’s .
Do you remember in which scene ?

It 's time to go back to CONMEBOL .
It 's time to go back to South America .
" Like here in Africa , football will join people together .
Like you said , Mr. president ( ' Lula ' ) , football is not just kicking the ball around .

I have to say to Mr. Ricardo Teixeira that on January 1st , 2011 , I wo n't be the Brazilian president , but I will be a Brazilian , and I 'm available to help in any way I can . " [ UEFA President Michel ]
Platini , you dared to take Brazil out of a World Cup [ 1986 ] .
But I admire you , especially for the extraordinary player that you were .
[ Franz ]
Beckenbauer , who was possibly one of the players that I most admired because of his seriousness and discipline .
I consider you , after me and Pele , the best player I saw on the pitch .

We are learning from them so that the World Cup of 2014 is a bigger success .
" Brazilians like challenges .
Be certain that we are going to make a World Cup as emotional and beautiful as the World Cup in South Africa .
We are working hard for our growing economy to reflect in a beautiful tournament .
" The Brazil head of State also stressed on making the 2014 World Cup an environment - friendly competition .
" We will make a green World Cup , green as our forests .
Environmental sustainability will be a trademark of Brazil and the next World Cup .
We want to leave a legacy to improve the quality of life of our people .
We are sure that we will charm the world , like South Africa charmed us this year .
" We are passionate for sport .
And we are passionate for life .
But we always think that life can get better .
When the final whistle blows here in Johannesburg , the ball will go to Brazil and will be received with the same love and ability we show inside the pitches . "
Wife questions Japan PM Naoto Kan 's ability to govern By Roland Buerk
BBC News , Tokyo Published duration 22 July 2010
image caption Naoto and Nobuko Kan have been married for 40 years
The wife of Japan 's prime minister has written a book publicly questioning her husband 's ability to lead the country .
Called " What on earth will change in Japan now you are prime minister ? " , it was published this week .
Naoto Kan became leader of the world 's second biggest economy last month , following the resignation of Yukio Hatoyama .
He has been married to his wife , Nobuko , for 40 years .
Poll drubbing
Many wives of successful men may privately wonder how their husbands made it to the top , but few are as public about it as Japan 's first lady .
In a book about her husband , Noboko Kan writes : " I wonder : ' Is it okay that this man is prime minister ? ' - because I know him well . "
In a long list of his failings she criticises his delivery of his first policy speech in parliament , as well as his fashion sense and inability to cook .
It was written before upper house elections earlier this month at which the voters appeared to agree with Mrs Kan 's assessment , handing her husband 's party a drubbing .
The decision to publish the book is eccentric even by the standards of the wives of Japanese prime ministers .
The last one , Miyuki Hatoyama , said she had been to the planet Venus , and had met Tom Cruise in a previous life when he was Japanese .
But the Kans are as famous for her willingness to spar with him in public as for their enduring marriage .
Trey Grayson , Blanche Lincoln and Arlen Specter are battling in closely watched races .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO Sestak , Paul score wins as Lincoln faces runoff
Upstart Senate candidates claimed two stunning victories in primary elections Tuesday night as Pennsylvania Rep. Joe Sestak denied incumbent Democrat Arlen Specter renomination to a sixth term and Kentucky insurgent Rand Paul easily bested establishment favorite Trey Grayson for the Republican Party 's Senate nod .
In the evening 's third key Senate race , Arkansas Sen .
Blanche Lincoln clung to a slim lead of a few thousand votes over Lt. Gov. Bill Halter with nearly 85 percent of the vote counted in the state 's Democratic primary , but will face an expensive and potentially dangerous June 8 runoff since neither candidate will reach 50 percent of the vote .

Insurgents did n't completely rule the night , however .
Democrat Mark Critz , a former Hill aide , defeated Republican Tim Burns in the special election for the Pennsylvania congressional seat of the late Rep. John Murtha .
Both parties invested millions in the race — viewed as a bellwether election for the fall campaign .
The AP called Pennsylvania 's Senate primary for Sestak just before 10:15 p.m. , as Sestak led Specter , 53 percent to 47 percent , with 65 percent of precincts reporting .
The second - term congressman and former admiral will face off against former GOP Rep .
Pat Toomey in the general election .
Addressing supporters shortly after the race was called in Sestak 's favor , Specter endorsed his victorious opponent : " I will support him in the election . "
With nearly all precincts reporting in Kentucky , Paul was drawing 59 percent of the vote to Grayson 's 35 percent — a yawning lead over a candidate once viewed as a sure bet for his party 's nomination and openly backed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell .
In his victory speech , Paul applauded the tea party movement and issued a stern warning to the political establishment : " I have a message , a message from the tea party , a message that is loud and clear and does not mince words :
We 've come to take our government back . "
" The tea party movement is about saving the country from a mountain of debt that is devouring our country and that I think could lead to chaos , " Paul said grimly , laying in to President Barack Obama for his participation in last year 's Copenhagen summit on global warming and accusing Obama of trying to " apologize for the industrial revolution . "
Reactions to Paul ’s nomination split sharply from the left and right .
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , who endorsed Paul in the primary , called the election a “ wake - up call ” in an interview with the Associated Press , describing the campaign as “ an opportunity to not embrace the status quo but to shake things up . ”
Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine painted the Kentucky race as a victory for “ the far - right Republican segment of the electorate , ” calling Paul a nominee “ whose ideas are outside of the political mainstream . ”
On the Democratic side in Kentucky , state Attorney General Jack Conway narrowly defeated Lt. Gov. Daniel Mongiardo , leading 44 percent to 43 percent , with 98 percent of precincts reporting , and giving national Democrats their preferred candidate for the fall campaign .
Though the White House and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee strongly backed Specter in the Pennsylvania primary fight , the DSCC quickly released a statement responding warmly to Sestak 's victory .
" Joe Sestak has a compelling life story and a powerful message of change .
He knows what is wrong with Washington and , if elected to the Senate , will shake up how business is done in the Capitol , " DSCC Chairman Robert Menendez ( D - N.J. ) said .
In state elections , Pennsylvania Attorney General Tom Corbett was nominated as the GOP 's candidate for governor .
The AP called the Democratic gubernatorial primary for Allegheny County Executive Dan Onorato before 10 p.m .
In Arkansas , Lincoln and Halter spent the last day of the campaign tamping down expectations .
“ We certainly hope to win today outright , but I do think it ’s fair to point out that when you ’ve been in a race one week and you ’re taking on an 11 - year incumbent , who has been a member of Congress for four years before that , by anybody ’s reckoning , a runoff would be a victory for us , ” Halter told reporters .
Lincoln said she ’d be “ ecstatic one way or the other , whether we win right out or whether we go to a runoff . ”
On the Republican side , Rep. John Boozman , the popular congressman from Northwest Arkansas , was able to avoid a runoff , easily disposing of Lincoln 's 2004 opponent , Jim Holt , as well as state senator Gilbert Baker in a crowded eight - candidate field .
Even as voting got under way Tuesday morning , a pair of breaking political scandals added new fireworks to the already theatrical day .
The New York Times reported Monday night that Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal , running for the Senate as a Democrat , had repeatedly misrepresented his activities during the Vietnam War .
Under fire for suggesting he had served overseas when he had not , Blumenthal called an emergency press conference at a VFW hall Tuesday afternoon to push back against the story .
At the hastily assembled afternoon event , where he was surrounded by veterans , Blumenthal struck a defiant note , declaring : " On a few occasions I have misspoken about my service and I regret that , and I take full responsibility .
But I will not allow anyone to take a few misplaced words and impugn my record of service to our country . "
Blumenthal called his disputed remarks " absolutely unintentional , a few misplaced words — ' in , ' instead of ' during , ' totally unintentional . "
New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez , chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , signaled his party would stand by Blumenthal as its candidate as Connecticut Democrats assemble this weekend for a nominating convention .
“ I ’m sure those veterans who will be standing up for him today will make the case for him , that he will continue to stay in the Senate race and that we will continue to support him , ” Menendez said .
Meanwhile , a once - predictable House contest was upended by the resignation of Indiana Republican Rep. Mark Souder , who admitted to an extramarital affair with an aide in an emotional statement .
“ I have sinned against God , my wife and my family .
... I am so shamed to have hurt those I love , ” Souder said .
“ My family were more than willing to stand here with me .
We are a committed family .
But the error is mine , and I should bear the responsibility . ”
It was not immediately clear who would replace Souder on the ballot in his Republican - heavy district .
Souder won renomination earlier this month with less than 50 percent of the vote , against a split field of GOP challengers .
The Democratic nominee is physician Tom Hayhurst .
Small Mojave Desert Town Goes 85 % Solar
June 10th , 2010 by Susan Kraemer
Nipton , a tiny Californian town in the blaring sun of the Mojave just went solar , and is likely to soon become a tourist attraction as “ the most solar town in America . ”
The townsfolk , all thirty eight of them , just installed their own citywide supply of clean abundant solar power .
[ social_buttons ]
But the 38 souls in Nipton did n’t pick just any clean abundant solar power .
Nipton selected Silicon Valley start - up Skyline Solar to provide their town ’s electricity with an innovative high gain solar ( HGS ) that marries CSP , PV and trough - based solar thermal .
Three year old Skyline has already snagged a $ 3 million developmental contract with the U.S. Department of Energy , and found $ 24 million in its first round of interested investors .
It was among the first beneficiaries of the accelerated patent approvals by the Obama administration Department of Energy earlier this month , under the Greentech Pilot Program .
Nipton ’s brand new solar installation has been engineered to produce 85 % of Nipton ’s electricity needs now , and if the town grows larger , with all that tourism it can now expect , it will be easy to add more .
Installers will be able to build power plants more quickly using Skyline ’s pre-engineered systems because the upgradeable , pre-engineered solar energy systems are modular and scalable .
This makes them faster to install , and once installed , the reflective troughs , and the tracking system , and a central passive cooling system all help the solar generate ten times the energy per unit of silicon , which also means wasting less material .
Skyline squeezes every last electron out of their systems with a combination of efficiency measures .
How it works
Focus
Their HGS arrays comprise conventional monocrystalline - silicon panels , but these are mounted on the edge of a W - shaped configuration called a reflective rack .
The two troughs that make up the rack counterbalance each other , capturing and focusing sunlight – reflecting it into the panels .
Cooling , passive
The panels are positioned so heat can escape easily , and the system is passively cooled by the air flowing through it .
That leads to a higher conversion efficiency for the system , because when solar panels get too hot , their efficiencies drop .
Economical tracking
Because the system is made of reflective aluminum , rather than steel and mirrors , its light weight means it can be cost effectively mounted on a tracker , which follows the sun and exposes the panels to more sunlight throughout the day .
Pay as you go
Because the systems are small and modular , they can be combined to scale up to various - sized projects .
The company ’s first demonstration project in San Jose was made up of twenty four 18 - by - 6 - foot systems .
A 1 - MW system would take 500 to 600 of these units .

PHOENIX — As the academic year winds down , Creighton School Principal Rosemary Agneessens faces a wrenching decision : what to do with veteran teachers whom the state education department says do n't speak English well enough .
The Arizona Department of Education recently began telling school districts that teachers whose spoken English it deems to be heavily accented or ungrammatical must be removed from classes for students still learning English .

Native protesters have occupied disputed land in Caledonia since early 2006 , but do n’t call it a “ standoff , ” says the incoming commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police .
Chris Lewis — named Wednesday by Premier Dalton McGuinty to succeed Julian Fantino , who retires as head of the OPP on August 1 — has been in charge of the Caledonia operation for more than three years .
“ The term ‘ standoff , ’ right off the bat , really strikes with me because it really is not a standoff at this point , ” Lewis told reporters at Queen ’s Park .
“ It ’s a very peaceful community .
People on the disputed land , as we speak , we ’re not having any problems there , ” he said .
“ So I really have inherited nothing but continuing to do my job at a different level than I ’ve been doing for the last few years . ”
Lewis , 53 , who was appointed a deputy in 2007 by Fantino , began his policing career in 1978 in the remote Kapuskasing detachment and is well - regarded by his fellow officers .
He oversaw the creation of the OPP ’s aboriginal policing bureau and has studied aboriginal government and law , which may have been helpful in dealing with Caledonia , which has dogged the government since Feb. 28 , 2006 .
At issue is the occupation of Douglas Creek Estates , a former housing development site in Caledonia , south of Hamilton , which natives say was stolen from them by the Crown more than 200 years ago .
“ I ’ve been the lead on that file since I became deputy in January 2007 , so really nothing will change , ” said Lewis .
“ Those are difficult situations that we ’re faced with .
We ’ll continue to take our tempered and measured approach in how we deal with it and we ’ll do our best to keep the peace there so nothing will change from our perspective . ”
Haldimand County Mayor Marie Trainer said while “ things are calm at this hour ” in Caledonia , problems can flare up quickly .
“ We are always on standby and the neighbours there have very poor nerves , ” Trainer said in an interview Wednesday .
“ Nothing is happening at the moment but they still occupy the site , there ’s still the burnt - out trailer there , and they wo n’t let us on site to clean up the terrible mess , ” she said of the disputed land the province bought for $ 15.8 million .
Fantino , a former chief of the forces in Toronto , York Region , and London , presided over the provincial police for almost four years and inherited the complicated Caledonia debacle from his predecessor .
While popular with the rank - and - file — he often ticketed speeders while driving from his Woodbridge home to OPP headquarters in Orillia — Fantino ’s efforts to defuse tensions in Caledonia sometimes landed him in hot water .
The current commissioner was also criticized for his dealings with the Special Investigations Unit , which probes fatal police incidents ,
Police and government sources say Lewis — who bested fellow OPP deputy Larry Beechey and Toronto Police deputy chief Tony Warr for the top job — will likely maintain a lower profile .
Appearing at his side at Queen ’s Park on Wednesday , a beaming McGuinty hailed Lewis for “ a lifetime of outstanding service that has culminated in becoming our newest OPP commissioner . ”
The premier , however , was careful to also praise Fantino for “ all he has done to uphold the law and keep Ontario ’s families safe . ”
Lewis , the 13th OPP commissioner in the service ’s 101 - year history , will run a force with 5,900 uniformed officers , 1,800 civilian employees and 850 auxiliary members .
Progressive Conservative MPP Garfield Dunlop ( Simcoe North ) praised the appointment .

“ We are fortunate that such a dedicated individual , admired by the public and his fellow officers , has been appointed to lead the OPP .
I have the utmost confidence in his ability to lead the OPP forward , ” said Dunlop .
NDP MPP Cheri DiNovo ( Parkdale - High Park ) said the problems at Caledonia are due to “ provincial and federal bungling of the First Nations file , ” not anything Lewis has done or will do in policing .
“ This … is not the commissioner ’s job .
This is the government ’s job , ” said DiNovo , criticizing both McGuinty and Prime Minister Stephen Harper for the problem .

Artists and interior designers have long believed that color can dramatically affect moods , feelings , and emotions .
" Colors , like features , follow the changes of the emotions , " the artist Pablo Picasso once remarked .
Color is a powerful communication tool and can be used to signal action , influence mood , and even influence physiological reactions .
Certain colors have been associated with increased blood pressure , increased metabolism , and eyestrain .
So how exactly does color work ?
How is color believed to impact mood and behavior ?
What Is Color Psychology ?
In 1666 , English scientist Sir Isaac Newton discovered that when pure white light passes through a prism , it separates into all of the visible colors .
Newton also found that each color is made up of a single wavelength and cannot be separated any further into other colors .
Further experiments demonstrated that light could be combined to form other colors .
For example , red light mixed with yellow light creates an orange color .
Some colors , such as green and magenta , cancel each other out when mixed and result in a white light .
If you have ever painted , then you have probably noticed how certain colors can be mixed to create other colors .
" Given the prevalence of color , one would expect color psychology to be a well - developed area , " researchers Andrew Elliot and Markus Maier have noted .
" Surprisingly , little theoretical or empirical work has been conducted to date on color 's influence on psychological functioning , ﻿﻿ and the work that has been done has been driven mostly by practical concerns , not scientific rigor . "
Despite the general lack of research in this area , the concept of color psychology has become a hot topic in marketing , art , design , and other areas .
Much of the evidence in this emerging area is anecdotal at best , but researchers and experts have made a few important discoveries and observations about the psychology of color and the effect it has on moods , feelings , and behaviors .
Your feelings about color are often deeply personal and rooted in your own experience or culture .
For example , while the color white is used in many Western countries to represent purity and innocence , it is seen as a symbol of mourning in many Eastern countries .
The Psychological Effects of Color
Why is color such a powerful force in our lives ?
What effects can it have on our bodies and minds ?
While perceptions of color are somewhat subjective , there are some color effects that have universal meaning .
Colors in the red area of the color spectrum are known as warm colors and include red , orange , and yellow .
These warm colors evoke emotions ranging from feelings of warmth and comfort to feelings of anger and hostility .
Colors on the blue side of the spectrum are known as cool colors and include blue , purple , and green .
These colors are often described as calm , but can also call to mind feelings of sadness or indifference .
How do people respond to different colors ?

Color Psychology as Therapy
Several ancient cultures , including the Egyptians and Chinese , practiced chromotherapy , or the use of colors to heal .
Chromotherapy is sometimes referred to as light therapy or colorology .
Colorology is still used today as a holistic or alternative treatment .﻿﻿

Modern Research on Color Psychology
Most psychologists view color therapy with skepticism and point out that the supposed effects of color are often grossly exaggerated .
Colors also have different meanings in different cultures .
Research has demonstrated in many cases that the mood - altering effects of color may only be temporary .
A blue room may initially cause feelings of calm , but the effect dissipates after a short period of time .
However , existing research has found that color can impact people in a variety of surprising ways :
Warm - colored placebo pills were reported as more effective than cool - colored placebo pills in one study .

Additionally , students were more likely to associate negative qualities with a player wearing a black uniform according to a study that looked at historical data of sports teams and what they were dressed .
﻿ ﻿
Color Can Influence Performance
Studies have also shown that certain colors can have an impact on performance .
No one likes to see a graded test covered in red ink , but one study found that seeing the color red before taking an exam actually hurt test performance .﻿﻿
While the color red is often described as threatening , arousing or exciting , many previous studies on the impact of the color red have been largely inconclusive .
The study found , however , that exposing students to the color red prior to an exam has been shown to have a negative impact on test performance .
In the first of the six experiments described in the study , 71 U.S. colleges students were presented with a participant number colored either red , green or black prior to taking a five - minute test .
The results revealed that students who were presented with the red number before taking the test scored more than 20 % lower than those presented with the green and black numbers .
Color and Consumer Purchases
Color psychology suggests that various shades can have a wide range of effects , from boosting our moods to causing anxiety .
But could the color of the products you purchase ever say something about your personality ?
For example , could the color of the car you buy somehow relate to some underlying personality traits or quirks ?
Your color preferences why buying items might say something about the type of image you may be trying to project .
Color preferences , from the clothes you wear to the car you drive , can sometimes make a statement about how we want other people to perceive us .
Other factors such as age and gender can also influence the color choices we make .
White :
As many of our readers have suggested , the color white can feel fresh and clean .
The color is often used to evoke a sense of youth and modernity .

Gray :
The experts suggest that people who drive gray cars do n't want to stand out and instead prefer something a bit more subtle .
Of course , the color selections we make are often influenced by factors including price , selection , and other practical concerns .
Not only that , but color preferences can also change in time .﻿﻿
A person might prefer brighter , more attention - getting colors when they are younger , but find themselves drawn to more traditional colors as they grow older .
The personality of the buyer can play an important role in color selection , but buyers are often heavily influenced by factors such as price as well as availability .
For example , purchasing a white vehicle might be less about wanting people to think that you are young and modern and more about the climate you live in ; people who live in hot climates typically prefer light - colored vehicles over dark ones .
Additional Research Is Still Needed
Interest in the subject of color psychology is growing , but there remain a number of unanswered questions .
How do color associations develop ?
How powerful is the influence of these associations on real - world behavior ?
Can color be used to increase worker productivity or workplace safety ?
What colors have an impact on consumer behavior ?
Do certain personality types prefer certain colors ?
As researchers continue to explore such questions , we may soon learn more about the impact that color has on human psychology .
Zena O'Connor , a faculty member in the Department of Architecture , Design , and Planning at the University of Sydney , suggests that people should be wary of many of the claims they see about the psychology of color .
" Many of these claims lack substantiation in terms of empirical support , exhibit fundamental flaws ( such as causal oversimplification and subjective validation ) , and may include factoids presented as facts , " O'Connor explains .
" In addition , such claims often refer to outdated research without referring to current research findings . "
A Word From Verywell
Color can play an important role in conveying information , creating certain moods , and even influencing the decisions people make .
Color preferences also exert an influence on the objects people choose to purchase , the clothes they wear , and the way they adorn their environments .
People often select objects in colors that evoke certain moods or feelings , such as selecting a car color that seems sporty , futuristic , sleek , or trustworthy .
Room colors can also be used to evoke specific moods , such as painting a bedroom a soft green to create a peaceful mood .
So what 's the bottom line ?
Experts have found that while color can have an influence on how we feel and act , these effects are subject to personal , cultural , and situational factors .
More scientific research is needed to gain a better understanding of color psychology .
As we wrote yesterday , SkyTruth may have discovered a small but persistent leak or oily discharge from Platform # 23051 in the Gulf of Mexico , unrelated to the ongoing BP / Deepwater Horizon oil spill .
We see a small slick apparently emanating from the platform location on multiple satellite images taken since April 25 , including yesterday ’s Envisat ASAR radar image .
According to MMS data , the platform is located at 28.938022 degrees North latitude , 88.970963 degrees
West longitude .
That ’s about 12 miles east - southeast of the tip of the South Pass outlet channel of the Mississippi River .
If anyone happens to be in the vicinity of this platform it would be great to get some observations , photos and / or video to document this possible leak or discharge .

Joldosh Osmanov works for an international organisation in Bishkek .
He is following the situation in Osh through friends who live there .
What I 've heard from friends in Osh is that the conflict began with a fight between young Uzbeks and Kyrgyz , which spiralled to the point that the two ethnic groups started looting each other 's stores and cafes .
It 's said that both sides had guns and that 's why so many people ended up dying and getting injured .
My friends there are staying at home since it is unsafe to go outside .
They told me that because of the size of the city , the police and army are still struggling to take control of the situation in some areas .
Uzbeks in the city live in neighbourhoods called ‘ mahalya ' .
So to stop the Kyrgyz from reaching them , the authorities have surrounded the areas with heavy military vehicles and soldiers .
The situation in Osh is a little different from what happened here in Bishkek .
It 's not a political protest as it was in Bishkek .
When that was happening people could go out and move around .
But is Osh they 're afraid to leave the house .
It 's an interethnic conflict , meaning that you can be harmed just because you are Kyrgyz or Uzbek .
There are all sorts of rumours going round .
People there are saying that Uzbek youths took Kyrgyz women hostage .
Another rumour is that Uzbek people who work in the Osh police department have given weapons to Uzbek people .
But these could be rumours spread by Kyrgyz in order for them to legitimise their actions .
In any case the authorities will not mention them .
They do n't want to see the violence escalate .
They 've already imposed a curfew until 20 June . "

Past environmental disasters have prompted major U.S. laws , but the worst oil spill in U.S. history has yet to break the Senate logjam over the pending energy - climate bill .
Why the difference ?
" People 's outrage is focused on BP , " Anthony Leiserowitz , a researcher at Yale University who tracks public opinion on climate change , tells The Washington Post in story today .
The spill " has n't been automatically connected to some sense that there 's something more fundamental wrong with our relationship with the natural world . "
Environmentalists want the public to see the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , begun April 20 and still spewing , as reason to lessen U.S. dependence on fossil fuel and support a Senate bill by Sens.
John Kerry , D - Mass. , and Joe Lieberman , I - Conn. , to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
They 've held " Hands Across the Sand " events at Gulf beaches to protest offshore drilling , and in Washington , they spelled out " Freedom From Oil " on the National Mall with American flags , reports the Post .
Yet the Senate remains gridlocked in an election year rife with anti-incumbent fervor and Americans , in public opinion polls , still put economic concerns far ahead of environmental ones .
With gas prices down from a year ago , more are driving this summer , reports AAA .
In contrast , a much smaller oil spill in 1968 ( 100,000 barrels ) near Santa Barbara , Calif. , along with a fire on Cleveland 's Cuyahoga River , helped create the first Earth Day in 1970 and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency months later .

Image caption A record number of youngsters now expect university places
Increasing tuition fees to £ 7,000 per year would mean a sharp drop in young people wanting to go to university , says a survey .
The Sutton Trust education charity has published research showing 80 % of 2,700 youngsters asked in England and Wales expect to apply to university .
But it warns a steep rise in fees could mean two - thirds changing their minds .
Trust chairman Sir Peter Lampl says many young people who miss out on places would be " sorely disappointed " .
The research from the Sutton Trust comes against the background of Lord Browne 's review of university funding in England .
This could allow universities to charge tuition fees higher than the current maximum of £ 3,225 per year .
Record applicants
Have Your Say Youngsters now need further education if we are to compete with other nations Lucy Clarke Send us your comments
The Sutton Trust 's study of 2,700 young people aged 11 to 16 , carried out by Ipsos Mori , says that an unprecedented four out of five young people now expect to go to university .
Universities have warned that they are facing a huge demand for places this summer - up 16 % year - on - year - with applications climbing sharply in recent years .
There could be as many as 250,000 more applications than there are places this summer .
The survey from the Sutton Trust suggests the demand for places is going to intensify even more .
But it includes a strong warning that such ambitions could be punctured by much higher tuition fees .
It identifies the crunch point for fees as being £ 7,000 .
If fees rise to £ 5,000 per year , the survey suggests a limited deterrent .
But if fees were to be lifted to £ 7,000 per year , only 45 % would want to apply .
And if fees reached £ 10,000 , the number of young people wanting to apply falls to 26 % .
The survey also found a low level of awareness among teenagers of the financial support that might be available for students .
Trust chairman Sir Peter Lampl said it was important that young people from poorer backgrounds should not miss out because of a pressure on university places and increased fees .
" The findings are also a warning that significantly higher fees may affect university participation .
" If Lord Browne 's review concludes that higher fees are necessary , there is a significant task ahead in ensuring that all young people - and particularly those from non-privileged homes - are equipped with the information they need to make well - informed decisions , " said Sir Peter .
A Department for Business Innovation and Skills spokesman said : " The coalition programme makes it clear that the criteria for any reform include increasing social mobility and attracting a higher proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds . "

The voices in Washington calling for a military strike on Iranian nuclear plants are growing in number and strength .
The cautious attitude of the Barack Obama administration itself in relation to such a course means that direct military action by the United States itself remains on balance unlikely ( see Joe Klein , " An Attack on Iran : Back on the Table " , Time , 15 July 2010 ) .
But current trends in the middle east suggest that the prospect of Israeli action against Iran in the next few months is coming closer ( see " Israel vs Iran : the risk of war " , 11 June 2010 ) .
These include oft - repeated reports that Iran is rearming Hizbollah in southern Lebanon , and that Syria is supplying Hizbollah with some of its Iranian - made M-600 ballistic - missiles .
The M -600 is a solid - fuel missile with a range stretching over much of Israel - a much more potent weapon than those fired in the Israel - Lebanon war of July - August 2006 ( see Amal Saad - Ghorayeb , “ The Hizbollah project : last war , next war ” , 13 August 2009 )
Israel ’s current concern over a resumption of conflict with Hizbollah , however , is overshadowed by its analysis of the benefits , costs and consequences of an attempt to strike a decisive blow against Iran .
Binyamin Netanyahu , concluding his visit to the United States with an interview on Fox News , described Iran as “ the ultimate terrorist threat ” and said that for Iran to think it can maintain its nuclear ambitions would be a mistake .
Here , the Israeli prime minister expresses by implication two sentiments that are entrenched across much of Israel ’s political opinion .
The first is that Iran ’s nuclear programme is exclusively military , and that it represents an existential threat to Israel .
The country ’s own powerful nuclear arsenal , first developed in the late 1950s , has little or no place in this analysis .
The second is that the United States - notwithstanding the Washington chorus - cannot be relied on to constrain Iranian nuclear ambitions by force ; at some stage Israel will have to go it alone ( see Jim Lobe “ Hawks Sharpen Claws for Iran Strike ” , Asia Times / IPS , 12 July 2010 ) .
This current moment raises three vital questions for anyone concerned with security and stability in the middle east : whether Israel has the military capability to launch an effective strike on Iran , what form military action would take , and what Iran ’s reaction would be .
The Israeli capability
A new report published by the Oxford Research Group ( ORG ) - Military Action Against Iran : Impact and Effects ( 15 July 2010 ) - which seeks to clarify these issues and offer recommendations .
Its starting - point is that Israel in the past few years has transformed its ability to undertake air - strikes across great distances - and certainly as far from its territory as Iran .
It has also worked diligently to build relations with two states bordering Iran - Azerbaijan to the north , and the Kurdish region of Iraq to the west ; both might prove useful in the event of action against Iran .
The extensive and sophisticated equipment Israel now possesses includes : over 120 long - range F - 15I and F - 16 I strike - aircraft , purchased from the United States ; an expanded and upgraded fleet of tanker - aircraft ; a large fleet of drones , some capable of being armed with weapons ; bunker - busting bombs that can be attached to its planes ; medium - range ballistic - missiles , and ( probably ) submarine - launched cruise - missiles .
These capabilities mean that Israel can now undertake military action against Iran to an extent that even in 2006 would have been impossible ( see “ Israel ’s shadow over Iran ” , 14 January 2010 ) .
Moreover , it can do so without overflying Iraq , thus avoiding direct infringement of United States - controlled air - space and the direct implication of Washington in the operation .
The US would know almost at once that an Israeli attack was underway , and the widespread use of its manufactured weapons would be noted across the region ; but an ability to deny close involvement , including to its own and other western publics , would be welcome .
This is even more so since the Israeli action will involve far more than “ a war against real - estate ” : attacks on specific nuclear facilities such as the uranium - enrichment centres at Natanz , the uranium - processing plant near Esfahan , and the new Arak research - reactor .
An Israeli security perspective , for example , is concerned almost as much with Iran ’s development of medium - range solid - fuel missiles as with its nuclear projects ; so missile - research , development and production sites would be key targets .
Moreover , the people who design , develop and build the nuclear and missile programmes - and the facilities that train these specialists - are as significant as the physical infrastructure ; so housing - complexes around nuclear and missile plants , key research - centres , factories , and even university departments training scientists and engineers would also be in the line of fire .
In practice , then , military action will be much more generic than specific ; it will certainly involve raids in and around greater Tehran ; and it will be seen as more an act of war against the country as a whole than a limited dropping of bombs in remote locations .
The Iranian calculation
Many western
Gulf states might , at elite level , privately welcome Israeli action against Iran .
Their substantial Shi ’a minorities , and indeed a majority of Arabs across the region , will take a very different view .
Many , Shi’a and Sunni alike , will be bitterly opposed to what they see as another attack by a powerful western state on a Muslim country and people .
The key variable , however , is the attitude of the Iranian state itself to an Israeli attack .
In domestic terms , the state would have great freedom of manoeuvre : an Israeli raid would have the automatic political impact of galvanising support for the hitherto unpopular Mahmoud Ahmadinejad administration , as citizens rally against a concrete external threat .
Any visible opposition would be marginalised , and the “ green movement ” pressed further onto the defensive .
At the same time , a regime emboldened by becoming the focus of nationalist defiance would not necessarily ( so the Oxford Research Group report argues ) undertake an immediate military ( or paramilitary ) response .
True , it might make an attempt to fire some missiles at Israel , but mainly as a symbolic gesture whose impact would be mainly psychological .
Much more likely would be an early announcement of Tehran ’s formal withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty ( NPT ) ; a cessation of the International Atomic Energy Association ( IAEA ) inspection - regime ( after the obligatory ninety - day notice period ) ; and a swift attempt to develop a nuclear deterrent .
In the shorter term , it is possible too that Iran might initially refrain from vigorous reactions in order to maximise its influence , harvest the moral credit of the assaulted , and devote its energies to the intensive rebuilding of its nuclear and missile capabilities .
This could mean holding fire against American targets in Iraq or Afghanistan , or even taking steps to avoid a Hizbollah - Israel clash until the time were more ripe for Tehran .
But Iran will also be thinking long - term .
It is certain that the regime has anticipated a conflict occurring at some stage , calibrated its many aspects , and prepared plans to cope with the aftermath - including the construction of deeply - buried military facilities that can be quickly operationalised ( see William J. Broad , “ Iran Shielding Its Nuclear Efforts in Maze of Tunnels ” , New York Times , 6 January 2010 ) .
The true impact of military action against Iran begins to become visible here - namely , that once it is launched , the consequences are multiple and uncontrollable .
The global responsibility
Even a major Israeli attack would be inconclusive .
Israel would within months need to start bombing again in order to complete an unfinished job , and at that stage Iran would likely be most ready to consider wider responses .
They include provoking a worldwide oil crisis ; its ability to disrupt oil exports from the Gulf suggests that this would not be difficult .
The economic consequences would be formidable ( see “ Asymmetric war : Iran and the new normal ” , 8 July 2010 ) .
Military Action Against Iran : Impact and Effects concludes that a war to curb Iran ’s nuclear ambitions will “ lead to sustained conflict and regional instability ” , and that it is “ unlikely to prevent the eventual acquisition of nuclear weapons by Iran and might even encourage it . ”
Thus , “ military action against Iran should be ruled out as a means of responding to its possible nuclear ambitions . ”
The crisis sparked by an Israeli assault on Iran could indeed become at least as destructive as have been the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past decade .
The fact that the United States and Israel itself are using an undefined threat of military action to reinforce diplomatic pressure on Tehran actually makes other approaches more difficult .
This predicament has to be faced , and innovative thinking needed soon , if the region and the world are to avoid catastrophe .
This stream of bite - size distractions is just the sort of thing that Nicholas Carr , in his book “ The Shallows , ” maintains is undermining serious and sustained thought .
In another recent book , “ You Are Not a Gadget , ” Jaron Lanier , the technology pioneer and writer , pointedly laments the “ vapid video pranks ” and “ lightweight mashups ” that mark what he argues is the disappointing lack of progress in the Web 2.0 era , part of a devolution into a culture of schlock and juvenilia , where recycling mass - media artifacts trumps true individual originality .
But maybe juvenilia has its purpose .
“ There ’s something excellent about freeing the 10 - year - old boy in all of us , ” says Theresa Senft , a University of East London lecturer , who is writing a book about Internet microcelebrity .
Senft ’s work deals seriously with the politics and power dynamics of online identity and representation — and she loves ROFL without apologies .
“ It ’s the doofus , the kid who dances in the rain and makes 10,000 fart jokes and laughs at every single one , ” she says .
“ It ’s very joyful . ”
People have a hard time , she added , acknowledging the irrational laughter that the body produces even when the mind is n’t sure why .
“ How come we ca n’t think of this stuff as ‘ O.K. , it ’s stupid — but it ’s also beautiful in some way ’ ? ” she asks .
“ It ’s beautiful to be in the middle of 5,000 e-mails and stressing about your taxes and having someone send you an idiotic video — and just laugh . ”
The closing panel discussion at ROFLCon II was “ Mainstreaming the Web , ” and it included Ben Huh , the Lolcat entrepreneur ; Christopher Poole , the 4Chan founder ; and Kenyatta Cheese of Know Your Meme , among others .
The discussion was surprisingly earnest .
( And despite some rumors about trouble­makers from /b/ who were planning to disrupt things , it was almost disappointingly civilized . )
There was musing about whether memes signify a subculture and , if so , whether that could last ; speculation about the nature of the meme consumer that would have fit in easily at a more traditional Web confab ; and audience feedback making the inevitable suggestion that mainstream attention is ruining awesome meme making .
Mostly there was consensus .
Cheese said that Know Your Meme was founded in part because more mainstream sources ( he mentioned Wikipedia ) were n’t documenting Internet memes , despite the fact that ROFL material is “ fast becoming our common language . ”
Earlier , on an afternoon when I was supposed to be calling up media scholars and technology experts to get their take on this fast - growing form of culture , I instead sought a little entertainment online .
I was n’t consciously seeking out the happy distractions of ROFL material , but after the usual flitting around , I paused on a post on HipsterRunoff.com , titled “ Keut Hipster Girl Watches White Guy Beat Up Black Guy on Public Bus . ”
HipsterRunoff frequently comments on Web culture in the texting - speak patois of an idiot - savant “ author ” named Carles .
It can be read as nihilistic , searingly critical or just sort of ROFL .
In any case , this post was about a recent “ youtubable fight ” on a bus in Oakland , in which “ an old white guy wearing a fanny pack ” pummels a younger black man .
“ The fight seems racially motivated , ” Carles deadpanned , adding : “ A cute lil hipster girl watches on , trying to pay attention to her surroundings , but more importantly , she is enjoying the music on her large headphones .
Her purple American Apparel outfit and Converse lowtops clash violently with the racial tensions on the bus . ”
The video itself was as described — and fairly depressing .
But it was clearly getting sucked into the ROFL vortex .
The anonymous users of 4 Chan ’s /b/ forum renamed the older white guy “ Epic Beard Man . ”
They also created a nickname for the indifferent - seeming young woman in the headphones , “ Amber Lamps , ” inspired by the younger black man ’s slurred request for an ambulance .
A slew of image macros incorporated these figures and phrases from the clip into visual jokes using every conceivable ROFL trope , collected on Know Your Meme and Encyclopedia Dramatica .
Many of the jokes turned on racist language , and the 75,000 - plus comments posted to the original YouTube video ( which soon had more than four million views ) were a carnival of coarseness .
The video was linked from BuzzFeed , and the crowd classified it as LOL and OMG .
Somebody made a video of Hitler reacting to the incident .
Somebody else created an animated version and someone started a site , Epicbeardmanfacts.com .
Traditional media sources and “ citizen journalists ” interviewed both men , and videos of those conversations circulated and became part of the iterations online .
The Huffington Post ran an item titled “ Why ‘ Epic Beard Man ’ Is the Fastest Growing Public Fight Meme Ever . ”
Awesome ?
Or appalling ?
Either way , the Epic Beard Man meme seemed like a good example of one last thing worth considering about “ Internet culture . ”
Among the academics I eventually called was Gabriella Coleman , the N.Y.U. professor .
Her research into hacker identities stretches back to the era of 1970s “ phreakers ” who figured out how to manipulate the phone system and continues through the contemporary trolls who rain grief on Web users they find stupid or bothersome or simply easy to pick on .
A mantra in the latter group is that they do it all “ for the lulz , ” meaning for the LOLs , just because they can .
The “ for the lulz ” attitude can be more broadly thought of as a rationale for the idea that everything is worth making fun of , nothing should be taken seriously , not even a guy getting punched in the face until he bleeds .
Coleman has a particular interest in the different and interlocking ethical codes of the groups she studies .
One of the variations she has explored is the “ informational trickster , ” a formulation that relies in part on the writer Lewis Hyde ’s exploration of creative troublemaking figures in the folklore and mythology of multiple cultures in his book , “ Trickster Makes This World . ”
The trickster figures that Hyde writes about break rules , ignore mores and commit prankish acts of mayhem or mischief for selfish reasons .
Sometimes the trickster goes too far and pays a price ; sometimes the trickster reveals the hypocrisy of the game he just cheated .
But invariably , the actions of tricksters bridge two previously divergent worlds , revealing each to the other and changing their relationship permanently .
The more traditional pundits and gurus who talk about the Internet often seem to want to draw strict boundaries between old mass - media culture and the more egalitarian forms taking shape online — and between Internet life and life in the physical world .
But I wonder if the trick that converts a bus fight into hilarious entertainment for millions is n’t revealing such boundaries as false .
Sometimes the pointless - seeming jokes that spring from the Web seem to be calling a bluff and showing a truth :
This is what egalitarian cultural production really looks like , this is what having unbounded spaces really entails , this is what anybody - can - be - famous means , this is how the hunger for “ moar ” gets sated , this is what ’s burbling in the hive mind ’s id .
But the real point is that to pretend otherwise is n’t denying the Internet — it ’s denying reality .
In some cases , then , maybe the payoff of ROFL is n’t just the pleasure of laughter , though that surely happens .
Trickster expression , intentional or otherwise , does n’t propose a solution but jolts you to confront some question that you might prefer to have avoided .
Like what , exactly , am I laughing at ?

CNN 's Senior Editor of Mideast Affairs Octavia
Nasr agreed to leave the company after tweeting that she " respected " Lebanese cleric Sayyed Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah , who is often credited as being an inspiration for the Hezbollah militant movement .
The tweet , " Sad to hear of the passing of Sayyed Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah …
One of Hezbollah ’s giants I respect a lot , " erupted a slew of reactions on Twitter .
Two days after the tweet , Nasr tried to explain her tweets and apologize in a blog post .
Despite being a prolific and savvy Twitter user , Nasr called the incident " a good lesson on why 140 characters should not be used to comment on controversial or sensitive issues , especially those dealing with the Middle East . "
She tried to explain what she meant by " respect , " and convey more fully the context behind her tweet , noting that Fadlallah took a " contrarian and pioneering stand among Shia clerics on woman 's rights . "
However , in an internal memo SVP for CNN International Newsgathering Parisa Khosravi announced Nasr would be leaving the company as a result of her comments , citing that her credibility has been compromised .
The event may be a reminder that sometimes 140 characters is just not enough for expression , and that context is perhaps even important when tailoring your message for a mass audience on the viral web .
Publishing is publishing , no matter the media used to broadcast .
Each one has its strengths and weaknesses , whether it is a TV segment or a burst of 140 characters .
We are , after all , in an age in which we consume media in multiple streams and channels .
But what the incident also brings up is the question of bias and opinion in newsrooms across the country .
Should journalists continue to pursue the elusive goal of impartial objectivity ?
Or should journalists be upfront about their opinions with their audience ?
Where is the balance ?
Complete objectivity has always been a mystical creature as elusive as the Lochness Monster of Big Foot .
Journalists are like any other people with opinions .
But the longstanding pursuit has been to avoid the opinion to get in the way of news - gathering and reporting ; to approach the story with the idea of an impartial observer , something that is perhaps unattainable .
And the web is clearly shifting the standards and expectations of such a standard with blogs adding a clear voice to and perspective to the news .
Of course , this often comes at a cost of getting only one side of the story , but at the same time opinion often adds value to the conversation and holds people accountable , especially in the case of analysis of a complex issue .
Regardless , reporters and journalists should be clear and transparent with their readers , setting a clear expectation about the information they are consuming .
What do you think ?
Should Nasr have been fired ?
And whether the statement was taken out of context or not , should journalists clearly express their opinions and be upfront about their biases ?

SØKNADSPLIKTIG : Større opppussingsprosjekter som du har tenkt til å gjøre selv , kan du nå måtte søke kommunen om godkjennelse for .
Har du tenkt til å selge bolig eller leie den ut , må den nå være energimerket .
Og har du tenkt til å pusse opp badet , må du nå søke om tillatelse .
1. juli trådte flere nye regler i kraft for landets boligeiere , og noen av dem betyr økte utgifter .
Hos Huseiernes Landsforbund er man gjennomgående positive til endringene .
- De nye byggereglene kan nok medføre at noen saker blir mer omstendelige for søkeren , men samtidig får vi et nytt system med uavhengig bygningskontroll , og det har vi kjempet for i mange år , uttaler forbundets administrerende direktør , Peter Batta , til klikk .
no .
Ekstrakostnad for selvbyggere
Fra 1 . juli forsvant meldesystemet fra byggesaksbehandlingen .
Det innebærer at enten kan du bare sette i gang med prosjektet ditt eller så må du søke om godkjennelse .
Og dersom prosjektet er søknadspliktig , påløper det også saksbehandlingsgebyrer i kommunen .
- Hos oss må man minimum betale 1800 kroner for å behandle en søknad , forteller fungerende bygningssjef i Bærum kommune , Åse Eiterstraum , til klikk .
no .
I tillegg må man også søke om såkalt ansvarsrett , men ifølge Eiterstraum tar i hvert fall ikke Bærum kommune ekstra betalt for en slik søknad .
- Slike søknader pleier vi å behandle sammen med tiltakssøknaden .
Våtromsarbeider krever søknad
Med innføringen av de nye reglene har det blitt vanskeligere å gjøre egenarbeider på badet .
Skal du bare legge fliser , er det fortsatt fritt frem .
Omfattende arbeider krever derimot godkjennelse .
- Skal du legge membran eller gjøre rørgjennomføringer må du nå søke kommunen , og i tillegg må du godtgjøre overfor kommunen at du er i stand til å utføre arbeidene selv , forklarer Gustav Pilgram Larsen til klikk .
no .
Han er assisterende direktør i Statens bygningstekniske etat .
Han understreker at i tillegg må man betale en fagperson som kan kontrollere arbeidene .
Men ifølge rørleggerbransjen vil ikke det bli noe problem .
- Vi ser ikke for oss at det vil komme noe rush av privatpersoner som vil ha godkjent våtromsarbeidene sine , fordi dette tidligere har vært arbeider som fagfolk har utført , sier Ole Larmerud til klikk .
no .
Han er teknisk direktør i Norske Rørleggerbedrifters Landsforbund .
Han ser heller ikke noe problem når det gjelder kontroll av arbeidene etter nye forskrifter .
- Rørleggerforetak som blir godkjente , ansvarlige kontrollører vil selvsagt kunne kontrollere arbeider utført av andre og vil se på det som en utvidelse av deres eget arbeidsområde .
Universell utforming
Flere av 1 . juli - reglene vil gjelde kun nye boliger , men i noen tilfeller vil reglene også berøre eksisterende bygg dersom det gjøres omfattende ombygging .
Det gjelder blant annet kravet om universell utforming .
- Dersom man bygger om egen bolig , vil det kunne utløse et krav om universell utforming , forklarer Pilgram Larsen .
I praksis innebærer dette at hus og leiligheter skal utformes slik at alle , uavhengig funksjonsgrad og alder , skal kunne bruke boligen uten spesielle tilpasninger eller hjelpemidler .
Radonsikring
Større ombygginger vil også kunne utløse krav om radonsikring .
- Radonsperre koster noen hundrelapper per kvadratmeter , og det er det virkelig verdt når vi vet at rundt 300 personer dør av lungekreft årlig på grunn av radongass , poengterer Peter Batta .
Energimerking
Skal du selge eller leie ut boligen din , må den nå være energimerket .
- Energiattesten skal følge med prospektet .
Men dersom det ikke finnes en slik attest , skal det opplyses om det i prospektet , forklarer informasjonssjef Roger Nyborg i Eiendomsmeglerforbundet til klikk.no .
One of my most common feature requests is for Instapaper to periodically download articles in the background .
A lot of people forget to launch the app to let it download content before going underground or boarding a plane .
I ’ve already received multiple emails from people who are excited for iOS 4 ’s multitasking because they can’t wait for this to finally stop being an issue , because they think Instapaper will be able to download articles periodically in the background .
It ’s painful to respond , crushing their hopes , to tell them that the iOS multitasking system does n’t allow me to do that .
By naming these features “ multitasking ” , Apple has set customers ’ expectations to include what apps can do in a traditional computer multitasking environment .
It ’s going to mislead people into expecting such behavior from apps , but we ca n’t actually deliver most of it .
Some people will notice that no apps can do these things and properly focus their disappointment on Apple .
But many others will only notice the shortcomings in one particular app that they need to do the “ impossible ” and blame that application , leading to dissatisfaction and negative thoughts about the app .
1
As long as iOS “ multitasking ” can do much less than traditional multitasking — which will probably always be the case — this is going to be an issue .
Proposed solution : A new multitasking type
The addition of one more multitasking service would solve this issue for a lot of application types : a periodic network request .
Here ’s how I would do it :
The application gives the system an NSURLRequest and an ideal refresh interval , such as every 30 minutes , every few hours , or every day .
iOS executes that request , whenever it deems that it should , and saves the response to a local file .
Next time the application launches , iOS hands it an NSData of the most recent response .
Executing the request “ whenever it deems that it should ” is important .
iOS can decide , for instance :
Not to update when the battery is low , connectivity is poor , other requests are running , free memory is low , CPU usage is high , or the user is predicted to exceed their monthly data limit .
Not to update as frequently as the app requests , or to increase the interval over time , or to dynamically adjust the interval based on how often it receives a 304 ( Not Modified ) response .
Not to update at all if the requesting app has not been launched in a long time .
This would allow Instapaper to download updates in the background , and would also greatly benefit RSS readers , Twitter clients , chat programs , weather and news widgets , and a huge number of other applications that currently can’t get much benefit from iOS ’ multitasking .
It will mean that he will be able to avoid , for several months at least , an ongoing trial in which he is accused of banking fraud and the laundering of more than one million euros .
A Scarborough woman who nearly killed her toddler with a cocaine overdose after giving him the drug for 14 months has been sentenced to seven years in prison .
Tamara Broomfield persisted in a pattern of “ gross parental abuse over a prolonged period of time against a vulnerable and defenceless child , ” Ontario Superior Court Justice Tamarin Dunnet said in sentencing her Thursday .
In 2009 , Dunnet convicted the 28 - year - old woman of aggravated assault endangering life for giving her son the almost lethal cocaine dose , assault causing bodily harm for multiple rib fractures he sustained , and failing to provide the necessities of life for neglecting to get medical help for his fractured arm .
“ As a result of his mother ’s actions , her son Malique has sustained permanent and irreversible brain damage causing him to be dependent on others for the rest of his life . ”
Dunnet said there has never been any explanation for why Broomfield , who claimed not to be a cocaine user , gave her boy the drug .
“ One is left to infer that she made conscious decisions to obtain cocaine to give to Malique for her own selfish purposes . ”
When she took her 2 - year - old boy to hospital on Aug. 1 , 2005 , she never mentioned he had ingested cocaine , although that information would have helped doctors in their battle to save his life , the judge said .
Hospital tests showed that cocaine levels in his body , had he been an adult , would place him in the top 5 per cent of users .
Broomfield smiled and chatted with her lawyer Daniel Brown after she was sentenced and before she was led away in handcuffs .
The judge deducted 14 months for pre-trial custody .
Broomfield could be back on the street as early next week , because she is filing an appeal and is seeking to renew her bail , Brown told reporters .
Broomfield is very disappointed with her conviction and sentence , and still insists she is innocent , he said .
“ There were problems with the way this trial was conducted by her previous lawyer and she intends to raise those issues on appeal . ”
Brown said the medical evidence used to prove she gave Malique cocaine over 14 months was “ novel science ” that was never challenged at trial .
Outside court , Steve Fitz - Charles , Malique ’s father , said he hopes the publicity surrounding his son ’s case will help protect others from the same fate .

How to Live : a Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer By Sarah Bakewell ( Chatto & Windus , £ 16.99 )
After inheriting his father ’s estate in the interior of Aquitaine , Michel de Montaigne ( 1533 -1592 ) decided to quit public life as a magistrate in the Bordeaux parlement and devote himself to leisurely study .
Instead of leading to the Horatian idyll of self - cultivation he expected , the inactivity and desultory reading led to a nervous breakdown .
To steady himself , he began to write .
Since he was neither a military man nor a man of affairs , his only subject matter was himself ; so he resolved to try ( essayer ) to assay himself , his nature , his opinions , his attitudes and reactions , pretending nothing and confessing all .
“ I am myself the matter of my book ” he wrote ; and he knew that he was engaged in producing something wholly original by being so .
The result is a classic that has been admired , imitated and enjoyed ever since .
A reason for the enduring attraction of Montaigne ’s Essays is that they do what all classics do : they illuminate the universal in the particular .
In one way this should be a surprise , because Montaigne was a highly individual man and , by his own account , a rather unsuccessful one .
He frankly confessed his inabilities and shortcomings , his dislike of business , his yearning for solitude , his regret at being forgetful and not very clever , his physical lacks ( he was short and had , he tells us , a small penis ) .
Yet his frankness is refreshing and full of human truth .
He found a method of writing suited to the character of his mind — an aleatory , divagatory , exploratory method which meandered along with his thoughts , making his essays unsystematic and random , full of unexpected , entertaining detours .
Sarah Bakewell adopts Montaigne ’s own method to give an account of him and his views .
Because Montaigne ’s great question was Socrates ’s question — “ how to live ? ” — she arranges her portrait of him around the answers he offered .
The outcome is an instructive journey around Montaigne , exemplifying his charm and the universality of his appeal .
Bakewell rightly treats Montaigne as a contemporary for all times .
Scholars , by contrast , like to emphasise the respects in which he was of his epoch , rooting him in the turbulent mixture of Renaissance and Reformation that made it possible for him to write as a pagan in the bitter midst of the 16th century ’s wars of religion . …

( WOMENSENEWS ) –Janna Jones ( not her real name ) used to love her job in the information technology , or IT , industry when she was working in the Washington , D.C. , area as a computer analyst .
Her company worked on mostly large government contracts .
" The firm was diverse , there was lots of mentoring , I never felt any discrimination , I felt very supported , especially as a young woman , " said Jones , who specialized in data mining .
She used sophisticated software and wrote computer programs to search for patterns of fraud and abuse for government agencies , including the IRS and Medicare .
" I really thought this was going to be a career for me , because things were so positive , " she said .
But a move to a company in the Midwest changed that .
" I do n’t know if it was the company or the geography , but I could hear and feel the hostility , " she said .
Jones said even if a woman had been a team leader on a project , when it came time to meet with a client , she would be relegated to a secretarial role .
" I could be giving a presentation and if people had questions they would look to the men in the room and never ask it directly of me , " she said .
When she asked her boss how to deal with this sexism , she was advised to , " Play up my femininity .
Make sure the men feel like they are smarter than you , then they will feel comfortable , " said Jones .
But she knows her experience is not just related to location .
" I have girlfriends in D.C. , all over who have endured similar things . "
Jones , who is 29 , did not want her real name used because she is job hunting now .
" I ’d love to stay in the industry , " she said .
A Growing Industry
Technology jobs are predicted to grow at a faster rate than all other jobs in the professional sector , up to 22 percent over the next decade , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Compensation is also good .
In 2008 , women in tech made an average salary of $ 70,370 , according to Dice Holdings , an Urbandale , Iowa - based company that specializes in recruiting and career development in technology and engineering .
But women ’s stake in that rosy outlook is questionable .
For starters , men ’s pay during the same time period was $ 80,357 .
A study by the National Center for Women and Information Technology , based in Boulder , Colorado , also finds that women are leaving computer careers in staggering numbers .
" Fifty - six percent of women in technology companies leave their organizations at the mid-level point , 10 - 20 years in their careers , " said Catherine Ashcraft , the senior research scientist who authored the report .
In 2008 , women held only 25 percent of all professional IT - related jobs , down from 36 percent in 1991 , according to the group ’s report , " Women in IT : The Facts . "
The report shows about half the women who leave science , engineering and tech jobs continue to use their technology skills , either starting their own companies or finding positions in government or nonprofits .
The others , however , say goodbye to their extensive training , taking non-tech jobs or leaving the work force completely .
Ashcraft said women are discouraged and leave for a wide range of blatant and subtle reasons .
Women ’s pay , after 15 years , is 11 percent less than men with comparable experience .
There are also subtle hostilities and " microinequities " that range from looks and gestures to backhanded compliments like : " Great job !
You are living proof that women really do have technical minds ! "
A diverse workplace is n’t just a matter of equal opportunity ; it often means a better bottom line and a more positive working environment .
The report indicated that companies with the highest representation of women in senior management teams had a 35 percent higher return on equity .
‘ Ecosystem of Reform ’
The National Center for Women and Information Technology works with Fortune 500 companies , from ATandT to Cisco to Google to Wal - Mart , to help create " an ecosystem of reform " to help recruit , retain and promote qualified women .
In order for this to succeed , however , the tone must be set at the top .
Ashcraft says leaders of any diversity effort have to be high enough in the chain of command to have the power to make and enforce decisions .
Only then will the other goals of recruiting , mentoring and removing biases and barriers make a difference .
" There are isolated practices here and there that are promising , but no one has it right yet , " said Ashcraft .
" Some companies have flex - time on the books , but the sticky part is there ’s sometimes a stigma if you access it . "
The implication , she added , is that women are getting " special treatment " to deal with family responsibilities .
And some women will be sent off a " glass cliff , " a metaphor for a nearly impossible work assignment that men in the company dodge around , leaving it to a woman to undertake and then face a high risk of failure .
" It ’s not unique to technology , " said Ashcraft .
" If there ’s pressure from above to diversify , to look like they are doing the right thing , they will promote people who are not ready or they wo n’t give them the power they need .
So they will be promoted to high - risk projects so they can be a scapegoat . "
Ashcraft says that simply reducing female attrition by one quarter would add 220,000 to the science , engineering and technology talent pool .
Mentoring a Positive Step
One positive step would be to expand and support mentoring .
The report indicates that people with mentors receive more promotions and higher compensation , and also have higher job satisfaction .
The right woman or man as a mentor can mean women are less likely to have one foot out the door because of isolation or deliberate or unintentional roadblocks to promotions .
Smaller companies , nonprofits and entrepreneurs can be the benefactors of the lack of insight from large companies .
" The giants of the tech industry have lost high caliber employees and it ’s the little organizations , like mine , who have really gained at their expense , " said Sarah Schacht , founder of Knowledge As Power .
Her Seattle - based company helps individuals track legislation and communicate with lawmakers .
Schacht ’s staff of 10 is expected to grow to 14 later this year .
" In building my organization I wanted the work experience to be dramatically different , " said Schacht .
At age 30 , Schacht has female employees and even interns older than herself who have defected from corporate jobs .
" It seems clear that they are looking for more meaning in their work .
They ’ve been at it for 10 - 15 years and are realizing , ‘ It ’s not going to get any better . ’ "
So she puts outcomes ahead of rules when dealing with her employees .
" As somebody whose grandparents have Alzheimer ’s and who dealt with the death of my father in the last year , I realize ‘ life happens . ’
I do n’t care where your work is getting done , I care that deadlines are met , " Schacht said .

Guest toon from Alex of Buttersafe
There was considerable attention yesterday on a media report stating that Canadian Heritage Minister James Moore warned against " radical extremists " opposing C - 32 .
A video of part of his remarks has now been posted online [ full video here ] .
The comments , which come after the prepared speech , feature a no-holds - barred attack against those arguing for fair copyright .
According to Moore , some proposed amendments to C - 32 are not genuine but rather part of an attempt to oppose copyright and copyright reform , to drum up fear , and to mislead .
Moore encourages confrontation , urging the audience to confront on Facebook , Twitter , talk shows and in the media until " they are defeated . "
I 'm under no illusion here .
Yesterday , I asked in a post who Moore 's " radical extremists " are .
The video suggests that he thinks it is me and the thousands of other Canadians who have argued for fair copyright ( a reporter at the event reached the same conclusion and CRIA lawyer Barry Sookman is happy to do the same ) .
His comments met with applause from the audience and will be taken as a mandate to continue the astroturfing activities on Balanced Copyright for Canada .
To hear the Minister of Canadian Heritage both discredit the views of so many people and to encourage confrontation as the optimal plan of action is incredibly discouraging .
To use his own words , it is an attempt to mislead , misdirect , and undermine what has been more than a year - long effort for Canadians to speak out on copyright .
For those that are interested , my actual take on C - 32 is here and some proposed amendments here .
The comments are not dissimilar from many consumer , education , library , business , and creator groups .
I see few people who are " absolutists " out there – most want a fair approach but may disagree on precisely where to strike the balance on issues such as digital locks or fair dealing .
Perhaps most troubling is the fact that this is part of a growing trend .
Yesterday 's comments targeted fair copyright , but we are not alone .
When consumer groups criticize the bill , Moore claims they do n't represent consumers and cites support from the Chamber of Commerce instead .
When political opposition parties speak of the need for reform to digital locks provisions , he says they have not put forward amendments .
When creator groups such as ACTRA criticize his approach , he blocks them on Twitter .
When business and education groups express concern about digital locks , he selectively cites their supportive comments instead .
Moore is clearly ready to fight and has urged the few supporters of DMCA - style provisions to do the same .
Those absolutists out there , who are babyish in their approach to copyright legislation who think that any idea that copyright reform would be an attack on individual citizens are people who frankly do n't get .
Let me amend what I said a minute ago .
Do n't ignore those voices .
Those people who are out there who are saying that copyright legislation , copyright reform is not good , these are people who are dressing up the fact that they do n't believe in copyright reform at all .
Right .
These people out there who do n't believe in copyright at all .
They will say , well Bill C - 61 , the old copyright legislation , we disagreed with these specific provisions .
Well , Bill C - 32 we have these specific amendments .
Do n't fool yourself .
These voices that are out there , these people that are out there who pretend to be experts that the media cite all the time .
They do n't believe in any copyright reform whatsoever .
They will find any excuse to oppose this bill , to drum up fear , to mislead , to misdirect , and to push people in the wrong direction and to undermine what has been a meaningful comprehensive year - long effort to get something right .
This has n't been done since 1997 , three years after I graduated high school .
It 's been a long time .
We need to amend our legislation .
Those people out there who try to pretend that they are copyright experts and they want to amend copyright in a meaningful way , do n't be fooled by some of these people .
They do n't believe in any copyright .
They do n't believe in individuals ' right to protect their own creations .
When they speak , they need to be confronted .
If it 's on Facebook , if it 's on Twitter , or if it's on a talk show or if it is a newspaper , confront them and tell they are wrong .
Canada , from the Hudson 's Bay Company through FTA and NAFTA to the G8 and G20 , Canada always has been and always will be a trading nation .
Our future and our past and our prosperity has always been dependent on investment into Canada , being in compliance with international standards , opening ourselves up to the world , welcoming investment and working with the world .
Not being an outlier in the world , disregarding international treaties like WIPO that we 've signed , disregarding our obligations to protect foreign investment into Canada , Canadian investment into Canadian businesses , we need to protect those investments and protect those jobs .
Make sure that those voices who try to find technical , non-sensical , fear - mongering reasons to oppose copyright reform are confronted every step of the way and they are defeated .
When we do that this bill will pass and Canada will be better for it .
Preventing Lower Back Pain : Assuming is Okay Written on June 21 , 2010 at 7:43 am , by Eric Cressey
It 's widely known that approximately 80 % of the population will suffer from lower back pain at some point during their lives .
What is n't widely known , however , is that even those who are asymptomatic are usually walking around with a host of nasty stuff going on with their spines .
Do n't believe me ?
A 1994 study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that in a study of MRIs of 98 asymptomatic individuals , 82 % of those MRIs came back as positive for a disc bulge , protrusion , or extrusion at one level .
And , 38 % actually had these issues at more than one level .
You can read the free full text HERE .
As the others discovered , it does n't stop with disc issues , either - and that 's where a great study from Soler and Calderon comes in .
They looked at the incidence of spondylolysis ( vertebral fractures ) in elite Spanish athletes , and found that 8 % of those they examined had them .
Only about half of those diagnosed via imaging actually had back pain , though .
The incidence was highest in track and field throwers , rowers , gymnasts , and weightlifters - and I 'd expect that this figure is actually higher in the U.S. , where we have more sports ( hockey , baseball , lacrosse ) involving violent extension and rotation , more contact sports , and more participation in weight training .
What does this mean for us ?
Well , as Chou et al. reported in The Lancet , " Lumbar imaging for low - back pain without indications of serious underlying conditions does not improve clinical outcomes .
Therefore , clinicians should refrain from routine , immediate lumbar imaging in patients with acute or subacute low - back pain and without features suggesting a serious underlying condition . "
That 's not the point of my article today , though ; I 'll leave that stuff to the physicians to decide and rehabilitation specialists to interpret and treat .
As fitness professionals , strength coaches , and even just fitness enthusiasts and athletes , we need to assume that there is are probably a lot of structural abnormalities going on in the spines we encounter - including our own .
The programs we write and follow need to be sound and take these issues into account , considering differences in age , gender , sport participation , and injury history .
The technique we use needs to position us so that we can avoid causing them to reach threshold .
And , we need to appreciate that there is a risk - reward balance to be " struck " with everything we do in training because nobody will ever be " perfectly prepared " for the demands to be placed on their bodies .
Rather than lay all my thoughts out here , I 'm going to direct you to some previous writing of mine : To Squat or Not to Squat ?

Image caption Igor Sutyagin was jailed in Russia in 2004
A prisoner swap is being planned to bring 10 suspected Russian spies back from the US , say Russian reports .
Igor Sutyagin , a man jailed in Russia for spying for the CIA , said he and unspecified others would be exchanged , his family said .
Neither Russian nor US authorities have commented on reports of the swap .
Meanwhile , a New York court unsealed an indictment against the 10 alleged spies and an eleventh suspect who is on the run after escaping custody in Cyprus .
The indictment came hours after a court hearing in the US state of Virginia for three of the suspected spies was postponed and orders were issued to transport them " promptly to the Southern District of New York for further proceedings " .
The federal indictment does not change the charges already filed against the group , which is accused of laundering money and acting as unregistered foreign agents .
Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said : " As the government indicated would happen when the case began , the defendants are being transported to the Southern District of New York to face the charges against them . "
He added : " Today 's indictment is the next step in that process . "
' Illegal agents '
In a move which fuelled speculation about an imminent swap , a top US diplomat met the Russian ambassador to Washington .
No details were given of the talks between undersecretary of state for political affairs William Burns , who is a former US ambassador to Moscow , and Ambassador Sergei Kislyak other than the fact that issue of spies came up in the meeting .
Igor Sutyagin was quoted as saying he expected to be put on flights to Vienna , then London , on Thursday .
No reason has yet been given for the transfer to New York , where the other seven suspects are in custody .
The 10 suspected Russian spies were arrested last month on suspicion of working as illegal agents for the Russian government .
An 11th suspect was arrested in Cyprus but went missing after being released on bail .
On Wednesday , the New York Times quoted sources close to the case as saying the federal government was seeking a rapid resolution .
' No choice '
Igor Sutyagin , a nuclear weapons specialist , is serving a 15 - year jail sentence for passing information to a UK firm allegedly used as a front by the CIA .
Image caption Sutyagin 's lawyer ( R ) , mother and brother spoke to media
According to his brother , Dmitry , he said he had been told by Russian officials that he would be released and sent to the UK in exchange for an unknown number of spies .
The officials met Sutyagin on Monday at a prison in Arkhangelsk , northern Russia , and US officials were at the meeting , the brother said .
Sutyagin said he had been made to sign a confession , although he maintains his innocence and does not want to leave Russia , his brother added .
After Monday 's meeting , the prisoner was reportedly moved to Moscow 's Lefortovo prison .
Anna Stavitskaya , a lawyer acting for Sutyagin , told Reuters that her client had agreed to be swapped " as he had no other choice left " .
" He knew that otherwise his whole life would be broken but he still insists he is innocent , " she said .

Russian media quote a member of Sutyagin 's family as saying he had seen a list of names of prisoners likely to be swapped by Russia , including Sergei Skripal .
Skripal is a Russian military intelligence ( GRU ) officer convicted of spying for the UK in 2006 .
The 11 alleged members of the Russian spy ring in the US are accused of conspiracy to act as unlawful agents of a foreign government .
The crime is less serious than espionage but carries a sentence of up to five years in prison .
Two of the suspects , Mikhail Kutzik and Natalia Pereverzeva , had been living as a couple with their children in Arlington , near Washington DC .
They admitted being Russian citizens operating under assumed names .
They and fellow suspect Mikhail Semenko had been due to attend the court hearing on Wednesday .
Meanwhile , the US government said it would appeal against a New York judge 's decision to allow one suspect , Vicky Pelaez , to be released on bail .
Ms Pelaez remained in custody on Wednesday as bail arrangements were still being completed .
Investigators have pulled 56 corpses and four heads from the 600 - foot - deep mine shaft on the edge of this town , nestled in the verdant mountains 110 miles south of Mexico City .
Many of the victims were dumped into the slanted chute while still alive and aware .
" The rocks in the shaft are sharp - edged and tore at the bodies , " Luis Rivera , 23 , Guerrero state 's senior criminologist in Taxco , said in explaining the feet , hands and legs torn from some victims .
" There were some who arrived alive at the bottom . "
Only eight of the badly decomposed bodies have been identified so far , including that of a prison warden kidnapped in late May .
But police say all the victims were killed by the henchmen of a Texas - born gangster , Edgar Valdez , who is warring for control of one of Mexico 's largest drug - trafficking organizations .
Not long ago , such a gruesome discovery would have been headline news for weeks in Mexico .
But the atrocities linked to the country 's gangland wars come too fast these days for any to draw notice for long .
Shootouts no longer shock .
Beheadings have become boring and massacres mundane .
Unearthed narco - graves — the clandestine mass tombs where many drug war victims lie - now serve merely as mileposts .
More than 400 people this year have been killed gangland style in Guerrero state , which includes Taxco , as Valdez 's group fights with his rivals for smuggling routes and local markets .
Amid that fighting , men have been disappearing by the dozens in Taxco and surrounding towns .
' Count the heads '
There were rumors that some of those who vanished had been dumped down the ventilation tunnel of the mine , which like most others nearby has been closed for three years by a labor strike .
The vent sits alongside a badly rutted road that overlooks a valley of grazing livestock and farm fields a few miles from town .
A 465 - year - old hacienda , which was the first silver processing plant in Mexico and now hosts a New Age wellness retreat , sits half a mile away .
Precisely to keep people from falling into the shaft , the mining company years ago had it enclosed by tall cinder - block walls topped with closely spaced iron beams .
But someone had removed some of the blocks , leaving a small breach in one wall .
People used to throw trash and sometimes dead animals into the pit through that gap , one local resident said .
Gangsters dispatched their victims the same way .
Investigators had responded to past rumors by searching the upper reaches of the vent , finding nothing .
They were sent in again on May 29 after captured gangsters told army interrogators that they recently had dumped three men into the hole .
Rivera , the state criminologist , got the call before dawn that Saturday morning .
He sent an underling into the mine , who called by late morning to report there were " many bodies " in a large pit at the foot of the shaft .
The number of victims was n't easy to calculate , the man told Rivera , because there also were many unattached limbs .
" I told him to count the heads , " Rivera said in a hushed voice .
" I knew I would have a lot of work . "
Rivera informed his superiors of the discovery and was told to retrieve the mangled remains by any means necessary , despite a lack of proper rescue equipment .
Rounding up local firefighters and police officers for the task , Rivera reluctantly decided he had to go down into the mine himself .
Climbing into his office 's single disposable biohazard suit , Rivera descended on a rusted ladder for the first 11 yards or so , then rappelled the rest of the way down .
Once on the bottom , Rivera said , he stumbled over something and stepped into a tangled heap of decaying flesh .
It felt like quicksand , he said , the dead floating in a thickened broth of water and the fluids from their decomposing remains .
Bodies stacked deep
Rivera had assumed the pit was no more than a foot or two deep .
But when he tried to gauge it with a 5 - foot board , he could n't touch bottom .
The team then realized that the floating bodies were stacked several deep .
As one was pulled out , another would surface .
Working in the dank , dark cavern , Rivera and the other men began pulling bodies from the pit .
They lifted the victims in their arms , wrapped them in burlap sacks and looped ropes around them .
Others at the surface pulled the bodies up by hand .
The crews managed to retrieve only four victims in the first 24 hours .
It took six days to remove them all .
Rivera said that scabs on some of the bodies suggested their hearts were still beating when they were plunged into the mine 's maw , the rocks and jutting metal bars biting into them like fangs .
" Many were thrown in alive , " the criminologist said .
People have been coming to Rivera 's office and to morgues all month , searching for family members who have gone missing .
They bring face shots , descriptions of tattoos and birthmarks , lists of clothes the missing were wearing when last seen .
Many to remain nameless
Investigators positively identified one of the men by a leg that bore a tattoo of the Virgin of Guadalupe and another proclaiming " Made in Mexico . "
Another reclaimed his name because " Rosa " was inked into his chest .
But most of the bodies are decayed almost beyond recognition as human .
A few had become mummified , Rivera said .
The cold and humid conditions of the mine - and its lack of insects and foraging wild animals - make establishing any time of death difficult , he said .
So Rivera can offer little hope to most of the searching relatives .
But he 'll keep trying .
" These might have been bad people , " Rivera said of the victims .
" But their families are not at fault .
They need to know . "

U.S. Jobless Claims and Housing Market Data Point to Worsening Economy
Reports issued Thursday on initial claims for unemployment benefits and sales of previously owned homes confirm that the US economy is slowing dramatically .
The Labor Department reported that initial jobless claims for the week ended July 17 rose by 37,000 to 464,000 .
The number was far higher than the consensus forecast of economists .
It underscored the bleak prospects for any significant reduction in the unemployment rate , now officially at 9.5 percent .
The four - week moving average of initial claims also rose , hitting 454,750 , up 1,250 from the previous week .
In a healthy economy with substantial hiring , initial jobless claims usually fall below 400,000 .
Also on Thursday , the National Association of Realtors reported that existing home sales fell 5.1 percent in June to an annual rate of 5.37 million units .
It was the second consecutive monthly drop .
Home sales in the US are down 26 percent from their peak in September 2005 .
The sales figure followed other housing data released earlier in the week showing that the housing market recovery is collapsing .
Housing starts fell in June to the lowest level since October , and homebuilder sentiment fell this month to its lowest level since April 2009 .
In May , pending home sales plunged 15.9 percent from the year - earlier period to the lowest level since the National Association of Realtors began collecting statistics in 2001 .
In a front - page article Wednesday headlined “ Housing Market Stumbles , ” the Wall Street Journal noted , “ Demand for home purchase mortgages sits near a 14 - year low , according to the Mortgage Bankers Association , down 44 percent over the past two months . ”
Underlying the renewed housing slump is the jobs crisis , the worst since the 1930s .
Home sales and construction are falling despite the fact that mortgage rates are the lowest in decades and home prices have fallen sharply .
But demand is low because so many people are either out of work or afraid of being laid - off , or are working fewer hours for less pay .
In addition , a quarter of homeowners are “ under water , ” i.e. , they owe more on their mortgage than the sale price of their home .
Consequently , they cannot sell their present home to move into another .
The flood of foreclosed homes is further undermining the housing market .
Bloomberg wrote on Thursday , “ Foreclosures and short - sales are boosting the so - called shadow inventory , and competing with owners trying to sell properties .
Home seizures jumped 38 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier , Realty Trac said last week , putting lenders on pace to claim more than 1 million properties this year . ”
Also on Thursday , the Conference Board reported that its index of leading economic indicators fell 0.2 percent in June .
It was the second decline in three months .
“ The indicators point to slower growth through the fall , ” said Ken Goldstein , an economist at the Conference Board .
The release of the economic data coincided with two days of congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , in which the central bank chief acknowledged a slowdown in what was already a torpid economic growth rate .
Presenting the Fed ’s semiannual monetary policy report to Congress , Bernanke appeared Wednesday before the Senate Banking Committee and Thursday before the House Financial Services Committee .
He said the US economic outlook was “ somewhat weaker ” than previously indicated , and focused on persistent high unemployment and the slowdown in the housing market .
On jobs , Bernanke acknowledged that the Fed expected the unemployment rate to decline even more slowly than it had previously forecast , leaving the official jobless rate at 7.0 percent to 7.5 percent at the close of 2012 .
The Fed forecasts the jobless rate to be between 9.2 percent and 9.5 percent in the final quarter of 2010 .
He acknowledged that the pace of private payroll growth in the first half of 2010 — 100,000 a month , on average — is “ insufficient to reduce the unemployment rate materially . ”
The US central bank recently cut its estimate for US growth in 2010 from 3.2 -3.7 percent to 3.0 - 3.5 percent .
It expects the economy to pick up only slightly to 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent in 2011 and 2012 .
This is a projection for , at best , years of extremely high unemployment , with all of the attendant social consequences .
But what shook the stock market on Wednesday was Bernanke ’s remark that the economic outlook was “ unusually uncertain . ”
This sent the Dow tumbling , leading to a 109 - point drop at the close of trading .
In his Senate testimony Wednesday , Bernanke said the Fed was prepared to take new steps in the event of the economy slipping back toward negative growth .
However , he made clear that it had no plans in the near term to intervene further .
On Thursday , before the House committee , Bernanke placed more emphasis on the willingness of the Fed to take unorthodox measures to prevent deflation or a “ double - dip ” recession .
He made clear that these measures would aim to increase the flow of cheap credit to major banks and corporations , bolstering their profits .
Bernanke implicitly indicated that the Fed would not support any measures to directly create jobs , such as a public works program , or any major government spending to provide relief for the millions of workers facing long - term unemployment , the loss of their homes , utility shutoffs , and a slide into destitution .
While he cautioned against immediately ending all forms of economic stimulus , he reiterated his repeated demand that the government formulate a medium - term plan to slash social spending in order to reduce the budget deficit .
Bernanke ’s testimony Thursday , combined with more second - quarter corporate reports showing bumper profits , sparked a rally on Wall Street , with the Dow closing up by 201 points .
President Obama has repeatedly declared that the economy is “ headed in the right direction . ”
His administration has dropped even its minimal proposals to aid financially desperate state and local governments and subsidize job creation .
It is pursuing the ruling class policy of using mass unemployment to drive down the wages and living standards of the working class , and preparing sweeping austerity measures to make working people pay for the budget and debt crisis of US capitalism .
While workers are suffering the impact of this policy , big business is benefiting handsomely .
Corporations registered record profit gains in the first quarter of 2010 , and they are expected to rise another 19.3 percent this quarter , as compared to a year ago .
The profit surge is largely the result of downsizing , wage cutting and speedup .
In a recent column in the New York Times , Roger Altman , an investment banker and deputy treasury secretary in the first Clinton administration , defended Obama against criticisms from some business leaders by citing his pro-corporate record .
He pointed out that profits are up 41 percent since Obama was elected and the Dow has risen by more than 28 percent over the same period .

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Where is the New York Times ?
Where is The Washington Post ?
Where are CBS and NBC ?
A whistleblower makes explosive allegations about the Department of Justice ; his story is backed by at least two other witnesses ; and the allegations involve the two hot - button issues of race and of blatant politicization of the justice system .
A potential constitutional confrontation stemming from the scandal brews between the Justice Department and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights .
A congressman highly respected for thoughtfulness and bipartisanship has all but accused the department of serious impropriety .
By every standard of objective journalism , this adds up to real news .
Or it would be real news if a Republican Justice Department stood accused .
It would be real news if the liberal media were n’t mostly in the tank for our celebrated but failing first black president .
Tomorrow , the Civil Rights Commission will hear long - awaited testimony from J. Christian Adams , who resigned from the Voting Section of the Justice Department after the department improperly ordered him to refuse compliance with the commission ’s lawful subpoena .
Mr. Adams first told his story in public in these pages on June 28 and later did two major interviews with Fox News ’ Megyn Kelly .
In those appearances , he flatly accused the Obama Justice Department of adopting an unlawful , immoral policy identified in previous Washington Times editorials - namely , enforcing civil rights laws against white perpetrators who victimized minorities but never against black perpetrators who victimize whites or Asians .
If this is indeed the policy , it makes a scandalous mockery of the cherished American principle of “ equal justice under the law . ”
All these allegations stem from what should have been a slam - dunk voter - intimidation case against members of the New Black Panther Party videotaped in menacing behavior outside a Philadelphia polling place in 2008 .
The Obama Justice Department dropped or seriously reduced all the charges or penalties in the case after it already effectively had been won .
Mr. Adams ‘ former colleague , longtime award - winning civil rights lawyer Christopher Coates , has been reported on multiple occasions to have backed Mr. Adams ‘ version of events and of the Obama team ’s openly discriminatory policy .
If the department ’s motives are not racial or racist , Justice officials surely appear political .
One of the Black Panthers against whom the department declined to press charges was an official poll watcher for the Democratic Party and an elected local party official .
The department dropped charges just four days before another election , allowing him again to serve as a poll watcher .
Mr. Adams says the official most directly involved in dropping the case , Steven H. Rosenbaum - whose ethics have been subject to judicial sanction - refused to read his own team ’s legal briefs before deciding to dismiss the case .
Mr. Adams accuses Thomas E. Perez , head of the Justice Department ’s Civil Rights Division , of providing false answers in testimony to the Civil Rights Commission .
On a parallel track , The Washington Times has reported strong circumstantial evidence suggesting that department officials may have consulted the White House before dismissing the case .
That possibility , too , cries out for investigation .
These broad policy questions and suggestions of political chicanery are important .
Do we have a nation of laws equally applied to all , or is justice being reduced to raw politics ?
Investigating such questions is the essence of the news business .
Failure to look into such a scandal is evidence of the institutional corruption of the much - ballyhooed “ fourth branch of government , ” a supposedly independent media .

Police nab hundreds in HOV sting
Virginia State Police pull over drivers at an entrance ramp to Interstate 66 on Wednesday .
( Gerald Martineau for The Washington Post )
Local and state police in Maryland and Virginia cited hundreds of drivers for violating HOV rules on Wednesday , authorities said .
The effort was part of the region 's second " Capitol Region HOV Awareness Day . "
The campaign yielded resulted in 713 citations for HOV violations :
-- First offense : 684
-- Second offense : 25
-- Third offense : 3 ( Virginia )
-- Fourth offense : 1 ( Virginia )
Under Virginia regulations , a first offense is $ 125 ; a second is $ 250 , plus three points on your license ; a third , $ 500 , plus three points ; and a fourth a whopping $ 1,000 , plus three points .
In Maryland the violations carry a $ 90 fine and one point .
Law enforcement also cited nine people for reckless driving and 68 for speeding .
Additionally , authorities recorded 52 equipment violations ; 53 inspection violations ; 18 expired registrations ; 24 drivers with revoked or invalid licenses ; 10 drivers without licenses ; 41 people who were n't buckled up ; and two instances where children were n't properly fastened in a safety seat .
State police from Maryland and Virginia , the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Police and authorities from Fairfax and Arlington counties participated in the effort during morning and evening rush hours .
Following Gordon Brown 's extraordinary , game - changing statement , here is a guide to how a progressive alliance could be constructed .
Bear in mind that as Sinn Féin 's five MPs refuse to take their Commons seats , a government needs 321 seats for a de facto majority in the House .
Progressive alliance
Labour : 258 seats
Liberal Democrats : 57 seats
Social Democratic Labour Party : 3 seats ( Labour 's Northern Irish sister party )
The Alliance Party : 1 seat ( Lib Dems ' Northern Irish sister party )
Plaid Cymru : 3 seats ( currently in coalition with Labour in Wales )
Scottish National Party : 6 seats ( the SNP negotiating team arrived in London last night and called for a " progressive " alternative to a Tory - Lib Dem pact )
Green Party : 1 seat ( Caroline Lucas has ruled out joining a formal coalition , but maintains that she is " interested in talking about ways we might co-operate " )
Independent : 1 seat ( Sylvia Hermon regularly voted with Labour while an Ulster Unionist MP , and could be expected to back the government on key votes )
Total : 330 seats
Conservative alliance
Conservative Party : 307 seats ( I add one seat , as the Tories are almost certain to win the delayed election in Thirsk and Malton )
Democratic Unionist Party : 8 seats ( the DUP generally votes with the Tories and there has been talk of a deal for some time )
Total : 315 seats
Perhaps the clearest indicator we 've had that a progressive alliance is increasingly likely is the statement issued by Nick Clegg this evening .
He made it clear he was dissatisfied with the Tories ' current offer :
[ S ] o far we have been unable to agree a comprehensive partnership agreement for a full parliament .
We need a government that lasts , which is why we believe , in the light of the state of talks with the Conservative Party , the only responsible thing to do is to open discussions with the Labour Party to secure a stable partnership agreement .
The possibility that Britain 's progressive majority may finally receive adequate representation in government is more real than ever tonight .

Kenya cleans up .
As Megan noted earlier today , official compensation offers an incomplete picture of the full benefits of a job .
This is especially true for the job of " most powerful figure in the country . "
For example , the official bennies of the office of President of Russia are worth quite a bit more than the equivalent of a U.S. law associate , I imagine .

Many European countries are now looking to emulate Norway 's quota for female board members , introduced first in 2004 .
A new report takes a look at the effects of that legislation six years on and concludes that many of the original arguments against the measure have not been borne out .

The Saddest Sight at the Pride Parade ...
... was n't the Christian protesters .
It was seeing so many young queers — and so many old ones — puffing away on cigarettes .
Seattle Center was so fucking smoky you would 've thought the Space Needle was on fire .
Pathetic :
It 's a Nice Thought ...
Society really fucks with our heads , I realize , and gay people do n't raise ourselves to hate ourselves .
But it would be nice if , as folks came out , they worked to shed the self - destructive bullshit — drug abuse ( not to be confused with responsible drug use ) , drowning themselves in booze ( not to be confused with a refreshing dip now and then ) , insane amounts of promiscuous and often unsafe sex ( not to be confused with sane amounts of promiscuous and safer sex ) , and cigarettes ( do n't be confused : there 's no reason to smoke cigarettes at all , ever ) — along with the shame .
But way too many do n't .
Veteran swingman Matt Barnes , one of the most coveted free agents left on the open market , will play for the Los Angeles Lakers .
The Lakers announced Thursday they had signed the free - agent forward .
Terms were not disclosed ;
Yahoo !
Sports is reporting that Barnes agreed to a two - year contract worth $ 3.6 million .
" Its official I AM A LOS ANGLES LAKER .
I wanna thank u for all ur patients and understanding .
This is a dream come true !!!
Good lookn Kobe , " said a post on the seven - year veteran 's Twitter feed .
The deal is significantly less than the one he reportedly agreed to with the Toronto Raptors on Monday .
Barnes announced Monday night via his Twitter feed that he was headed to Toronto .
But that deal quickly unraveled when it became apparent that the limited sign - and - trade options available to Orlando -- Barnes ' last team -- would not allow for the contract that Barnes was anticipating .
Under the impression that he would be receiving a two - year contract worth roughly $ 9 million , Barnes tweeted his thanks to Magic fans after announcing that he'd be " playing for the Toronto Raptors " next season .
The Magic are prevented by salary - cap rules from starting a sign - and - trade deal for Barnes at higher than $ 1.9 million , because Orlando does n't have Barnes ' full Bird rights after employing him for only one season .
A sign - and - trade deal would also have to span at least three years , although only the first year is required to be guaranteed .
Economic rebounds sure are n't what they used to be .
If the current rebound had been like those during 1954 - 1982 , the U.S. would have already experienced a substantial rebound in employment , as shown by the shaded gray area in the chart from Goldman Sachs below .
The U.S. seems to be stuck in a ' New Normal ' , one which for employment has existed since 1991 .
In the last two decades , employment gains have remained weak well after the end of recessions .
Worse yet 2009 takes the cake as the worst of the worst as shown by the blue line below .
We clearly have a long time to wait for the significant employment gains like we used to see in 1954 - 1982 .
Peter Harvey denies a charge of attempted murder in July 2009 A science teacher beat a pupil around the head with a dumbbell while shouting " die , die , die " , a court heard .
Peter Harvey , 50 , hit the 14 - year - old boy with a 3 kg weight at All Saints ' Roman Catholic School , Mansfield , a jury heard .
He denies attempted murder and causing grievous bodily harm ( GBH ) with intent , but has admitted a charge of GBH .
Nottingham Crown Court was told students were filmed calling Mr Harvey a " psycho " moments before the attack .
Another pupil was filming as Mr Harvey tried to restore discipline .
The injured schoolboy , whom Mr Harvey confronted for misbehaving in class , suffered a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain .
At the time the blows were being struck Mr Harvey was only heard to say one thing ... ' die , die , die '
Stuart Rafferty QC Stuart Rafferty QC , prosecuting , said Mr Harvey was sent home from the school in December 2008 after telling an education adviser he might harm somebody .
He returned to the classroom in April 2009 .
Mr Harvey was " happy " and " positive " on the morning of the attack , the court heard .
But , after a girl with behavioural difficulties started being disruptive it was alleged he kicked her , Mr Rafferty said .
He added : " She left the classroom in a state of tears and some of the class took exception to the way she had been treated and started calling him a psycho .
" He did n't seem to respond to that and told the class to get on with their work . "
' Chased round classroom '
The schoolboy victim then started waving a wooden metre rule and a metal Bunsen burner about in " high jinks " before he was attacked , the court heard .
Mr Harvey chased him round the classroom and the boy swore at him , the jury was told .
Mr Rafferty said : " That seems to have lit the blue touch paper because Mr Harvey grabbed him by his collar and started dragging him out of the classroom .
" He threw him to the ground and armed himself with a 3 kg dumbbell and began to hit the boy about the head with it .
" He struck at least two blows to the head which caused serious injury , really serious injury .
" At the time the blows were being struck Mr Harvey was only heard to say one thing .
" What he was saying was ' die , die , die ' . "
' Felt no emotion '
The court heard that one pupil tried to drag Mr Harvey off the boy , who was lying on his back looking " frightened and confused " .
The teacher was kneeling above him , raising the dumbbell to shoulder height for each of the blows .
Mr Rafferty said : " No - one can say for one moment what happened to this boy was deserved or justified .
" What he [ Mr Harvey ] did was grossly disproportionate to the wrong inflicted on him by the boy or other members of the class . "
The court heard that Mr Harvey later told police he felt like he was watching himself on television .
He said he was not feeling any emotion and " could n't think at all " .
' Mental breakdown '
The jury was told one 15 - year - old girl , who was in the class when the attack happened , claimed she confronted Harvey about his behaviour moments before the attack .
In an interview given to police , she said : " I said to him , ' Sir , I think you are having a mental breakdown ' because people were scared of him .
He started murmuring something about killing me . "
Describing the attack , the girl added : " He grabbed him by the neck and forced him out into the corridor .
The class ran out and he got him to the floor .
" By this time he was doing something to him .
He grabbed a weight and hit him on the head constantly .
He did n't stop and blood was everywhere .
" Everyone was screaming and then two people went and got teachers . "
The trial continues .

NEW YORK -- Pro Football Hall of Famer Lawrence Taylor was indicted Wednesday by a suburban New York grand jury on charges of third - degree rape and patronizing a prostitute .
The indictment follows his May 6 arrest at a Holiday Inn in Ramapo , N.Y. , where prosecutors say he paid a 16 - year - old girl $ 300 to have sex with him .
Taylor had been charged previously in Ramapo Town Court , but the indictment transfers the case to Rockland County .
He is scheduled to appear July 13 .
The former New York Giants linebacker also was indicted on charges of endangering the welfare of a child , and sexual abuse and criminal sexual act in the third degree .
He faces up to four years in prison if convicted .
He has denied the charges .
Rockland County District Attorney Thomas Zugibe said the 16 - year - old told investigators that she had been verbally threatened and physically assaulted by a pimp who drove her 26 miles north to the hotel where Taylor was waiting .
" One of the most effective ways to target prostitution is to go after the johns , " Zugibe said .
" This indictment underscores our serious commitment to prosecuting those defendants who create a market for the region 's growing sex trade . "
Taylor 's attorney reiterated his client 's innocence Wednesday .
" Mr. Taylor and his legal team made a strategic decision not to present any evidence to the grand jury , including him testifying or any witnesses in his defense , " said defense attorney Arthur Aidala .
At a late afternoon news conference in lower Manhattan , Aidala said that Taylor was prepared for the indictment .
" We 've spoken about this at length , " he said .
Aidala said he does not know what evidence was presented by prosecutors to the grand jury , but he said there is more to his defense than meets the eye .
" Our defense does not consist only of Lawrence Taylor and his words and his actions , " Aidala said .
" We have other evidence -- I 'm not going to talk about what other evidence it is -- but it's not just going to be 'he said she said . '
It 's going to be independent , corroborated evidence that we will be putting forth in Lawrence Taylor 's defense . "
Of the specific charges , Aidala said : " I am saying that he did not have sexual intercourse as defined by the penal code . "
He added that he did not expect a plea bargain .
When it comes to playing racing games , a good steering wheel and pedal set is a nearly idiotproof way to help lower lap times and improve consistency .
Unfortunately , such peripherals are not without their foibles .
If you want a decent , high - quality setup you ’ll have to shell out at least $ 100 , and if you want them arranged in an ergonomic fashion , you ’ll have to set aside a good chunk of space and , if you ’re really hardcore , invest in a cockpit or chair .
But what if you do n’t want to make that kind of financial or spatial commitment ?
Are you stuck in Joypad Purgatory ?
Up until this , point , yes .
However , HKS – which is far better known tuning parts and services for real cars rather than virtual ones – is hoping to bridge the gap between joypad and wheel / pedal set with the new Playstation 3 controller it has co-developed with InterWorks .
Officially named the HKS Racing Hipermax III , this aftermarket controller takes the standard PS3 button and analog stick layout and discards it in favor a novel new one .
The D - pad now lives where the right analog stick was , its spot having been usurped by a scroll wheel intended for steering duty .
The function buttons still reside on the right - hand side , but the “ square ” and “ X ” buttons have been replaced by a pair of vaguely - pedal - shaped buttons .
Lastly , a large central digital readout displays the amount of pressure being put on the accelerator and brake buttons .
Pricing for the Hipermax III has not been announced , but it will reportedly undercut the genuine Sony gamepad ’s $ 54.99 MSRP .
Furthermore , there are no plans at the moment for Xbox360 or PC versions .
Expect to see this controller in stores by the holiday season , perfect timing for all the Gran Turismo 5 buyers reading ( and writing ) this .

Sorry to keep blogging about this , but wait ’til you hear what happened .
This is beyond outrageous .
I mean … the word “ disgusting ” does n’t even begin to describe it .
As the title up top suggests , this is my fourth Best Buy entry .
Click here for the first , here for the second , and here for the third .
And now get ready to hear about their latest series of failures .
Yesterday , the 57th day since I had a working TV , was supposed to be THE day that my new TV was delivered and installed .
Did it happen ?
No , of course not .
Keep reading and you ’ll see why …
MESS -UP #1 : Best Buy told me that I ’d get a phone call half an hour before the TV was delivered .
Surprise - surprise : no one ever called .
The delivery guys showed up out of the blue with it — not a big deal , but it still annoyed me .
More than anything , though , I was relieved ( and in a state of shock ) that the TV was actually in my possession :
MESS-UP # 2 : I was given a four - hour window when the installation would take place .
Initially , it was set up for 8 am to 12 pm , but ( shocker ! ) at the very last second , it had to be pushed back to 12 pm to 4 pm .
I do n’t even know why .
Somehow , the guys who were supposed to do it in the morning were unavailable .
I accepted this , but told Best Buy three different times that I was going to have to leave my place no later than 3:30 pm .
They promised me that the Geek Squad — that ’s who was going to be installing the TV — would arrive early and finish the job by that time .
MESS-UP # 3 : At 2 pm , the Geek Squad called to ask what streets I live between — and to get subway directions .
You ’d think that after 57 days , Best Buy might have that information in its computer system .
MESS -UP # 4 : The Geek Squad did not arrive until 2:45 pm — way too late to finish the job on time .
MESS -UP # 5 : Only ONE guy showed up to do the job — a major problem considering that the new TV weighs 97 pounds and needed to be lifted onto a wall mount .
MESS UP #6 : The Geek Squad guy mistakenly thought that his job simply entailed mounting the TV .
Inexplicably , Best Buy had neglected to inform him that he ’d need to run a monster cable from the TV to a nearby audio - video cabinet , then drill a hole in it to get the wires through , and set up various pieces of electronic equipment ( DVD player , VCR , high - def receiver , old - school Nintendo , etc. ) .
MESS-UP # 7 : The guy did n’t have the right parts to secure the brackets for the wall mount .
He actually had to ask me for nuts and bolts ; naturally I did n’t have the ones he needed .
MESS-UP # 8 : Get ready for it .
No really … get ready .
At around 3:15 pm , I discovered that the TV screen was cracked !!!
I truly could NOT believe it .
Here I am taking a photo of the damage ( with the Geek Squad guy calling his supervisor ) :
By the way , my apartment looks empty because I had to move all my furniture out of the way .
Everything has been a mess here for weeks .
It ’s so stressful to have my home turned upside down , and this is where I work every day on my book .
My career has been suffering as a result of this ordeal .
I ’m not joking .
The amount of time and energy I ’ve wasted , along with the aggravation I ’ve endured , ca n’t even be measured or reimbursed .
Want to see the actual cracks ?
( Yes , there were two . )
Check this out :
Here ’s a closer look at the crack on the right :
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT ?!?!
BEST BUY MADE WE WAIT N
EARLY TWO MONTHS FOR A TV AND THEN DELIVERED ONE WITH TWO ******* CRACKS !!!!!!
WHAT THE **** DO I HAVE TO DO TO GET A ******* TV THAT ******* WORKS ?
But wait , that ’s not all …
MESS -UP #9 : The Geek Squad guy told me he ’d call his supervisor and then call the store and then call me back with an update .
He had my home phone number .
I gave him my cell phone number .
He never called .
No text message .
No voice - mail .
Nothing .
So , basically , I have not heard a single thing from Best Buy in the 11 hours since I discovered that they sent me a cracked TV — not an apology or an explanation or an update or anything .
I am so angry about this that …I do n’t even know what to say anymore .
To everyone reading this , please spread the word .
Tell everyone you know not to shop at Best Buy .
Tweet about it .
Post on Facebook about it .
Link to my blog entries about it .
Do not EVER buy anything from this company .
They are thoroughly inept and apathetic .
They ’re idiots and thieves .
I truly hope that it goes bankrupt ( but not before they refund my money ) .
I do n’t even want them to keep trying .
I do n’t want a TV from them .
I just want my money back , and of course they ’re refusing to give it to me .
Finally , I now have * two * lawyers on the case .
I ’m going to make a conference call to the Best Buy corporate headquarters later this morning with one of them , and depending on how that turns out , I have another lawyer - friend who ’s gathering details and info and preparing to fax Best Buy ’s general counsel ’s office a letter , informing them that they ’re being sued .
NDP MP Charlie Angus has issued a lengthy letter to Canadian Heritage Minister James Moore and Industry Minister Tony Clement that challenges them on the digital lock provisions in Bill C - 32 .
In a release on the letter , Angus states " the digital lock provisions will subject Canadians to arbitrary limitations on their legal rights of access .
The government is trying to create the impression that this unbalanced approach to digital locks is necessary in order to bring Canada into compliance with WIPO and the Berne Convention .
Nothing could be further from the truth . "
He adds :
" The government is establishing a two - tiered set of rights .
Bill C - 32 offers rights that consumers will be restricted from exercising .
These provisions make a mockery of the claim that the bill is balanced and pro-consumer .
Either the government has a faulty understanding of international treaty obligations or is looking to use these existing treaties as a cover to pursue a specific political agenda .
The New Democratic Party will challenge any provisions that would lead to unbalanced and arbitrary copyright legislation . "
The letter delves into much greater detail on the digital lock issue , discussing how there is flexibility at international law with Angus emphatically stating " I believe the government will be unable to produce evidence that these onerous digital lock provisions are the result of existing treaty obligations . "
As result , Angus makes a formal request that the government seek an opinion from WIPO on the issue of exceptions to digital locks .
In a shot at Moore 's " radical extremists " comment , Angus notes :
I have taken the steps to reference these works so that you can be reassured that Canadians who raise questions about the unbalanced implementation of digital lock provisions are not pushing " extreme " or " radical " views .
In fact , they are much within the mainstream regarding international implementation of these treateis .
Indeed , if there is a case for any " extreme " behavior in the present debate it would be the decision of the government to use C - 32 to pursue an agenda that goes well beyond the norms established by WIPO signatories .
As it stands now , Bill C - 32 is a flawed piece of legislation that will face increasing opposition because of its one - sided approach to digital locks .
It is clear that either the government has applied a faulty understanding of international treaty obligations or is looking to use these existing treaties as cover to pursue a specific political agenda .
Either way , the New Democratic Party will challenge provisions that would create a two - tiered set of rights with arbitrary limitations on citizen 's use of legally - accessed works .
THE police watchdog is investigating whether riot squad officers , unhappy with a magistrate 's judgment , may have fed false information to a radio station and a newspaper to discredit him .
In what would be a highly improper assault on the NSW courts if proven , officers from the public order riot squad allegedly took umbrage when a Local Court magistrate , David Heilpern , found three policemen - including two riot squad officers - had possibly '' tweaked ' ' their evidence in a Taser case .
'' This was an attempt to intimidate a judicial officer and … what magistrates of the Local Court have come to expect if they criticise police , '' one member of the judiciary told the Herald .
The allegations were uncovered as a result of the Herald 's reports this week about a cover - up by police and the government of misuse and abuses during a 2008 - 09 trial of the controversial Taser in NSW .
In one case that resulted from the trial a Sydney man , Ali Alkan , was twice Tasered by police despite presenting no threat .
He had been walking shirtless down the middle of Oxford Street in Surry Hills when police asked him to get off the road .
Prior injunction , pending appeal may be moot ; Status of court 's apparent conflicts - of - interest remain an open question ...
Ernest A. Canning Byon 7/13/2010 , 2:50 pm PT
Guest blogged by Ernest A. Canning
As noted in today 's Green News Report , Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar has ordered a new moratorium on exploratory deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere off the continental shelf of the U.S. .
The new suspension may make prior court battles over the previous moratorium moot , even as questions linger concerning apparent conflicts - of - interest by the judge who originally heard the case .
Stating that he was basing his decision on " an extensive record of existing and new information indicating that allowing new deepwater drilling to commence would pose a threat of serious , irreparable , or immediate harm or damage to the marine , coastal , and human environment , " Salazar sent a memo yesterday to Michael R. Bromwich , the Director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement ( BOEM ) , directing him to issue new suspensions of deepwater drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf ( OCS ) .
The new suspensions , presuming they withstand another inevitable court challenge from the oil industry , will run through November 30 and apply to both the Pacific and Gulf Coast regions .
In revealing the new suspensions , Salazar announced ...
I remain open to modifying the new deepwater drilling suspensions based on new information , but industry must raise the bar on its practices and answer fundamental questions about deepwater safety , blowout prevention and containment , and oil spill response .
The new suspension , which the Department estimates will apply to just 21 rigs , comes four days after a three - judge panel of the heavily - Republican 5th Circuit Court of Appeal in New Orleans rejected the Department of Interior 's request for an emergency stay of Judge Martin Feldman 's June 22 , 2010 preliminary injunction [ PDF ] .
That injunction prevented enforcement of the Department of Interior 's six month moratorium on exploratory drilling on only 33 " of the approximately 3,600 structures in the Gulf dedicated to offshore oil exploration and production . "
Because it is based on new evidence , the status of both the appeal and injunction in the previous case , Hornbeck Offshore Services , Inc. vs. Salazar , is in doubt .
New suspension guidelines
In his memorandum , Salazar directed Bromwich to utilize the suspension for :
1 . The submission of evidence by operators demonstrating that they have the ability to respond effectively to a potential oil spill in the Gulf , given the unprecedented commitment of available oil spill response resources that are now being dedicated to the BP oil spill ; 2 . The assessment of wild well intervention and blowout containment resources to determine the strategies and methods by which they can be made more readily available should another blowout occur ; and 3 .
The collection and analysis of key evidence regarding the potential causes of the April 20 , 2010 explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig , including information collected by the Presidential Commission and other investigations .
The one thing not mentioned is the lasting impact of oil spill disasters .
Consider the fact that Dec. 7 , 2011 will mark the 60th anniversary of the " date which will live in infamy . "
Yet , after all these years , if you stand on the deck of the Arizona Memorial and look down into the water , you will still see oil seeping up from below .
The Memorial guides refer to it as " the ship 's tears . "
In its previous 5th Circuit motion for a stay [ PDF ] , the government advised the court that Salazar was pursuing " all avenues for addressing risky operations , and will take new and immediately effective action as necessary . "
It noted that even the plaintiff , Hornbeck , admitted that Salazar " has the authority to do so . "
The government brief announced a new suspension would soon issue , noting :
The district court never disputed that the OCSLA [ Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act ] grants Interior the authority to issue the suspensions at issue .
It merely complained that Interior had not adequately explained its reasons for doing so .
In explaining Salazar 's new , July 12 directive , the Department of Interior stressed [ PDF ] that the " new " suspension was based on " new evidence regarding safety concerns , blowout containment shortcomings within the industry , and spill response capabilities that are strained by the BP oil spill .
Moreover , the new decision by the Secretary establishes a process through which BOEM will gather and analyze new information from the public , experts , stakeholders , and the industry on safety and response issues ...
In addition , the May 28 moratorium proscribed drilling based on specific water depths ; the new decision does not suspend activities based on water depth , but on the basis of the drilling configurations and technologies . "
A moot case and an interest - conflicted judge ?
If the government 's previous brief is accurate , the appropriate appellate course would be to rule that the previous moratorium has been superseded by the new one necessitating that the case be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings .
If that occurs , the parties will be back to square one with Hornbeck having the burden of showing that the " new " moratorium is arbitrary and capricious .
But if Hornbeck files a motion seeking a new preliminary injunction the question remains as to whether Judge Feldman must recuse himself in light of the conflicts - of - interest we discussed in Case for Impeachment of Judge Martin Feldman Strengthened by New Details on Oil Firm Holdings .
As we have previously detailed , according to the Alliance for Justice [ PDF ] :
In 2009 , Judge Feldman had financial investments valued at between $ 36,000 - 515,000 in twenty - eight individual energy and energy - related corporations , among them Exxon Mobil , Transocean , General Electric , Tyco International , and numerous smaller companies such as Ocean Energy , El Paso , and Quicksilver Resources .
Additionally , in 2009 Judge Feldman invested between $ 7,000 – 105,000 in Blackrock , a money management firm that is BP ’s biggest shareholder .
While the government did not previously move to disqualify Judge Feldman , the Alliance for Justice reported that " a group of environmental groups intervened and filed a motion for his disqualification , arguing that his financial holdings in oil and gas companies create the appearance of partiality . "
In the opinion of this writer , the government can and should move to disqualify Judge Feldman if and when this matter is returned to the District Court for further proceedings .

Saudi Arabia 's religious police have arrested 10 " emo " women for allegedly causing a disturbance in a coffee shop , Al - Yaum newspaper has reported .
The coffee shop owner in the eastern city of Dammam called the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice to complain after the young women , dressed and made up in the " emo " fashion , apparently began disturbing other clients .
The religious police then called their parents to come and collect the women , and to sign pledges that the girls would not repeat their ostensibly offensive un -Islamic behaviour and dress .
According to recent reports , growing numbers of urban young Saudi women are latching on to the emo fashion popular from Japan to Europe and the Americas .
The trend is characterised by wearing skinny black jeans , tennis shoes , colourful T - shirts bearing the names of emo bands , heavy make up and sharply chopped and sometimes radically coloured hairdos .
While Saudi women normally must appear in public shrouded by all - black abayas and headscarves , some daringly open their abayas in places such as malls and coffee shops to reveal more trendy outfits underneath .

ABOARD TURKISH PRESIDENT ’S AIRCRAFT ( Reuters ) - Peering out of his aircraft window at the energy - rich lands of Central Asia 35,000 feet ( 10,000 metres ) below , President Abdullah Gul wondered how opponents of Turkey ’s bid for EU membership could fail to see the big picture .
Turkey 's President Abdullah Gul ( L ) chats with Greece 's Prime Minister George Papandreou following a group photo session during the Southeast European Cooperation Process Summit in Istanbul June 23 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Osman Orsal
“ Everyone knows Turkey ’s biggest contribution will be in the field of energy , ” Gul told Reuters on his way home from Kazakhstan , a country courted for its mineral resources by China , Russia and the West .
In the new “ Great Game ” being played out across Eurasia , Turkey ’s role as a landbridge for pipelines bringing oil and gas from Central Asia and the Middle East will be a crucial for Europe ’s energy security .
But old doubts about letting in a Muslim country of 71 million people , many of whom still live in the backward areas of eastern Anatolia , have held Europe back .
For all recent reforms , some sceptics still see a country haunted by the economic turmoil and military interventions of the late 20th century .
Some of the EU ’s 27 members , Gul said , were erecting “ artificial obstacles ” without any sense of long - term vision over the advantages of having a secular , Muslim country with a fast growing economy in the club .
“ If you sacrifice strategic objectives for tactical considerations you will never be a big player , ” Gul said .
Five years have elapsed since Turkey entered formal negotiations to enter the EU .
In that time , Turkey has completed one chapter , the term given to subjects for negotiation , and opened 13 others , leaving 21 to go .
EUROPEAN AMBITIONS
All but three of the remaining chapters are blocked , including , to Gul ’s consternation , the one on energy .
The hold up is mostly due to an impasse over the divided island of Cyprus , an EU member whose Greek Cypriot government has obstructed Turkey ’s progress throughout because of Ankara ’s support for Turkish Cypriots who broke away in 1974 .
But Turkish EU campaigners might argue the Cyprus issue has become a device for other countries that want to keep Turkey out .
“ Some countries , even though they are not directly affected , are hiding behind this matter to create artificial obstructions , ” Gul said .
NATO member Turkey ’s concerted efforts to forge relations with its eastern neighbours , the Middle East , the Islamic World , as well as Russia and the former Soviet bloc countries , has led to some critics saying it is turning away from the West .
Some go further , saying the choice of new friends , like Iran and Syria , is a mark of the ruling AK party ’s Islamist pedigree .
Gul dismisses such notions as misconceived .
For Turkey , gaining admission to the EU is the top priority of state policy , he said .
The AK Party he belonged to before becoming president in 2007 has been the driving force , and while critics still talk of its Islamist roots , the party likens itself to a Muslim version of Europe ’s christian democrats .
Turkey , Gul said , was committed to the ideals of democracy , human rights , free markets , gender equality , and transparency and accountability and was intent on promoting those values .
The youth , intellectuals , and politicians in many Muslim countries , according to Gul , have been inspired by watching Turkey change .
OTTOMAN LEGACY
“ Turkey has become a sort of central attraction , ” Gul said .
“ Everybody is questioning themselves and saying ; If Turkey can realise this , we can realise this too . ”
Improving relations with Eastern neighbours , and seeking to grow markets in the Middle East , Africa and the wider Islamic World as well as former Soviet bloc countries did n’t compromise Turkey ’s EU goal , Gul said .
It was natural for a country to engage with former dominions of the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East , the Balkans and the Caucasus , Gul said , in the same way that Britain cherished its ties with the Commonwealth and Spain retains its links with Latin America , including some radical states .
“ Turkey ’s orientation is being confused with its contacts and relations -- these are separate things . ”
Having good relations with neighbours , was part of a vision to spread stability and security needed to bring prosperity to a a region whose governments have neglected their people by squandering resources on war , conflict and confrontation .
Relations with eastern neighbours have opened up markedly an alliance with Israel , however , has soured since Israeli forces boarded a Turkish aid ship on its way to Gaza , killing nine pro-Palestinian activists .
The new foreign policy approach will not be without its setbacks .
But Ankara clearly sees the opening as a driving force for its own domestic development and a key selling point to those Europeans yet to recognise Gul ’s big picture .
“ Turkey is like a stability generator in the region , ” Gul said .
He added , “ It is such a toxic subject , such an important time for Democrats . ”
The administration seemed to be taking a carrot - and - stick approach on Sunday .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , in town to give the governors a classified national security briefing , met one - on - one with Jan Brewer , the Republican who succeeded her as governor of Arizona and ardently supports the immigration law .
About the same time as that meeting , Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said on a taped Sunday talk show that the Justice Department could bring yet another lawsuit against Arizona if there is evidence that the immigration law leads to racial profiling .
Ms. Brewer said she and Ms. Napolitano did not discuss the current lawsuit .
Instead , in a conversation she described as cordial , they discussed Arizona ’s request for more National Guard troops along the border with Mexico , as well as other resources .
The Democrats ’ meeting provided a window on tensions between the White House and states over the suit , which the Justice Department filed last week in federal court in Phoenix .
Nineteen Democratic governors are either leaving office or seeking re-election this year , and Republicans see those seats as crucial to swaying the 2012 presidential race .
The Arizona law — which Ms. Brewer signed in April and which , barring an injunction , takes effect July 29 — makes it a state crime to be an illegal immigrant there .
It also requires police officers to determine the immigration status of people they stop for other offenses if there is a “ reasonable suspicion ” that they might be illegal immigrants .

Among its principal treasures are a suit of armour made in Milan for the Grand Master , Adrien de Wignacourt ( 1690 - 97 ) and a full - length panoply made for Grand Master Martin Garzes by Sigismund Wold of Landshut .
~City of Valletta
Grand Master 's Palace is located is Valletta , Malta and was the legendary seat of the Knights Hospitaller of Saint John .
The order of the Knights Hospitaller arrived in Malta in the first half of the 16th century , after spending several years in route to nowhere without a base after their expulsion by the Ottomans in 1522 .
Grand Master ’s Palace remained the base of the Knight ’s Hospitaller from 1571 to 1798 when Napoleon conquered Valletta .
It was designed by Gerolamo Cessar and constructed on the site the Knight ’s Hospitaller procured in 1571 .
The head of the order ’s nephew , Grand Master Jean Parisot de la Valette , lived in a small house on the site .
Incorporated into the southwest corner of the palace , the house of Jean Parisot de la Valette still exists .
The Palace of the Grand Master ’s served as a home for British governors of Malta , after the Royal Navy captured the island from the French at the beginning of the 19th century .
The island of Malta gained independence in 1964 , and the palace transformed into the home of parliament .
The seat of parliament meets in the original council chamber which is lined with Goblin tapestries depicting scenes from the New World and the Caribbean .
The presidential office also resides in Grandmaster ’s Palace .
Like the Zeughaus Museum , home of the world 's most extensive collection of historical weaponry , Grand Master ’s Palace contains an armory of historical weapons used by the knights and their enemies , including the sword of Turgut Reis , the Ottomon admiral and privateer who died in 1565 at the Siege of Malta .
Grand Master ’s Palace contains a large part of Malta ’s history , representing the changing of an era and opulence .
It is , however , a site filled with the mysteries of an order people like you and I can now see first hand .
Is it enough for our lives , our economy , our cities to become “ sustainable ” ?
If being sustainable means no more than being able to maintain the status quo of strife and never having enough , of contests over who gets the most of the scarce resources available , then aiming for sustainability is not enough .
We should instead aim for abundance .
What ’s abundance ?
Abundance , by my definition , is the condition when all people , regardless of their backgrounds , now and in the future , are enabled to live life as art .
Art is self - expression to others – and just like a painting , a hand - made basket , a dance performance , a dinner , or a garden express something about their makers and take on added value when they are shared with others , so also life ’s activities only become meaningful if they express something about the person ’s self and values to others in that person ’s life .

Life as art can only flourish in conditions of freedom , because it is based on exploring one ’s own inner self , one ’s own needs , wants and desires , and finding one ’s own unique way of expressing oneself to others .
Life as art supports social equity , both because expressing oneself to others does not depend on exploiting others , and because the more people around you are able to express themselves freely , the more you are enabled and encouraged to do the same .
Finally , life as art is compatible with sustainability , both because most people ’s values include the preservation of human and other life on earth , and because life as art helps overcome our addiction to an ever - increasing consumption of material commodities that do not satisfy our real needs .
The major obstacle to abundance is that our economy finds value only in scarcity .
Anything abundant either cannot be sold ( for example , air to breathe ) , or can only be sold at a low price ( for example , the labor of landless rural people ) .
An economy that runs on profits devalues everything that is abundant , leading to excessive exploitation and pollution .
At the same time , somebody has to make sure that demand for marketed commodities constantly grows , so that demand exceeds supply ( that ’s the economic definition of scarcity ) .
We ’re told that we just naturally always want more , but in reality , we can easily observe that some people are content with relatively little and others never have enough .
Also , everyone ’s wants and needs are greatly influenced by their social environment .
Our needs and wants only grow inexorably under specific conditions – and these conditions are expressly created by what I call scarcity - generating institutions .
In addition to keeping demand growing , scarcity - generating institutions can also manipulate supplies , for example by monopoly , where a few companies or individuals control the total supply of some commodity and thus keep prices high .
The “ health ” of our economy depends vitally on scarcity - generating institutions , but our well - being depends on nurturing abundance .
Scarcity Generation in Cities
Some examples of scarcity generation ?
The way U.S. ( and many other ) cities are built provides lots of them .
Industrial interests , real - estate markets , and urban growth machines have conspired to create sprawling cities that make it impossible , impractical , unpleasant , or downright dangerous to get around by walking or cycling or public transport .
These institutions have made mobility a scarce commodity that can only be obtained by buying a car ( with all its follow - up costs ) .
The resulting health problems ( ranging from respiratory problems to obesity ) contribute to escalating health care costs .
The inability to meet people while walking about town leads to a decline in sociability , a reduced sense of community .
Where there are fewer “ eyes on the street , ” security becomes scarce and depends on employing more police , installing alarm systems and surveillance cameras , imposing harsher penalties for misdemeanors , and so forth .
People become afraid of walking on the street , and patronize only stores with a big parking lot around them .
That brings lots of business to the big - box chain stores , and starves small independent businesses which form the heart of a vibrant local culture and economy .
Protest against " Big Brother " surveillance cameras in Abbiategrasso , Italy
Meanwhile , policies from the federal level ( such as tax incentives ) down to the local level ( such as zoning ordinances ) provide subsidies and other support for building the most space and resource - demanding form of housing ( single - family houses with large lawns around them ) , while leading to an underprovisioning of more reasonably - priced alternatives ( such as rented apartments , condominiums , and coop - housing ) .
So , people find that the only way they can get good housing is to move into the suburbs .
The resulting sprawl makes land in reasonable vicinity to the city center scarce , and drives up its cost – and also the cost of rents for families and business owners .
In fact , walkable places with a good mix of businesses and a sense of urban flair and vitality have become so scarce in the United States that they now attract a disproportionate number of people who hunger after something better than suburban desolation .
That drives up real - estate prices in these “ gentrified ” places , and drives out many of the long - time residents who can no longer pay the increasing rents .

It ’s an absurd irony , but it seems that living in a place where you can enjoy getting around by walking has become a privilege of the rich .
All of the above leads to increased consumption , increased profits to be made , increased economic “ growth , ” but reduced quality of life , restrained choices , increased inequality , and intensified environmental destruction .
We need something else .
Fostering Abundance in Cities
Scarcity is n’t produced only in cities ; it ’s produced all over the place in different ways , and by individuals in families or in small groups as well as by national governments , transnational corporations and financial institutions .
So cities are not the only type of place where we need to counteract the forces of scarcity generation , but they ’re an important one – particularly because cities are the places where most cultural innovation occurs and then spreads both to smaller settlements and up to the national and international levels .
What , then , can people – individuals , community organizations , businesses , and local governments – do at the urban scale in order to promote abundance ?
Here are a few answers .
There are many more , and I hope that you , the readers , will think of many more , or think about what you are doing already and how that may contribute to abundance .
We ’re made to believe that life consists of being born , getting a degree , marrying , buying a single - family house , car , and dog ( plus lots of other consumer items ) , earning as much money as possible ( without wasting time on questioning the meaningfulness of our work ) , retiring , and dying .
But life can consist of so much more – if we take the time to explore ourselves , our values , our relationships to others , and the ways that we may express ourselves and our values through our work , whether paid or unpaid .
In other words , we can live life as art .
To facilitate this kind of exploration , there can be all kinds of schools , businesses , meditation centers , meeting places , street theatre , publishing houses , libraries , and so on .
There ’s lots of scope for individual enterprise here , and city governments can help in the establishment of places where this kind of cultural ferment can happen .
Cities can also support more abundant freedom of choice among their residents by ensuring that there are different ways to cater to specific needs .
The need for mobility can be served not only through private cars , but also through walking , cycling , roller - skating , buses , trains , boats , horse - drawn carriages , car - sharing , taxis , and so on , provided by private businesses , public enterprises , self - provisioning , cooperatives , and so on .
The need for food can be provided by supermarkets , specialty stores , natural food stores , farmers markets , community gardens , community - supported agriculture , allotment gardens , private gardens , urban foraging , catering to all kinds of different people in different ways .
Market in Waldkirch , Germany
The need for housing can be served by owner - occupied houses , but also by rental housing , housing coops , community land trusts , and other means .
One size does n’t fit all , and we should n’t all be forced into one size .
The more such options there are , that do n’t just depend on market mechanisms but also on sharing and self - provisioning , the more likely it is that low - income people will be able to get what they need ( and thus not be poor ) .
And , it ’s also more likely that people can provide for their needs without consuming excessive amounts of resources .
A perennial problem we face these days is that any solutions to environmental problems appear to drive up the cost of living – for example , organic food costs more than industrially grown food , and reducing energy needs requires up - front investments ( even if it saves money within a few years ) .
Also , there ’s a conflict between trying to ensure reasonable costs to consumers and making sure that the producers of those commodities get adequately paid for their work .
The producers who get the worst payment for their work are often the workers , but small businesspeople also often put in long hours for little or uncertain returns .
This is especially true if they face direct competition from large retailers , who have their own means of reducing costs .
In a profit - driven system , it can be extremely difficult to reconcile the interests of consumers , workers , and small business owners in the face of large corporations .
One of the ways to overcome this dilemma is to promote various forms of shared ownership .
In worker coops , the workers are co-owners of the business and can decide among themselves how to distribute revenue between wages , profit ( shared among co-owners , i.e. , themselves ) and investment .
In community gardens , people produce food for themselves and are thus producers and consumers in one ( sometimes referred to as “ prosumers ” ) .
In customer - owned utilities , the customers are co-owners and can collectively decide how much to charge themselves for the use of electric power , and how to allocate the net revenue between profits ( shared out among themselves ) and investments .
In all such ventures , the co-owners can collectively decide how much environmental and social goals are worth to them .
They are not bound to put profits first like corporations are , and can choose to make these ventures into part of their lives lived as art .
City governments can support such ventures through appropriate business incubators and by facilitating the process of obtaining necessary permits .
This piece has focused on the basic idea of how to promote abundance in cities ; in the future , I hope to write some more contributions about specific examples .
But in the meantime , I encourage you to read other contributions to shareable .
net and think about how all those initiatives are helping all people , now and in the future , to live life as art , creating greater abundance !
Being a Comfortable " Other "
You live in a world where , from a young age , girls are taught that their appearance is valued above anything else .
Girls must live up to this standard or the ridicule that follows will be a deserved consequence .
“ Too much advertising depicts women , and to a lesser extent men , as just pretty objects .
Flip through the pages of Vanity Fair or even GQ , and you ca n’t help but feel all there is to life is pouting your lips , sucking your cheeks in , and looking pretty .
Preferably with an off - camera fan blowing your generously conditioned locks , ” says Paul Venables , founder of the San Francisco advertising agency Venables Bell & Partners .
He ’s talking about the growing societal problem that is the objectification of women .
We need more realistic and positive images of women in the media .
End of story .
As a girl growing up in the twenty - first century , constantly surrounded by advertisements , movies , songs , and more , referring to my gender , I ’ve begun to notice this problem more and more .
Seeing these repeated negative images of women in the media makes those images seem like the right way to be .
Could the increasing number of ditzy women on air be increasing the number of ditzy women ?
Could the rising number of advertisements featuring huge breasts and tiny waists be contributing to the rising number of my friends who may have eating disorders ?
And could the constant bombardment of “ Be like this , ” “ Be like her , ” “ Be skinny , ” “ Be popular , ” “ Be dumb , ” be the reason behind self - consciousness and the desire to be like that , to be like her , to be skinny , popular , dumb ?
Could it ?
Renowned scientists and doctors agree that low self - esteem , poor body image , depression , perfectionism , and rigid thinking patterns can lead to anorexia in adolescent girls .
All of these are things that can come from viewing negative images of women in the media .
Studies have shown that even a small exposure to these types of images can cause immediate drops in self - esteem , positive body images , and happiness .
Rigid thinking patters can come in the form of stereotypes that girls feel the need to conform to , and the idea of perfectionism collides with the idea of the “ perfect ” body .
Really , what is that ?
Does anyone have the “ perfect ” physique , hair , eyes , nose , face , breasts , everything ?
Whose job is it to decide what the “ perfect ” person is like ?
We look at the outcome of whatever godly planning meeting decided this , in every from of media , everyday .
But who decided ?
Why are we mindlessly following these people who we do not know , these stereotypes of what we should be ?
Why are they forced upon us ?
Why do we allow them to be forced upon us ?
As I go from childhood , to teendom , to adulthood , I have questions about myself , life , the world I live in .
We all do .
We have all asked ourselves , gazing at some form of “ beautiful ” or “ perfect ” person in the media , “ Is that how I ’m supposed to be ? ”
We are looking to the unrealistic images in the media for role models that will allow us to discover our own realistic images .
Really , the models on television should not be our looking glass into the real world .
Our chance to find role models should be a day - to - day look at the strong , powerful women that exist in our society .
These are the images that should be publicized .
The facts that we should receive should not be the ones that sell size zeros , not the ones that make anything else “ fat , ” not the ones that make girls feel ugly for achieving academically .
Those are not the facts that we need to take in , in this time of growth in our lives .
Instead , we should get facts that empower both girls and their role models .
In my experience , adolescent girls are at an age during which they are finding themselves .
They look to each other , and , when peers do not know all the answers , they look to the media .
When we watch TV , we look at the way the pretty heroine walks , talks , dresses .
We might try on her persona , walking her walk and talking her talk .
Of course , when the women that we are shadowing breaks the dress code on a daily basis and act as dumb as anything , following them does not help us to grow .
It affects us negatively .
This is something that I feel personally affected by .
In sixth grade , I tried to be myself by being out of the box , by being anything but what I saw in the media .
Looking back , I realize that this is a separate persona projected by the media .
There ’s “ perfect ” and there ’s “ other . ”
There are also those who fit neatly into “ trying to be perfect . ”
As we look to the media for advice , “ trying to be perfect ” is what most of us become .
Only recently do I feel like I have grown up into myself , a comfortable “ other , ” though not the negative “ other ” projected by television and advertising .
I realized that “ perfect ” is entirely fictional .
I now wear clothes because I like them , not because Selena Gomez ’s stylist does or does not .
I feel like I have overcome some pressure from the media , but it will always be there .
One must be strong and continually try to overcome it .
When facing all these facts , which , in reality , bombard us every day , in the media , it becomes quite clear that the objectification of women is a problem that needs to be fixed .
This will take effort from all of us : the advertising community , women , men , everyone .
Some people who have been making a commendable effort are socially responsible advertising agencies like Venables Bell & Partners .
Venables said that his firm values talent over looks .
“ From my perspective , ” he laughed , “ rejecting pretty faces in favor of real people who have real talent is kind of a fun part of the job . ”
Those who are directly involved in the media are not the only ones who can do good .
At this point , you are probably wondering what you can do to help .
First of all , spread the word .
When girls and boys , men and women , understand that there are still problems in our society with the objectification and degradation of women , they will want to help .
A raised awareness is one of our most powerful weapons .
Also , products and companies that use advertisements that unrealistically or negatively depict women should be notified of the severe problems with this .
Write a petition .
Call in .
Anything and everything helps .
Advertising agencies and other forms of media are not out to get women , though hurtful projections of women may make it seem this way .
Tell them what they ’re doing wrong , and , chances are , they ’ll want to stop , and make it right .
Finally , do your best to remain unaffected by negative images of women in the media .
Do not allow stereotypes , negative expectations , or anything else to get the better of you .
Do n’t believe in stereotypes ; believe in yourself .
Do n’t look up to airbrushed and enhanced female role models ; look to your mom , older sister , or best friend .
And do n’t fall in love with the “ perfect ” everything ; fall in love with you .

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration adopted its so - called " meatball " logo in 1959 .
With NASA 's work and mission changing , is it time for a new logo ?
Half a century later , the designers at design firm Base decided the meatball was a bit out of date and took it upon themselves to design a new one .
Their company blog says they were faced with the question , " If you could redesign any brand , which would it be ? "
Their answer was NASA , so they set out to produce " Something that on a very basic , universal level was about what NASA is and does . "
Here are their designs , compiled into one image by The Daily What :
Base , which produced the designed unsolicited and most likely for the publicity , explains their philosophy in the redesign :
The first thing we see in NASA 's previous logos is that perennial truth that what looks futuristic today looks passe tomorrow .
And of course tomorrow comes faster today than it did yesterday .
We also wanted to avoid anything that would be too techy -- NASA is n't about technology ; it 's about using technology as a vehicle for doing and going and discovering .
So we went with a fairly neutral typeface that wo n't look immediately dated .
But we also wanted to de-emphasize the name in the logo to create more of a symbol that would be universally understood .
So we eclipse the name with a giant sphere , which could be Earth or any other planet .
In this way , we do n't get rid of the " meatball " ; it 's still there , you just do n't see it .

Popular mobile VoIP and chat client Fring has updated its mobile app to add support for 2 - way video calling for the iPhone 4 .
You might be brushing off this feature because the new iPhone has FaceTime , but the Fring app has two big advantages over Apple 's video calling feature : 3G support and compatibility across multiple platforms .
Fring launched video calls on iPhone last year , giving iPhone 3GS users a simple way to make calls , although 2 - way video calling was n't possible because the 3GS did n't have a front - facing camera .
Earlier this year , the company brought 3G video calling to market .
Today 's update finally makes Fring compatible with 2 - way video calling on the iPhone 4 .
While it 's easier to initiate or receive a FaceTime call , the company is betting that people will use Fring because it allows them to call friends without an iPhone 4 — one of the big restrictions to FaceTime .
Fring 's 3G connectivity also addresses another shortcoming of Apple 's video calling feature : it only works on Wi-Fi .
Put it all together , and it means you can use Fring to call your friend with the Evo while you 're driving across the country , though we do n't recommend it for many reason .
Since FaceTime will eventually be an open platform , we hope that Fring will integrate FaceTime into its mobile apps , making video calls across multiple devices a seamless experience .
FRANK COMMISSION GIVES DEFICIT HAWKS A HAND ….
It came together largely under the radar , but Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) helped create a task force on Pentagon spending , featuring a team of credible defense experts .
They ’ve reached some interesting conclusions .
A panel commissioned by Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) is recommending nearly $ 1 trillion in cuts to the Pentagon ’s budget during the next 10 years .
The Sustainable Defense Task Force , a commission of scholars from a broad ideological spectrum appointed by Frank , the House Financial Services Committee chairman , laid out actions the government could take that could save as much as $ 960 billion between 2011 and 2020 .
Measures presented by the task force include making significant reductions to the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter program , which has strong support from Defense Secretary Robert Gates ; delaying the procurement of a new midair refueling tanker the Air Force has identified as one of its top acquisition priorities ; and reducing the Navy ’s fleet to 230 ships instead of the 313 eyed by the service .
Among the other possible cuts are savings from reducing the U.S. nuclear arsenal , and reducing U.S. routine military presence in Europe and Asia .
Frank continues to present this approach in the context of priorities and choices — policymakers could agree to these defense cuts without undermining our national security interests , or policymakers interested in reducing the deficit can raise taxes and cut already - short - changed domestic investments .
What ’s more , this need not be considered a partisan exercise .
As The Hill noted , “ Frank requested the creation of the task force in cooperation with Reps .
Walter Jones ( R - N.C. ) and Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) and Sen. Ron Wyden ( D - Ore . ) . ”
There ’s little reason for optimism on this front ; far too many policymakers consider the Pentagon budget entirely off - limits , despite the fact that the United States now spends about as much on defense as every other country on the planet combined .
For a Congress so concerned about deficits that it ’s willing to let unemployment benefits expire for struggling families , it ’s hardly outrageous to think some budget savings can be found in the enormous Pentagon budget .
That said , Frank ’s commission does offer alleged deficit hawks an opportunity to rise to the occasion .
As Paul Waldman recently explained , “ They ’re quite happy to borrow hundreds of billions to spend on defense , because they just happen to like spending money on defense … .
You ca n’t call yourself a ‘ deficit hawk ’ if the only programs you want to cut are the ones you do n’t like anyway . ”
Defense Secretary Robert Gates has said , publicly and repeatedly , that the United States can’t keep spending such vast amounts of money on the military indefinitely .
Any chance conservative deficit hawks — the ones who claim to be desperate to cut government spending — will step up and agree ?

World cricket is set for a serious political rift over the nomination of John Howard , the former Australian prime minister , as the president - designate of the ICC .
The cricket boards of South Africa and Zimbabwe are leading an initiative to block Howard 's nomination , while Australia and New Zealand , who jointly nominated him , stand behind their man .
Four votes are needed to block Howard 's nomination and it is believed that , barring some dramatic late changes , his candidature will not be a formality .
The BCCI 's position is expected to play crucial role in the issue .
David Morgan , the president of the ICC , is scheduled on Thursday to meet Sharad Pawar , who takes over the presidency next month , and is expected to discuss the matter .
Cricket South Africa has taken up the matter in the strongest of manners , accusing David Morgan , the ICC president , of ignoring the sentiments of an " overwhelming number of ICC directors " who were opposed to Howard 's candidature .
Morgan has also been accused of making the matter a personal cause .
The ICC follows a policy of regional rotation for its presidency and this year was the turn of Australia and New Zealand .
Howard , a career politician and self - declared cricket tragic , beat off a strong challenge from New Zealand Cricket , which favoured John Anderson , a former chairman of the board and a long - time cricket administrator , to win the nomination for the term , which starts from 2012 .
He was due to serve as vice - president to Pawar for the next two years .
As it turns out , though , a section of the ICC board has strong reservations about Howard .
Zimbabwe Cricket has made no secret of its opposition to a man who was so critical of it when he was prime minister and is certain to vote against him if the matter reaches that point .
Morgan has strongly defended his position in an email exchange with Mtutuzeli Nyoka , the CSA president .
He is believed to made it clear that he had no personal agenda and that he had acted according to the ICC constitution .
He is expected to vigorously defend Nyoka 's charge and is understood to have reminded his fellow directors that their job is to act in the best interests of ICC members , and not pursue personal agendas .
Howard , it will be stressed , was selected by New Zealand and Cricket Australia as part of the ICC 's constitutional process , and therefore Morgan has not acted unconstitutionally
For the record , the ICC is playing down the issue .
" The board has not yet discussed the matter , " its chief executive , Haroon Lorgat , told Cricinfo . "
What you might be hearing might have happened on the sidelines but it was not discussed at the board meeting .
The process is that Australia and New Zealand nominate someone , followed by the board considering the nomination before putting it before the annual conference .
It is a three - step process .
" It [ the opposition to Howard 's nomination ] is speculative at this moment .
We have n't yet faced such a scenario ; it has not been blocked as yet , nor even considered . "
Asked what would happen if the nomination was rejected , Lorgat said : " We will probably go back and ask ( the same region ) for another nomination .
But that has never happened and what you are saying is speculative . "
Meanwhile , Cricket Australia stood firmly behind its man .
" We remain rock solid in our support of the nomination , " Peter Young , the CA spokesperson , told Cricinfo .
" CA and NZC undertook an exhaustive professional process and have come up with a joint nomination that we are convinced is the best possible nomination we could put forward .
We will continue to be welded on in our joint support of that nomination .
We have made that clear to the ICC in recent weeks . "
Australia 's position received unqualified backing from New Zealand cricket .
" We certainly have n't heard any notification from ICC that there 's a problem with that .
We 're certainly not contemplating any other scenarios than John Howard being our man , " Justin Vaughan , the NZC chief executive , said .
" We believe we went through a very robust and thorough process .
We believe ICC should accept that and accept the nomination . "
The matter may come down to the neutrals and the ECB offered a non-committal comment on the situation .
" It 's up to New Zealand Cricket and Cricket Australia to nominate a candidate and we as the ECB will await that nomination at the ICC annual conference , " an ECB spokesman said .
The sense of what is at stake was summed up by Ijaz Butt , the PCB chairman .
" This is a very sensitive issue right now so I do n't want to discuss it , " Butt said .
" I know John Howard personally and I know how much he loves the sport and the game . "

Limited reach , the kangaroo
Why do kangaroos have such small arms ?
Scientists now think they know why , helping to explain why the unusually - shaped marsupials have tiny arms yet such long legs .
Kangaroos have small forelimbs because short arms are necessary to survive within their mother 's pouch soon after they are born , a new analysis confirms .
This need to crawl at an early age constrained the evolution of marsupial body shapes , leading to the animals we see today , scientists say .
The research also provides intriguing clues as to why there are no marsupials with flippers or wings .
The study is published in the Australian Journal of Zoology .
Arm 's length Compared to placental mammals , marsupials such as kangaroos are born at an early stage of foetal development .
They end up ' stuck ' with this forelimb shape in later life
Dr Jim Copper
Syracuse University , New York , US
Once born they immediately climb or crawl in the pouch to their mother 's teat using unusually well developed forelimbs .
" It occurred to me that this type of birth strategy could have constrained the evolutionary diversification of their forelimb shapes , " says Dr Jim Cooper of Syracuse University , New York in the US .
" The idea is that since they need the forelimbs to climb across their mother 's belly at birth , they end up ' stuck ' with this forelimb shape in later life , " he says .
The idea is not new , being first proposed in the 1970s .
But the predictions of this so - called " constraint hypothesis " had never been tested .
So Dr Cooper worked with Professor Scott Steppan from Florida State University in Tallahassee , US , to design a study to do just that .
Stunted Using skeletons of an extensive range of mammals from various scientific and museum collections , the researchers measured and compared their different body shapes , mapping the diversity of limb proportions between marsupial and placental mammals .
That revealed that the evolution of marsupial forelimbs has indeed been constrained compared to those of placental mammals .

" We now know that marsupial forelimb shape has been evolving at a much slower rate in comparison to their sister group , the placental mammals . "
" If they can't make the crawl , then they do n't survive , so the importance of having ' good climbing forelimbs ' trumps the importance of having good running forelimbs . "
That also explains why kangaroos have such long hind limbs .
" We also know the rate of hind limb shape evolution has not been slower among the marsupials . "
That is because the development of hind legs were not constrained by life in the pouch .
So they are able to grow long to enable kangaroos to hop fast , compensating for the lack of effective front legs that can be used for four - legged running .
Missing marsupial
The constraint hypothesis may also explain why marsupials have never taken to the air or water , as their forelimbs cannot evolve into structures capable of flying or swimming .
" This concept has profound implications for answering such questions as ' why are there no marsupial bats or whales ? ' " says Dr Cooper .

" The stronger the support for this hypothesis , then the more certain we are that we can explain the root cause of this major evolutionary pattern . "

The process started on Wednesday evening , after a delay during which the Admiral gave permission for the process to start , and held the press conference that I reported on yesterday .
The picture that everyone has long been waiting to see became available after 3:25 pm ( Eastern ) yesterday afternoon , when BP closed the choke lines on the 3 - ram stack , and oil stopped flowing into the Gulf .
It was followed by the Kent Wells ' conference , which had been delayed , in which he noted that the relief well had finished a gyro survey to locate its position , and prepared the site for the casing to be set this weekend .
Then the drill pipe etc. was pulled back into the casing while the integrity test was run .
It was left in the well so that , in case there was any passage created between the two wells during the test ( they are only just over four feet apart ) , then heavy mud could be immediately pumped down the RW to kill the risk of any additional problems .
( The drill has 30 ft to go to reach the casing point , but is at the desired 2 degree angle ) .
One of the changes to the plan from that originally conceived was to add four ROVs that would be stationed around the well to alleviate the fears of those who had become worried by the continuing plethora of stories of a breached well casing .
Although many of these stories have been discussed , and their invalidity shown , nevertheless in order to keep everyone happy ( particularly those with political prominence ) , four ROVs were set around the well to watch the seabed and ensure there were no leaks .
This is one example of the results – the seabed is stable , with no oil and gas bubbling up from non-existent leaks .
( BOA ROV 2 )
Had there been any leakage from the well it would likely have come up around the casing of the well at the bottom .
Here is the shot ( BOA ROV 1 ) of the mud-line of the well .
( The point where the well breaks through the mud to the sea bed ) .
As you can see , there is none .
( The well casing with the BOP above it are just to the right of the lights of the illuminating ROV . )
The other change that Secretary Chu apparently imposed was that there be a conference every six hours during the test ( which is scheduled to run 48 hours ) .
The initial plan was to close the rams sealing the well ( which happened before I wrote the post yesterday ) and then to close the kill line ( the two ports that produced the vertical jets I showed last evening ) and then to slowly ( over a few minutes ) close the choke , monitoring the pressure , until the flow ceased .
There should also be a little clarity in the discussion at this point .
There are two sets of valves and circuits involved in this process .
The first of these are the circuits on the original blowout preventer ( BOP ) .
The kill and choke lines attached to those circuits were modified so that oil and gas are fed through them to the vessels on the surface which are either collecting or burning off the fuel .
The second set of kill and choke valves are on the new stack that was mounted above the BOP , and it is these new valves that are being opened and closed .
When the stack valves are open , the oil flows out into the water , rather than into directed lines , and so they are not the same circuits .
At the beginning of the test the BOP valves were closed , so that all the flow went up to the stack where it can flow out through either the drill pipe at the top , the kill lines to the side , or the choke line – which is the curved yellow pipe at the top of the well .
The drill pipe flow was first closed , using the central ram in the stack .
As the test began ( and as Kent Wells noted in the morning briefing Thursday ) that there was a leak .
. . . we noticed a leak on a hub on the choke line .
And so when we saw that , that would have precluded us from properly doing the test , we needed to get that fixed .
Fortunately , as everything , we always plan so we had a second choke on surface .
So we disconnected that choke and hub system .
Took it up , brought the other one down , landed it this morning and we ’re once again going through the process of positioning ourselves to do the well integrity tests .
There were in fact two trips to the surface before the choke line was fully in place .
The well was then ready to ramp up for the test , and this was the schedule that Kent Wells reported in the afternoon briefing Thursday :
At 10:30 this morning we closed the kill line and since we had already had the middle ram of the capping stack closed that meant the only flow at that point was going out through the choke line and what was also being collected through the Q4000 and the helix producer .
Then between 10:30 and 12:30 we shut down the Q4000 , we shut down the helix producer and that meant only flow was going up through the choke line and then at 12:30 we started to close the choke , we would do it a half a turn at a time to just slowly start to close the well in .
And at about 1:15 this afternoon we issued that the integrity test was starting .
The official time of the choke being fully closed , which meant the well was fully shut in is approximately 2:25 this afternoon and as of that time there is no flow of oil going into the gulf of Mexico .
So obviously this is an encouraging point of time .
Remember this is the start of our test .
So the well is currently shut - in , though the results have not been all that had been hoped for .
Admiral Allen has already issued a terse comment :
" We 're encouraged by this development , but this is n't over .
Over the next several hours we will continue to collect data and work with the federal science team to analyze this information and perform additional seismic mapping runs in the hopes of gaining a better understanding on the condition of the well bore and options for temporary shut in of the well during a hurricane .
It remains likely that we will return to the containment process using this new stacking cap connected to the risers to attempt to collect up to 80,000 barrels of oil per day until the relief well is completed . "
Part of the problem , apparently , is that the well pressure has not reached the 8 - 9,000 psi level that it was hoped it would reach , but instead it is reported to have fallen slightly shy of 7,000 psi .
While this is below the expectation , it is higher than the 6,000 psi that Admiral Allen had set as the target below which they would assume a loss in integrity , and restart the flow of oil to the surface vessels .
To try and add a little context to this , at the beginning of the leak , the pressure of the oil and gas in the rock at the bottom of the well was measured at 11,900 psi .
When the oil and gas fill the well that fluid column has a certain weight that balances some of the rock pressure , and the difference should be the pressure at the top of the column ( which is where the BOP and stack sit ) .
That gives the 8 – 9,000 psi range .
If the well pressure at the BOP is measured , however , at just shy of 7,000 psi then there are two possibilities .
The first is that there has been so much flow of fluid out of the well that the driving pressure of the fluid in the rock has fallen by the 1,500 psi or so that brings the pressures down to those seen .
While that is a possibility , it may be unlikely because , at the time that the Top Kill was tried and as the Admiral noted just the other day , the well pressure could not be raised above 6,000 psi as they pumped in mud , even though at one stage they stopped the flow of oil out of the well .
What this could indicate is that there is a possibility of crossflow at the bottom of the well .
What this means that the oil and gas that are flowing out of the reservoir into the bottom of the well , are , under the pressure in the well , now flowing into a higher reservoir of rock , now that they can't get out of the well .
Depending on where that re-injection flow is , this may , or may not , suggest that the casing has lost integrity .
This is a topic that has been covered in the comments at The Oil Drum , where fdoleza has noted :
Exactly .
I believe the flow will be coming out of the bottom sand and going into the upper sand .
It would not be a leak , but it would tell them why their pressure data ai n't a classical surface buildup .
And I sure hope they 're modeling temperatures and so on , because this is a very interesting case .
They do n't have downhole gauges , so they 'll have to take the way the oil cools down as it sits to get a better idea of the way things are moving down below .
If there are questions whether there is still flow in the formation or from the original formation into surrounding rock , then it is possible that the relief well ( RW ) is close enough to the original well ( WW ) that putting a set of very sensitive microphones down the RW might allow some triangulation to estimate where such a flow might be occurring .
It might make it easier that the well has n’t been finally cased yet .
But the test has 2 days to run , and will be evaluated every 6 hours .
With time some of these questions may be answered as the test continues .
( If there is no flow anywhere , after a while all the readings should become quite stable ) .
Oh , and just as this started to look like a little good news , there is this from the National Hurricane Center :
The windows of opportunity are not likely to remain open long .
It is encouraging , however , that there may now be an answer if these do turn into hurricanes .
A Israeli soldier is to face charges over the shooting of two Palestinian women during Operation Cast lead in Gaza a year and a half ago , the army said on Wednesday .
Open gallery view An IDF soldier during the Gaza war Credit : ( Archive )
The solider will be charged with opening fire on a 64 - year - old Raya Salma Abu Hajjaj and her 35 - year - old daughter Majda in disregard of the IDF 's rules of engagement .
Chief Army Prosecutor Avihai Mandelblit will on June 22 hold a hearing to determine the exact charges the soldier will face .
The unusually strong phrasing of the summons to the hearing , which includes the word ' killing ' , leaves open the possibility of a manslaughter charge , or a lesser charge of negligence .
The soldier , identified only as First Seargent S. , said during an army investigation that he had fired at the women's legs only when he believed troops ' lives to be at risk and had not intended to kill them .
But Palestinian eyewitnesses to the shooting south of Gaza city on January 4 , 2009 , said the women were among a group of civilians waving white flags .
Sergeant S. was part of a combined force of Givati and armored brigades which had entered a built up area when it identified a group of around 30 Palestinians walking towards them , apparently after being ordered by the IDF to evacuate their homes in a neighboring area .
A deputy battalion commander ordered troops to fire warning shots towards the group - but not at them .
Soon after the order was given , two Givati brigade soldiers joined the troops .
One of them , S. , opened fire , killing the two women .
Investigators found that the battalion commander had acted properly .
The case is expected to center on how much S. knew of the circumstances and the commander 's orders when he arrived at the scene .
The fatal incident was first investigated following reports by B'Tselem , an Israeli human rights organization , and was later mentioned in a UN report by former South African jurist Richard Goldstone , which accused both Israel and Hamas with war crimes .
If S. is charged , he will be the third soldier to be tried for offenses during the Gaza war .
Some 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed during Israel 's three - week war on Hamas in late 2008 and early 2009 .
Earlier this year , Israel submitted its response to the UN report .
Defense Minister Ehud Barak said at the time :
" This report stresses that the IDF is like no other army , both from a moral standpoint as well as from a professional standpoint . "
Barak said : " All of the soldiers and officers whom we sent to battle need to know that the state of Israel stands behind them even on the day after . "
A Roman Catholic priest in Connecticut has been arrested on charges he stole $ 1.3 million in church money over seven years to use for male escorts , expensive clothing , and luxury hotels and restaurants .
Waterbury police say the 64 - year - old Rev. Kevin J. Gray was charged Tuesday with first - degree larceny .
Gray is the former pastor at Sacred Heart / Sagrado Corazon Parish in Waterbury .

The Hartford Archdiocese last month asked police to investigate after it discovered during a financial review that he might have taken more than a million dollars for personal use .
Gray was Sacred Heart ’s pastor from January 2003 until April 15 , when he was granted a medical leave .
He was later suspended but still lives there .

I hear about the race riot at Daddy ’s Money almost as soon as I arrive on Grand Isle , Louisiana .
My friend and I are going to the bar tonight to catch the “ female oil wrestling ” oil - spill cleanup workers have been packing in to see on Saturday nights .
When we stop by the office of the island ’s biggest seafood distributor , he tells us that two days ago a bunch of black guys and a bunch of white guys got into a big fight at the bar .
It spilled out all over the street and had to be broken up by a ton of cops .
According to the Census , 1,541 people live in this slow Southern resort town .
An estimated 3 percent of them are black .
That was before the spill .
The seafood guy gestures in the direction of the floating barracks being built on barges in the bay to house the lower - skilled cleanup workers , and says that people think the barracks will keep those workers — who are mostly black — from “ jumping off ” onto dry land and causing trouble .
That night , dozens of men in race - segregated packs crowd around to watch strippers dance around and then tussle inside the bouncy inflatable ring set up inside Daddy ’s Money .
Female oil wrestlers need , obviously , to be oiled .
Plastic cups full of baby oil are being auctioned off , along with the right to rub their contents all over one of the thong - bikinied gals .
“ I hope there ’s no dispersant in that oil ! ” someone quips .
The bidding before the first match starts at $ 10 ; it ends pretty quickly when some kid offers $ 100 .
“ He outbid me ! ” the guy next to me yells .
His name is Cortez .
He bid $ 80 .
He has dollar bills tucked all the way around under the brim of his hat , and piles of them in his fist .
He has spent $ 200 of his $ 1,000 paycheck already tonight .
“ I am coming here every Saturday from now on , ” he says .
He gestures expansively at the scene — writhing women ; hollering , money - throwing men .
“ Sponsored by BP ! ” he yells , laughing , then throws his arms around me and grabs my ass .
Upstairs , on the open - air deck , the supervisors and professional contractors drink .
One comes over to talk ; he calls me a Yankee when I do n’t get that when he says “ animals ” he means black guys .
Another tells us about the crime - prone “ monkeys . ”
I have already stopped counting how many times I ’ve heard the n-word on Grand Isle today .
Back downstairs , the testosterone is still spewing .
It ’s not just the men screaming at the now - topless girls rolling around trying to pin each other to the floor .
An ex-Army Ranger so drunk he can hardly stand asks me if I have a boyfriend .
When I lie and say that I do and he ’s right over there somewhere , the Ranger scowls and pushes me .
I move to the other side of the ring , where some guy wraps a tight grip around my waist .
“ You can have some of BP ’s money too if you let me make love to you , ” he says .
“ I ’m not a prostitute , ” I inform him , backing up to create some space between our pelvises , but he presses an insistent forearm harder into the small of my back .
“ I ’m not trying to play you like a prostitute , ” he says .
“ I ’m just saying : Whatever it takes . ”
I extract myself with a firm fist to his chest .
Two Grand Isle girls who are the only other non-strippers in the bar are trying to inch away from a teetering drunk who wo n’t take his hands off them and is encouraging them to get in the ring .
I turn around to see if an Interior Department firefighter I talked to earlier , who seems like a nice guy in that he offered to buy me dinner rather than offering money to have sex with him , is still behind me .
Just in case .
Because he ’s a hero he steps in and tells the teetering guy to back off .
“ That ’s my wife , ” he says , towering over the drunk and pointing at one of the girls .
“ I do n’t care , ” the teetering guy says .
That ’s where it ends .
The fireman has a thick four - inch - long scar behind his ear where he was once hit with a bottle ; he does n’t start bar fights anymore .
Which is a lucky thing for his coworkers , because he ’s a very buff Pawnee , and he ’s sick of them calling him “ Tonto , ” “ Chief , ” and “ Indian Joe . ”
The near - desperate levels of racial and sexual aggression in this horde are n’t what you usually get at a strip show in a bar .
It feels more like a strip show in a prison yard .
My friend says he ’s leaving because he can’t bear to be here with all the stupidity and “ stale testosterone ” anymore .
He returns from the bar across the street within 10 minutes .
He walked in and walked right back out ; it was the same scene .
Last week , someone was stabbed there .
Upstairs , one of the cleanup supervisors announces that a nearby Canadian engineer has n’t had any pussy in 10 days , and could die .
The guys say there ’s an old Vietnamese lady with a notebook full of available hookers ’ ages and races who wanders the cleanup workers ’ haunts , but she ’s not here right now .
Anyway , the workers are forbidden from bringing hookers into the houses and hotel rooms their employers are putting them up in , under threat of being fired .
“ How long are you going to be here ? ” I ask the contractor who ’s worried about the sexless Canadian .
“ We are n’t leaving till this is all clean , ” he answers , “ we ” being M - I SWACO , a cleanup contractor that just built a giant orange - pipe - jumble sand - washing machine on the beach ( and which is not to be confused with the contractors who are doing only “ window dressing ” operations , as one of the other supervisors at the bar describes his job ) .
M-I SWACO is not just going to polish the destruction off the surface .
They ’re going to have oiled sand from all over the island brought in by the truckload , then dig out the contaminated layers , wash it , and put it back , at least 40 tons of sand an hour .
They ’re going to save this place .
“ We ’ll be here as long as oil keeps washing up , ” the contractor says .
“ So … ” I laugh sort of helplessly .
“ A year ? ”
“ Three years … ” he says .
“ Five years … ”
“ Hopefully forever , ” the guy next to him says .
“ I need this job if I ca n’t work offshore anymore . ”
Last week , the emcee that accompanies the oil wrestlers yelled into the microphone , “ Let that oil gush !
Let that money flow ! ”
The workers — part of the new Grand Isle scenery of helicopters , Hummers , and National Guardsmen , serious people in uniforms and coveralls and work boots — the workers around the wrestling ring , drunk and blowing cash from jobs that might kill them , cheered .
This morning 's subway paper in New York .
Apple 's iPhone 4 antenna problem is clearly not going away overnight , despite Apple 's best wishes ( and best attempts to censor ) .
Will it result in a massive product recall ?
( We doubt it .
In fact , we think this is a non-issue that will blow over . )
Even a week ago , we may have laughed off the idea .
But now that Consumer Reports has come down hard on Apple over the issue ( deciding not to recommend buying the phone , despite also calling it the best smartphone on the market ; figure that out ) the antenna issue is front page news .
And suddenly , everyone 's talking about the possibility of an iPhone 4 recall .
PR experts are obviously talking about a recall .
“ Apple will be forced to do a recall of this product , ” Professor Matthew Seeger , " an expert in crisis communication , " told CultofMac.com .
“ It ’s critically important .
The brand image is the most important thing Apple has .
This is potentially devastating . ”
“ Apple needs to put this fire out now , ” Dr. Larry Barton , a " leading expert in crisis management and author of Crisis Leadership Now , " also told CultofMac.com .
“ There has to be a military - like response to this issue .
And we have not seen this kind of urgency . ”
Even Apple 's super - fans are talking about a potential recall .
Instapaper creator Marco Arment writes , " To fix the problems , Apple will need to replace , redesign , or relocate the proximity sensor and prevent electrical conductivity between the antenna sections ( possibly with an insulating coating on the steel ) .
They can do this with a mid-cycle hardware revision , but they ’d face an even more massive PR disaster ( and a potential class - action suit ) if they did n’t recall all iPhone 4s sold so far for replacement with the fixed models .
It would need to be an unconditional ( but probably optional ) recall . "
And the mainstream tech press is flexing the R - word , too .
" Apple should recall the iPhone 4 and start disseminating new phones with properly coated antennas -- and I 'm not talking duct tape or neon - colored rubber bands , " CNET 's Molly Wood writes .
Your move , Steve .
Do n't miss : 10 Things We Love And Hate About The iPhone 4
Since his arrival last offseason , Minnesota Wild General Manager Chuck Fletcher has made no secret about how he wants to build his team around Mikko Koivu Anytime he was asked about the status of his franchise , Fletcher named Koivu first among the names of talented players that can carry this team .
He and Head Coach Todd Richards named Koivu the first - ever permanent team captain last October .
When asked about his plans for this offseason , Fletcher listed his top priority as signing Koivu to an extension .
Done deal .
On Thursday , the Wild inked the 2001 first round pick to a seven - year extension , meaning Koivu will be a member of the Wild through the 2017 - 2018 campaign when he 's 35 years old .
" It 's a milestone day in the history of the Minnesota Wild , " said Fletcher minutes after seeing the signed deal on his desk .
" When you have your franchise player commit to you , really for the next eight seasons .
He 's our best hockey player .
He 's our captain .
And he 's still just 27 with his best hockey years ahead of him .
" Fletcher 's obvious excitement was matched by Koivu , who said he considers Minnesota to be his second home .
" Everybody has treated myself and my family and friends always first class , " he said , specifically noting Wild fans , the organization , coaches , trainers and more .
" I really feel Minnesota is my home .
That was the biggest point when we started .
I 'm happy to be there and to be a member of the Wild .
" He then added a statement that should be music to the ears of the folks in the State of Hockey , who are as provincial as they come .
" I 'll be a Minnesota guy for the next eight years , and it feels good .
" Koivu is coming off a career year last season in which he tallied 71 points on 22 goals and 49 assists .
His assist and point totals led the team , as did his multi- point games ( 20 ) .
He played in all but two games , and helped Team Finland to a bronze medal finish at the 2010 Olympics , his second Olympic appearance .
His stats are one thing , but what set Koivu apart in the eyes of the Wild staff was his leadership , and his competitiveness .
Fletcher knew he was inheriting a good hockey player , but he did n't know just how many intagibles Koivu brings to the club .
" I do n't think I realized how competitive he is on the ice .
He is not a flashy player , but he truly is a dominant power center in the NHL .
" The Koivu signing continues a summer of accomplishments for Fletcher .
He wanted to reach deals with restricted free agents that included Guillaume Latendresse and Josh Harding .
He wanted to bolster the lineup with skill and toughness , as he did with the acquistions of Matt Cullen , Eric Nystrom and Brad Staubitz .
But his top priority was to reach a long - term deal with Koivu , and he did it two weeks after he was allowed to by the Collective Bargaining Agreement .
"
When I took the job , my primary goal was to sign Koivu , " Fletcher said .
" After 15 months of planning how to go about this , today we were able to accomplish that .
It speaks to the commitment Mikko has made to us .
He showed strong interest in signing with us and both parties are excited about moving forward together .
" Moving forward includes rebounding from two straight years of missing the postseason with new additions and more experience for all of the returning players .
"
Now we can focus on the next season and getting ready for the preseason and Helsinki after that , " he said .
" I 'm excited and I can't wait to get started .
" When asked what he thought of the new additions to the team , he said , " I think it looks good .
" All that 's left now is for Koivu to get healthy .
Following last season , he underwent surgery on his knee and his shoulder .
He says his recover is ahead of schedule .
" I'm very confident I 'll be ready to go when camp starts [ on September 17 ] , " he said .
A team that did n't have a permanent captain for eight years , now has one for the next eight .
And now , Fletcher can focus on a new number one priority , whatever that may be .
Image caption Mr Khan has been invited to Lahore to receive an award for his good deed
A Pakistani hotel employee has won acclaim after handing in over $ 50,000 ( £ 33,000 ) in cash that had been left behind by a guest .
Essa Khan , 51 , discovered the money in $ 100 notes left in the room of a Japanese worker at the Serena Hotel in Gilgit .
Mr Khan , who earns about 21,000 rupees ( $ 235 ; £ 153 ) a month , says he never considered keeping the money .
He has been invited to receive an award from a state governor for his honesty .
" My duty with the hotel and my family upbringing teaches me nothing else , " he said .
" Times are hard for everyone , but that does n't mean we should start stealing and taking things which do not belong to us . "
' Relieved '
The father - of - five says he hopes the incident will help portray his country in a good light .
The Pakistani government has been riddled with accusations of corruption .
" I want people around the world to know that there are many good people in Pakistan - everybody is not a terrorist here . "
Hotel manager Rajid Uddin told the BBC there had been similar instances where lost items had been returned , but none " on this magnitude " .
He said the guest had been relieved when the cash was found .
" He was naturally very worried as he was n't able to figure out where he had lost the money , " he said .
Mr Khan said he had already received an award from the hotel , and that Salman Taseer , the governor of Punjab , had congratulated him and invited him to Lahore for a ceremony .
When academics talk about executive compensation , they usually focus on the mismatch between pay incentives and the interests of shareholders .
Back in 1990 , Michael Jensen and Brian Murphy argued in a famous ( and in some quarters infamous ) HBR article that too many executives were paid “ like bureaucrats ” — that is , that their pay bore little relation to the returns they delivered to shareholders .
Then , after corporate boards responded in the 1990s by loading CEO pay packages with more and more stock options , Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried made the case that top executives had captured the pay - setting process to wrest big rewards for themselves regardless of what happened to shareholders .
In both of these views , executive pay was beset by an agency problem — the agents ( a.k.a. the executives ) had set things up in a way that disadvantaged the principals ( a.k.a , the shareholders ) .
Lately , though , scholars looking into the link between bankers ’ pay and the financial crisis have begun gathering evidence of another problem :
At financial institutions , executives looking out for the best interest of shareholders can rain economic disaster on the rest of us .
I made my first acquaintance with this new line of research at a conference on governance and executive pay in the financial sector last month at Columbia University .
Here ’s a quick rundown of the relevant working papers :
In “ Yesterday ’s Heroes : Compensation and Creative Risk - Taking ” ( pdf ) , Jose Scheinkman and Harrison Hong of Princeton and Ing - Haw Cheng of the University of Michigan studied the link between compensation and risk - taking among financial firms and found that , yeah , CEOs who took bigger risks got paid more .
But there was no evidence that they were putting anything over on shareholders : the high - pay , high - risk firms had high levels of insider ownership , big holdings by institutional investors and did no worse on governance metrics than other firms .
Similarly , in “ Bank CEO Incentives and the Credit Crisis , ” René Stulz of Ohio State and Rüdiger Fahlenbrach of the Swiss Finance Institute found that banks where CEOs incentives were most closely aligned with those of shareholders actually did worse in terms of stock returns and return on equity during the crisis .
In “ The Probability of Default , Excessive Risk , and Executive Compensation : A Study of Financial Services Firms from 1995 to 2008 ” ( pdf ) , Sudhakar Balachandran and Bruce Kogut of Columbia and Hitesh Harnal of UBS found that higher equity - based pay increased the probability of default among the 113 firms they studied , while non-equity pay ( such as cash bonuses ) was correlated with a lower risk of default .
In “ Bank Owners or Bank Managers : Who is Keen on Risk ?
Evidence from the Financial Crisis , ” Reint Gropp of the European Business School and Matthias Köhler of the Center for European Economic Research discovered that banks with more concentrated ownership ( that is , banks where the biggest shareholders were big enough that they — and not managers — presumably called the shots ) “ had higher profits in the years before the crisis , and incurred larger losses and were more likely to require government assistance during the crisis compared to manager - controlled banks . ”
At the conference , Columbia ’s Patrick Bolton talked a little about why this was .
He and Hamid Mehran of the New York Fed and Joel Shapiro of Oxford University are in the early stages of a project ( pdf ) examining the theory of executive compensation and risk - taking .
The gist of their argument is that equity in a highly leveraged firm ( banks and investment banks have debt - to - equity ratios that start at 10 - to - 1 and go much higher ) is equivalent to a call option .
That is , if the firm goes bust the equity holders only lose a little but if it does well they can reap huge rewards .
So shareholders have every incentive to push executives at highly leveraged firms to take big risks ( and executives with big equity stakes have every incentive to take big risks ) .
Given the systemic importance of financial institutions , which causes central banks and governments to bail them out when things go wrong , this is a serious problem — and its one not envisioned in the usual analyses of what ’s wrong with executive pay .
“ Aligning manager interest with shareholder interest does not necessarily mean a sound or socially responsible policy , ” Columbia Law Professor John Coffee said at the conference .
And yet , as Coffee pointed out , a major plank of the financial reform package now being worked out by House and Senate negotiators is a series of reforms intended to give shareholders more say in how corporate managers are rewarded .
Hmmmm .

“ Creepy ! ” said nearly every boy I showed her to ; “ Cool ! ” said the girls , who immediately got the idea of the toy — to make movies from Barbie ’s point of view .
Powered by two AAA batteries ( one in each leg ) , the doll can record up to 30 minutes of Webcam quality AVI video , with a three - button interface .
You can watch your recordings on the doll ’s screen , but with no sound ( “ Hey — there ’s no sound ! ” the testers complained ) .
Or you can transfer them to your Macintosh or Windows computer by way of the included mini-U.S.B. cable .
Because the doll can be posed , she doubles as a pretty good tripod .
One problem :
We drained two sets of batteries by accidentally leaving the recorder on .
Mattel estimates just over an hour of recording time per set .
This is not the first time engineers have been given the challenge of packing Barbie ’s figure with technology .
Michelle Chidoni , a spokeswoman for Mattel , said Barbie has been accessorized with speakers , motors , fiber optic clothing and an impeller - pump designed to push glitterized fluid through special wings .
Today , her 256 MB of onboard memory can capture any sight or sound your child desires .
This composite image shows a powerful microquasar containing a black hole in the outskirts of the nearby ( 12.7 million light years ) galaxy NGC 7793 .
The large image contains data from the Chandra X - ray Observatory in red , green and blue , optical data from the Very Large Telescope in light blue , and optical emission by hydrogen ( " H - alpha " ) from the CTIO 1.5 - m telescope in gold .
The upper inset shows a close - up of the X - ray image of the microquasar , which is a system containing a stellar - mass black hole being fed by a companion star .
Gas swirling toward the black hole forms a disk around the black hole .
Twisted magnetic fields in the disk generate strong electromagnetic forces that propel some of the gas away from the disk at high speeds in two jets , creating a huge bubble of hot gas about 1,000 light years across .
The faint green / blue source near the middle of the upper inset image corresponds to the position of the black hole , while the red / yellow ( upper right ) and yellow ( lower left ) sources correspond to spots where the jets are plowing into surrounding gas and heating it .
The nebula produced by energy from the jets is clearly seen in the H - alpha image shown in the lower inset .
The jets in the NGC 7793 microquasar are the most powerful ever seen from a stellar - mass black hole and the data show that a surprising amount of energy from the black hole is being carried away by the jets , rather than by radiation from material being pulled inward .
The power of the jets is estimated to be about ten times larger than that of the very powerful ones seen from the famous microquasar in our own galaxy , SS433 .
This system in NGC 7793 is a miniature version of the powerful quasars and radio galaxies , which contain black holes that range from millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun .
A paper describing this work is being published in the July 8th , 2010 , issue of Nature .
The authors are Manfred Pakull from the University of Strasbourg in France , Roberto Soria from University College London , and Christian Motch , also from the University of Strasbourg .
Christopher Nolan is well underway with the press interviews for his new movie , Inception which is released in cinemas in the UK 16th July .
His new movie has an all star cast which includes Ellen Page , Marion Cotillard , Joseph Gordon - Levitt , Ken Watanabe , Leonardo DiCaprio , Michael Caine , Tom Berenger , Cillian Murphy , Tom Hardy and Talulah Riley but really all anyone wants to know is , what ’s going on with Batman 3 ?
MTV got the chance to talk with Nolan about the movie which he has told us he ’s hoping will be released in 2012 and has also said that his brother , Jonah Nolan is currently working on the script from the story that he , and David Goyer have written .
I ’ve placed the short snippet from the interview below for your viewing pleasure or you can head over to MTV for the full low - down .

White or brown rice might be a matter of taste .
But people who substitute brown rice for white rice for health reasons may be onto something , a new study from Harvard University implies .
Yet doctors warn that there 's more to this effect than the nutrition in rice alone .
Researchers drew on data from over 200,000 subjects and found that those who ate five or more servings of white rice a week had a 17 percent increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with those who rarely ate white rice .
What 's more , they found that those who ate brown rice regularly were overall less likely to develop diabetes .
With those results , researchers estimated that subbing in a few servings a week of white rice with brown would result in a 16 percent decrease in diabetes risk .
But diet and diabetes experts say these results may have more to do with type of person who tends to prefer brown rice than how the food itself affects health .
" Maybe people who eat brown rice are more health conscious , " said Dr. Charles Clark , professor of medicine at Indiana University School of Medicine .
Because the study can only gauge associations between lifestyle choices and later disease , it 's impossible to tell whether it's the rice that makes a difference or some other shared quality among brown rice eaters , he said .
Indeed , researchers found that brown rice eaters as a group tended to be more physically active , leaner , less likely to smoke , and perhaps most importantly , had a higher intake of fruits , vegetables , and whole grains -- all choices that help lower risk of developing diabetes .
" I think whole grains may be the big player and not brown rice alone , " says Carla Wolper , a researcher at the N.Y. Obesity Research Center .
But making the switch from white to brown rice may be a relatively painless way for Americans to incorporate more whole grains in their diet , says Dr. Walter Willet , a co-author on the study .
This was one of the reasons researchers decided to zero in on this particular grain .
Health Nuts and Brown Rice
Showing that eating whole grains is healthier for you than eating refined grains is nothing new , but given the growing consumption of white rice in the United States and globally , Willett says , this particular diet change is worth looking into .
" When we refine rice , we strip away the majority of many of the nutrients , " says Willett , " including magnesium , chromium and other minerals and vitamins . "
" You 're left with a form of starch that is rapidly broken down , leads to greater spikes in blood sugar , and increases the demand for insulin .
Over time this exhausts the pancreas and leads to diabetes , " he said .
Doctors largely agreed that a whole grain , like brown rice , is better than a refined grain like white rice or white bread .
" The overall consumption of brown rice was relatively low in this population , " said Dr. Carl J. Lavie , medical director of Cardiac Rehabilitation and Prevention at John Ochsner Heart and Vascular Institute in New Orleans .
" Instead of consuming high quantities of white rice , it would be preferable to replace this with either brown rice and even better to replace white rice with other whole grains … " he said .
Clark said brown rice is high in fiber and " diets high in fiber are protective for a number of risks including colon cancer , obesity , and diabetes . "
So adding more whole grains , such as brown rice , is always a good thing .
The fact that those who chose brown rice tended to live more health - conscious lives than white rice eaters exaggerated the reduced risk of diabetes seen in the study , but it does not explain it away , Willett said .
Could the Brown Rice Alone Change Diabetes Risk ?
Researchers controlled for the lifestyle choices that may impact diabetes risk , such as overall diet , exercise level , smoking habits , and a family history of the disease .
Taking into account all these behaviors , the association between brown rice consumption and a lower risk of diabetes was diminished but did not disappear , said Willett .
But those diminished benefits of brown rice alone did not impress all doctors .
Richard Feinman , a professor of Cell Biology at SUNY Downstate Medical Center , called the direct link between eating brown rice and lower diabetes risk " weak . "
" It [ the article ] is written in a technical way that consumers wo n't understand so the limited results are obscured , " said Feinman .
" But the conclusions stated in the abstract are not justified by the results . "
Feinman said by looking at the study , he 'd estimate that 1 person out of 1,000 people who subbed brown rice for white rice would be able to prevent diabetes .
Keith Thomas Ayoob , of Albert Einstein College of Medicine , acknowledged that brown rice alone might have an effect on a person 's risk for diabetes and brown rice is n't a remedy for disease risk .
Ayoob said he does n't want consumers to think that switching to brown rice could replace the other habits necessary for good health such as portion control , exercise , and overall diet .
" I'm all for people swapping out refined grains for whole grains , but the issue of diabetes is more complex than can be seen by this study , " he said .

Alex Petrovic is a defenseman for the Red Deer Rebels of the WHL .
A solid puck mover , Petrovic plays against the top players in the WHL , according to head coach Jesse Wallin .
He 's got good size for a kid his age , and he is n't afraid to use it .
Drafted in 2007 by the Rebels , Petrovic went fist to fist with Dylan McIlrath in the Top Prospects game back in January of this year .
He likes to model his game after Chris Pronger and idolizes Mike Modano .
Alex was the 2nd highest scoring defenseman for the Rebels in 2009 / 10 .
Ranked at the 34th spot at the midterm period , he has improved his game to move up to 24th among North American skaters .
2009 /2010 Regular Season Stats :
GP G A PTS +/- PIM 57 8 19 27 3 87
Scouting Report ( NHL Central Scouting ) :
" I like him ; he 's going to be good .
I like his on - ice attitude ; he 's got a bit of an edge to him .
He uses his size .
He also looks to be a take - charge guy .
Every time I saw Red Deer , I 'm looking at the 1991s ( birth year ) , but he jumped out every game . "
Why he'd be a good fit in Columbus :
There 's something missing in Petrovic 's game .
Something about him just feels off but I can't put my finger on it .
I do n't think he will fit in to Columbus ' style and what they want to do moving forward .
Reports are saying he 'll do well in the NHL but I do n't see a future with the Blue Jackets .
Petrovic in Action :
This is the fight with Dylan McIlrath at the Top Prospects game .

Back from the Road
I have just come back from a 40 day road trip across the United States of America .
It was without a doubt the single best experience of my life on every level imaginable .
I recognize how hard such a trip is for most people given individual circumstances but at some point in life if possible I would highly recommend doing something similar .
It was a total game changer for me .
I started Memorial Day weekend and went from NYC to Philadelphia , Pennsylvania then on to Alexandria , Virginia ; Bedford , Virginia ; Asheville , North Carolina ; Nashville , Tennessee ; Memphis , Tennessee ; Clarksdale , Mississippi ; Shreveport , Louisiana ( not recommended unless you live on the East Texas border and have a gambling problem ) ; Dallas , Texas ; Sweetwater , Texas ; Alamogordo , New Mexico ( White Sands ) ; Santa Fe , New Mexico ; The Grand Canyon ; Sedona , Arizona ; Las Vegas , Nevada ; Mt. Zion National Park , Utah ( where my brother got married ) ; Bryce Canyon National Park , Utah ; Salt Lake City , Utah ; Jackson , Wyoming ( Grand Teton National Park ) ; Yellowstone National Park , Wyoming ; Bozeman , Montana ; Mt. Rushmore / The Badlands , South Dakota ; Omaha , Nebraska ( home of the sellout and recent propaganda mouthpiece Warren Buffett ) ; Indianapolis , Indiana ; Harrisburg , Pennsylvania ; Montauk , New York .
For a kid that grew up in Manhattan this was almost too much to handle , but in a profoundly positive way .
The communion with nature , the amazing conversations with random people in far off places about the things I write about in these emails and the new friends I made .
To the new people on this list that I met along the way , thanks for being a very important part of this trip which will forever hold a powerful grip on me .
Now onto the other stuff …
The Rats are Cornered
This email will be pretty brief as I am still getting used to getting back to the fake world .
Although I did work a little every day and kept up with the major news both financial and otherwise I am certainly behind on the details .
This is how I would summarize what has gone on and where we are headed .
The stimulus and gimmicks initiated by a desperate political class prodded on by our Keynesian witch - doctors Summers and Geithner ran their course and at the end of that road was a massive pile of debt , chronic unemployment , a populace that does n’t believe or trust anything the government says or does and a housing market set to resume its downward spiral .
So basically the forces of deflation have taken over once again .
Banana Ben Bernanke knows it and he knows what he wants to do about it .
He wants to print so much money it would make your head spin .
He wants to drop nuclear bombs of QE2 all over this great land .
That is his answer to everything .
The man is 100 % insane according to Einstein ’s definition .
I quote : “ The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results . "
There is a major problem however .
Bernanke knows how unpopular he and his fascist institution are right now after all of the crimes they have committed in plain view since 2008 .
As such , he knows he needs cover for QE2 and that means some sort of deflationary shock that scares the masses and makes many clamor for help like sad , scared little children ( we are being conditioned like animals ) .
This is why I think the Fed and others have been fine with the recent market plunge .
The only issue for them is they absolutely need gold , silver and other commodities to collapse as well .
Bernanke cannot have the S&P500 at 850 and gold at 1,200 and announce QE2 .
Gold would surge to new highs and it would look horrible .
This is why so much emphasis is being placed on getting gold and silver to retreat in a major way via propaganda pieces and also likely surreptitious selling behind the scenes .
While there has been a decent pullback , it is nothing close to what they need and I am particularly impressed with how well silver is hanging in .
I think this is due to a run on physical silver by investors and the dearth of government or central bank stockpiles to sell in the shadows .
This is what I mean by the rats being cornered .
So far they have failed in decimating the precious metals markets and if they ca n’t do that in a deflationary scare then they are in huge trouble .
Of course they will never stop trying because they are addicted to power and control and will do almost anything to protect their positions .
I think a key thing to think about now that we must accept that they are in a corner is what is the next move on the chess board .
I read this from Jesse ’s Café yesterday ( http://jessescrossroadscafe.blogspot.com/2010/07/currency-wars-selling-them-rope.html)
What is disconcerting to me , and you can see it to some extent in Rickards own work , is that the Wall Street financiers clearly have their eyes on the Pentagon budget : opaque , patriotically defensible , and huge .
A currency war , with the Wall Street crowd providing tactics and weaponry and mercenaries to both the US and to its adversaries , might make the bonuses taken from the mortgage bubble look like pocket change by comparison .
It ’s an old idea really , the basis of some legendary fortunes , adapted to the modern world .
It produces nothing but misery , while transferring wealth from the many to the few .
Ok , so this fits into a lot of what I have been warning about for some time now .
Namely that once they lose control they will go to the next plan which is pure desperation .
They will single out the two greatest threats to their power and I think those two things are : 1 ) Gold and Silver ( independent money ) 2 ) The Internet ( free speech ) .
If they ca n’t control the population with inane television and propaganda they will demonize these major threats .
This will probably be sold to public in the name of national security since who could argue with that ( if you do argue you will be labeled unpatriotic or a terrorist ) .
So expect more and more announcements of Russian and Chinese cyber attacks or the like , which will be used as an attempt to censor the web and there will also be more and more news stories related to gold and silver being used by terrorists or those that wish to harm “ America ” ( which is not the Republic but a small group of corporate , financial and political elites from both owned parties that have control via the monetary system ) .
This group will then use “ national security concerns ” as a further justification to grab even more power and wield it in the name of protecting us from whatever threat they wish to use , real or fabricated .
What can we Do ?
For those that care about real freedom , genuine progressive reforms and this Republic in general there are all sorts of things you can do and they are being done all over the place .
I actually think this group will fail miserably and ultimately be brought to justice .
I simply think too many smart people have woken up to the scam and the entire system will implode on itself .
So as I have written before the key is NOT to be consumed by fear but rather to take action .
Get your finances in order with gold and silver and other real assets but also get mentally and emotionally prepared .
This is because if you are not in a position to help your neighbors then you are no good to anyone .
This will not be about hunkering down in a bunker and emerging rich once the dust settles .
It is about staying intact financially and emotionally so that you can help rebuild a better nation when the current world paradigm comes to an end which should happen swiftly within the next 1 - 2 years .
Most importantly do not look for leaders to save anything or anyone .
It not about looking outside it ’s about looking inside as Gandhi said .
If we become the change we want to see in the world the world will change .
Messianic leaders are a myth and meant to control you and stop you from personal action and independent thought .
Thinking a new leader will change the world just gives you an excuse to be lazy .
Let ’s do this ,
Mike

A three - year Connecticut study has set out to prove that simulators reduce crashes among teenagers by 25 % .

As prom season begins , the issue of phased - in driving privileges for teens is heating up .
Three Democratic senators are pushing legislation to create a national graduated driver licensing ( GDL ) law .
They say it would replace a patchwork of state laws with a single national standard that encompasses proven safety policies for novice drivers .
New Jersey just strengthened its GDL law , adding a first - in - the - nation provision requiring teens with a driver 's permit or probationary license to display a special decal on their license plates .
Illinois is considering reducing the amount of time that teenagers can drive on weekend nights .
Fresh scrutiny surrounds Minnesota 's GDL law after 18 people , many of them teens , were killed in one week in highway crashes .
' NO PHONE ZONE ' : Rallies join texting fight PHONES AND DRIVING :
Teens say they do it Alabama and Pennsylvania are considering tightening their GDL restrictions , says Justin McNaull , auto club AAA 's director of state relations .
Every state except North Dakota has a licensing program for teens that includes three phrases .
The strongest programs include restrictions on nighttime driving , limits on the number of teen passengers and a minimum age of 16 for getting a learner 's permit .
Forty - two states allow learner 's permits before age 16 .
Programs reduce deaths
There is little debate about the effectiveness of good GDL programs on highway safety .
States that impose major restrictions have seen crash reductions of 10%- 30 % , according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety .
In Massachusetts , fatal crashes involving drivers younger than 18 dropped 75 % in the three years after the state implemented tougher restrictions for young drivers ; injury crashes involving these drivers fell 38 % .
What is sparking controversy is a key component of the proposed federal legislation :
It raises the age at which young drivers can get a learner 's permit from 14 or 15 in most states to 16 ; it also sets 18 as the minimum age at which young drivers can get an unrestricted license .
" It 's a very important time of year , " says co-sponsor Sen .
Amy Klobuchar , D - Minn .
" Kids are out for proms and graduation parties .
A lot of kids start driving in the summer .
The basic point is to put more standards in place for those first few years when they 're learning to drive . "
The legislation , also sponsored by Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand , D - N.Y. , and Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , has many detractors .
" It 's not a GDL act at all .
It 's a raise - the - driving age act , " says Rob Foss , director of the Center for the Study of Young Drivers at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill .
" It 's shifting the whole licensing process to an older age for a number of states . "
" I think doing this would be a horrible idea , " says Alex Koroknay - Palicz , executive director of the 10,000 - member National Youth Rights Association , which supports lowering the voting and drinking ages .
" Part of the beauty of our federal system is allowing states to be laboratories and having different policies and approaches to difficult problems . "
He emphasizes the urban - rural divide over the minimum age for licensing : " Driving in New Jersey is a completely different thing than driving in Nebraska or Idaho , " he says .
" You have states where people learn to drive on the farm at 12 or 13 .
You can't have the same rules in those states as in states like Connecticut or New Jersey . "
Restrictions proposed The Senate legislation , the Safe Teen and Novice Driver Uniform Protection ( STAND UP ) act for new drivers under 21 , would : • Establish a three - stage process with a learner 's permit and intermediate stage before an unrestricted driver 's license .
• Prohibit unsupervised nighttime driving during the first two stages .
• Prohibit non-emergency use of cellphones and other communications devices during the first two phases .
States failing to comply with STAND UP 's minimum requirements after three years would lose some federal highway construction money .
The Governors Highway Safety Association , which represents state safety offices , " has n't taken a formal position on STAND UP but opposes new highway safety sanctions and has noted that 49 states would potentially lose highway funds " if the act passes without changes , spokesman Jonathan Adkins says .
The federal legislation is " very close to what we consider a model GDL , " says McNaull of AAA .
The auto club is not actively supporting the measure because of the possible sanctions against states .
Foss says the legislation is different from earlier federal mandates that drastically improved seat - belt use and reduced drunken driving .
" In those cases , they were able to point to states and say look , they did it in this state and it produced this result , " Foss says .
" In this case , what the STAND UP act would require has never been tried in any state . "
Raising the learner 's permit age to 16 would reduce the fatal crash rate of 15 - to 17 - year - olds by about 13 % , says Anne McCartt , senior vice president for research at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety .
The insurance institute 's surveys in Minnesota , North Carolina and Rhode Island found up to 50 % of parents support raising the minimum licensing age , McCartt says .
" I think even more parents might support an older licensing age if they really understood the safety benefits , " she says .

WASHINGTON — As Congress prepares to allow gay individuals to serve openly in the military , those against the proposed change voiced their concerns Monday , warning the repeal of " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell " could soon lead to strong , strapping American soldiers engaging in mind - blowing homosexual intercourse right on the battlefield .

" We 're sending our soldiers out there with a mission , and that mission is to protect this country , " said Rep. Louie Gohmert ( R - TX ) , one of many conservative politicians who staunchly oppose the change .
" If this is repealed , what 's to stop all - night sex romps from breaking out while U.S. servicemen are hiding in a bunker , or crawling around an irrigation ditch bathed only by the light of the moon , or , say , the dozens of other situations I 've already thought through in elaborate detail ? "
" We can't allow this to happen , " Gohmert added as beads of sweat collected on his brow .
" It 's wrong .
Sweaty male sex — no matter how erotic and uninhibited — is so wrong and so , so naughty . "

Despite its support from the defense secretary and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs , the repeal has been condemned by many military officers who worry it could disrupt troop cohesion and endanger the lives of the taut young soldiers who have dedicated their lives to serving America with " every rippling muscle in their rock - hard bodies . "
Others have argued that allowing gay soldiers to push their lifestyle on others , testing the limits of pleasure a man can take before he erupts in uncontrollable ecstasy , would seriously damage morale .

" The military should not be used to advance some radical , steamy , mouthwatering social agenda , " said Rep. Trent Franks ( R - AZ ) .
" Our men need to know they can count on each other in battle , and we can't have them getting distracted by illicit romantic dalliances , " said Gen. James T. Conway , commandant of the Marine Corps .
" Especially if one 's a little blond Adonis farm boy and his buddy 's a real tough street kid straight out of Brooklyn .
I mean , think about it :
What if they lock eyes and abandon their post to start ripping each other 's fatigues off , revealing twin sets of glistening washboard abs and at last fulfilling their hidden passions ? "

Continued Conway , " Is this the message we want to send to our enemies ? "
Many active - duty service members told reporters allowing gay individuals to be open about their sexuality would result in great discomfort among platoons overseas .

" The last thing I need after a 12 - hour reconnaissance patrol is to know I 'm hitting the showers with some guy who might be checking me out and who might , after seeing what I have to work with , find himself wondering if I too long for the firm yet tender embrace of another man , " Army Cpl. Dale Montgomery said .
" So , in conclusion , what were we talking about again ? "
Earlier efforts to repeal Don't Ask , Don't
Tell have failed , including a notable 2007 bill to end the policy that was filibustered by Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) , who over the course of several days repeatedly screened the gay pornographic film Thrill Sergeant and demanded to know if his colleagues liked that sort of thing .

Repeal opponents argued that future combat missions might slowly begin like this scene from ' Trained To Obey '
This May , Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) promised voters he would do everything in his power to prevent gays from serving openly in the armed forces , and on Thursday , he told reporters that the role of the military is to defend American freedoms , not " the rights of , you know , those people some of us stay up all night thinking about as we toss and turn .

" Imagine you 've got a boat full of sailors out cruising the Gulf of Aden when all of a sudden they 're attacked .
Some of the homosexuals lock themselves below deck and begin touching themselves , " said the 73 - year - old senator and Vietnam War veteran , his breath quickening .
" One of their names is Ricardo .
Unbuttoning his pants , he throws his gunner 's mate down on the cot and penetrates him , his big , beautiful dick shimmering with power , his dog tags bouncing up and down as he 's pounding , and pounding , and pounding . "
Added McCain , " What I 'm trying to say is : It all boils down to combat effectiveness . "

When asked about his views on lesbians serving openly in the military , McCain made no secret of his position on the issue .
" Female soldiers being intimate with one another ? " McCain said .
" Gross !
No , thank you . "

Were I an actor in need of tears I would have only to think of what Sydney Harbour looked like when I first saw it , or how I felt when I left it three years later – not just the place but those I 'd grown to love there – for the tears to pour from my eyes like waterfalls .
I was young , I was newly married , my Cambridge degree was still warm in my pocket – a roll of parchment guaranteeing me , I thought , a sort of free ambassadorial passage to any campus of my choosing , and I had chosen Sydney – the world was all before me .
Nothing had been good until then : I had hated university , I had been lonely , I craved respect though I had done nothing to deserve any , I had no idea what I was for .
But now there could be no doubt : I was on a fourfold mission – to put the past behind me , to enter manhood , to cheer up , to teach Australians how to read English literature … oh , and to overcome seasickness .
So that 's a fivefold mission .
I failed the last .
Some would say I failed the lot .
But about seasickness , at least , there can be no argument .
We were at sea about a month , and it was a whole year before the ground stayed still beneath my feet .
Flotillas of small boats came out to meet us , each stocked to the point of capsizing with touristical junk , of which the most vivid to me still , perhaps because we bought a pair , were carved wooden elephant bookends .
In minutes the merchants would ensnare the ship in a tangle of rigging which enabled them to send us up our merchandise , and us to send them down our money .
If any more picturesque method of bartering and buying has ever been devised I had not encountered it .
Though I had travelled a bit , I had never seen anything like this – a towering vessel roped from funnel to anchor , as though about to be boarded by pirates , so that items of silk and brass , batik and beads , could be hauled up while baskets of paper money and coins were hauled down , all to the accompaniment of a wild cacophony of negotiation and derision .
I felt like Marco Polo , surveying the wonders of the world .
When we went ashore it was the same .
I was spat at in Port Said – do n't ask me why .
( By which I mean do n't ask me or I 'll tell you . )
We bought Bob Dylan records for a quarter of their price in Aden , faring better than those who bought boxed shirts only to discover , when they got them back on board , that they had no sleeves or backs .
And in Colombo , where I bought my wife a ring from a gold dealer in an upstairs room in a backstreet I would n't dare to venture into today , we were chased by a snake charmer who believed we owed him more than we'd paid him for taking his photograph .
But for the lurching sea , everything we saw was lit by the light of a marvellous adventure … well , but for the lurching sea and the Australian stowaway .
We 'd have helped her more had she not snored when we gave her our cabin floor to sleep on .
We entered the Heads which guard Sydney Harbour late on a broiling February afternoon .
The sky was a phosphorescent blue , the air was balmy ; in the distance I could make out the arch of the bridge , as full of promise as a rainbow .
Bigger and more curious seagulls than I had ever seen in England hovered over us .
" Waltzing Matilda " played on the loudspeaker system .
I could barely breathe for the kitschy splendour of it all .
My wife kissed me .
Our new life had begun .
More fun for me , as it was to turn out , than for her .
Everything happened at once .
We were met off the boat by the professor who'd hired me .
We were to stay with him that night .
But before sleep , dinner .
The gallon flagons of wine that were passed around the table I will never forget .
Claret or riesling – that was your choice in those days .
It 's my suspicion that wine coming in flagons made one drink more ; when you have only red or white to choose from , you concentrate more on quantity than variety .
I was drunk quickly anyway , and stayed a man who got drunk quickly for the rest of my sojourn in Australia – a Pom who could n't hold his liquor .
I offer that as partial excuse for my behaviour .
I met the department that night .
All there for dinner , to meet the new arrival and to hear the news from Cambridge .
Had I , for example , met Germaine before I left ?
As it happened , I had .
It was Germaine Greer – who had lectured at Sydney – I was replacing .
A tough act to follow , I was told .
So I did n't try .
I did it my way – cultivating a leather - jacketed bohemian look , growing my hair , smoking enough cigarettes to kill a hundred men , clicking my fingers like a jazzman when I entered a seminar room , tearing up novels I did n't like , telling students that the novels they liked – works of irrationality such as Wuthering Heights – were rubbish , and otherwise doing all I could not to make the same mistake I 'd made in Cambridge , which had been to pass unnoticed through the quadrangles .
Stage one of my mission , at least , was accomplished .
This time the bastards knew who I was .
I had put the past behind me .
It was only half the department which gathered on that first evening – the half that mattered , in my view , since it was the half to which I 'd been appointed and which , loosely , shared the literary ideology , which was an ideology of non-ideology , in which I 'd been educated .
Roughly , our side thought some books were better than others and that it was our duty to teach in that spirit , and the other side did n't .
That might not sound sufficient justification for the war that broke out while I was there , dividing the university into rival camps , bringing friendships to an end , ruining the reputations of clever men and making the careers of fools , but it was .
For me , the situation was heaven sent .
I discovered in myself a taste for bitter controversy , a willingness to inflict verbal blows , a love of violent debate and a peculiar pride in knowing that some people – the wrong people – hated me .
It is good for a person who has suffered from acute shyness , as I had , to find that he can cause as much upset as he suffered .
Better to be a brute , I thought , than to be a wallflower .
And to be thought a brute in Australia , where men were men , and women did n't mind so long as one 's brutishness expressed itself in well - chosen language , was very heaven .
It was all heaven .
We rented a flat in McMahons Point , overlooking Lavender Bay , from the small balcony of which we could see the Harbour Bridge , the grinning face of Lunar Park , the ferries come and go , and the Opera House slowly rise from nothing .
I would walk down in the morning to the jetty – a cliff descent bordered with wildflowers whose scent made me giddy – the sun on my neck , the smell of sea and newness in my nostrils , and think myself transported to another planet .
Never have I felt the sheer physical joy of existence – the joy an animal must experience – more vividly .
It was a ferry ride of less than 15 minutes to Circular Quay , a 15 minutes I never wanted to end .
Other passengers off to work in the city – bank managers in shorts and knee - length socks , lustrous women with the Harbour waters dancing in their eyes – would immerse themselves in the morning papers and not look around them at the wonders of the Harbour , or up , when we passed beneath it , into the engineering marvel of the Bridge .
I would never not look around me , I vowed , but of course in time I too sat at the prow of the ferry in the sun and read the papers , especially when they were full of the goings - on in the now infamously riven English department .
Funny to think of an English literature department – or to be precise , two English literature departments – being headline news , but we were .
I fell in love , of course .
Not just with the Bridge and the harbour it spanned with such unsubtle majesty , but with my colleagues ( on the right side of the fence ) , with their children and their bush houses and their swimming pools , with the cleverness of Australians , with their sense of humour , their affability , their sentimentality and their recklessness , with the friends I made and , inevitably , with a student .
I was too stimulated not to fall in love .
I was a boy from a cold northern city who had been educated in a cold East Anglian town .
Anywhere with a glimmer of light and a ray of sunshine would have turned my head , but Sydney was glamorous – growing into a great and dangerous metropolis , but still exquisitely poised between that and a gentle , overgrown country town populated with Greek and Italian market - gardeners .
In half an hour from where we lived we could be on a harbour beach or an ocean beach , washing scallops down with riesling , watching lovers kiss and surfers tumble and children play as though Sydney were a giant kindergarten without a worry .
No worries .
The phrase originated here .
And on top of this I was enjoying fame as a young Turk lecturer saying outrageous things and enjoying pouring fuel on an already inflammable institution .
How could I not fall in love ?
You fall in love differently when you are young and far from home in a seductive place .
You fall in love with the very air you breathe , and the vivid colours and the unbearably sweet sensation of distance and unaccustomedness .
If the person already embodies the spirit of the place that has seduced you – its beauty , its liveliness , its quickness , and somehow its faraway sadness , for Sydney always struck me as melancholy – and if your trysts are indistinguishable from this landscape , the city as much the site of passion as your heart , you fall heavily .
There were strong arguments all round for not allowing this to happen – though age difference was not one of them : I was scarcely older than my students – but happen it did .
To speak of ruination is to put it too dramatically , but in the end all parties to this affair suffered keenly , me included , though I was the least entitled to sympathy .
Against these continuing aches of love and falsity my life at Sydney went its way ; the arguments at the university grew more bitter , my friendships with Australian men more devoted .
Last year the best of my Australian friends of this era died quite suddenly .
Terry Collits , a literary man , a product of the Christian Brothers , a manly Marxist theoriser , a consummate clown , a cricketer and for me the very voice of Sydney in the quick alternations between seriousness and wild mirth , between modernity and old - fashionedness – he wore the most terrible , office clerk 's trousers – between confrontation and sentimentality .
We fought and betrayed each other , we threw wine at each other – I wanted to finish off those trousers – and we wept in each other 's arms .
Friendships with Australian men almost invariably took this form , always on the verge of tears and violence .
The heat had something to do with it , and those flagons of claret and riesling ; but it's my theory that this intensity of mateship goes back to the earliest days of the white men in Australia , before the women turned up , when they had only themselves to play with .
Clever bastards I found them , too .
More knowledgeable than I was about everything , liberating themselves from the intellectual patronage of Poms like me by being altogether more cultivated .
So back we'd go from a morning playing squash to an afternoon listening to Brahms 's clarinet quintet and then on to the balcony of Terry 's house in the fading sunshine for chess and the wine coming out .
I think of him as Sydney , a Sydney now unbearably diminished for me .
So why , since I loved IT so much , did I leave less than three years after my rhapsodic arrival ?
The simple answer is that you can have too much of a good thing : there was too much fun and not enough work , Sydney had become a sort of Lotus Land to me , a seduction of the senses , and I was , after all , an Englishman with English ambitions to which the sunshine and the wine and the overall beauty of everything and everyone were at last inimical .
It 's a sad but necessary fact for some of us to face : that we fare better when the going is n't easy .
But that does n't explain it all .
The splitting asunder of the English department played a part .
Our side had lost the fight if not the argument , and now many of my closest colleagues were leaving , dispirited .
And I , too , was splitting apart , unable to make mature choices between love and responsibility , or harder still , between love and love .
So you could say the decision to return was as much an act of indecisive flight as anything else .
The fun was over anyway .
As was the last remnant of what could be called my boyhood .
Job done , in that case .
On the day before I sailed away , I sat on a bench in a park overlooking McMahons Point – the harbour seen from the other end to the one we entered by – and shed tears enough to float a paper boat on .
I felt like Matthew Arnold 's Forsaken Merman , gazing at the sleeping town from the sand hills , singing : " There dwells a loved one , " though I was the one doing the forsaking .
I have been back to Sydney many times since – once I even rented a house and stayed there for a year , trying to reintegrate it into my present life – but I can't trust me in the place .
It 's too like visiting myself as I was , as I might have been , as I had no business being , as I am glad I am not any more , allowing that one is bound to be ambivalent about one 's younger self .
It 's also a bit of a burden on Sydney that it has to bear so much .
But then again , it flaunted its beauty , so can it be all my fault that I fell for it ?

Electric bikes , or electric assist bikes , are hugely popular in certain parts of the world .
During a recent trip to Beijing I was amazed at the number of electric bikes and electric scooters zipping around on every street , they out - numbered gas powered 2 - wheel transport by about 3/1 and most of them had relatively small removable battery packs so people could take the battery into their home or office with them to recharge it .
Genius !
It turns out the US and Europe have a thriving though quite small community of electric bike riders that I was unfamiliar with , certainly nothing on the scale of Beijing or Shanghai but there are an ever increasing number of companies producing remarkably desirable electric bikes .
The Schwinn Continental ( pictured above ) is currently on my top 5 list .
Its clean , retro design coupled with impressive ( though discreet ) technology is just the sort of thing that usually results in me pulling out my wallet and decimating my bank account .
The Continental has an advanced lithium - polymer battery housed under the rear cargo tray that is designed to be slid out and taken with you for charging ( and perhaps security ) , the bike also has a 7 - speed internal Shimano shaft drive ( look closely and you ’ll notice there ’s no chain ) .
Depending on your preference you can choose your power setting , anything from full power ( no pedalling ) to a slight power assist is available with a range of between 25 and 30 miles per charge .
The Schwinn costs about the same as a mid-range mountain or racing bike at $ 2,499 USD , obviously that is n’t cheap but if you use it for your daily commute or pootling into and around town you ’ll probably save the sticker price in fuel over the medium to long term .
What do you think ?
If you have a sub - 30 mile commute would you use an electric bike ?
Schwinn also provide a simple CO2 / Gas $ / Calories Burned calculator if you ’re curious to see how much you could save ( or burn ) .

June 25 , 2010 — The Government of Canada would like to provide an update on the recent administrative concerns expressed by some Canadians regarding the Tax Free Savings Account ( TFSA ) .
2009 was the first year of the program and the response to the TFSA has been overwhelmingly positive .
Approximately 4.7 million Canadians have taken out a TFSA since the program was initiated .
Our government recognizes that there was some genuine confusion about the rules for the TFSA in the first year .
We understand that it may take time for some Canadians to learn about the program and for some financial institutions to properly inform their clients about this product .
The Government of Canada confirms that for the 2009 filing year , the first year of the program , we have taken the decision to be as flexible as possible in cases where a genuine misunderstanding of the TFSA contribution rules occurred .
Our intention is to review each situation on a case - by - case basis and , where appropriate , waive taxes on excess contributions for this year .
For instance , individuals who used their TFSA as a regular banking account in 2009 , making deposits and withdrawals on a frequent basis , or who have transferred funds between TFSAs at different institutions , but whose net contributions never exceeded the 2009 limit of $ 5000 , may not be required to pay the tax on excess contributions for this year .
Of the nearly 4.7 million Canadians who have a TFSA , less than 2 % ( 70,000 ) have recently received a letter from the Canada Revenue Agency asking to provide further information about their accounts before June 30 , 2010 .
We have decided to extend this deadline from June 30 to August 3 , 2010 , to allow ample time for Canadians to provide the necessary information about their accounts .
If you received a TFSA return letter :
You are encouraged to respond to the CRA letter by providing additional information or explanations that you may have in respect of your over - contributions .
If no additional information is provided or you do not contact the CRA , a notice of assessment will be issued .
Only at that time should you use the request for taxpayer relief form or a formal notice of objection .
If you have questions about your TFSA , you are encouraged to contact the CRA at 1-800- 959- 8281 or visit our Web site at : www.cra-arc.gc.ca.

Pipe bomb disguised as chocolates sends woman to hospital
A seemingly anonymous gift left on the front porch of a Houston home owned by an oil company executive has the city ’s affluent population of oil profiteers on edge this weekend , after that package exploded and seriously injured a 62 - year - old woman .
Neighbors of the victim told an ABC News affiliate in Houston that the bomb was disguised as a box of chocolates in a gift bag , left on the home ’s doorstep around Thursday .
ADVERTISEMENT
Instead , it contained what authorities described as a pipe bomb carrying a load of thumb tacks and nails .
When she opened the package on Friday evening , standing on her back porch around 6:30 , it resulted in shrapnel embedded across the woman ’s face — injuries police said were not life - threatening .
“ It was n’t immediately clear whether the house was targeted , however , Eyewitness News found out the home is owned by an oil company executive , ” the ABC affiliate further noted .
Police refused to release the victim ’s name and none of the area media stated who the home belongs to or which oil company employs that individual .
However , an examination of the homefront shown on local news reports correlated to images featured on Google Street View .
A series of basic searches across a publicly available property database revealed the home ’s owner to be James Brock Moore III , president of Adams Resources Exploration Corporation ( AREC ) .
A separate name listed on the home ’s appraisal record , one Vennie Wolf , may or may not be the bomb ’s victim .
The company brags on its
Web site that it successfully “ exploited ” the “ Austin chalk , ” which is a geological formation that ’s proved tricky to drill under due to its fractured oil and gas stocks .
Many companies have adopted advanced horizontal drilling techniques to conquer the chalk and penetrate even deeper into underground Texas mineral reserves .
AREC says its areas of interest stretch along the Gulf coast from south Texas all the way to Alabama .

No further details could be confirmed at time of this writing .
Neighbors described the bomb ’s detonation as sounding similar to a transformer blowing out .
One man , Dennis McCoy , who spoke to Houston ’s KHOU 11 News , claimed to have been asked by the woman if he ’d left a box of candies on her doorstep .
The box apparently carried a simple note saying , “ Thank you . ”
Initial online speculation centered on whether the bombing may be a targeted hit on someone associated with embattled oil company BP , which is currently held as responsible for the worst environmental accident in humanity ’s history .
A connection of that nature is at least not immediately apparent .
Such speculation would appear to be driven only by police refusal to release the victim ’s name and local media ’s reticence to give a precise address .

Local reports said that the package note also carried the woman ’s name , except misspelled .
“ I ca n’t believe anyone would do something as terrible and tragic to a person like this lady , ” Karen Gennity , a neighbor , told ABC 13 .

A targeted antibiotic provides effective and long - lasting relief of Irritable Bowel Syndrome symptoms , according to the results of two multisite Phase III clinical trials designed by Cedars - Sinai researchers .
Rifaximin is the first drug treatment for IBS that relieves symptoms while it 's being administered and continues to benefit patients after they stop taking the drug .
Researchers found that patients who took rifaximin not only experienced relief of their IBS symptoms , including specific symptoms of bloating , abdominal pain and stool consistency , while they were taking the antibiotic , but also that their relief was sustained over the 10 week follow - up period when no antibiotic was administered .
The results of the studies were presented at the Digestive Disease Week conference in New Orleans on May 3 .
" These studies validate the role of altered gut bacteria in IBS , " said Mark Pimentel , M.D. , GI Motility Program director at Cedars - Sinai and the principal investigator of the clinical trail at Cedars .
" These findings show that targeted antibiotics provide safe and long - lasting improvement for IBS patients . "
IBS is the most common gastrointestinal disorder in the United States , affecting more than 20 percent of the population .
Traditionally , patients with IBS have been described as having " constipation predominant , " " diarrhea - predominant " or an alternating pattern of diarrhea and constipation .
In addition to these symptoms , IBS patients often experience abdominal pain or cramps , excess gas or bloating , harder or looser stools than normal and visible abdominal distension .
Because the cause of IBS has been elusive , treatments for the disease have historically focused on relieving its symptoms through medications that either slow or speed up the digestive process .
Earlier research conducted by Pimentel and colleagues documents a possible link between bloating , the most common IBS symptom , and bacterial fermentation by giving participants lactulose breath tests .
The test monitors the level of hydrogen and methane -- the gases emitted by fermented bacteria -- on the breath .
Those tests show elevated levels of those gases , indicating that small intestine bacterial overgrowth , or SIBO , may be a cause of IBS .
More than 1,200 patients participated in the Phase III , double - blind , multi-center studies of rifaximin , a nonabsorbable antibiotic that stays in the gut and is currently FDA - approved to treat traveler 's diarrhea and hepatic encephalopathy .
IBS patients with mild to moderate diarrhea and bloating were randomized to receive 550 milligrams of rifaximin or placebo for two weeks .
Patients were then followed for an additional 10 weeks .
Phase III trials are randomized studies on large patient groups to definitively demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a new drug .
The findings support previous research by Pimentel indicating that IBS is caused by an overgrowth of bacteria in the gut .
" Even after you stop the antibiotic , the patients continue to feel better , which indicates that we did something to strike at what causes the condition , " Pimentel said .
In addition to Cedars - Sinai , other centers participating in the clinical trials included Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston , University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor , University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , Connecticut Gastroenterology Institute in Bristol , Conn .
Rifaximin is marketed by Salix Pharmaceuticals , Inc. Salix also provided funding for the studies .
Pimentel discovered the use of rifaximin for IBS , and Cedars - Sinai holds patent rights to this discovery and has licensed rights to the invention to Salix .
Dr. Pimentel is a consultant to Salix , Inc , and serves on its scientific advisory board .
Yahoo Japan on Tuesday announced that is has signed a deal to use Google for its search engine and search ad delivery system .
Microsoft quickly criticized the deal .
Yahoo Japan on Tuesday announced that is has signed a deal to use Google for its search engine and search ad delivery system .
Yahoo Japan will continue to manage its own search page and search service .
Yahoo Japan will also continue to run its advertising marketplace independent of Google .
Microsoft condemned the deal and said it would result in Google gaining nearly complete control over search and search advertising in Japan through contract , not organic growth .
Yahoo Japan denied this .
" Yahoo Japan and Google will continue to compete with each other in all service areas including their advertising and search services , " the company said in a statement .
Yahoo Japan said the value of its search service " will stay at a high level " if it uses Google 's services .
Improved search will also increase the value of other Yahoo Japan services , the company said .
Yahoo Japan and Google have not yet determined a timeline for when the deal will be put into place .
Yahoo Japan is jointly owned by Yahoo and Softbank .
Yahoo Japan said the Google deal " will have no change " on other business areas , " including Yahoo's equity ownership in Yahoo Japan . "
The announcement comes one year after Yahoo under which Microsoft will power Yahoo's search site while Yahoo will manage the sales force for both companies ' premium search advertisers .
Referencing the Yahoo - Microsoft deal , Yahoo Japan said it examined several search engines and ad platform technologies , but ultimately decided that " Google has developed what we believe is the best - performing search engine and ads platform technology for the Japanese language environment . "
Microsoft made an unsolicited bid for Yahoo in February 2008 , but after much back and forth , a bid for Yahoo 's search business , and a proxy bid for Yahoo by billionaire investor Carl Icahn , a combined Microsoft - Yahoo never came to fruition .
Google with Yahoo that would have allowed the Internet company access to Google 's AdSense for search and content advertising programs in the U.S. and Canada .
Regulatory scrutiny , however , later .
Dave Heiner , vice president and deputy general counsel at Microsoft , said Tuesday that the Yahoo Japan - Google deal is " even worse " than the failed Google - Yahoo 2008 deal .
" Today Google accounts for about 51 percent of paid search advertising in Japan .
Yahoo Japan accounts for 47 percent .
Their combined share of natural search results is almost as high , " Heiner wrote in a blog post .
" If Google is permitted to proceed with its plan , it would gain nearly complete control over search and search advertising in Japan through contract , not organic growth .
Google alone would decide what consumers in Japan will find , or not find , on the Web .
And Google will obtain massive amounts of data regarding the search history and Web sites visited by every consumer , business and government agency that conducts Web searches . "
Heiner said the attempted Google - Yahoo match - up " was not nearly so far - reaching . "
" Less than two years later Google has entered into a deal that would turn its only major competitor in Japan into a collaborator , rather than a competitor , across natural search results and advertising , " Heiner concluded .
" In doing so , Google has engineered a transaction that , once again , would deprive its search rivals of needed search query scale . "
Google said its deal with Yahoo Japan is different from its proposed deal with Yahoo in 2008 .
" Google will only be licensing its advertising platform services to [ Yahoo Japan ] , and will not be providing its ads to appear on YJC , " Google said in a statement .
" YJC will continue to manage their own advertising system and advertiser relationships , and both companies ' advertisers and advertising data will remain entirely separate . "
Yahoo Japan will be able to customize how its users see Google 's search services , and " users should continue to expect very different experiences " on Yahoo Japan than they might see on Google .
The company insisted the deal is " commonplace in the business world , and it does n't foreclose any robust competition . "
The Japan Fair Trade Commission has no objection to the deal , Google said .
" Competition between Google and YJC , as well as others in the online advertising market , will remain vigorous because their advertising operations will stay independent of one another , and there is competition with other online advertising service providers , " the company concluded .

A dog that was itself rescued from the pound is being hailed a hero after coming to the aid of an elderly woman on the New South Wales north coast .
The Kyogle woman , known only as Meg , had broken her hip after falling and was lying helpless outside her home .
Gypsy , the staffie - cattle dog cross , went to investigate and took home one of Meg 's slippers .
Her owner , Roger , discovered the situation when he went to return the slipper .
" You do n't give animals credit - they obviously do n't think like we do - but she worked this one out , that somebody needed help and this was the only way she could tell us how , by pinching a fluffy slipper , " Roger said .
Meg was rushed to hospital and had to undergo surgery .
She spent the next seven weeks recovering in hospital and it was only this week she could finally say thank you to Gypsy .
" I had some lamb shanks and I said I 'd wrap them up in a big bow and when we all got together again , which we did last Friday ... and Roger gave her one of the shanks , she did n't eat it , she just took off to take it home to show Marian and waited for Roger to come and away they went , and I 'm in tears by that stage , " Meg said .
" I suppose it was such a happiness for me to know that she found me and it was just good to see her again .
" We all hope for those sorts of things to happen but there 's a lesson there , to be kind to your neighbours ' dog and to treat them right and to treat your own dogs correctly . "

Earlier this week there was a discussion at getrichslowly .org about a poll they had done about emergency funds .
One of the findings was that the amount people were saving in their emergency funds seems to be dwindling over the past 5 - 6 months .
Continues after Advertisement
After reading that post I started looking for other polls to find out how many people are actually saving up an emergency fund in the first place , and to see what they believe is a good place to get their emergency money .
Poll About Emergency Funds
The numbers seem to vary a bit depending upon the source , however , I found a Gallup poll from a few years back that found only about 4 in 10 Americans say they actually have cash on hand in case of an emergency .
Only 10 % say they have $ 1,000 in cash available in case of an emergency .
When you dig a little deeper you find that a lot of people are n't depending mainly on cash savings to bail them out in case of an emergency .
Three in four consumers say they would use their savings account as a money source in case of an emergency .
Fifty - six percent say they would use credit cards and 50 % would borrow from a relative .
Thirty - nine percent say they would use their 401k retirement account and 37 % say they would use their home equity account .
So besides cash savings ( 75 % ) , people say they would use these sources to help pay for an emergency :
Credit cards ( 56 % )
Borrow from relatives ( 50 % )
401 k retirement account ( 39 % )
Home equity loan ( 37 % )
Based on the fact that only 10 % say that they have $ 1,000 in cash on hand for an emergency , and the fact that so many are depending upon other ill - advised sources of emergency money , I 'd have to say people are in general woefully under - prepared .
How Much Money Are You Saving ?
So the question is this – how much money are you saving in your emergency fund ?
Most experts ( like Dave Ramsey ) will suggest that you save at least 3 - 6 months of expenses in an accessible cash account .
Personally I think that 's a good start , but at our house we usually fall more on the conservative side of things because of the large number of emergencies we 've experienced in the past 3 - 4 years ( hospitalizations , baby , car troubles ) .
We 're currently sitting on a nice 10 month cash reserve in our online savings account , and we 're building it to 12 months .
With the economy as it is , and with one spouse staying home to be with our son , we just feel more comfortable having a bigger cushion in case something were to happen .
And something WILL happen .
Money magazine says that 78 % of us will have a major negative event happen in any given 10 - year period of time .
Have You Had To Use Your Emergency Fund Yet ?
Another question for commenters :
Have you had to dig into your emergency fund at any point yet ?
I 'd be curious to know what types of expenses count as an emergency , and just how big those expenses were .
For us we 've been in a state of continually renewing our emergency fund over the past few years .
First my wife was in the hospital for several weeks , which ended up costing us several thousand dollars after insurance kicked in .
Our emergency fund covered it , and we quickly refunded it .
We also had a car that died on us – when the engine decided to give up the ghost .
Luckily we had saved up a car replacement fund , and only a small amount of our emergency fund was touched .
Next we had another hospitalization for my wife – again covered by insurance , and then by our emergency fund .
So as you can see – major negative events can and will occur – even frequently sometimes !
How much are you saving for your emergency fund ?
If you do n't believe in having a large cash reserve , how will you be paying for any emergencies that crop up ?
Have you had to use an emergency fund yet ?
If you have , what was the emergency ?

Why a climate bill failed
If you wanted to design a threat that our political system could n't address , here 's what you 'd do :
You 'd make the pain of doing nothing come much later , but the pain of doing something begin right now .
You 'd concentrate the costs of failure in poor countries , while the costs of a policy solution would be concentrated in certain regions of America .
You 'd make it hard to solve without the imposition of a new tax .
You 'd make sure that some of the largest and richest industries in the world had an enormous amount to fear from that tax .
Which is all to say , it 's no surprise that Congress is collapsing beneath the weight of an energy bill .
Climate change , a long - range problem that will primarily harm developing countries and require immediate and difficult policy changes on the part of rich countries that will impose huge costs on particular regions of the United States , is exactly the sort of problem our system can't handle .
And for all that , we got fairly close .
The House did pass Waxman - Markey , which was n't a perfect bill , but would 've at least been a serious start .
It was in the Senate , where you added the Republicans ' preference for paralysis and their ability to filibuster that preference into reality , that it just became impossible .
But the fact that we 're not going to solve the problem does n't mean the problem goes away .
Just look at the financial crisis or the BP oil spill for evidence that bad things can happen to inattentive countries .
Better hope someone invents a brand - new , low - cost , easily scalable , endlessly renewable , totally sustainable energy source , and quick .
Inmates of the jail where Lindsay Lohan is set to spend up to 90 days have warned of gangs out to attack the starlet , saying " everyone will want a piece of her , " one inmate said in an interview with The Sun .
Lindsay Lohan will leave her Hollywood pad next week and move into new digs at the Lynwood correctional facility in Los Angeles .
But instead of wild showbiz parties and a plush double bed to curl up in afterwards , the actress will be locked up for 23 hours a day in a tiny cell with a rock - hard bunk and a single blanket .
Inmates told The Sun of the brutal conditions inside the prison , where Lohan 's A - list neighbors reportedly will be replaced with tough guards and fearsome lesbian gangs desperate to get their hands on her .
Lohan has been sentenced to 90 days ' jail for breaking her probation for a 2007 drunken - driving offense .
The terrified former child star hired a new lawyer in a last - ditch bid to avoid jail .
More On This ... Inside Lindsay Lohan ’s Upcoming Prison Cell Hell
And from her future neighbors ' graphic accounts of life inside , it is clear why she is so desperate to wriggle out of her sentence .
Tamara Haley , 38 , is doing time for heroin possession and prostitution .
She said Monday : " Everyone will want a piece of her .
It will make them famous if they hurt Lindsay Lohan .
" Or if you get her to cry , the whole ward will laugh and people will love it -- even the guards . "
Haley also warned bisexual Lindsay of the jail 's lesbian gangs -- and offered advice on how to avoid their clutches .
She said : " The gay inmates wear their shirts inside out to let others know they are available .
" So if Lindsay does n't want someone to grab her ass she 'd better keep her shirt on straight .
" Women grab each other like animals when the guards are n't looking .
It 's disgusting . "
Unless her new lawyer wins an eleventh hour reprieve , Lohan must hand herself in to the authorities by midnight on July 20 .
Jail overcrowding means she is likely to serve around 23 days , most likely in the segregation unit for her own safety .
Haley added : " She 'll be segregated from the general population , but where she 's going it is even worse .
It 's the wing where the murderers are .
" I do n't think they will actually be able to get to her , but you never know .
At the very least some of those hard cases will try to scare her .
They 'll scream stuff to her from their cells .
" I 've been in segregation and it was rough .
The lights are on the whole time .
You hear people screaming all night long .
The cells are filthy and kept brutally cold .
You get one tiny blanket and that 's it .
" There 's an infection going around now .
You can barely sleep at night from all the coughing .
And there are girls with body lice . "
( CNN ) --
A series of steps aimed at bolstering U.S. exports has so far brought a 17 percent increase in the first four months of 2010 over the same period last year , President Obama will announce Wednesday .
Obama 's National Export Initiative , introduced during his State of the Union address in February , seeks to double exports over the next five years .
A White House statement said Obama , in a statement scheduled for later Wednesday , will show that the program is on schedule so far .
The program has made progress on its five main objectives , Obama will say , including the coordination of trade missions in 24 countries ; increased loans to help American exporters ; breaking down trade barriers ; enforcing trade rules , and promoting international economic cooperation .
For example , the statement said , the United States has reached agreements in recent months to reopen exports of pork to China and poultry to Russia .
" Boosting America 's exports strengthens our economic growth and supports millions of good , high - paying American jobs , " Obama said in the statement that also named 18 additional members to the President 's Export Council announced in March .
The panel is headed by W. James McNerney Jr. , chairman , president and CEO of The Boeing Company , and Ursula Burns , chairman and CEO of Xerox Corporation .
" Cops are here in the neighborhood to protect and serve , and instead they 're dealing drugs ? " said an exasperated Terrance Teachey , 40 , standing outside the Nicetown Boys and Girls Club after enrolling his 12 - year - old son in summer camp .
" So what does that say to our society ?
If we want to have a healthy community , the cops have to play their role , just like the community has to play their role .
If the cops are dealing drugs , the kids are going to think they can do what they want to do . "
After Dina Lohan called the cops on Carvel Ice Cream for denying her freebies , Carvel denounced " entitled " Dina .
Now Carvel 's mascot , an anthropomorphized chocolate whale named Fudgie , is giving Dina the smackdown on his blog , Twitter , and Facebook page .
Fudgie has been swimming in Carvel 's sea of sweetness and treats since the 1970s , when Carvel developed a series of awkwardly - named - in - retrospect ice cream cakes named Cookie Puss , Fudgie the Whale , and Hug - Me Bear .
Now , as Carvel 's official " spokeswhale , " Fudgie would like everyone to know that Dina Lohan is a greedy bitch for abusing Lindsay 's " Carvel Black Card " coupon for free ice cream :
While we did offer free ice cream for 75 years with each card , we knew most would likely never be used , or at the least , not abused .
They were not given with the intent to provide massive amounts of free yumminess to people who certainly have the flow to afford it themselves .
We simply wanted to get Carvel 's anniversary milestone in the news and bring our Franchise Partners , who like all small business owners are struggling in this yucky economy , more customers .
Okay , so he did n't literally call her a " greedy bitch , " but for an anthropomorphized chocolate whale named Fudgie , words like " abuse " and " yucky " are about as mean as it gets .
Fudgie 's Facebook friends are rallying around him .
Fudgie has also been tweeting up a storm about the Lohan " drama . "
Hopefully Lindsay or Michael Lohan gets in a Twitter war with Fudgie .

The government have made some solid major decisions during their first term .
In my opinion , the size and delivery vehicles for the stimulus were appropriate .
I think the Super Profits Tax ( SPT ) is sound , though you can argue over the details and which minerals it should apply to .
Unfortunately , the government are not only incompetent administrators but positively autistic communicators .
The SPT was well received in the days immediately after the budget .
What happened ?
The SPT should sell itself .
Especially because it feeds well into what should be the government ’s two strand narrative .
[ DDET Read More ]
The first strand should be that they saved us from the GFC .
Never mind whether you agree with this or not .
It is a strong positive for them and they will win a landslide if the election is fought on this issue .
The SPT is the flip side of the stimulus and an excuse to keep the stimulus front and centre of political debate .
The government put us into a big fiscal hole with the stimulus package .
They have taken some criticism for the implementation ( i.e. pink bats and school canteens ) but the voters are mostly glad of the fact of the stimulus , while having misgivings about the debt going forward .
The government have always claimed the country should get back into surplus over the business cycle .
The money has to come from somewhere .
Where else are we going to get the huge sums required ?
Yet Wayne Swan denies that this is the main reason for the SPT .
He wants to claim credit for getting us back into surplus by 2012 - 13 but is coy about how he is doing it .
He should openly acknowledge his strategy .
Yes , we need the money to balance the budget in 3 years .
This not only moves the focus back to on the consequent early surplus , but it feeds beautifully into what should be the second strand of the government ’s narrative , namely investment in infrastructure and long term management of inter-generational wealth .
Back when they were able to communicate , the ALP ran very hard with the idea that Howard had squandered the resources boom , pointing to slow trains and under - resourced schools .
Regardless of whether you accept this view , it gained a great deal of traction .
They should be positioning the revenue gained from the SPT as the avoidance of losing revenue the way we did in the last boom .
People hate to lose revenue .
If they position it this way , every time the punter hears the SPT mentioned , they think of all the money that would be lost if we did not have it .
But Rudd lives in Canberra and does n’t know how ordinary people think .
How else to explain calling it a Super Profits Tax ?
This is the greatest own goal of all time – a minor variation on the opposition ’s “ Great Big New Tax ” mantra .
They could have called it the 10 % Excess Profits Premium , which carries the message that ( a ) it is only on high profits , ( b ) it is only a marginal change from 30 % to 40 % and ( c ) the country receives a premium on their resources .
Premium is such a nice positive word compared to tax .
Does the government have anyone who knows how to sell a product ?
Apparently not .
Instead , their shifting message is drowned out by mining industry propaganda which does not bear the slightest critical scrutiny .
Journalists apparently think that they must not point out nonsense in the interest of appearing balanced .
The mining lobby ’s campaign has the following elements .
The SPT tax is excessive .
It is only a change from 30 % to 40 % on profits over 6 % .
I am sure that most punters think that mining companies are being taxed an extra 40 % on all their profits , if not on all their revenues .
Rudd should have called it a 10 % premium , not a 40 % tax .
The fact that this is worth $ 9 billion per year tells you how much profit is being made .
The SPT will harm investment .
Since it is only a marginal charge on excess profits , it could not cause any existing profitable projects to close .
It could certainly affect the economics of future ventures , since the rewards on the denominator of the risk / reward ratio will be smaller .
So we might see less projects in future .
This is not such a problem though .
First , it will roll out slowly over time so there is a chance to react .
If necessary , we can encourage new projects in the future by allowing more of the exploration costs to be deductible .
Second , the resources are still in the ground so nothing ( or little ) is actually lost .
The marginal rate of 40 % is internationally uncompetitive .
It is suggested that the 40 % rate being higher than say 25 % in Chile is somehow relevant .
This is nonsense .
A decision to invest in country A or B will depend on the relative profit margin , not the tax rate itself .
If Australia had diamond fields where you could just walk around and pick them up then we would be well advised to tax profits at 99 % .
I reckon mining companies would still fall over themselves to pick the diamonds up .
No journalist has called the marginal tax rate argument for the nonsense it is .
The SPT tax is retrospective .
It applies to future profits only .
The mining companies complain that they made the decision to pursue these projects under a different tax regime .
That ’s true but in that case every time a landlord puts up rent on a commerical property it is retrospective .
As the unfortunate holder of Tabcorp shares I know first hand that the value can decrease when government removes a monopoly right .
Retrospective ?
This is just abuse of language .
The SPT increases sovereign risk .
If they mean sovereign risk of the country then Kyran Curry from S&P disagrees .
He says the mining tax would have no effect on our credit rating , which is an indicator of sovereign risk .
In fact , he says the tax raised over the first two years could strengthen the rating .
The SPT will harm the whole economy .
It is only a change from 30 % to 40 % on profits over 6 % for one industry sector that is currently thriving .
Moreover , most of the big mining company dividends go to foreign based shareholders .
If you had to find $ 9 billion per year to take out of the economy to get us into surplus , you would be hard - pressed to find a less damaging way to do it .
None of this means that I support every aspect of the SPT .
Many economists prefer a purer Resources Rent Tax .
Nor do I think that the SPT would necessarily be an easy sell even if Rudd was at the top of his game .
Nick Gruen thinks that the political landscape has fundamentally changed from when the RRT on petrol was introduced , and he may be right .
So what has been the effect of the SPT on the fortunes of the big miners and the country ?
I downloaded the share prices of RIO , BHP and the ASX for this year and looked at the month prior to the budget announcement and the month after .
I calculated the movements of $ 1 equally invested in RIO and BHP on January 1 and subtracted off value of the same $ 1 invested in the ASX .
The graph is below .
The zero does not mean anything in particular .
It is changes in the graph that tell you how mining is faring compared to the general market .
I also downloaded the DJI for the same period so I could compare Australian and US shares .
The budget was May 11 , about the middle of the graph .
I guess you can tell two stories here .
The mines drop compared to the ASX on May 11 and 12 and the ASX drops compared the DJI over the next week .
Or you can look at the previous month which suggests that the market already knew the SPT was coming .
If the drop from April 12 to May 12 is all due to the SPT then it is around a 10 % loss for the mines .
If you only count post announcment it is about 4 % .
Either way , mining share prices have been moving up compared to the market over the last month – as has the ASX compared to the DJI – recovering perhaps half the lost ground .
This might represent the market perception of the likelihood of the SPT actually ever being implemented .
I wish I had the time to do a similar graph for “ small miners ” but I do not know enough of their names and there are too many of them .
If the SPT designers are to be believed , small mining shares should show the opposite pattern to that of the large miners .

As the economy ( hopefully ) begins to pick up , one of the things that will make recovery difficult is the problem of sectoral shifts .
That is , the industries that lost jobs in the recession are n’t necessarily the same ones that will gain jobs in the recovery .
So if you ’re a guy who ’s installed drywall for the past 20 years , you ’re in dire straits even if the economy starts going gangbusters .
There are millions of construction workers who are going to have to find a brand new line of work over the next few years , and that change wo n’t be an easy one .
But guess what ?
There ’s one industry where , although a massive sectoral shift would be a blessing , it ’s not happening : high finance .
Here ’s the New York Times today :
While much of the country remains fixated on the bleak employment picture , hiring is beginning to pick up in the place that led the economy into recession — Wall Street .
Is n’t that sweet ?
But Annie Lowrey says it ’s even worse than that :
Granted , Rae Rosen believes that Wall Street is hiring in anticipation of better times .
But the article , and the data , show that times are already pretty darn good .
The Wall Street firms that made it out of the credit crunch and the financial collapse alive are doing just fine , in fact .
They have less competition from companies like Lehman Brothers and Bear Sterns .
That means more profits .
They also are benefiting handsomely from low interest rates .
It is Banking 101 : Wall Street firms borrow billions from the government for close to nothing , lend it out and make money on the margin .
That means more profits .
Companies like Goldman Sachs are more profitable now than they were in the boom years .
That , really , is why they are hiring — not because they are betting on a strong economic recovery .
They are making money hand - over - fist despite the fact that the rest of the economy is ailing terribly , and only starting to turn around .
The financialization of the American economy has been a disaster .
Forget all that stuff about the hollowing out of our manufacturing base or increased global competition or waves of immigrants taking away our jobs .
Those are all legitimate issues of one stripe or another , but the far bigger issue is that a gigantic chunk of our productive capacity — Wall Street — is deployed almost solely to make money for one sector of our economy : Wall Street .
Until that changes , until the financial industry is focused primarily on providing capital and services to other people , we ’re always going to suffer from either ( a ) underperformance in the real economy or ( b ) an endless boom and bust cycle .
Take your pick .
There ’s one key metric that will tell us whether financial reform is working : the size and profitability of the FIRE sector .
( That ’s Finance , Insurance , and Real Estate . )
If it shrinks considerably , it means financial reform , despite all the watering down , has basically done its job .
But if the FIRE sector remains enormous , it has n’t .
We ’ll know in a few years .

Update # 2 ( 3:30 PM ) : Oha Suta just finished airing a triple battle , but it did not feature anything new .
It was Gochiruzeru , Hihidaruma and Shimama vs. Musharna , Wargle , and Rankurusu .
The show had teased that they would be showing - off the apparent Luvdisc evolution ( Mamanbō ) , but it was nowhere to be seen in the triple battle .
| Update : Due to our new server being unable to handle the amount of people watching the videos , I have uploaded them to YouTube and posted them below .
The current issue of Dengeki Nintendo DS magazine contains an advertisement DVD with new Black and White video footage , and thanks to an armed robbery at their printing plant an anonymous Japanese PokeBeach reader , we now have the video to share with everyone !
The first video below shows part of the game ’s intro followed by you , Cheren , and Belle opening the present from Professor Araragi and picking your starter Pokemon .
You then battle them , destroying your room in the process .
The second video shows several battle scenes between most of the recently revealed Pokemon .
Enjoy !
Be sure to check back here later today as well !
This afternoon ( in U.S. time ) , a new triple - battle will be shown on Oha Suta .
The battle may contain new Pokemon or reveal some new information , and whatever is revealed will be posted here !
Sometimes , when you ’re forced to live in a world that you know is just a computer program , and when you also know kung fu , you find yourself sad and lonely .
Keanu Reaves knows this all too well .
There was even an Internet holiday devoted to the task of cheering him up , but his sadness persists and continue to take many forms across the web .
But maybe what he needs is some real - life , human company ; namely , yours .
And now , thanks to the wonderful people of Reddit , you can do your part in cheering up sad Keanu .
Step 1 : Click the image above to see it full size .
Step 2 : Print it out .
Step 3 : Cut out all dem Keanus .
Step 4 : Fold the white tab back along the Keanu ’s - butt line .
Step 5 : Sit him wherever he looks happiest .
( Tape him if necessary . )
Step 6 : There is no step 6 .
If you keep ending up with noticeable white backgrounds around your Keanus , there ’s this image which sadly offers only one sad celebrity , but has a less conspicuous background .
Let ’s look at some success stories of how real people have tried ( and from the look on Keanu ’s face , failed ) to cheer him up in the real world ( read : the Matrix ) .
Even when he ’s out and about , the man just can crack a smile .
If you come up with any creative locations for your Keanu , snap a pic and show us in the comments .

Have a tip we should know ?
tips@themarysue.com
Although I ’ve learned not to expect much from the right - leaning Supreme Court , I ’ve been pleasantly surprised by some of their recent decisions .
First was Holy See v. John
Doe , in which the court upheld a ruling that the Vatican is n’t immune from lawsuits over its protection of pedophiles .
The second was Christian Legal Society v. Martinez , in which a Christian student group sued a California law school to demand – what else ?
– the legal right to discriminate against gays .
The law school has a policy that all official student groups must accept all comers and may not turn anyone away on grounds of race , gender , or sexual orientation .
The Christian group claimed that they should be able to exclude gays and still receive all the benefits granted to officially recognized student groups : university funding , the use of university facilities for meetings , and the right to use the university ’s newsletter for their communications .
Fortunately , the Supreme Court disagreed :
The court held that the all - comers condition on access to a limited public forum was both reasonable and viewpoint neutral , and therefore did not violate CLS ’s right to free speech .
Nor , in the court ’s view , did Hastings impermissibly impair CLS ’s right to expressive association : Hastings did not order CLS to admit any student , nor did the school proscribe any speech ; Hastings merely placed conditions on the use of school facilities and funds .
This decision was both simple and reasonable , and is the obvious consequence of state and federal laws forbidding the government to cooperate in discrimination .
Since the activity fee that funds student groups is mandatory , Hastings ’ policy ensures that no student is “ forced to fund a group that would reject her as a member ” .
As the court points out , other groups such as fraternities and sororities do n’t have official school recognition , yet they continue to thrive , and CLS is also still in existence and still holding its own events .
Departing Justice John Paul Stevens summed up the issue at hand in his concurrence , in a praiseworthy reminder that religiously inspired bigotry is no different than any other kind of bigotry :
Other groups may exclude or mistreat Jews , blacks , and women — or those who do not share their contempt for Jews , blacks , and women .
A free society must tolerate such groups .
It need not subsidize them , give them its official imprimatur , or grant them equal access to law school facilities .
All well and good , and I look forward to this decision being applied across the country .
( Yes , I ’m perfectly happy to see it apply to atheist groups as well . )
But then I got a news alert directing me to this column , by Mike Adams on the ultra - right - wing site Townhall .
As you ’d expect , he ’s furious that the government wo n’t cooperate in spreading his prejudice , and he ’s threatening to do something about it :
… when I get back to the secular university in August , I plan to round up the students I know who are most hostile to atheism .
Then I ’m going to get them to help me find atheist - haters willing to join atheist student groups across the South .
I plan to use my young fundamentalist Christian warriors to undermine the mission of every group that disagrees with me on the existence of God .
That means an invading group can turn a smaller , weaker group into second class citizens on campus .
That ’s what I intend to do to those groups who do not believe in God .
I do not seek robust debate .
I seek power over the godless heathen dissident .
Now obviously , this is just a petulant tantrum .
I do n’t expect Adams to actually attempt this idiotic plan , but even if he tried , it would be easy to thwart him .
The court ’s decision pointed out that student groups could still , for example , expel members who did n’t pay dues , or restrict officer positions to those who had been members for a year or more .
If his “ young Christian warriors ” wanted to disrupt an atheist club , they ’d have to sit and wait for a year , paying to promote atheism the whole time , before they ’d get their chance .
I doubt many Christians would be willing to do that .
Or an atheist law students ’ club could just forgo official recognition , exactly as the court emphasized that they could , and restrict their membership to professing nonbelievers .
What concerns me more is that Mike Adams is n’t just some random wingnut .
According to his biography , he ’s a criminology professor at UNC - Wilmington .
It ’s one thing for professors to express political opinions .
Liberal or conservative , they have the same free - speech rights as anyone else .
It ’s something else altogether for Adams , a college professor , to proclaim that he seeks “ power ” over students on his own campus who disagree with him , that he “ ca n’t stand ” them , that he wants to “ undermine ” and “ destroy ” their associations , and that his goal is to reduce them to “ second - class citizens ” .
It ’s chilling and inappropriate in the extreme for any person to make such statements about people over whom he has legitimate authority .
If I were an atheist student , after reading this , I would n’t be confident of fair treatment in Adams ’ class .
( Just imagine the response from the right wing if an atheist professor wrote a column saying that he can’t stand Christian students , wants to treat them as second - class citizens , and plans to disrupt and destroy their church meetings . )
I plan to write to UNC - Wilmington to bring this column to their attention and to ask if they sanction these kinds of statements from their professors about their own students .
Here ’s contact info for the dean of Adams ’ school .
Anyone else want to join me in writing a polite letter ?
It has come to this : Congress , quite by accident , is incentivizing death .
When the Senate allowed the estate tax to lapse at the end of last year , it encouraged wealthy people near death 's door to stay alive until Jan. 1 so they could spare their heirs a 45 % tax hit .
Now the situation has reversed :
If Congress does n't change the law soon — and ...
September 9 , 2009 , 1:00 AM
After breakfast , I headed over to the physics building .
I had planned a fairly cursory search .
As I remembered , I had been in a fairly large lab , so how hard could it be to find it again ?
Sure , the guy who signed me up for the experiment had met me at the desk in the building lobby and guided me there , but still …
My plans came to an abrupt halt when I reached the door .
It was locked .
Apparently , since there were no classes on the weekend , and the professors had off , the building was n’t open .
So I needed to find somebody with a key .
I had one idea about who could help me , but I would n’t see him until lunch , so I spent the morning studying .
Or tried to , at any rate .
I was interrupted by a knock .
“ You were really serious about being busy , were n’t you ? ”
Terry asked as she opened my door .
You ’ve really turned into a study Sue .
Did you have a lot of trouble with your mid-terms ? ”
“ My grades were fine , actually , ” I answered , “ but I am pre-med , after all .
I have to get really good grades if I want to get into medical school . ”
“ Sure , but you ’ve never been this obsessed over it , before .
You are coming to the game with us , are n’t you ? ”
“ The game … ? ”
“ Marsha !
The football game , remember ? ”
“ Oh , right … um , of course I ’m going . ”
Even though I had no idea who “ we ” were .
If Marsha had gone , then I had to , even though I was n’t all that big a college football fan .
She looked at my garment rack .
“ Oh !
You ’re getting through your jobs .
Do you have time for me , now ? ”
Nikki had praised my pinning skills , so I decided to take a chance .
“ Sure , ” I answered .
“ Go get the gown and I ’ll measure you . ”
Then I remembered something Nikki had told me .
“ And change into the underwear and shoes you ’ll be wearing at the party .
I ’ll need to measure you in it . ”
She shrugged and left , then came back immediately with the gown and shoes , much too quickly to have changed .
To my surprise , she closed the door and then proceeded to take off all of her clothes before dressing as ordered .
“ W- wait … ” I stammered in surprise , my eyes bulging .
“ You … but … no underwear ? ”
“ I intend to enjoy the entire evening , Marsh , ” she explained with a conspiratorial smile .
“ Greg and I do n’t stop partying when everybody else does . ”
I did n’t say anything , but tried to act the consummate professional , keeping my thoughts to myself and my eyes in my head , although I knew that was more acting than professionalism .
It would have freaked her out to have “ Marsha ” show too much interest , so I focusing on the pinning itself .
It was enough of an effort that it took most of my attention .
There were a few places that needed to be taken in , and one that seemed just a bit tight .
Nikki had n’t been explicit about it , but it seemed obvious that I would have to open a seam before measuring , so I had Terry take off the gown while I found something in the sewing box that would work .
I carefully tore open the stitches , sneaking a couple of peeks at her splendid naked body when she was n’t looking .
Then I measured and pinned some more after she had put it back on .
That actually had taken me a bit to puzzle out , but my acting experience helped there .
Mr. Condrin had always said that when you get lost , you just carry on , and your audience wo n’t know , and indeed Terri never noticed anything wrong .
In particular , she did n’t notice my increasing nervousness , and she would never had imagined the reason , even if she had .
Rather , she talked all through the session .
“ I ’m really hoping that you can get this done early , Marsh .
I mean , I know that you have a lot of things to do with the play and all , but I was hoping to give Greg a preview .
I mean , what I wore last spring was n’t really anything , and I think this is going to show off my figure a bit better .
You know how hard it is for me to find something to look good in . ”
I did n’t pay a lot of attention to what she was saying , as it did n’t seem important .
That is , it seemed more important to her that she say it than that I respond .
But there were times when she did seem to need an answer , so I told her general things , such as “ You ’re going to look great in this , Terry . ”
I tried to remember what Mom had said to her own customers when she fit them , but I had n’t really paid a lot of attention .
It did n’t seem to matter , though .
Terry seemed quite pleased with any compliment I gave her .
When I was done , Terry took off the gown again and handed it to me .
“ Any idea when you ’ll have it done ? ” she asked , while standing before me in nothing but her heels .
“ A few weeks , ” I told her ; I had decided to ask Nikki to help me learn to do this one myself .
Since there was still about seven weeks until it was needed , that was n’t going to be a problem .
But her nudity and my silent reaction to it was a problem – possibly a very serious one – and Chad was the only one I could think of who might be able to help me .
I really needed her to get dressed and leave .
“ I assume you are going to be grinding away again this morning , Marsh ? ”
She asked , finally donning her regular clothes again .
“ I ’ll come get you when we leave for lunch . ”
As soon as she left , I closed my door and called Chad .
I got his mother again , of course .
“ Jennifer !
Is something wrong ? ”
Not now !
I thought to myself .
I need to talk to Chad !
But I bit my tongue and went through the ritual .
“ Nothing ’s wrong , Mrs. Barnes , I just had something I wanted to talk to Chad about .
“ Was he helpful yesterday ? ”
“ Yes , Mrs. Barnes , ” I said , trying hard not to sound as if I were clenching my teeth , “ we had a very nice conversation .
Your son always has an interesting perspective on things . ”
“ Why , thank , Jennifer .
Let me go call him . ”
Whew !
Only two questions , that time .
Still , if I ever came into money I was definitely going to buy him a cell phone .
“ Marsh ? ” Chad was understandably surprised to hear from me two days in a row .
“ What ’s up ?
Did you find them already ? ”
“ I have n’t started yet , Chad .
Look I need to talk to you about something else . ”
He must have heard the urgency in my voice , because his tone switched to one of concern .
“ What ’s wrong ? ”
I got right to the point .
“ One of Marsha ’s roommates was standing in front of me totally naked today in high heels and I did n’t feel turned on at all . ”
Chad laughed .
“ Well , then you ’re not any guy I know .
Unless she was a total dog ? ”
“ No , that ’s the point , Chad , ” I said , a bit annoyed .
“ Terry is really sexy .
Three weeks ago , I would have gone for her in a heart - beat – if it were n’t for the fact that her boyfriend is the size of a small truck . ”
He laughed again .
“ OK , you ’re also definitely not Marsha .
Wow .
So , what were you doing ?
I ’m pretty sure that if I were in the middle of a tough game , I probably would n’t react to a naked sexy girl , either .
And … if you ever feel like putting me to the test on that … ”
He snickered .
“ You may be a boy inside , but your body would work as a very nice test subject .
“ Come on , Chad !
That ’s sick !
I ’m not going to parade around …
Ugh .
You ’re missing the point .
I was n’t doing anything distracting .
I was just helping her with some clothing , and she tried it on without any underwear ! ”
“ And you got an eyeful .
Very nice .
So , there ’s a silver lining to this ‘ turned into a girl ’ thing , right ? ”
“ Chad , you ’re not hearing me .
I got my eyeful … .
And I did n’t react .
Not physically , anyway .
It was like she was …
I do n’t know , a beautiful piece of artwork or something .
Intellectually , I admired her , but that was about as far as it went .
I ’m freaking out about this a bit .
Should n’t I have been really turned on ? ”
“ I do n’t know .
Maybe you ’re just too used to the nude female body now , since you ’re wearing one yourself ? ”
Aargh !
Why am I not getting through ?
“ Chad , in the past five years , I ’ve seen lots of lots of naked girls , and I ’ve never gotten tired of it or jaded .
Seeing Marsha ’s body is not a turn on , and never has been .
But other girls ’ bodies should be .
So what happened ? ”
I heard him hesitate , and sort of hum , which was a familiar sign .
It meant that he was finally thinking about the puzzle .
“ So looking at a beautiful naked girl did n’t turn you on ?
Weird . ”
“ Not ‘ weird , ’ Chad .
Horrible !
Look , I ’m definitely in a ‘ no touching ’ mode with girls , since Marsha was straight .
But I figured I could at least get my jollies from looking ! ”
“ Yeah , yeah , I see what you mean .
Yeah , that ’s sounds like a problem .
OK .
OK , let ’s think about this .
Um , what kinds of things have turned you on since … uh , since this experiment ? ”
I thought for a moment , but could n’t come up with anything .
“ To be honest , Chad , I ’ve been so intent on trying to cope as a girl , that I have n’t gotten turned on at all . ”
“ Not at all ?!
Well … ” and he paused again , but this time he sounded a bit hesitant .
“ What happened when you … I mean , now that you have free access … you know what I mean … ?
I ’m sure you must have … you know … played with … the new parts ? ”
“ You mean have I masturbated as a girl ? ”
“ Um …. Yeah . ”
“ No . Absolutely not .
That ’s one part of my body that is definitely not mine .
It ’s Marsha ’s , and I ’m not going to … take liberties with her body like that . ”
He was incredulous .
“ Seriously ?
I mean , dude , you get to finger a… um … oh boy .
I ’m working hard on the ‘ you ’re a guy ’ bit , but I still feel like I ’m talking to Marsha , and she ’s kind of … you know , modest in the way she talks . ”
“ I understand , Chad , and I ’ve been working hard to talk like her .
Tina was really shocked when I got a bit spicy in my language a few weeks ago . ”
“ I ’ll bet . ” He thought a bit more .
“ But why not , you know , pleasure yourself ? ”
“ Because this is n’t my body .
I ’m living in it , but the real me is inside .
Besides , you ’re missing the point .
I ’m sure that really getting turned on physically is something I could recognize .
But I ’m talking about what happens when I just look .
Even if I did n’t fully get turned on as a guy , I ’d feel something .
So why are n’t I feeling anything now ?
“ You have n’t felt the urge to look at all ? ”
“ I ’ve felt the urge ; I mean , I looked at Terry while I was working on her gown and she was naked .
I just did n’t feel anything when I looked . ”
“ Well , maybe you just do n’t know what it feels like .
I mean , as a guy , it ’s pretty obvious , right ?
It ’s pretty much impossible to look and not get turned on a little .
You ’re used to that , and now you ’re sort of missing a critical indicator . ”
That sounded good .
“ So you ’re saying that maybe I did feel something and just did n’t notice ? ”
“ Exactly . ”
It was just the answer I wanted , and I grasped at it .
It proved that there was n’t anything wrong with me ; I was just working with an unfamiliar body and an unfamiliar response system .
“ Thanks , Chad , ” I told him .
“ I was starting to get a bit worried . ”
“ Well , you know , ” he continued .
“ That means that you need practice , right ?
So you can get to know what it ’s supposed to feel like . ”
“ Makes sense to me . ”
“ Right .
So , here are your marching orders , Private : you need to spend the day girl - watching ! ”
I laughed .
This was the buddy I remembered .
“ Problem is , Chad , I ’m supposed to go to a football game with the roommates this afternoon . ”
“ And they do n’t have cheerleaders ?
Sexy cheerleaders in skimpy little skirts ?
Little skirts that going flying as they wave their pom-poms ? ”
“ You know they do , ” I laughed again .
“ And porn !
That ’s what the internet is for , you know .
Unless you expect to have lots and lots of chances to see naked girls … ? ”
“ Probably not .
OK , the porn ’s a good idea , too . ”
“ Right .
And report back to me after the game , OK ?
Diss… missed ! ”
I laughed again and hung up , feeling much better .
The football game had n’t interested me , but now I had my own reason for going .
And maybe just as important , Chad and I were back on the same page .
The day was definitely taking a turn for the better .
It is high time someone explained to the ignorant Americans exactly who is really to blame for Gulf oil spill and why the rhetoric emanating from America is so infuriating to most people in Britain .
The rig that had the accident was owned and operated by Transocean , and American company ( which has since paid out a substantial dividend to its own shareholders ) .
The American press initially referred to the accident in terms of it being Transocean ’s rig , and only switched to using BP ’s name when the extent of the oil spill became apparent .
Survivors of the rig fire have claimed they were held incommunicado by Transocean heavies and lawyers on a boat until they signed forms absolving Transocean of any blame or causing any harm .
They were n’t even allowed to let their families know they were alive until they signed that form .
The head of Transocean has had a working holiday in India since the oil spill and has been filmed on stage in a song and dance routine with half naked Indian actresses as part of a celebration of Transocean ’s safety record .
The company has also sought to limit its liability exposure to just $ 27 million .
I challenge even an American lawyer to find fault with the notion that if you are the owner and the operator of a piece of equipment that fails catastrophically and causes tremendous damage and loss of life then the very same owner and operator is responsible both legally and morally .
I have yet to hear Barack Obama make any mention of these facts .
The same applies to the American press and in fact Americans period .
The whole disaster is the fault of Transocean , with possible joint liability of Cameron , another American firm , for providing equipment that failed to prevent an accident becoming a disaster .
Barack Obama has indulged in shameless partisan attacks on a foreign company for the sole purpose of boosting his popularity ahead of crucial elections due to be held in a few months time .
The American press , which is notorious for its complete inability to conduct meaningful , impartial research has gone along with Obama .
American oil firms are encouraging these attacks in the hope of gaining business contracts currently held by BP and perhaps even taking over the company .
Put this in contrast with British treatment of the American oil company Occidental which was responsible for 167 deaths on an oil rig in the North Sea and Americans might begin to understand British anger at their hypocrisy .
If that is not enough , consider American responsibilities and actions regarding the Union Carbide disaster at Bhopal , India .
In the first decade after the cyanide gas was released , 25,000 deaths were attributed to the accident and 300,000 were made sick and / or homeless .
That was in 1984 and today most of the victims are still waiting for compensation or even a meaningful apology .
To the fool who says shame on Britain , I hope you are reading this .
You – and Americans like you -have royally cheessed off the only real friends you ever had .

Jamaican security forces are fighting with gunmen as the government attempts to take control of an alleged drug lord 's stronghold in the capital .
Gunfire erupted as troops and police stormed the Tivoli Gardens area to search for Christopher " Dudus " Coke , who is wanted in the US .
A soldier was killed .
It follows two police deaths on Sunday .
Supporters of Mr Coke are fighting to stop his extradition to the US on drug and gun-running charges .
TIVOLI GARDENS Located on Jamaica 's south - eastern coast , far from tourist hub in north
Built in late 1960s on grounds of a cleared dump known as the Dungle or " dung hill "
Warren - like public housing project with population of about 25,000
One of Jamaica 's notorious " garrison " slums - described as " a state within a state "
Power base of Prime Minister Bruce Golding 's West Kingston constituency
Invaded in 2001 by security forces in search of illegal weapons ; 25 people killed in three - day stand - off
Four residents died in a similar operation in 1997 Jamaica unrest :
Your stories Kingston under siege
So far there is no indication that the security forces have been successful in tracking down their target in the warren - like slum .
Gunmen in the area are reported to be heavily armed .
There are unconfirmed reports of civilian victims .
Mr Coke , who insists he is a legitimate businessman , enjoys the support of many impoverished Kingston residents who see him as a benefactor and have vowed to protect him at any cost .
There are also reports of violence in other parts of the capital , raising fears that the unrest is spreading .
A state of emergency remains in place in parts of Kingston .
The restrictions were imposed on Friday after several police stations were attacked following an announcement by the prime minister agreeing to the extradition of Mr Coke .
Heavy resistance
The BBC's Nick Davis in Kingston says the operation started about noon on Monday , when large numbers of soldiers were seen heading to the poor Tivoli Gardens area .
AT THE SCENE
Overnight the central streets of this capital city echoed to the occasional boom of an explosion , or the sharp retorts of a gun battle .
Grey smoke billowed from two areas in the impoverished Tivoli Gardens neighbourhood .
There have been deaths .
First - hand reports are hard to come by , but Jamaicans who have spoken to people living in the area say they are confined to their homes , and desperate to find a safe way out .
They are squeezed between the army and police on the one hand , and gunmen trying to protect the local big man - Christopher Coke , known here simply as Dudus .
Plumes of smoke could be seen coming from the area as helicopters buzzed overhead .
Security Minister Dwight Nelson said the soldiers , in a joint operation with police , had broken down the barricades around Tivoli Gardens and were conducting a house - to - house search for Mr Coke .
" The purpose of the operation is to execute the warrant for extradition and to detain [ Coke ] so he can appear in court , " he told the BBC .
He insisted the police were " doing everything in their power to ensure the city remains safe " .
But some reports said police had met heavy resistance from gunmen as they tried to enter Tivoli Gardens .
Residents in the area were advised to remain indoors but the streets were already quiet as Jamaica observed its Labour Day holiday .
The US State Department said the fighting had intermittently blocked the road to Kingston 's international airport and forced the cancellation of some flights .
Benefactor
Tivoli Gardens , the constituency represented in parliament by Prime Minister Bruce Golding , is the stronghold of Mr Coke , 41 , who describes himself as a community leader .
His supporters see him as a man who is fulfilling a role that the government does not , such as giving them money to support their children .

Before the fighting , they staged protests and barricaded streets to stop his arrest and extradition .
One resident of Kingston , Suzanne , rang the BBC to say Mr Coke provided a valuable service to the community - unlike the politicians .
" If your grandmother dies , you go to him and he buries her , " she said .
" Okay , that 's a fact .
If you 're a politician you 're not going to find him , especially Bruce [ Golding ] , you 're not going to find him anywhere in the constituency , so you go to him [ Dudus ] .
" You need your child to go to school - you go to him , and this is how it 's been , this kind of patronage . "
Life sentence
The US justice department accuses Mr Coke of being one of the world 's most dangerous drug barons .
He is said to lead a gang called the Shower Posse - owing to the volume of bullets used in shootings - and operate an international smuggling network .
He faces a life sentence if convicted on charges filed against him in New York .
The gang has also been blamed for numerous murders in Jamaica and the US .
The trouble started last week when Mr Golding said he was prepared to send Mr Coke to the US on drugs and weapons trafficking charges .
The decision reversed nine months of opposition to his extradition .
Mr Golding had argued that the evidence against Mr Coke was obtained illegally by intercepting mobile telephone calls .
But he changed his mind in the face of growing public discontent , and questions about his possible ties to Mr Coke .
He has denounced the unrest as a " calculated assault on the authority of the state that cannot be tolerated " .
Justice Minister Simon Power is signalling a further shakeup of the criminal justice system in the next 12 months as he investigates changes , including the way sex offence victims are questioned .
" Just because it 's the way it 's always been done does not mean that is the only answer for us in future . "
Among the changes already under way are using computers more to reduce reliance on paper files , and using audiovisual links for hearings and procedural matters .
Critics say defendants have the right to face their accuser .
But Mr Power told Parliament 's justice committee that transporting notorious killer Graeme Burton to Wellington from Paremoremo and back for two court appearances in early 2007 cost $ 14,000 .
" There 's got to be a better way of doing it than that . "
The Government had advice that it was not a breach of the bill of rights .
Mr Power leaves for Europe later this month to investigate one of the other controversial changes he is considering – a move to an inquisitorial system in sexual offending cases .
Under such a system , a judge would be involved in collecting and determining the facts of the case , rather than the traditional adversarial system which requires cross-examination of victims .
Though no decisions have been made yet , Mr Power made it clear yesterday that he believed victims , particularly child victims , were being brutalised by the current system .
" Children who are forced to give explanations 12 or 18 months later about something that occurred when they were five or six years old under cross-examination – that can't be , in the long term , a satisfactory way for those people to engage with the criminal justice system , " he said .
A child could not be expected to explain in cross-examination so long after the incident whether they stood by their claim , what was going through their mind , and details like " What time did this person come into your bedroom ? "
This was not a satisfactory way for the criminal justice system to deal with those individuals , he said .
Mr Power also thought women sex victims should not have to relive offences against them under cross-examination and that needed " serious improvement " .
The idea of children being interviewed by qualified experts rather than judges or lawyers was also worth considering .
Mr Power said simplification of the criminal justice system would include looking at what point a defendant could elect to have a jury trial , what should happen when people did n't show up in court and having lawyers agree early on what the key issues were .
The changes he was considering were big and he would talk to the legal profession before pushing ahead .
There have already been significant changes , including beefed up victims ' rights and the removal of the defence of provocation .
July 2010 , Summary
Some half a million Israelis are now living over the Green Line : more than 300,000 in 121 settlements and about one hundred outposts , which control 42 percent of the land area of the West Bank , and the rest in twelve neighborhoods that Israel established on land it annexed to the Jerusalem Municipality .
The report analyzes the means employed by Israel to gain control of land for building the settlements .
In preparing the report , B'Tselem relied on official state data and documents , among them Attorney Talia Sasson 's report on the outposts , the database produced by Brigadier General Baruch Spiegel , reports of the state comptroller , and maps of the Civil Administration .
The settlement enterprise has been characterized , since its inception , by an instrumental , cynical , and even criminal approach to international law , local legislation , Israeli military orders , and Israeli law , which has enabled the continuous pilfering of land from Palestinians in the West Bank .
The principal means Israel used for this purpose was declaration of “ state land , ” a mechanism that resulted in the seizure of more than 900,000 dunams of land ( sixteen percent of the West Bank ) , with most of the declarations being made in 1979 - 1992 .
The interpretation that the State Attorney 's Office gave to the concept “ state land ” in the Ottoman Land Law contradicted explicit statutory provisions and judgments of the Mandatory Supreme Court .
Without this distorted interpretation , Israel would not have been able to allocate such extensive areas of land for the settlements .
In addition , the settlements seized control of private Palestinian land .
By cross-checking data of the Civil Administration , the settlements ' jurisdictional area , and aerial photos of the settlements taken in 2009 , B'Tselem found that 21 percent of the built - up area of the settlements is land that Israel recognizes as private property , owned by Palestinians .
To encourage Israelis to move to the settlements , Israel created a mechanism for providing benefits and incentives to settlements and settlers , regardless of their economic condition , which often was financially secure .
Most of the settlements in the West Bank hold the status of National Priority Area A , which entitles them to a number of benefits : in housing , by enabling settlers to purchase quality , inexpensive apartments , with an automatic grant of a subsidized mortgage ; wide - ranging benefits in education , such as free education from age three , extended school days , free transportation to schools , and higher teachers ' salaries ; for industry and agriculture , by grants and subsidies , and indemnification for the taxes imposed on their produce by the European Union ; in taxation , by imposing taxes significantly lower than in communities inside the Green Line , and by providing larger balancing grants to the settlements , to aid in covering deficits .
Establishment of the settlements violates international humanitarian law .
Israel has ignored the relevant rules of law , adopting its own interpretation , which is not accepted by almost all leading jurists around the world and by the international community .
The settlement enterprise has caused continuing , cumulative infringement of the Palestinians ' human rights , as follows :
the right of property , by seizing control of extensive stretches of West Bank land in favor of the settlements ;
the right to equality and due process , by establishing separate legal systems , in which the person 's rights are based on his national origin , the settlers being subject to Israel 's legal system , which is based on human rights and democratic values , while the Palestinians are subject to the military legal system , which systematically deprives them of their rights ;
the right to an adequate standard of living , since the settlements were intentionally established in a way that prevents urban development of Palestinian communities , and Israel 's control of the water sources prevents the development of Palestinian agriculture ;
the right to freedom of movement , by means of the checkpoints and other obstructions on Palestinian movement in the West Bank , which are intended to protect the settlements and the settler 's traffic arteries ;
the right to self - determination , by severing Palestinian territorial contiguity and creating dozens of enclaves that prevent the establishment of an independent and viable Palestinian state .
The cloak of legality that Israel has sought to give to the settlement enterprise is aimed at covering the ongoing theft of West Bank land , thereby removing the basic values of legality and justice from Israel 's system of law enforcement in the West Bank .
The report exposes the system Israel has adopted as a tool to advance political objectives , enabling the systematic infringement of the Palestinians ' human rights .
The extensive geographic - spatial changes that Israel has made in the landscape of the West Bank undermine the negotiations that Israel has conducted for eighteen years with the Palestinians and breach its international obligations .
The settlement enterprise , being based on discrimination against the Palestinians living in the West Bank , also weakens the pillars of the State of Israel as a democratic country and diminishes its status among the nations of the world .
Microsoft has today both announced and released a beta version of its free Security Essentials anti-malware software .
The new version of the lightweight anti-virus , anti-spyware software includes more protection against network - based attacks .
The network protection has two parts .
Microsft Security Essentials now integrates with Internet Explorer to better protect against Web - based threats .
This allows the program to prevent malicious scripts from running .
The current version can detect such scripts when they get written to Internet Explorer 's cache , but that may be too late to protect the user .
For users of Windows Vista and Windows 7 , the new Security Essentials provides protection against network exploits , by inspecting network traffic and blocking any suspicious connectivity .
This feature is n't available for Windows XP , as it depends on the Windows Filtering Platform facility that was introduced with Windows Vista .
Windows Filtering Platform allows programs to plug themselves into the networking subsystem and monitor any network traffic in a robust , high performance way .
This provides protection above and beyond that offered by the Windows Firewall ( which the new version of Security Essentials offers to enable during installation ) , as it can guard against attacks made on software that 's allowed through the firewall .
The beta is available on a first - come , first - served basis on Microsoft Connect ; the beta program only has a limited number of places .
Microsoft claims that the beta is only available to customers in the US , Israel , Brazil , and China ; nonetheless , it successfully downloaded and installed for me ( I 'm based in the UK ) .
Future updates will be delivered through Microsoft Update .
Microsoft Security Essentials has already become popular thanks to its low resource usage and discreet interface .
This network - based monitoring represents a significant broadening of the Security Essentials ' scope .
By guarding against network attacks in addition to malware , the program is becoming something of a must - have for Windows users .

The City of Toronto has passed a new bylaw that limits idling to one minute , reports say .
The bylaw includes TTC buses for the first time , the Toronto Star reports .
The fine is $ 125 .
Council voted 24 - 13 in favour of cutting the maximum idling time down from three minutes to one .
They also got rid of a loophole that let people idle if it was cold or hot .
By any measurements it was a horrific crime .
Gerardo Regalado , a 38 - year - old Floridian , burst into a restaurant in the Miami suburb of Hialeah , and shot his wife dead .
Then , ignoring several male potential targets , he proceeded to pump bullets into six more women .
Three of them died .
The killer then stalked out of the diner and drove a few blocks before killing himself .
The awful carnage was caught on videotape by a security camera .
It is a terrible thing to watch as the women run through the restaurant pursued by the relentless Regalado who does not hesitate to shoot .
But there was one thing the massacre did not catch : the public imagination .
The most shocking thing about the Hialeah killings was the collective yawn given to them by the American media .
Unlike the British media after the recent massacre in Cumbria , there was no collective national soul - searching .
There was no parade of reporters heading to the crime scene from all over the country .
It was just another day in America .
If newspapers outside Florida carried the story , it was relegated to the inside pages .
It seems that America , so often beset by mass shootings and serial killers , is becoming steadily immune to the violence .
Neither the public nor the media is especially interested any more .
They appear to be subject to a dreadful phenomenon of one - upmanship where only the most dreadful and awful of crimes will now generate significant media attention .
After all , if walking into a restaurant and shooting seven women is not enough to generate national news , what is ?
What does any self - respecting mass killer have to do these days to get attention ?
Yet , ironically , this is happening in the middle of a nationwide decline in violent crime across America .
The latest FBI statistics show that violent crime went down 5.5 % in 2009 compared with the year before : the third yearly drop in a row .
That figure covers murder , rape , robbery and aggravated assault .
Even the larger cities , which one would expect to be hit hard by the economic crisis , have seen a drop in the murder rate of 7.2 % .
That is good news .
But , given the public apathy that greeted the Regalado shootings , one wonders if the damage to society has already been done .
The one thing worse than a society that gives rise to killers like Regalado is one that ignores them as not especially newsworthy .
Duchenne : Key to a Genuine Smile ?
Experiments cast doubt on the classic marker of a genuine smile .
For years psychologists have thought that a real smile , which reflects felt , positive emotion , is signalled by upturned lips and crinkly eyes .
This genuine smile is named after the French physician Duchenne , who passed electrical currents through live subjects and took photos of their weirdly contorted faces .
Oddly enough when some people try to fake a smile they look like one of Duchenne ’s subjects : in pain .
It has been suggested that 80 % of us are unable to conjure up a fake smile that will trick others because we do n’t have voluntary control over the muscles around our eyes which signal the Duchenne smile .
Others , though , may well be much better at faking a real smile , which is a handy trick because people automatically trust , like and want to be with those who appear to be showing real emotion .
Writing in a recent issue of the journal Emotion , however , Krumhuber and Manstead ( 2009 ) question whether this 80 % estimate is anywhere near the mark .
In the first of a series of experiments they found that 83 % of the people in their study could produce fake smiles that others mistook for the real thing in photographs .
The researchers also explored how people perceived genuine and fake smiles when they saw videos rather than just static pictures .
Then it emerged that fake smiles were easier to spot , but the supposedly crucial crinkling around the eyes did n’t help much .
Instead , telling a real from fake smile relied more on dynamic processes such as how long people hold it , the symmetry of the expression and whether conflicting emotions are communicated by other facial areas .
So the Duchenne smile has taken a bit of bashing in this research , which suggests that most people can fake crinkly eyes .
Not only that but the crinkly eyes are n’t as crucial for us in judging the sincerity of a smile as other factors .
Rather than just the crinkly eyes , it ’s the whole movement of the face which tells a tale either of deception or of genuine , felt emotion .

Nearly one month ago , the Gaza Freedom Flotilla arrived at the port of Ashdod after a clash between the passengers of the Turkish ship Mavi Marmara and Israeli Navy commandos .
The confrontation resulted in nine Turkish deaths , dozens of injured , and a crisis between two otherwise “ friendly ” states .
When the Mavi Marmara was still somewhere in the Mediterranean with its passengers under arrest , we received a request from the Association of Turkish Jews in Israel calling for voluntary translators .
In less then an hour , we were on an Ashdod - bound bus .
As Turkish Jews living in Israel , we had already felt great distress upon hearing the news .
We wanted to see for ourselves who was on those boats .
Before the flotilla crisis , Israelis used to ask us , “ Why do n’t Turks like us anymore ? ”
Their question was not rhetorical .
These days , Israelis who hear us speak Turkish on the streets of Tel Aviv no longer seek an answer , but rather lecture us on the bad behavior of Turks and say : “ Turks do n’t like us anymore . ”
For most Israelis , the Turkish attitude has become as clear as a cloudless sky .
Most of the analysis of the flotilla incident has centered on the Gaza boycott .
However , the lasting significance of the episode on the Mavi Marmara may be what it reveals about the damaged relationship between Israel and Turkey .
On the Mavi Marmara
In the aftermath of the flotilla raid , media outlets were bombarded with reports , as journalists , analysts and first - hand witnesses , who returned to their homes in Turkey , described their versions event .
For our part , after two days spent translating for nearly 100 Turkish passengers from the flotilla , we were still confused about what had really happened .
Israeli media labeled all those on the boat as Islamist radicals .
Turkish and Arab media portrayed them as a group of peace activists massacred by Israeli villains , akin to Nazis .
According to what we saw , there were both activists and radicals on board , but the majority of the passengers fell into neither category .
They were simply religious people motivated by their consciences to help the Gazan children whose pictures they had been seeing on television for years .
Their humanist desire does not make them political activists nor does their faith make them Islamists .
We discovered from listening to the Turkish passengers that many of them were recruited through local humanitarian and civil society organizations and not the IHH , the Turkish group that organized the flotilla .
The IHH , Insani Yardim Vakfi or Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms in English , is a Turkish NGO .
In international media , some describe the IHH as a humanitarian organization offering services in over 100 countries while others describe it as a charity that funnels money to terrorist organizations .
In any case , the IHH organizers understood the politics of the flotilla .
Gaza News
Most of the people actually onboard the ship , however , were not affiliated with the IHH , and did not have a political agenda .
When we talked with them , most had no idea that an embargo actually bars entrance to Gaza .
Many asked us in astonishment : “ Is n’t Gaza a country of its own ?
Does Israel control Gaza ? ”
When asked why they came on this mission , their answer was “ To bring humanitarian aid . ”
One seriously injured man we spoke to in the hospital said that he was an orphan and boarded the ship to help Gazan orphans .
The people we talked to were fellow Turks familiar to us –they were no radicals .
Two Gazas
For Israelis , the word “ Gaza ” awakens two main thoughts :
The first is the captured soldier Gilad Shalit , whose photos cover the walls of Israeli cities , and transform him into a national symbol .
“ If Turks really wanted to help , they should try to liberate Gilad , ” many Israelis said when the ships set sail .
The second is Hamas and the Qassam rockets that Gaza ’s “ terrorist ” regime regularly fires into southern cities of Israel .
For most Israelis , the real victims of “ Gaza ” are the residents of the town of Sderot near the Gaza border .
Contrary to this perception , for the religiously conscious Turkish passengers of the Mavi Marmara , Gaza is a holy land occupied by a foreign power .
Popular television shows in Turkey now portray Israeli soldiers as murderers ; after the 2009 Gaza war , Israeli soldiers became “ baby - killers . ”
Turkey ’s Prime Minister , Tayyip Erdogan , made that clear when he addressed Israeli President Shimon Peres at Davos in January last year , saying , “ When it comes to killing , you know well how to kill ” .
Turkish attitudes towards Israel became even more inflamed in January 2010 , when Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon tried to humiliate Turkey ’s ambassador to Israel by seating him in a low chair and then ensuring that reporters photographed the event ..
Despite subsequent Israeli attempts to minimize the incident , plus a Turkish diplomatic acknowledgment , many Turks have not forgotten the “ chair crisis , ” and the damage it caused their honor .
Meanwhile , here in Israel , the popular image of Turkey has also changed dramatically in the past year .
Some Israelis decided to “ excommunicate ” Turkey by not enjoying cheap vacations on its beautiful shores after Turkey ’s government sharpened its criticism of Israel ’s attack on Gaza .
Since Turkey began pursuing rapprochements with Iran and Syria , Israel ’s right - wing government has been instilling suspicion of Turkey in both Israeli citizens and the Jewish Diaspora .
Relying on the principle , “ The friend of my enemy is my enemy , ” official Israeli rhetoric is on a fast track to categorize Turkey as an enemy state .
Mavi Marmara as Symboll
Keeping in mind this summary characterization of Turkish and Israeli perspectives , the events on the Mavi Marmara look different .
When the Israeli engagement began , what devout Turkish Muslim passengers saw were armed Israeli “ baby - killers ” dropping onto their ship from helicopters .
When masked Israeli commandos opened fire , the Turks did not know that the weapons were paint - ball guns ; all they saw and heard were “ non - stop gun shots . ”
Crucially , many of the passengers ’ wives were below the deck .
Not only were the men afraid for their own lives , but they also felt the need to protect their wives and honor .
In the scenarios familiar to them from Turkish television , vicious Israelis would kill them all , rape their wives and use the humanitarian aid to celebrate .
So the passengers attacked the Israeli soldiers , with the only weapons they had : sticks , kitchen knives , and metal rods that they “ cut off the ship . ”
When these people were being processed in Ashdod , we even heard some who refused to drink Israeli water because they truly believed that it had been poisoned .
From the Israeli perspective , the commandos , armed only with paint - ball guns and pistols ( the latter to be used only in self - defense ) , were dropped into a mob of angry people .
What the soldiers saw were Islamic terrorists , since in their minds , aggressive Muslim men with long beards and long sticks can only be terrorists .
Under very real attack , the soldiers resorted to using their only actual weapons , their real guns .
Years of misrepresentation of Israel by Turks in the Turkish media , and years of fear of Muslim men instilled in Israelis by Israelis , combined to trap two groups of people who neither wanted nor expected a violent confrontation .
Most tragically , when the two sides fought , they increased the power of those on both sides who failed to protect them .
The leaders of Turkey and Israel flexed their muscles and did so at the expense of Turkish civilians and Israeli soldiers .
In the popular media , the Israeli - Turkish friendship was broken over one petty old boat that used to make rounds on the Marmara Sea .
Yet nothing happens overnight .
The myth of an Israeli - Turkish love affair had been hanging on a loose thread for quite a while .
Far from a love affair , relations between the two states have always been based on mutual interest .
It is unfortunate that our leaders lacked the slightest bit of vision and caused others to suffer the consequences .
Most of the passengers of Mavi Marmara did not wish or expect to be involved in a violent clash , let alone find themselves detained in an Israeli prison .
Turkish Jews did not want radicals to have another excuse to threaten their community .
Turkish and Israeli companies who have been trading for decades did not want politics to block their business .
Israelis did not want to lose another friendly nation in a world that is becoming increasingly hostile Israel .
We would like to be able to say that the Turkish and Israeli governments did not want such winds of animosity either .
Unfortunately , we are not so sure about that .

Total housing starts were at 593 thousand ( SAAR ) in May , down 10 % from the revised April rate of 659,000 ( revised down from 672 thousand ) , and up 24 % from the all time record low in April 2009 of 477 thousand ( the lowest level since the Census Bureau began tracking housing starts in 1959 ) .
Single - family starts collapsed 17.2 % to 468,000 in May .
This is 30 % above the record low in January 2009 ( 360 thousand ) .
The second graph shows total and single unit starts since 1968 .
This shows the huge collapse following the housing bubble , and that housing starts have mostly been moving sideways for over a year .
Here is the Census Bureau report on housing Permits , Starts and Completions .
Housing Starts :
Privately - owned housing starts in May were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593,000 .
This is 10.0 percent ( ±10.3 % ) * below the revised April estimate of 659,000 , but is 7.8 percent ( ±9.7 % ) * above the May 2009 rate of 550,000 .
Single - family housing starts in May were at a rate of 468,000 ; this is 17.2 percent ( ±7.9 % ) below the revised April figure of 565,000 .
Building Permits :
Privately - owned housing units authorized by building permits in May were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 574,000 .
This is 5.9 percent ( ±2.2 % ) below the revised April rate of 610,000 , but is 4.4 percent ( ±2.6 % ) above the May 2009 estimate of 550,000 .
Single - family authorizations in May were at a rate of 438,000 ; this is 9.9 percent ( ±2.1 % ) below the revised April figure of 486,000 .
Authorizations of units in buildings with five units or more were at a rate of 117,000 in May .
Note that permits fell sharply , suggesting another significant decline in housing starts next month .
This is way below expectations ( I took the under ! ) , and is good news for the housing market longer term ( there are too many housing units already ) , but bad news for the economy and employment short term .
Few weeks ago I visited a luthier looking for instruments parts , I had an idea in mind for an instrument I wanted to build .
My curiosity was to hear the sound of violin , viola and cello strings amplified through the body of a double bass .
I came up with a quadruple - neck experimental " something " that I thought to call Experibass .
To play it I used cello and double bass bows , a little device I built with fishing line and hose clamps , a paintbrush , a fork , spoons , a kick drum pedal and a drum stick .
I hope you 'll like it !
Thanks to luthier John
Wu for providing me the parts , even though I warned him that I was probably going to create a " monster " : )
As Paul King toured the English countryside in the 1980s going about his work as a contractor cutting down trees ravaged by Dutch Elm Disease , he was always struck by two specimens close to his Essex home which in the midst of the countrywide destruction remained untouched by the killer fungus .
The pair of elms continued to flourish as the disease largely wiped from the landscape a tree once considered as intrinsically English as the oak and Mr King decided to take cuttings from the two apparently resistant elm specimens to see if he could recreate their success .
Some 23 years later , it seems the nursery owner may have cracked the secret of how to reintroduce to the countryside the species that was immortalised on canvas by John Constable in The Hay Wain .
Mr King has produced 2,000 healthy English Elm saplings from the original pair of 200 - year - old disease - resistant trees .
Customers including the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and Leicestershire County Council are buying the rare specimens of English Elm , whose Latin name is Ulmus procera , after it was found they have the unusual ability to repel the tree - boring beetle which carries the fungus causing Dutch Elm Disease ( DED ) .
Mr King , from Rayne , near Braintree , said : " My job in the 1970s and 1980s was cutting down diseased elms .
Over the years we must have cut down thousands and it was heartbreaking .
But I always noticed how these two particular elms near my house somehow survived .
" It always struck me as remarkable that they were still alive when every other elm around had succumbed .
So I took a couple of cuttings as a hobby to try to get them to grow on .
They grew to about 12 - 15 ft in height and about six years ago I had to make a decision about whether to park the project or pursue it seriously .
" I decided I wanted to do it properly and scaled up production with about 2,000 seedlings .
Those seedlings are the ones that are now available and they are healthy and disease free , just as the two original trees remain today .
I would love to be able to help bring the English Elm back to our landscape . "
With its ability to effectively trick trees into slowly blocking off their own system for transferring nutrients , the DED fungus , Ophiostoma novo-ulmi , is one of the most devastating arboreal diseases .
Early variants of the disease , which originated in Asia and was first identified in the Netherlands ( giving the fungus its name ) , were introduced to Europe in 1910 .
They claimed only a small proportion of elms before dying out in the 1940s .
But a far more virulent and deadly strain emerged later and , after arriving in Britain in 1967 on a shipment of elm logs from North America , it slowly spread across the country , killing more than 25 million trees by causing their branches to brown and wither from the top down .
Over a period of 30 years , Ulmus procera has almost disappeared from the English countryside and is now undergoing its " second wave " of DED attack , killing younger sprouting elms which have emerged in hedgerows in recent decades only to succumb to a new onslaught of beetle attacks .
Mr King used a laboratory - based technique known as micropropagation to speed up production of his disease - resistant trees .
A company in Scotland used a sample of plant tissue to grow cells from the old elms and create multiple new trees , which have been grown in pots in Mr King 's nursery .
The precise reason for the ability of the trees to ward off the DED beetle remains unclear and although the new trees seem highly resistant to the fungus , it is not yet known whether they are permanently immune to the disease .
English elms only become fully susceptible to DED after about 10 years of growth , when they develop a cork - like bark which is attacked by the beetles .
Mr King said : " My nursery is bordered by a hedge with elms that died and throw up suckers that continually get re-infected and die back , so there is no doubt that my original trees have been exposed to the disease .
They are certainly highly resistant but we cannot say they are immune .
It is only once they have been widely reintroduced and survived for a good period of time that we can begin to say that . "
Among those hoping that the two Essex elms and their offspring carry a genetic block to the disease are the leaders of Leicestershire County Council , who have already planted 12 of the saplings with a view to distributing more to schools .
Botanists at Kew have also planted two trees to monitor their progress .
Colin Crosbie , manager of the Royal Horticultural Society garden at Wisley , Surrey , said : " There have been examples of apparently resistant trees which have been propagated elsewhere and been found to be not quite so resistant .
But the English elm is one of the most beautiful trees in the landscape and it would be very exciting to find a new fully resistant tree .
We need to get these elms out into different areas and see how they do . "
Oak diseases
Acute Oak Decline
While the English Elm has been routed by disease , the English Oak also faces an uncertain future .
Conservationists have warned that a new and little - understood pathogen , which causes trees to " bleed " black fluid and kills them within five years , is spreading far more rapidly across Britain than previously thought .
The condition , which some experts have warned could be as devastating as Dutch Elm Disease , has been identified by the Forestry Commission at 55 sites across southern England , the Midlands and East Anglia .
But woodland groups believe it has already spread to far more locations and have accused the Government of starving scientists of the funds needed for research .

In another perfect illustration of why the U.S. tourist industry is in free fall , audio has emerged of a Canadian couple who were interrogated and arrested by immigration officials after they dared to inquire as to why they were being asked such pointless and invasive questions .
Attempting to enter the U.S. at the Niagara Falls border , the couple were asked where they were going , to which they responded the Niagara Falls shopping mall .
When the immigration official bizarrely demanded to know what shops they were planning to visit , the situation quickly worsened .
After daring to ask why they were being bombarded with such ridiculous questions , they were told to exit their car and are taken inside for further interrogation by another official .
When the Canadian man rhetorically asks , “ what are you gonna do , shoot me ” the officials claim he is threatening them before he is arrested .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
Officials claim the man “ assaulted ” them because he backed away for a moment when being arrested .
The officials claim that their victims are required to submit to whatever order they give no matter how ridiculous .
To underscore the ludicrous justifications officials use for harassing people , the officer claims he personally stops three terrorists a day entering the United States from Canada .
One wonders whether he characterizes a “ terrorist ” as someone who does n’t instantly obey his every inane command .
Despite his pleas , the man and his wife are thrown in jail , at which point the audio ends .
Let us not forget that the United States does not stand alone in employing semi-retarded jackbooted goons who specialize in harassing innocent people to enforce security at its borders .
Before arriving in Ottawa to cover the 2006 Bilderberg conference , Alex Jones and his team were detained for 15 hours and put through a nightmare of interrogation , accusations and threats of arrest by Canadian immigration officials .
Customs openly told Jones as soon as they brought him into custody that the Bilderberg Group was aware of his arrival and that this was the reason for his detainment .
All three members of the team were instantly detained despite going through different immigration desks .
Watch the video below which contains the covertly recorded audio of the Canadian couple being harassed and arrested .

Stephen and Mashid Rizzone long planned on creating a fully “ green ” dream home and impart a legacy of environmental responsibility to their children .
Toward that end , 168 solar panels were installed in May on the back of the Rizzones ’ hillside Newport Beach home , facing the northeast side of Balboa Island .
And although the panels may indeed be environmentally responsible , they are also imparting a lot of glare on the island neighbors .
“ I ’m all for going green , and I ’m not trying to stop anyone from having solar panels , ” said Bob Olson , who says the porch of his Balboa Island home is now subjected to an intense glare for 2 1/ 2 hours a day because of the Rizzones ’ solar panels .
“ What I do n’t understand is why in the world they did n’t put the panels on the roof , where it would be more fitting with the look of the community . ”
So Olson is organizing a coalition of homeowners to take action against the project , starting with a petition to have the panels moved to the Rizzones ’ rooftop .
“ We are certainly concerned about our neighbors , and we have tried to respond to all concerns as best we can , ” Stephen Rizzone said .
“ We have made every effort to comply with all laws and regulations .
The project is fully permitted and approved by the city . ”
And the solar panels , he said , are here to stay .
The glass covering the Rizzones ’ solar panels is treated to decrease glare , said Rita Edwards , marketing manager for Northern California - based Premier Power Renewable Energy , which installed the panels and has used the same tempered glass coverings on other projects with success .
Olson , who designed and had a hand in building his Balboa Island home in 2005 , said he planned his residence with the intention of preserving the “ village look ” of the neighborhood .
“ Every detail , from the materials used on the roof door to the color of my front door , was kept in mind with respect of my neighbors and their homes , ” Olson said .
In the past , homeowners associations have prevented residents from making changes that would disrupt the established look of a neighborhood .
But under the California Solar Rights
Act , homeowners groups and local governments are prohibited from denying permits or otherwise preventing the installation of solar panels based on aesthetics .
Still , Olson believes he has found an answer by applying a 2004 amendment , Assembly Bill 2473 , which allows for the relocation of solar panels as long as moving them does not cost more than 20 % of the total project or lower its efficiency by 20 % .
Olson said lawyers he has consulted agree with his interpretation of the amendment .
He has yet to hire an attorney , however .
It ’s also unclear whether the amendment applies to projects that have already been completed .
Stephen Rizzone said landscapers are planting trees on the hill to soften the look of the panels and he is confident that neighbors will be more comfortable once they see the finished look .
“ The posts are planted 22 feet into the ground and surrounded by cement , ” Rizzone said of the solar panel project .
“ It ’s in and it ’s not going anywhere . ”

Our leftover medicines are spawning drug - resistant " bacterial monsters " that thrive inside sharks , scientists say .
The finding suggests antibiotics such as penicillin may be leaching into the environment and spurring drug - resistant bacteria to evolve and multiply in the oceans .
" Bacteria have sex , basically .
They can transfer genetic material , " said study leader Mark Mitchell , professor of veterinary clinical medicine at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign .
Mitchell and colleagues found antibiotic - resistant bacteria in seven species of shark — such as bull sharks , lemon sharks , and nurse sharks — as well as the redfish Sciaenops ocellata .
The fish live in coastal waters off Belize , Florida , Louisiana , and Massachusetts .
( See shark pictures . )
Though random mutations can account for the drug - resistant bacteria , there 's ample evidence for human origin , he noted .
" What do people do with antibiotics when they do n't finish them ?
They flush them down the toilet [ or ] put them in the garbage , " Mitchell said .
Trashed Medicines Making Monsters
Bacteria exposed to the drugs develop resistance , Mitchell said , so " we have the risk of creating these bacterial monsters . "
These monsters may cause particularly virulent illnesses in sharks and fish .
But the researchers are also concerned the resistant bacteria will find their way back into the human food chain .
Though sharks are n't a staple in the human diet , we eat what they eat — crab , shrimp , and other fish .
So people should be aware of these risks and handle food appropriately to avoid infection , Mitchell cautioned .
( Check out Green Guide 's tips for buying healthy fish . )
" I will eat things like sushi , " he said .
" But knowing there are those types of risks , I 'm going to try and get it from healthy , wild - caught fish , where there might be more of a minimal exposure [ to drugs ] . "
The privacy issues that have been hounding Facebook may be coming to a head .
A report in the Wall Street Journal indicates that the Facebook , along with MySpace , Digg , and a handful of other social - networking sites , have been sharing users ' personal data with advertisers without users ' knowledge or consent .
The data shared includes names , user IDs , and other information sufficient to enable ad companies such as the Google - owned DoubleClick to identify distinct user profiles .
Some of the sites in question , including MySpace and Facebook , stopped sharing the data after the Journal asked them about it .
The surreptitious data sharing was first noticed ( PDF ) by researchers from Worcester Polytechnic Institute and AT&T Labs in August 2009 , who brought it up with the sites in question .
It was n't until WSJ contacted them that changes were made .
Not surprisingly , Facebook appears to have gone farther than the other sites when it comes to sharing data .
When Facebook 's users clicked on ads appearing on a profile page , the site would at times provide data such as the username behind the click , as well as the user whose profile page from which the click came .
" If you are looking at your profile page and you click on an ad , you are telling that advertiser who you are , " Harvard Business School professor Ben Edelman told the Journal .
Advertisers contacted by the paper said that they were unaware of the additional data and did not make use of it .
Facebook has tweaked its privacy policy throughout its history , with the most recent moves to open up more user information to the public drawing heavy criticism and FTC complaints .
Users have also had a tough time navigating the site 's often - Byzantine privacy controls , which has led to a trickle of user defections .
With these latest revelations about Facebook ignoring industry standards , not to mention its own privacy policies , that trickle may turn into a torrent .
Update : want to know how the data sharing works ?
We explain .
It sits on a bluff above one of the best surfing spots in the world , with a view that can reach 60 miles to San Clemente Island on a clear day .
It ’s so isolated that you can barely see the tip of a gazebo or get a peek of some of the Spanish - style buildings from the beach .
And the closest you can get to it is a model at the city ’s public library .
This house in San Clemente was once Richard Nixon ’s Western White House , the place where he would drag his Cabinet and aides for weeks at a time while he conducted affairs of state and met leaders such as Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev and South Vietnamese leader Nguyen Van Thieu .
San Clemente was once a small city at the southern tip of Orange County that few people had heard of .
If they had driven through on the way to San Diego , maybe they had seen signs on the freeway .
Then , in 1969 , Nixon moved in .
Suddenly San Clemente was on the map , and signs at the city limits announced , “ Home of the Western White House . ”
Although he had grown up in Southern California and had represented the state in the House and the Senate , Nixon was living in New York when he was elected president in 1968 .
Shortly after the election , presidential assistant John Ehrlichman turned to Fred Divel , a 19 - year - old campaign aide from San Clemente , and asked him to scout around for a home for Nixon on the coast .
Divel , now 56 , focused on the nearly 30 - acre estate owned by the daughter of Henry Hamilton Cotton , one of the early developers of San Clemente and once the Democratic Party ’s national finance chairman .
Franklin Roosevelt had been a guest at the estate several times and played poker in the gazebo - like card room that still stands at the top of the bluff .
Divel presented the idea to Ehrlichman , complete with aerial photos .
“ The next thing you know , [ Nixon ] was checking out the swallows at San Juan Capistrano , ” Divel said .
Presidential Partiality
The area was a favorite of Nixon ’s , and he had proposed to his future wife , Pat , while sitting in his Oldsmobile on a cliff above nearby Dana Point .
Nixon bought the 10 - room home and renamed it La Casa Pacifica .
He had the tennis court scooped out and a swimming pool built in its place , with a barrier to protect against the wind .
A group called Orange County Golfing Friends of the President paid for a seven - hole course .
The location made for easy travel from Washington .
Nixon would fly into El Toro Marine base , take a helicopter to the nearby Coast Guard station and ride a golf cart to the house .
The Nixons were sometimes seen around town , buying beach chairs at a hardware store or when the president bought his wife candy for Valentine ’s Day , said Al Ehlow , a former police chief .
The president liked to eat the taco - enchilada - chile relleno combination at El Adobe restaurant in San Juan Capistrano .
Occasionally the president got rambunctious .
One time , Ehlow said , Nixon and his close friend Bebe Rebozo jumped into Rebozo ’s car and drove to the nearby Camp Pendleton Marine base without telling the Secret Service , sending the agents scrambling to find him .
The Western White House was a boon to local business .
When Nixon would show up — and he stayed for as long as a month — an entourage of Secret Service agents , advisors and Cabinet officers would accompany him , renting 60 hotel rooms , eating in local restaurants and shopping in local stores .
The White House press office and reporters covering the president would rent 70 rooms at the Surf and Sand Hotel in Laguna Beach .
When Nixon bought La Casa Pacifica , he put out a brief statement saying he put $ 100,000 down and owed a $ 240,000 mortgage .
But like so much of Nixon ’s presidency , the truth turned out to be quite different .
The Truth Comes Out
As congressional investigators and the Watergate special prosecutor were examining everything Nixon , reporters began asking questions about the purchase .
They would ask .
The White House would offer some details .
They would ask again .
The White House would provide a few more details .
It turned out that the sale was a more complicated transaction that involved Nixon receiving a $ 450,000 loan from his millionaire friend Robert Abplanalp to buy the estate and adjacent property .
Later , an investment company formed by Abplanalp and Rebozo bought most of the property from Nixon , leaving the president with 5.9 acres , but effectively giving him control of the entire acreage .
In addition , a congressional committee investigating government spending on Nixon ’s properties found that at least $ 66,614 of the money spent on the house should have been paid for by the president , according to “ Nightmare , ” by Pulitzer Prize - winning writer J. Anthony Lukas .
When Nixon resigned in 1974 , leaving Washington with that famous wave before lifting off , La Casa Pacifica became his permanent home .
The day Nixon left office , Ehlow quickly drove to the city limits .
By the time he got there , the signs touting the Western White House were gone .
They ended up in the city yard .
In 1979 , Richard and Pat Nixon decided to move to New York to be closer to their children and grandchildren .
La Casa Pacifica was sold to a partnership of developers : George Argyros , Donald Kohl and Gavin Herbert , chairman of Allergan .
Herbert , who became friends with Nixon after he resigned , ended up with the house and the surrounding 5 acres .
Houses were built on 1 - and 2 - acre lots carved out of the rest of the property , including on the golf course .
Herbert , owner of Roger ’s Gardens in Corona del Mar , said that while Nixon was president , Herbert and a group of volunteers would help with the landscaping .
Pat worked in the garden every day , he said .
She especially like the rose garden .
The house was remodeled about five years ago , and about 25 % of it was torn down and rebuilt , Herbert said .
But these days , the only way to get a good look at the house is at the library — unless you can get past the guard shack for the gated community below the property .
“ People still ask us … all the time , ‘ Why ca n’t we see the Western White House ? ’ ” said Pat Bowman , co-curator of the San Clemente Historical Society Museum .
She may tell them the best spot to catch a peek of it , but that ’s all you can get : a peek .
Johannesburg
It began with a clunk off the post .
Of course it did .
Nothing has been easy and very little has ever been good for Spain in the World Cup , so it was no wonder that a promising moment , maybe a seminal moment , could be punctuated with a solid bounce off the left post .
This was no way for Spain to try to qualify for the first actual semifinal match in its otherwise glorious history .
The home of Real Madrid , the land of Barcelona , had never played a semifinal .
And now a sub named Pedro was bouncing a gimme off the post after a nifty pass from Andrés Iniesta .
Spain is probably soccer ’s most underachieving nation .
Make a list of the countries that have qualified for the semifinals — both Turkey and South Korea in 2002 come to mind , and all right , South Korea was the host .
But still , Spain had never been there .
For Spain , something always hit the crossbar of life .
But this time , the ball deflected straight to David Villa , the hot man of this tournament for Spain , and he plunked it into the net in the 83rd minute for the only goal of the night , the goal that put Spain where it has never been .
HANS - WERNER SINN : - Hellas - kutt vil gi borgerkrig
Tysk toppøkonom tviler sterkt på at de greske sparetiltakene vil la seg gjennomføre .
KRAFTIGE PROTESTER :
De omfattende innstrammingene i de offentlige budsjettene har blitt møtt med kraftige protester , som har under en demonstrasjon i Aten .

- Dagens løsning vil lede frem til borgerkrig i Hellas .
Det er ikke mulig å gjennomføre , sier Hans - Werner Sinn , sjef for det anerkjente Ifo - instituttet , under seminaret Swiss Economic Forum ifølge AP .
Sinn , som også er professor i økonomi , mener de omfattende lønns - og priskuttene vil kunne få svært alvorlige følger .
- Politikerne forsøker å gjøre Hellas konkurransedyktig igjen gjennom en spareløsning .
Løsningene er imidlertid ikke gode , og kvalifiserer til å bli omtalt som en " gresk tragedie " .
Han mener eurolandene nå står igjen med ett realistisk alternativ som løsning på den greske gjeldsproblematikken :
- Den eneste løsningen er at vi gir Hellas de pengene de ikke klarer å betale tilbake .
Gjøres ikke dette , vil landet forlate eurosamarbeidet , spår Sinn .
Uttalelsen får stor oppmerksomhet ettersom
Sinn er blant den tyske regjeringens mest sentrale rådgivere .
Tysklands politikere har vært svært tilbakeholdne med å støtte gresk krisehjelp , da dette har en høy innenrikspolitisk kostnad .
Dette fikk forbundskansler Angela Merkel merke da det i mai ble klart at hennes parti kristendemokratene ( CDU ) hadde gjennomført det verste valget siden andre verdenskrig , etter at regjeringen hadde gått med på å bidra til både et kriselån til Hellas på 110 milliarder euro .
Av dette sto Tyskland for 22,4 milliarder euro .

50/50 sannsynlighet
Sinn er ikke alene om å legge frem dystre prognoser på Hellas ' vegne under Swiss Economic Forum .
Nobelprisvinner og professor ved Princeton University , Paul Krugman , mener det nå er 50 prosent sannsynlig at Hellas må ut av eurosonen .
- Til tross for enorme økonomiske ofre , klarer Hellas i løpet av de neste fem årene likevel å øke gjelden fra 115 prosent av bruttonasjonalproduktet til 140 prosent av BNP , sier Krugman ifølge AP .
- Og av en eller annen grunn skal vi tro at Hellas får tilgang til finansmarkedene i 2015 , og alt er fint .
Jeg forstår ikke helt hvordan det skal fungere .
Krugman tror eurolandene ikke tør forlate det kriserammede valutasamarbeidet , fordi det vil være " en oppmuntring til enorme bank run ( der bankkunder tar pengene ut av banken av frykt for at den skal gå konkurs , journ . anm . ) " .
- Men hva hvis vi får bank run uansett , spør professoren , og viser til gjeldskrisen i Argentina i 2001 , der bankene ble tvunget til å stenge .
- Med en gang du har kommet dit , åpnes muligheten for å forlate valutaen .
Jeg tror det er 50 prosent sannsynlig at noe liknende vil skje i Hellas , og at landet til slutt vil måtte trekke seg fra eurosonen .

At the time of publication , it represented the best available science .
Clouds form when water vapor condenses or freezes onto tiny solid or liquid particles , such as dust , soot , or crystals of sea salt .
Over the remote ocean , the air is usually cleaner than it is over land , so there are fewer particles to act as seeds for cloud droplets .
The scarcity of particles means that the droplets that do form grow relatively large .
This pair of images demonstrates how air pollution can change the size of droplets in marine clouds .
The top image is a photo - like view of the North Pacific Ocean ( south of the Aleutian Islands ) on September 29 , 2009 .
A blanket of clouds — a little thin in places — spans the scene .
The lower image shows the size of cloud droplets within the area outlined in white in the top image .
Bigger droplets are darker colors ( blue , purple ) ; smaller droplets are brighter ( pink , yellow ) .
The bright yellow arcs that streak the marine cloud layer are ship tracks — clouds that form when water vapor condenses onto the myriad tiny pollution particles in ship exhaust .
There are more seed particles in ship exhaust than are found in clean marine air , and the available water vapor gets spread out more thinly among them .
Because the available water is spread among more particles , the cloud droplets that form in the ships ’ wakes are smaller than typical marine layer cloud droplets .
By increasing the number and decreasing the size of cloud droplets , pollution often makes clouds brighter ( more reflective to incoming sunlight ) , in the same way that a crushed ice cube is more reflective than a solid one .
In this image , however , the ship tracks do n’t appear significantly brighter than the surrounding cloud layer , perhaps because the cloud layer was already fairly bright .
( A March 2009 image from this area demonstrates the cloud - brightening effect more dramatically ) .
In marine layer clouds , an abundance of small particles may also delay the onset of precipitation , which depends on cloud droplets colliding and coalescing into larger , heavier drops .
Said another way , pollution can increase the lifetime of clouds .
Human pollution has likely been modifying clouds on a global scale throughout the modern ( industrial ) era .
In fact , climate scientists suspect that these modifications — increasing cloud brightness and lifetime — have probably helped offset some of the warming influence of rising greenhouse gas concentrations .

Advertisement England captain Rio Ferdinand will miss the World Cup after suffering ligament damage to his left knee in the team 's first training session in South Africa .
The 31 - year - old has been ruled out for up to six weeks and Tottenham centre - back Michael Dawson is to fly out later on Friday as his replacement .
Steven Gerrard will now take over as England captain for the tournament .
" Everyone with the squad is very disappointed and sorry for Rio , " said England manager Fabio Capello .
" It was an accidental injury in training , but had nothing to do with the pitch . "
Ferdinand was sent to the Fearncrest Hospital in Rustenburg for a scan after suffering the injury late on in training in a challenge with striker Emile Heskey , described by Capello as " a normal tackle " .
PHIL McNULTY'S BLOG Ferdinand 's injury represents both a huge personal blow and a severe setback to England
The Manchester United defender was later seen emerging from the hospital on crutches , and a second medical opinion confirmed that he had no chance of featuring in South Africa .
His withdrawal from what would have been his fourth World Cup is a devastating end to an already disappointing season for Ferdinand , who , because of a back injury , had been restricted to only 13 Premier League starts for United and 21 appearances overall .
The centre - back had appeared to have overcome his injury problems when he trained with no setbacks at England 's two - week World Cup training camp in Austria .
He also came through the recent friendly victories over Mexico and Japan .
Dawson was the only centre - back dropped by Capello when he trimmed his 30 - man training squad to the 23 for the tournament .
The 26 - year - old enjoyed a fine season as Spurs finished in fourth place in the Premier League , but is uncapped at international level .
" It 's a crazy game and things can change in a split second , " said Dawson .
" One minute I 'm trying to arrange my holiday , then I get a call asking if I was on holiday because Rio had pulled out of training .
Dawson has yet to win a senior cap " I said ' no ' and then I was just waiting by the phone before getting a call saying I would be picked up in an hour .
" I 'll be going out there still having not yet won a senior cap , so where better place to get one if that was to happen . "
He also told Tottenham 's website : " For Rio to get injured , there would be no worse feeling for him as a player .
To miss the biggest tournament in the world as the captain , I feel for him .
" Dawson 's Spurs manager Harry Redknapp had suggested Capello only picked the defender in his 30 - man party to " make up the numbers " .
But the England coach said : " I did n't hear when Redknapp said that .
For me , all 30 players who stayed with me in Austria are important , really important for me .
" For me , it was important to find out and learn about all the players as they trained together .
It 's not important what other managers think about the players I 've chosen .
Dawson will be pleased to come here . "
Dawson will be joining Spurs team - mates Peter Crouch , Jermain Defoe , Aaron Lennon and Ledley King at the England camp .
Capello must now decide whether Dawson , King , Jamie Carragher or Matthew Upson should replace Ferdinand alongside John Terry at the heart of England 's defence .
The Italian made Ferdinand captain of England in February , having stripped Terry of the role following allegations that the Chelsea defender had an affair with the ex-girlfriend of former team - mate Wayne Bridge .
Ferdinand , who made his England debut back in 1997 as a 19 - year - old , has 78 caps and has scored three goals for his country .

Friday had started on a more positive note for England , with the news that midfielder Gareth Barry - who had been a major doubt after suffering an ankle injury towards the end of Manchester City 's season - trained with the squad .
" Gareth Barry is improving every day , " said Capello .
" In the afternoon he is training in the gym with the physio and in the morning always with the team .
" He is not completely training with the team as we have to be very careful . "
Meanwhile , goalkeeper David James sat out the training session after suffering a slight knee problem .
His injury is not thought to be too severe and is related to the 11 - hour overnight flight from London to South Africa on Thursday .
England 's World Cup campaign begins with their game against the United States in Rustenburg on 12 June .

The embattled oil and gas giant BP paid for a slew of travel and dining arrangements for senior government officials in the years leading up to the massive oil leak in the Gulf .
Critics say BP got too close with regulators , neutering the government ’s safety watchdogs .
The Washington - based newspaper The Hill revealed a series of BP - funded trips after a review of files at the Office of Government Ethics .
ADVERTISEMENT
Among the more notable was a BP - sponsored trip to Alaska for officials of the Food and Wildlife Service , which involved Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ maintenance of video surveillance at polar bear denÃ¢â‚ ¬Â and a Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å “ polar bear study .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
The paper adds :
In June 2004 , BP paid for meals and airfare for a trio of Interior Department officials , including then - deputy secretary J. Steven Griles , while they visited an offshore oil rig off New Orleans , La. BP split the cost with the National Ocean Industries Association .
Griles later pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice for his involvement in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal , and was sentenced to 10 months in prison .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨
In February 2005 , then - Interior Secretary Gale Norton and then - Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) Director Johnnie Burton attended a dedication ceremony for BPÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Thunder Horse oil rig off the coast of Texas .
BP paid for travel and meals for the officials .
BP also paid for airfare and lodging in 2006 and 2007 for a trip by officials from the Fish and Wildlife Service to Prudhoe Bay , Alaska , for Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ maintenance of video surveillance at polar bear denÃ¢â‚ ¬Â and a Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ polar bear study , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â according to documents .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨
In August 2004 , six EPA officials attended a meeting on AlaskaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s North Slope near Prudhoe Bay , where they stayed at BP facilities .
In 2006 , BP was responsible for a large oil spill in Prudhoe Bay .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â ¨
Former government officials are also an important part of BP ’s efforts to keep regulators and Congress at bay .
“ In the first three months of this year alone , the company at the heart of the current crisis , BP , has hired at least 27 lobbyists who formerly worked in Congress or the executive branch , ” Huffington Post ‘s Sam Stein noted Wednesday .
“ The revolving door between the oil giant and elected office is spinning fast — so much so that good government officials are hard - pressed to name a comparable organization with that much institutional clout on tap . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ In the first three months of 2010 — the three months that immediately preceded the explosion of its Deepwater Horizon offshore oil rig — BP spent more than $ 3.8 million dollars on lobbying the federal government , ” Stein added .
“ The cash was spread around seven prominent lobby shops within the D.C. area ( including BP ’s own internal operation ) , who in turn employed 39 lobbyists to help the company push its legislative interests .
That nearly 70 percent of those hired guns have experience in elected office does n’t surprise good government officials because those are after all the most sought - after hires on K Street . ”
BP also hired a spokeswoman this week who served in the Bush Administration .
Anne Womack Kolton , former head of public affairs at the Department of Energy and Cheney ’s onetime campaign press secretary , took over BP ’s public relations message this week .
ADVERTISEMENT
While at Cheney ’s side , Kolton defended the secrecy of the Vice President ’s Energy task force , a group which held secretive meetings with energy company executives .
When the General Accounting Office — the research arm of Congress — sued the Administraton for records relating to Cheney ’s meetings , Kolton ( then Womack ) was at his side .

There now seems little doubt that Republican primary voters have shifted to the right .
The question is whether that reflects a move by the country more broadly in that direction " or a shift by GOP candidates outside the mainstream , which could benefit Democrats in November .
Tuesdays primaries gave the latest evidence of the shift among Republican partisans , as the more conservative button was punched repeatedly .

Prior to the government declaring Gulf of Mexico beaches no - go zones for journalists , a group of concerned citizens traveled to Grand Isle , Louisiana , and scooped up samples of sea water and sent them to a lab to be tested .
“ The preliminary analysis was done at an academic analytical chemistry laboratory , ” they write on a YouTube post .
“ Benzene and other highly toxic contaminants were very low however the concentration of propylene glycol was between 360 and 440 parts per million .
Just 25 parts per million is known to kill most fish and propylene glycol is just one of many ingredients found in Corexit .
In short , the Gulf is being poisoned by BP ’s usage of the dispersants even after the EPA asked them to stop back in May . ”
According to the Material Safety Data Sheet , exposure to propylene glycol causes liver abnormalities and kidney damage .
It “ can easily penetrate the skin , and can weaken protein and cellular structure .
In fact , PG penetrates the skin so quickly that the EPA warns factory workers to avoid skin contact , to prevent brain , liver , and kidney abnormalities , ” reports the Anti-Aging Choices website .
In addition to killing marine life , Corexit is a threat to the residents of Grand Isle , according to a lab tech who talked with the citizen journalists by telephone .
Corexit 9527 is defined as a chronic and acute health hazard by the EPA .
The 9527 formula includes 2 - butoxyethanol , said to be the cause of health problems experienced by cleanup workers after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill , and propylene glycol .
Exxon Valdez worker Merle Savage told FastCompany.com the symptoms included nausea , vomiting , liver damage , and dizziness .
In June , CNN reported that the vast majority of those who worked to clean up the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska are now dead .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ In fact , the expert that CNN had on said that the life expectancy for those who worked to clean up the Exxon Valdez oil spill is only about 51 years .
Considering the fact that the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is now many times worse than the Exxon Valdez disaster , are you sure you want to volunteer to be on a cleanup crew down there ? ” asks Michael Snyder , writing for Business Insider .
BP and the government are engaged in a massive cover -up of the adverse health effects related to the oil gusher and the use of Corexit .

Purolator ‘s “ Metal Wars ” was a series of engine filter commercials featuring grudge matches where sophisticated battle machines take on pathetic cardboard opponents .
“ In a world of metal , some things just do n’t belong . ”
According to the producers of these commercial campaign , it made use of their competitor ’s Achille ’s heel : cardboard end caps used to prevent dirty oil from returning to the engine .
It was one one the most entertaining commercials I had seen in years , especially because they featured heavy metal in the background , but Purolator retired them and removed them from their Youtube account , and eventually from their site as well .
But here they are , in all their glory !

England 's Howard Webb will be the referee for the World Cup final .
The 38 - year - old from Rotherham has been chosen for the final by Fifa 's referees committee .
Webb and his assistants Darren Cann and Michael Mullarkey will officiate in the final on Sunday between Spain and Holland at Johannesburg 's Soccer City .
He will become the first Englishman to referee the final since Jack Taylor in 1974 .
It was expected that Webb , who turns 39 three days after the 11 July final , would be handed the honour after he was overlooked for the semi-finals of the competition .
Webb 's team have not put a foot wrong in the tournament so far .
Cann correctly ruled out a Fabio Quagliarella equaliser for Italy against Slovakia while Mullarkey was praised for his decision to allow Luís Fabiano 's goal for Brazil against Chile .

GENEVA ( Reuters ) - Violence in Kyrgyzstan appears to have begun with five coordinated attacks and has taken on an inter-ethnic character that could spiral out of control , the U.N. human rights office warned on Tuesday .
The office of U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay has collected eyewitness accounts , including from U.N. staff , in the southern Kyrgyz cities of Osh and Jalalabad , her spokesman Rupert Colville said .
“ We have strong indications that this event was not a spontaneous inter-ethnic clash -- that it was to some degree orchestrated , targeted and well - planned , ” Colville told a news briefing in Geneva .
“ Several of these reports suggest that the incident began with five simultaneous attacks in Osh involving men wearing balaclavas and carrying guns .
It looked like they were seeking to provoke a reaction , ” he said .
Colville said that one of the attacks was on a gym which he said was “ known to be the haunt of a criminal gang ” in Osh .
“ Targeting that gym was likely to provoke a reaction . ”
“ So it might be wrong to cast it , at least in origin , as an inter-ethnic conflict .
There seems to be other agendas driving it initially .
But once it start to take off on ethnic lines , then of course you start to get a clear divide and tit - for - tat reactions which is what ’s so particularly dangerous , ” he said .
At least 176 people have been killed in the violence which erupted in the Central Asian state last Thursday and may soon have driven 100,000 refugees across the border to Uzbekistan .
The interim government , which assumed power after the president was overthrown in April , has accused supporters of the ousted president , Kurmanbek Bakiyev , of stoking ethnic conflict .
Bakiyev , who is in exile in Belarus , has denied this allegation .
The U.N. human rights office was not in a position to make any direct accusations against any particular individuals or groups at this point , according to Colville .
“ It is very hard to confirm anything properly at this point , it is so fluid , and so volatile and so insecure , ” he added .
But it is an “ extremely dangerous situation given the ethnic patchwork in this part of Kyrgyzstan , ” he said , noting there were some 80 different groups in the Osh area alone .
“ Clearly the most important thing is that the violence stops ....
Inter -ethnic conflicts , once they start to spiral out of control , can really become very , very hard to rein in . ”
Separately , independent U.N. rights investigators called for restraint and dialogue , and voiced deep concern at reports of a shoot - to - kill policy adopted by the provisional government .
“ Force should be used by law enforcement officials only when strictly necessary , and that force must be in proportion to the legitimate objective to be achieved , ” they said in a statement .
“ It is essential to quickly establish the rule of law and to establish long term measures to promote dialogue and improve relations between ethnic groups , ” they added .
The joint statement was issued in Geneva by Kay McDougall , independent expert on minority issues , Philip Alston , special rapporteur on executions , and Githu Muigai , rapporteur on racism and racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance .
LOS ANGELES / SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Shares of Apple Inc slid more than 4 percent on Tuesday after a poor review for its iPhone 4 from an influential consumer guide underpinned mounting complaints about the hot - selling device ’s reception and spurred speculation about a product recall .

Analysts thought a recall unlikely but said the world ’s most valuable tech company needs need to move quickly to avert longer - term damage to its widely respected brand , which allows it to charge a premium for products like the iPad and iPod .
The stock should recover on Wednesday , some said .
Consumer Reports said on Monday it could not recommend the iPhone 4 -- which sold 1.7 million units worldwide in its first three days -- after its tests confirmed concerns about signal loss when the device is held in a certain way .
That report spurred widespread discussion on Tuesday , including on popular tech site Cnet and multiple blogs , about the possibility of an iPhone 4 recall : an unheard - of event for a company lauded by investors and tech aficionados for its marketing savvy and product quality .
Apple , which has called the iPhone 4 ’s June debut its most successful product launch ever , has not responded to the widely watched nonprofit organization ’s report or to the recall talk .
The company has said all cellphones suffer some signal loss when cradled in different ways , and suggested that a software glitch might have misled users by overstating signal strength .
Hudson Square Research analyst Daniel Ernst pointed to speculation that Consumer Reports ’ article might induce a recall .
But some spotted a buying opportunity as Apple ’s stock bounces off Tuesday ’s low .
“ There ’s nothing to recall .
There ’s people lining up in droves to buy this phone , ” said Gleacher & Co analyst Brian Marshall .
He said he could not replicate the antenna problem on the iPhone 4 .
Apple shares dipped below their 50 - day moving average price of $ 256.26 , sliding as much as 4.2 percent to $ 246.43 .
They pared losses to trade 2 percent lower at $ 252.19 Tuesday afternoon , as the Nasdaq gained 1.7 percent .
Shares of Research in Motion , which makes the rival Blackberry , climbed 3.4 percent to $ 55.62 .
Google Inc , whose Android operating system for smartphones is gaining traction on multiple devices , also rose , by more than 3 percent to $ 490.35 , along with tech stocks overall .
Analysts said Apple needs to take quick action to avert any lasting damage to its reputation for quality products -- an image honed by iconic gadgets such as the iPod and iPad -- though they did not see sales being hurt for now .
“ They need to provide an actual fix -- not a bumper fix -- so that the product performs as it should , ” said Ashok Kumar at Rodman & Renshaw .
“ Apple should have taken a higher road when addressing the design flaw , instead of taking the hard - line stance that they did . ”
“ This is not a Toyota problem , but it is a problem that Apple needs to address head - on , ” he said , referring to the Japanese automaker ’s global recalls of more than 10 million vehicles since late last year .
NEED TO TAKE ACTION
JP Morgan warned that reports of wireless reception problems on the smartphone , which competes with Motorola Inc ’s Droid and Palm Inc ’s Pre , may eventually affect demand .
“ Consumer Reports is a well - respected product reviewer , and the report should turn up the heat on Apple , ” analyst Mark Moskowitz said in a client note .
“ Concerns around iPhone 4 reception do not appear to be impacting demand , but we think there are risks when a well - respected product rating agency such as Consumer Reports issues an unfavorable report .
“ We continue to expect a fix from Apple , whether the solution is software - or hardware - related . ”
Consumer Reports , which publishes guides on everything from cars to TVs , said in its Monday report that it had tested other phones -- including the iPhone 3GS and Pre -- and found none had the signal - loss problems of Apple ’s latest iPhone .
It added that AT&T Inc , the exclusive mobile phone carrier for the iPhone 4 and whose network is often blamed for reception problems , was not necessarily the main culprit .
The report was the latest blow to the iPhone 4 , which has been plagued by complaints about poor reception .
Many of the complaints involve a wraparound antenna whose signal strength is said to be affected if the device is touched in a certain way .
Apple has been sued by iPhone customers in at least three complaints related to antenna problems .
Heavy options trading activity on Tuesday ahead of Friday ’s July contract expiration suggested investors were bracing for possible Apple news before the weekend , analysts say .
“ Apple shares are down on concerns about a possible defect with the new iPhone 4 .
Worries that iPhone 4 might be a lemon are weighing on their shares , ” said Frederic Ruffy , options strategists at Web information site WhatsTrading.com .
“ Live in the Web Center .
This is George Sells , Fox2 news . ”
The Web Center ?!
We were going to do exactly what every pseudo - news outpost is supposed to do in St. Louis and bite on this story that some St. Louis company is going to map Ozzy Osbourne ’s DNA and will undoubtedly uncover amazing truths and far too many bat head biting references to count , but when watching the clip about the story on Fox2 ’s site just now , something else caught our attention …
Fox2 calls a room in their office “ The Web Center ” .
Here ’s reporter George Sells in there now doing web stuff on his multiple monitors which we can only assume doubles as a emergency NASA launch center in St. Louis when the need arrises .
I know .
Its really crazy in the Web Center .
Its tough to take all in .
Here ’s an annotated version of the shot .
That ’s three monitors showing all kind of Web Centery stuff like Ozzy photos , and lets not forget the tape in the background .
…
Ok this thing is a converted closet is n’t it ?!
It has to be .
Somewhere there is a janitor pissed off he can’t keep his mop there anymore .
Why go the trouble of calling this clearly random room with an outlet on one of the walls the “ Web Center ” … is it because this room has the good power strip ?
It would be another thing if this was 1987 and this was the only room in the whole building that had the internet , but come on !
Every intern in the station has a computer , making every cube in the farm a little “ mini Web Center ” .
Hell we have internet on our phone …are we always in a Web Center where ever we go ?
You tell us Fox2 , you ’re the ones that had to get all fancy with the names for closets .
Oh wait .
Is calling it “ The Web Center ” how you convinced George to move to the room in the basement with those boxes of Jaco Report tapes ?

“ Our job is to help the customers lower the bill , ” Mr. Haines said , noting Torontonians are one of the highest per capita users of energy in the world .
“ We ’ve had cheap , abundant energy for 100 years … .
We have programs to get people to close their doors while the air conditioner ’s running .
You would n’t go to Europe and see that happening .
I think we have a long way to go . ”
The proliferation of renewable power sources , such as wind energy , will bring a new set of challenges , Mr. Haines said .
Wind is difficult to predict ; one day may bring extreme winds , and the next , dead calm .
“ To plan a power supply around that kind of scenario is a challenge , ” he said , adding this would necessitate an “ overbuild ” to ensure demands can be met .
Mr. Haines also addressed on Wednesday a campaign promise by mayoral candidate Rocco Rossi to build subways by selling off Toronto Hydro .
Mr. Rossi’s “ Transit City Plus ” vision involves spending $ 4.5 - billion over the next decade , which he believes can be achieved by wiping out the city ’s $ 2.4 - billion debt and thus freeing up the $ 450 - million spent servicing that debt every year .
To erase debt , Mr. Rossi has pledged to sell Toronto Hydro and “ some additional non-essential assets . ”
Such a sale would impact neither rates — which are set by the Ontario Energy Board — nor service , nor the corporation ’s ambitious infrastructure renewal plan , Mr. Haines said .
He said Toronto Hydro ’s “ equity ” is about $ 1 - billion , twice as much as it was 10 years ago , but would likely trade at a premium .
“ The determination of when you harvest that or if you harvest that value is … an election issue , ” Mr. Haines said .
“ I guess this is a good thing , to go from — if we think about when Mayor Miller came in , there was crime in the streets and we were having debates about murders — to we ’re having debates about what to do with a great asset .
I guess that ’s progress , but we ’ll let the politicians decide if that ’s in the public ’s best interest . ”
If you read this blog at its home at standalone - sysadmin.com , you might have seen the LOPSA logo on the bar at the right .
If you ’re not familiar with it , LOPSA stands for the League of Professional System Administrators , an organization of people who have banded together in order to increase the professionalism of our industry .
One of the things that was brought up often at PICC was the idea that people in our field ( and many others , for that matter ) need mentors , both when they ’re starting out and as they mature .
As we grow and become senior administrators , many of us have the need to become mentors , too .
LOPSA wants to bring those people together , and is forming a structured mentorship program to do it .
The mentorship page is brief , since the program is just getting started , but we are looking for people who are interested in being mentors , as well as people who would like to have mentors .
It wo n’t take a lot of your time , and a mentor relationship can be very rewarding .
If you ’re a junior admin and you do n’t have a mentor , there is a lot of experience that you ca n’t get from a manpage .
Having someone help to guide you when you ’re stuck can be a life saver .
Sign up by emailing volunteers@lopsa.org and let them know that you ’d like to take part in a mentorship .
Also , I do n’t know if they read this blog , but my mentors when I was just starting out as an admin were Randy Elkins and Brett Carroll .
I would n’t be half the administrator that I am today without their guidance .

Would LeBron James be willing to play for the Los Angeles Clippers if Donald Sterling no longer owned the team ?
Billionaire entertainment mogul David Geffen wants to find out .
A source close to the situation confirmed a New York Post report that Geffen is interested in purchasing a majority share of the Clippers -- and that the long - shot attempt to convince Sterling to cede operating control of the team is among the reasons James and close friend Maverick Carter were in Los Angeles over the weekend .

Sterling has insisted for nearly three decades that he will never sell the franchise .
But the New York Post reported in Tuesday 's editions that Geffen -- who already has a working relationship with James and Carter -- has expressed interest in buying a 51 percent stake in the Clippers .
James was invited to watch Game 2 of the NBA Finals at Staples Center in Geffen 's seats , sources confirmed , but he ultimately elected not to attend Boston 's eventual 103 - 94 victory , fearful of the spectacle his courtside presence would create at a time when James ' impending free agency has routinely drawn media attention away from the playoffs .
Yet Carter , who handles the bulk of James ' business dealings , was seen at the game with Geffen .
" Mr. Sterling has never expressed a desire to sell any part of his team , " Clippers president Andy Roeser told the Los Angeles Times on Tuesday .
" Because it is an asset of remarkable value , it 's true that there have been countless inquiries over the years .
But the Clippers have never been for sale . "
The Clippers , to this point , have not been seriously mentioned along with teams such as Chicago , New York and New Jersey as a viable threat to lure James away from the Cleveland Cavaliers in free agency .
That 's despite the fact that the Clippers can offer him a promising group of potential sidekicks -- led by All - Star center Chris Kaman , forward Blake Griffin and guards Eric Gordon and Baron Davis -- as well as proximity to the many off - court business opportunities that only Hollywood can provide .
Ozetta Hardy and Shirley Wallace want to get back the money they lost playing electronic machines at a bingo hall in Lowndes County .
The women filed a lawsuit last month against Whitehall Gaming Center LLC contending they and others who lost money at the center should be repaid .
The bingo hall voluntarily closed earlier this year amid the battles over whether electronic bingo is legal in Alabama .
Getting lost wagers back might seem futile .
But it 's actually addressed in state law , albeit in a 158 - year - old state law .
A lawyer for Whitehall points out that bingo halls in Alabama had been operating under laws passed in much more modern times .
But the Lowndes County lawsuit is among at least three filed this year that cite the old , rarely used law and argue that bettors should be repaid .
At least three other suits citing that law , among other claims , have been filed in the past three years .
Two of the suits were withdrawn by the plaintiffs .
One lawyer says he 's about to file another suit based partly on the old law .
The law -- 8-1-150 -- says contracts founded upon gambling are void .
" Any person who has paid any money or delivered any thing of value lost upon any game or wager may recover such money , thing , or its value by an action commenced within six months from the time of such payment or delivery , " according to the law .
Few people were even aware the law was on the books , said Blaine Stevens , one of the lawyers who filed the Lowndes County lawsuit .
" It 's rather an obscure statute . "
Stevens said the gist of their lawsuit is that the Whitehall Gaming Center never was a legal operation .
But Robert D. Segall , an attorney for Cornerstone Community Outreach Inc. , which ran the center , said the operation was authorized by later laws , and his clients will defend against the lawsuit .
" We believe the constitutional amendment allowing bingo to be played in Lowndes County overrides the statute ( 8 - 1- 150 ) , " he said .
The pre-Civil War law was enacted long before the constitutional amendment was approved , Segall noted .
Several counties around the state approved constitutional amendments allowing bingo to be played .
But lawyers for Gov. Bob Riley have argued in court that the constitutional amendments did not envision electronic bingo machines , which he contends are illegal slot machines .
Bingo hall and game company attorneys say the electronic bingo games are not slot machines .
But if they were , the players could be equally at fault and risk having their winnings forfeited anyway .
More bingo coverage : See related stories in the Alabama Bingo Files .
Ted Mann , a lawyer involved in a couple of the lawsuits , argues operators of the games should be held accountable .
" If people are going in thinking it 's legal and it is not , then they are entitled to get their money back , " he said .
The Lowndes County lawsuit and others filed against VictoryLand in Macon County , Greenetrack in Greene County , and one against a few Walker County bingo halls , all have sought class - action status .
That means they want to sue on behalf of all patrons who lost money at the bingo machines .
A bingo player filed suit against two Walker County bingo halls in 2007 arguing the facilities were illegal and she was due her money back .
She withdrew her suit for personal reasons .
Defendants in that case filed papers in court denying the games were illegal gambling and arguing that they were not liable for patrons ' losses .
Since that suit was filed , a judge has ruled the halls were illegal and ordered them shut down .
The lawyer who filed the 2007 suit on behalf of a Walker County bingo player , Garve Ivey Jr. , said he planned to file a new lawsuit in the next few weeks on behalf of other bingo hall patrons in Walker County .
" It 's much more clearer now that Judge ( Robert ) Vance has declared it illegal , " he said .
Ivey said the new lawsuit also will target gaming companies and try to get more money for charities that sponsored the games .
" I 'm interested in the millions of dollars that were shipped out to Oklahoma , Nevada and other places with no benefit to the people of Walker County , " he said .
Many bingo - hall patrons voiced disappointment and anger at having their bingo halls shut down during the past year .
But Stevens said some former patrons are changing their minds .
" When people find out that this was not a legal operation it changes their thinking about it , " he said .

Oil companies complicit in Sudan civil war , report alleges
By Brian Smith
12 July 2010
The European Coalition on Oil in Sudan ( ECOS ) — a group of 50 European Non Governmental Organisations — recently released a report , “ Unpaid debt : The legacy of Lundin , Petronas and OMV in Sudan , 1997 - 2003 ” .
It alleges that an oil consortium led by Swedish firm Lundin Petroleum ( and including Petronas of Malaysia , OMV of Austria and the Sudanese state oil company Sudapet ) may have been complicit in “ war crimes and crimes against humanity ” in Sudan .
ECOS notes that the Lundin Consortium signed a 1997 agreement with the Khartoum government for the exploitation of oil in the Block 5A concession on the border of North and South Sudan , an area not controlled by the government .
ECOS claims that the start of exploration in Block 5A set off “ a spiral of violence as the Sudanese government and forces loyal to them set out to secure and take control of the oilfields in that block ” .
The report says that in the ensuing six years the civilian population was forcibly displaced following indiscriminate attacks , pillage , killing , rape , abduction , torture and the burning of shelters .
It alleges that the Sudanese government ’s efforts to secure the oilfields included the use of “ artillery , ground troops , helicopter gunships , and high - altitude bombers against the civilian population ” .
ECOS estimates that 12,000 people died and “ almost 200,000 people were violently displaced ” in the process .
Jeffrey Fountain , vice president for legal affairs of Lundin Petroleum , has pointed to an open letter on the company ’s website refuting “ all the allegations and inferences of wrongdoing attributed to Lundin Petroleum ” .
The Swedish public prosecutor has opened a criminal investigation into Lundin Petroleum ’s activities in Sudan between 1997 and 2003 following the ECOS report , and has launched a formal investigation into the role played by Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs Carl Bildt , who was on Lundin ’s board during the period .
Said Mahmoudi , professor of international law at Stockholm University , believes that “ you have evidence that Lundin knew about what was happening , and they just closed their eyes simply because it was a question of millions and millions of dollars ” .
The report splits the events into three stages .
1997 –1999 : Commencement of oil exploration by the Lundin Consortium sparks war in Block 5A ; 2000 –2001 : Oil is discovered amidst intense violence ; and 2002 –2003 : A Military Solution .
In the first stage , Lundin Petroleum and the Sudanese Government signed the Block 5A Exploration and Production - sharing Agreement in February 1997 , just 10 weeks before the signing of the Khartoum Peace Agreement between the government and the Southern independence and defence groups .
After bringing OMV , Petronas and Sudapet on board , Lundin began seismic acquisition , and Khartoum sent in troops and the air force to keep the South Sudan Defence Force ( SSDF ) from controlling the oilfields .
The peace deal soon collapsed .
In May 1999 , the Lundin Consortium suspended its operations after an attack on its oil installations by the SSDF , though it soon after announced “ a significant new oil discovery ” comparable with the finds in Blocks 1 and 2 that contained an estimated 500 to 800 million barrels of reserves .
In the second stage , while operations were officially suspended , Lundin pushed on with building an all - weather road to the oilfield with the help of a major government offensive to protect road construction .
The completion of a pipeline from Blocks 1 and 2 to the Red Sea in July 1999 led to huge oil revenues flowing into Khartoum ’s coffers , which allowed the government to increase its offensives in Block 5A using newly purchased large - calibre artillery , helicopter gunships , and armoured combat vehicles .
The road was completed in January 2001 , when Lundin began drilling , and by March it announced a major oil strike with the field reportedly containing recoverable reserves of 149.1 million barrels of oil .
In the third stage the Sudan People ’s Liberation Army ( SPLA ) and the Sudan People ’s Defence Force ( SPDF ) , who had reunified following a cease - fire agreement in August 2001 , declared oil operations a legitimate military target .
Khartoum responded by launching a final major offensive to control Block 5A and to clear the oil areas of civilians .
In January 2002 , Lundin was again forced to suspend operations after an attack on its installations .
In March 2003 , after announcing that it would resume activities , Lundin Petroleum and OMV sold their rights in Block 5A to Petronas and ONGC Videsh Ltd ( India ) respectively .
In September 2003 , the Naivasha Agreement on Security Arrangements was signed by the Khartoum government and the SPLA ( representing the Southern ruling elites ) , as a prelude to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement ( CPA ) between the parties signed on January 9 , 2005 , bringing to an end two decades of civil war in which some 2 million people died — mostly due to starvation — and 4 million people lost their homes .
The CPA called for a future ( 2011 ) referendum on Southern independence and the sharing of oil and non-oil revenue .
It made the SPLA the de facto ruling group in the South and a partner to rule in Khartoum .
Under the wealth - sharing agreement all revenue was to be shared between Khartoum and the SPLA , with each receiving at least 2 percent of oil revenue .
The main impetus for settling the dispute has been pressure from Europe and the United States , because the 20 - year civil war hampered their ability to extract the enormous oil reserves that lie predominantly under the border region .
Southern Sudan produces over 80 percent of all the country ’s oil , which contributes around 70 percent of total Sudanese exports .
US oil companies felt that they have been hampered by Washington ’s uncompromising stance on Sudan , and felt marginalised by other foreign oil companies that were working more closely with the Khartoum regime .
In the five years since its signing , the oil revenue generated did not find its way to the wider population , where poverty and sporadic starvation are the norm .
Nor was money spent on much needed infrastructure projects .
In addition , the shaky alliances that went into signing the CPA have disintegrated , with Northern and Southern partners within the Government of National Unity at loggerheads , and divisions re-emerging within the Southern parties as the referendum approaches .
The SPLA government was accused of corruption , and along with the Khartoum government , of fraud during the recent elections .
E3 was last week , and I was lucky enough to be let into the NEXON press bunker to see all the new innovations coming out of the free MMO world of internet gaming .
It was awesome … for many reasons .
It was Nexon ’s first appearance at E3 , they were trying to make an impression , and they succeeded .
Why ?
Lets get into it !
First off , and I have to put this in somewhere , Nexon was the only company that I know of that had an open bar for the press .
If you ever get a chance to go to the Nexon booth : Go .
Ok , back to the real stuff .
Nexon made a great presentation showcasing three games they are delivering to the Internet community in the next months .
First and foremost is the new addition to its powerhouse game Dungeon Fighter Online .
Early in the presentation it was made clear that Nexon games are focus on one thing :
Fast paced , hard - core action .
If there was a game that exemplified that to a tee its DFO .
( Read my original review if you want to know whats its all about .
Do n’t read Adam ’s review .
I mean you could , but why have hamburger when you can have sex , right ? )
DFO will be seeing its official release and there are new goodies !
No matter what class you choose , tier you take , dungeon you go into , there is never an end to the action .
200 million players can’t be wrong , can they ?
Anyway , DFO is coming up with some new classes , features , and most likely those dungeon things as well .
Specifically , there is going to be a new class in the cadre of fighter called Gunner ( F ) . “ F ” you say ?
Yep , a fucking female !
And this is not just a reskinned female version of the gunner , but a new take on the whole gunner class .
She will have skills only available to her , so if you happen to play gunner and want to do something a bit different but just LOVE those duelies you can roll out this new class and have a blast !
There will also be new Avatar sets , and other buy - to - use items so if you want to jazz up your warrior you can jazz it up to the moon , baby !
And with the addition of new skills and spells , if you have n’t played Dungeon Fighter Online yet , then get on it during the official release , and kill some goblin bastards !
Stick around for part 2 of the look at the new Nexon warmachine when I talk about a game you ’ll wish you already knew about : Vindictus .
Do n’t say : “ You look tired . ”
Why :
It implies she does n’t look good .
Instead say : “ Is everything OK ? ”
We often blurt the “ tired ” comment when we get the sense that the other person feels out of sorts .
So just ask .
Do n’t say : “ Wow , you ’ve lost a ton of weight ! ”
Why :
To a newly trim person , it might give the impression that she used to look unattractive .
Instead say : “ You look fantastic . ”
And leave it at that .
If you ’re curious about how she got so svelte , add , “ What ’s your secret ? ”
Do n’t say : “ You look good for your age . ”
Why : Anything with a caveat like this is rude .
It 's saying , " You look great ―compared with other old people .
It 's amazing you have all your own teeth . "
Instead say : “ You look great . ”
Do n’t say : “ I could never wear that . ”
Why :
It can be misunderstood as a criticism .
( “ I could never wear that because it ’s so ugly . ” )
Instead say : “ You look so good in skinny jeans . ”
If you slip , say something like “ I could never wear that …because I was n’t blessed with your long legs . ”
Expert : Clinton Kelly , cohost of the TLC show , What Not to Wear .
Last week , I committed a terrible tax blogging sin : I used jargon .
I try not to use jargon on my blog .
I find it annoying , for one , because who wants to actually sound like a tax attorney ( no offense to my esteemed colleagues ) .
But more importantly , what ’s the point of reading a blog that you ca n’t understand ?
So , I ’m making amends with a quick explanatory post about basis .
Here ’s the context : there ’s a current proposal in Congress to reinstate the federal estate tax with a higher personal exemption and a “ stepped up ” basis for assets .
The proposal also includes an election for 2010 to be taxed at the 2011 rate with “ stepped up ” basis rather than at a zero rate with “ carry over ” basis .
So what the heck does any of that mean ?
Basis is , at its most simple , the cost that you pay for assets .
The actual cost is sometimes referred to as “ cost basis ” because you can make adjustments to basis over time .
So , for example , if you buy a house for $ 150,000 , that ’s your cost basis .
Say you make a capital improvement to your home – not painting your bedroom or changing the drapes .
I ’m talking a major change that adds permanent value to your home .
You add a second story or you attach a garage .
That changes your basis .
If that change cost you $ 15,000 , then your basis is $ 150,000 ( original purchase price ) +
$ 15,000 ( adjustment to basis ) = $ 165,000 .
Stocks and similar investments work the same way .
Usually the basis of homes , stocks and other personally - held capital assets can be figured out without too much drama .
There are , however , complicated maneuverings that go on with certain kinds of property like commercial assets and partnerships – it ’s best to have a good tax professional for those .
To figure out a gain or a loss for income tax purposes , you take the price of the asset at disposition ( in most cases , the sale price ) and subtract the adjusted basis .
That difference is your gain or loss .
So in my home example , if I sold the home for $ 200,000 , the gain is $ 35,000 ( $ 200,000 less $ 165,000 ) .
Traditionally , when a person dies , the gain on the property is n’t actually realized for income tax purposes at death .
That ’s because the law allows a “ step up ” in basis for assets held at death .
The basis is increased to the value of the asset on the date of death .
So in my example , if the home was worth $ 200,000 on the date of death , the new basis is $ 200,000 : forget about the purchase price and the adjustments .
When the estate ( or heir ) sells the property , the gain is the selling price less $ 200,000 .
Assuming that the sale happens close to the date of death , there is generally no gain – or very little gain – for income tax purposes .
In contrast , “ carry over ” basis means that the original basis of the asset carries over from one owner to the next .
You hear about this most commonly in the context of making a gift .
So in my home example , if the home is given away during lifetime , even if the home was worth $ 200,000 when the gift is made , the basis for the new owner is $ 165,000 ( the former owner ’s basis ) .
In a “ no federal estate tax ” world , this “ carry over ” basis also applies to property passing at death with a few notable exceptions ( including a $ 1.3 million exemption and additional rules for property passing to a spouse ) .
There ’s no “ step up ” like before .
You can imagine the difficulty in trying to sort out the basis then , for an asset that had been owned for quite sometime ( that banging you hear is the collective heads of tax attorneys smacking a table while staring , blurry - eyed at utility stocks held in certificate form ) .
It ’s quite the challenge .
This is the kind of thing that Congress did n’t spread around on the front pages of the papers when touted their repeal .
2010 is n’t exactly the magic bullet for estates after all but that ’s a whole other policy post for another day .
So , to recap :
Basis = cost + adjustments .
“ Stepped up ” basis = value of assets held by the decedent at death .
“ Carry over ” basis = original basis of asset carries over from one owner to the next .
Did I redeem myself ?
Some of the oil from the massive BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico will migrate around the tip of Florida and make its way up the East Coast , according to the calculations from a supercomputer at an Intel campus in New Mexico .
The Intel supercomputer , powered by 3,500 quad - core Xeon processors , has been running a complex program simulating ocean currents in hopes of giving residents , researchers and response teams an idea of where the oil from BP 's broken underwater well , which began gushing as many as 60,000 barrels of crude a day into the Gulf of Mexico when it burst April 20 , is going .
Intel , in an Inside Scoop column , said its three - year - old " Encanto " supercomputer , which was the third - fastest system in the world when it was introduced in 2007 and is now the 32nd most powerful computer , has been running the Parallel Ocean Program model , an experimental program from NCAR ( National Center for Atmospheric Research ) that was designed to measure the various flows and currents in the ocean .
Click here to see how Google Earth is tracking the oil spill .
Just days after the BP oil spill started , NCAR administrators decided to see if they could use this program to try to see where the crude may travel , according to Synte Peacock , an NCAR scientist .
" A number of us were discussing why there were no longer - term scenarios about the impact of the spill , " Peacock said in the column .
" Then we realized we had a perfect model to do just that - the Parallel Ocean Program . "
The researchers reconfigured the program to use the site of the spill as a starting point , then let model run .
" We basically dropped a ' virtual dye ' in the water , and then watched to see where it would go , " she said .
What the program showed was that the oil closest to the water surface - as far as 65 feet down - will be carried hundreds of miles by the Loop Current in the gulf until it hits the west coast of Florida .
The oil will move south , run around the southern tip of Florida and then quickly move north up the East Coast when it catches the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean , extending for thousands of miles .
" I 've had a lot of people ask me , ' Will the oil spill reach Florida ? ' "
Peacock said .
" Actually , our best knowledge says the scope of this environmental disaster will likely reach far beyond Florida , with impacts that have yet to be understood . "
To run its model , NCAR turned to Intel 's Encanto supercomputer , which is housed at the chip giant 's Rio Rancho , N.M. , campus .
The water - cooled supercomputer is housed in 28 tall cabinets .
NCAR and Intel ran different simulations that started with a different underlying current .
Then the system would run the simulation and track where the oil went .
According to Intel , the six simulations took Encanto more than 250,000 hours of compute time and used 1,000 cores in a massively parallel computing process .
What the program found was that while the oil in the deeper part of the ocean was moving slowly , that crude closer to the surface was moving faster .
However , the simulations showed that , once the oil hit the Gulf Stream , the current could carry the oil up to 100 miles a day , or 3,000 miles in a month .
Peacock said the simulations were less a forecast and more a possible projection of where the oil could go .
More work is being done in such areas as adding in such measures as the oil 's density and buoyancy , which will give the program a more accurate prediction , she said .
Meanwhile , BP executives are hopeful the latest effort to catch much of the oil spewing out of the break - this time to put another cap on the leaking oil well - will be more successful than past attempts .
According to news reports , about 81,000 square miles of federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico have been closed since April 20 .
BP announced July 12 that the cleanup efforts to date have cost the company about $ 3.5 billion .
Bad Idea Of the Week : Sarah Palin For RNC Chair
The latest bad idea from some conservative pundits ?
Sarah Palin for Chair of the Republican National Committee .
Doug Mataconis · · 31 comments
In the wake of Michael Steele ’s latest gaffe and the pressure that has mounted from some Republicans for his removal as RNC Chairman , some Republicans are putting forth the name of a possible replacement :
( CBS / AP ) Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele is in trouble with many in his party after speaking out against the war in Afghanistan .
Some are even calling for him to be removed .
And , reports CBS News Senior White House Correspondent Bill Plante , there ’s talk in GOP circles that Sarah Palin should replace him .
John McCain ’s one - time running mate and former Alaska governor is , as Plante puts it , “ the star of the Republican Party .
She ’s the top endorser , top fundraiser — and now could be the party ’s top dog .
Some members of the GOP base are calling for her ” to take Steele ’s place .
This talk seems to have started with a piece over at NRO by Kevin Williamson , who threw Palin ’s hat into the ring :
Allow me to chime in with my usual observation on this subject :
This is a job for Sarah Palin .
Palin would be a much better RNC chairman than presidential candidate or freelance kingmaker .
She ’d raise tons of money and help recruit good candidates , i.e. , she ’d excel at doing the things Steele should have been doing instead of appointing himself Republican pundit - at - large .
A Chairman Palin would help set the right tone for the Republican party without having to get herself entangled in the minutiae of policy - development , which has not been her forte
Leaving aside the back - handed nature of that last statement —- Sarah Palin does n’t know much about policy so let ’s let her run the Republican Party !
— the problems with Williamson ’s idea seem rather manifest .
For one thing , Sarah Palin is clearly the most polarizing Republican in American politics today .
She has high positive ratings among Republicans , but her national favorable ratings are worse today than they were at the end of the 2008 Presidential campaign .
Making her the public face of the GOP would alienate the very independents that the party needs to attract in 2010 and 2012 to be successful , and seems unlikely to engender much confidence among the big money donors that an RNC Chairman is generally tasked with cultivating for donations .
Moreover , as James Poulous points out , it ’s quite clear that RNC Chair is not a position that Palin would be suited for :
The position of RNC Chair demands a disposition and an education that Sarah Palin does not possess and does not wish to learn .
This is fine — few children will ever want to be Ken Mehlman when they grow up .
There is a lot to hate about life as a party chair , and the job will go down in history as a gig that only the Macker could love .
But the brute reality is clear : the next RNC Chair must perform , on command and on television , the full spectrum of on - message tricks , not just ringing platitudes but , turning on a dime , an encyclopedic host of policy details .
The next RNC Chair must reek of competence the way Bill Clinton reeks of confidence .
Sarah Palin would be a much better party chair than Michael Steele , in the sense that a shot of tequila would be a better meal than a Chicken McNugget .
Moreover , if Palin was n’t interested in being Governor of Alaska for her full time , one can hardly believe she ’ll find the job of RNC Chairman all that interesting .
What the GOP needs in a chairman is the kind of party insider that is seen and not heard , and who knows how to raise money without alienating voters and , as Reid Wilson reports , that seems to be exactly what they ’re looking for :
Despite a brief round of stories this weekend , ex- AK Gov. Sarah Palin ( R ) is not a serious contender to chair the RNC .
RNC members who control and influence big blocs of votes respect Palin , but they do n’t believe she will be a player in the party ’s future .
Steele has made a few gaffes , but RNC members shudder to think of a Palin chairmanship .

The names of eight men killed in a two - car crash in Co Donegal , described as the worst collision in the history of the State , have been released by gardaí .
The men died when a black Volkswagen Passat , in which eight young men were travelling , was in collision with a red Toyota Corolla last night on the Buncrana to Clonmany Road .
Seven of the men in the Passat died and the eighth is reported to be in a serious condition in Letterkenny General Hospital .
The driver of the Corolla was transferred to the hospital where he later died .
The names of those killed were released during a press conference at Buncrana Garda station this afternoon .
The seven dead men travelling in the Passat were named as ; Mark McLaughlin ( 21 ) of Ballinahone , Fahan ; Paul Doherty ( 19 ) of Ardagh , Ballyliffen ; Ciaran Sweeney ( 19 ) of Ballyliffen ; PJ McLaughlin ( 21 ) of Rockstown , Burnfoot ; James McEleney ( 23 ) of Minaduff , Clonmany ; Eamonn McDaid ( 22 ) of Cruckaheeney , Buncrana and Damien McLaughlin ( 21 ) of Umricam , Buncrana .
The driver of a red Corolla - Hugh Friel ( 66 ) from Dunaff , Clonmany - was travelling from Buncrana where he had been attending bingo .
Clonmany parish priest Fr Fintan Diggin and Buncrana parish priest Fr John Walsh attended the scene of crash last night .
Assistant Garda Commissioner Kieran Kenny said the crash was the worst he had dealt with in his 34 - year career and extended his sympathies to the families of the dead .
The crash happened “ a matter of moments ” after the black Passat clipped a white Renault Mégane , gardaí said .
The female driver of the Mégane , a local woman , was unhurt .
The Passat and Corolla left the road after colliding and crashed into a ditch on the side of the road , gardaí said .
The crash occurred on the R238 at Glasmullan , Drumfries on a short straight stretch between two bends about two kilometres from the North Pole pub .
The road remains closed and is subject to forensic examination .
Inishowen has seen a number of multiple fatality road crashes in recent years .
Five young local people were killed in a crash near Quigley ’s Point in 2005 and five eastern Europeans died in a two - car crash near Buncrana in 2006 .
National Roads Authority road safety expert Stephen Lambert said last night 's death toll was the highest number of fatalities in a single crash since records began in 1961 .
“ I have never come across such a multiple road fatality scene and I am finding it very difficult to take in , " he said after visiting the scene earlier today .
He said Donegal had been the focus of road safety initiatives over recent years targeting young drivers aged between 18 and 24 .
He said seven of those killed last night were in that age range .
Mr Lambert also asked people not to rush to judgment about the causes of the crash .
A Mass for those killed was held at St Mary ’s Oratory in Buncrana this morning .
Fr Rafal Januszewski , a curate in Buncrana , went to Letterkenny General Hospital last night to comfort the next of kin .
He said there were 60 relatives there and that in his seven years as a priest he has never experienced a tragedy like it .
He said hospital staff were extremely upset .
“ Many , many people were there inside - there were maybe 20 people in the corridor but they were very quiet .
Nobody was talking but some people were crying , ” the priest said .
“ They were distraught .
We were talking about this tragedy and offering words of comfort to help to give them peace . ”
Gardaí are appealing to witnesses who saw any of the three cars involved in the incident : the black Passat , registration , KHZ 7079 ; the red Corolla , registration number 05 DL 3967 or a white Renault Megane 04 DL 3497 , to contact them at Buncrana Garda station on 074 9320540 .
The Health Service Executive has set up a 24 - hour telephone information service for members of the community affected by the tragedy at : 087 2798412 .

“ No experiment can be more interesting than that we are now trying , and which we trust will end in establishing the fact , that man may be governed by reason and truth .
Our first object should therefore be , to leave open to him all the avenues to truth .
The most effectual hitherto found , is the freedom of the press .
It is , therefore , the first shut up by those who fear the investigation of their actions . ”
– Thomas Jefferson to John Tyler , 1804 .

In a recent story broken by the Daily Caller , numerous members of the media were exposed as being cheerleaders for the Obama administration instead of fulfilling the mission envisioned by the Founders and articulated by Justice Hugo Black : “ The Founding Fathers gave the free press the protection it must have ( to ) bare the secrets of government and inform the people . ”
In that context , this is a good news , bad news post .
The good news is the Associated Press launched an investigation that resulted in the retraction of a Department of Homeland Security policy of investigating individuals who request information under the Freedom of Information Act .
The bad news is that DHS has been collecting information on private citizens .
According to the AP , in July 2009 , Homeland Security introduced a directive requiring a wide range of information to be vetted by political appointees for “ awareness purposes , ” no matter who requested it .
Career employees were instructed to provide Secretary Janet Napolitano ’s political staff with information about the people who asked for the information .
According to nearly 1,000 pages of internal e-mails obtained by the AP , information was sought about the requesters , such as where they lived , whether they were reporters or private citizens , their place of employment and so on .
Employees were also instructed to designate political affiliation when the request came from a member of Congress .
The really bad news is that this is n’t the first time DHS has been caught using the agency for political purposes .
Some will remember the 2009 DHS report entitled Rightwing Extremism : Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment .
The report was noteworthy for its total lack of evidence to substantiate the title ’s premise and for lumping returning veterans , opponents of illegal immigration , defenders of the Second Amendment , and abortion foes with militias and white supremacists .
It upset a great many people at the time .
In response DHS assured critics that “ we do not – nor will we ever – monitor ideology or political beliefs . ”
The findings of the AP investigation cast serious doubt on the sincerity of that promise .
Ten months into the Obama presidency , Senator Lamar Alexander gave a speech comparing the behavior of the Obama White House with Richard Nixon ’s presidency .
He cautioned the president and his aides not to “ treat people with different views as enemies instead of listening to what they have to say … ”
That way , he warned , begets paranoia and a fortress mentality .
Among others examples , he offered the following in support of the Nixon comparison :
The White House Communication Director ’s announcement that Fox News , a major television network , would be treated as “ part of the opposition , ” after which White House officials swarmed talk shows urging other news organizations to “ boycott ”
Fox and not use any of its stories .
The President ’s own words that he was “ taking names ” of bondholders who resisted the GM and Chrysler bailouts .
Threatening insurance companies that resisted portions of the health care bill with taking away their antitrust exemption .
Sen .
Alexander likened such conduct to that of “ street brawls and political campaign consultants , ” but unseemly for the President of the United States and White House staff .
Politics has ever been a rough trade .
However , the office of the presidency requires decorum and propriety from the individual who occupies it .
“ As any veteran of the Nixon White House can attest , Sen .
Alexander concluded , “ we ’ve been down this road before and it wo n’t end well .
An “ enemies list ” only denigrates the presidency and the republic itself . ”
Is the Obama administration compiling an enemies list ?
The only certain conclusion to be drawn from this regrettable account is that a free and unbiased press really is the first defense against an unconstrained exercise of power .
Kudos to the Associated Press for undertaking an investigation to “ bare the secrets of government and inform the people . ”
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner made a false claim about the size of government spending being proposed by the Obama administration .
On NBC ’s " Meet the Press " July 25 , he said the president is proposing spending " as a share of our economy " that is " lower " than it was during the Bush administration and " comparable " to what it was under Ronald Reagan .
Neither claim is true .
The administration ’s own estimates project spending next year that is higher as a percentage of the economy than in any year since the end of World War II .
The average projected by Obama ’s budget officials is significantly higher than the average under Reagan or Bush ( father or son ) .
Here ’s what Geithner said :
Geithner : [ The president has ] proposed to freeze discretionary spending , to keep the overall size of the government at a very modest level as a share of our economy .
If you look again at what the president ’s proposing , he keeps the overall size of government at a very modest level comparable to–lower than what was in the Bush administration , comparable to what President Reagan presided over .
That ’s very important .
That ’s not true , as a glance at this chart shows .
It reflects official historical spending figures as a share of the nation ’s economic output , as measured by gross domestic product ( or GDP ) , plus the very latest estimates of current and future spending produced by Obama ’s own Office of Management and Budget .
According to the Mid Session Review released by the OMB on July 23 — two days before Geithner spoke — the Obama administration is proposing federal spending for next fiscal year equal to 25.1 percent of GDP .
That would be the highest since 1945 , the last year of World War II , when it was 41.9 percent .
( See table 1.2 , page 24 ) .
The administration ’s budget experts predict their spending will constitute a lesser share of the economy in the following years — assuming a healthy economic recovery — but still will average 23.8 percent of GDP for Obama ’s four years .
That ’s 3.4 percentage points higher than the average for all of President George W. Bush ’s eight years .
( Geithner said Obama ’s proposed spending is " lower . " )
And it ’s 1.5 percentage points higher than the eight - year average under Reagan .
( Geithner said Obama ’s is " comparable . " )
What Was He Thinking ?
We asked a Treasury spokesman to explain .
Gene Sperling , counselor to Geithner , responded , saying : " The Secretary was referring to … non-defense discretionary spending , " a narrow slice of total federal spending .
No , he was n’t .
Perhaps that ’s what Geithner meant to refer to — he did mention a proposal to " freeze discretionary spending . "
But he then went on to speak of the " overall size of government " — not once , but twice .
He said : Obama " keeps the overall size of government at a very modest level comparable to–lower than what was in the Bush administration , comparable to what President Reagan presided over . "
Geithner is n’t the first official to foul up this fiscal sleight - of - hand trick .
In 2004 , President George W. Bush claimed in an interview with NBC News that he had slowed the growth of " discretionary spending , " when in fact it was growing far faster than it had under President Clinton .
That time , a White House spokesman said Bush had meant to refer not to discretionary spending overall , but only to the portion of it not attributable to military spending or homeland security .
See " Defending Spending ?
Bush ’s Blooper , " Feb. 9 , 2004 .
Technical note : Federal fiscal years begin Oct. 1 , so the first fiscal year for which Obama issued a budget and signed spending bills was FY2010 , the current fiscal year .
By the same token , Reagan ’s years were FY1982- 1989 , George H.W. Bush ’s years were FY1990 - 1993 , Clinton ’s were FY1994 - 2001 , and George W. Bush ’s were FY2002 - 2009 .
Under the radar of this week ’s WWDC news is a small but very significant change to the iPhone Developer Program License Agreement .
The change is in the oft - controversial section 3.3.2 .
Here is the last sentence of the old copy :
No interpreted code may be downloaded or used in an Application except for code that is interpreted and run by Apple ’s Documented APIs and built - in interpreter ( s ) . ﻿
Here is the new copy :
Unless otherwise approved by Apple in writing , no interpreted code may be downloaded or used in an Application except for code that is interpreted and run by Apple ’s Documented APIs and built - in interpreter (s ) .
Notwithstanding the foregoing , with Apple ’s prior written consent , an Application may use embedded interpreted code in a limited way if such use is solely for providing minor features or functionality that are consistent with the intended and advertised purpose of the Application . ﻿
I ’ve said before that Apple ’s aversion to interpreted code and external runtimes is the potential for someone else to take the platform over .
That ’s not the whole story , though .
Games in particular tend to use engines and libraries that leverage interpreted languages such as Lua .
Many of these applications pose no threat , neither implicitly nor explicitly .
While explicit approval from Apple is still required , these new terms seem to acknowledge that there ’s a difference between an app that happens to have non-compiled code , and a meta - platform .
It ’s a step that should allow for many new possibilities .
Back in April , I reported on national standards proposed to end prison rape in the American justice system — - and speculated as to whether the pricetag was too high for corrections facilities t commit to implementing them .
Last week , the Department of Justice released a report from consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton detailing just how much the PREA standards will cost federal and local governments .
Last month , Attorney General Eric
Holder missed his deadline for implementing permanent corrections standards to bring U.S.corrections facilities in line with the Prison Rape Elimination Act , passed 7 years ago .
The Prison Rape Elimination Act Cost Impact Analysis [ PDF ] is an attempt to weigh the recommendation of the PREA commission against the financial concerns of corrections facilities across the country .
Just Detention International , bless it , sifted through the 414 - page document , and JDI executive director Lovisa Stannow has one major gripe with the accounting :
It only includes the costs of the PREA standards , not the benefits — - like people not being raped anymore .
Stannow :
Strong national standards aimed at ending sexual violence behind bars are urgently needed .
The Justice Department ’s own studies have shown that tens of thousands of prisoners , jail inmates , and juvenile detainees are sexually abused every year .
The measures recommended by the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission have the potential to improve safety significantly in our nation ’s detention facilities .
In the recently released report , Booz Allen Hamilton only examined the cost of each proposed standard , without considering the benefits and cost - savings that would result from instituting these basic measures to improve safety and decrease sexual violence in detention .
Beyond the dramatic impact on the well - being of inmates , staff , and society at large , the prevention of prisoner rape will decrease costs of litigation , grievance petitions , staff turnover , and the need for medical and mental health treatment .
Notwithstanding its focus on cost regardless of savings , the report found that the vast majority of the proposed standards are readily achievable without significant expense .
Three standards — - assessment and use of monitoring technology , limits on cross - gender viewing and searches , and inmate supervision — accounted for 99 percent of all estimated upfront costs .
Through innovative practices already established at forward thinking facilities , these expenses can be minimized .
Regardless of cost , corrections and detention agencies have a moral and constitutional obligation to protect inmates in their charge .
The proposed standards will greatly assist officials in upholding that duty .
Attorney General Holder should adopt a robust set of standards as quickly as possible .
Every day that he delays action , men , women , and children are subjected to rape behind bars .
Current compliance with the proposed PREA standards ranges widely from state to state — - and standard to standard .
While 98 percent of facilities currently comply with a standard of “ disciplinary sanctions for staff ” found to have sexually assaulted inmates , only 62 percent provide “ agency protection against retaliation ” and a mere 8 percent offer “ zero tolerance of sexual abuse . ”
The best corrections facilities in the country are as high as 88 percent complaint across the standards ; the worst are as low as 38 percent complaint .
Obviously , the corrections facilities with the lowest current compliance rates will have the biggest gripes about the costs associated with implementing the standards .
How long will the Justice Department continue to tolerate the concerns of these unsafe facilities ?

PHILADELPHIA --
Twice , the Philadelphia Flyers needed video replay to decide if a goal counted .
One did , one did n't .
Claude Giroux did n't need the officials to check his winner .
Giroux scored 5:59 into overtime to give the Flyers a 4 - 3 victory over Chicago in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup finals Wednesday night , cutting the Blackhawks ' series lead to 2 - 1 .
Game 4 is Friday night in Philadelphia .
Giroux scored on a redirection off Matt Carle 's pass , beating Antti Niemi to decide the third straight one - goal game in the series .
" I tried to get a stick on it , and it just trickled in , " Giroux said .
" Our line started playing well , so anytime your line 's going you just play better I think .
The whole team just showed up tonight , and we really wanted that win .
" Desperation was the key word , I think .
It 's almost do or die . "
The Flyers already rallied to win a series after dropping the first three games to Boston in the Eastern Conference semifinals .
While they talked all week about having faith they could do it again , the Flyers wo n't have to try .
Flyers coach Peter Laviolette said Giroux , who has nine postseason goals , was loose all day .
" He was smiling all day , came to the arena and had a great game .
Talented kid , " Laviolette said .
The Blackhawks , trying to win their first Stanley Cup title since 1961 , snapped a seven - game winning streak and a seven - game road winning streak .
Giroux ended the game moments after Simon Gagne thought he scored the winner , only to have replay officials rule the puck did n't cross the goal line .
The game kept going -- but not for long .
It was the second time replay was needed to determine a Flyers ' goal .
They went 1 for 2 -- but , oh , how huge that one was for the Flyers in their first Stanley Cup home game since 1997 .
Scott Hartnell had a no - goal overturned by replay to spark the Flyers to their first Cup win since 1987 .
Danny Briere and Ville Leino also scored for the Flyers , helping them win a game they desperately needed to avoid their second 3 - 0 hole of the playoffs .
Michael Leighton made 24 saves for the Flyers .
Giroux 's goal was the only shot in OT for the Flyers .
Niemi stopped 28 shots in the third straight thriller in the series .
Duncan Keith , Brent Sopel and Patrick Kane scored for the Blackhawks .
The Blackhawks had won 10 of 11 and swept the Western Conference finals to storm into the series busting with confidence .
They won two games at home without a point from Kane and had the road success to make them believe they would win twice in Philadelphia .
They 're now guaranteed a trip home .
" Right now it looks like they have the momentum in the series , " Kane said .
" But if we take Game 4 , then we put ourselves in a great position to go back and play in front of our home crowd and hopefully win it there . "
The Flyers were the beneficiary of replay to win this one .
The Flyers heard the goal horn twice on one goal midway through the second period to go up 2 - 1 .
Chris Pronger 's power - play slap shot was deflected by Hartnell , trickled through Niemi and eked past the red line .
Blackhawks defenseman Niklas Hjalmarsson 's diving stab at the puck cleared it back onto the nice as the goal horn sounded .
Flyers fans were irate over the blown call as play continued for another 1:42 even as the red light spun like a siren light .
When play stopped , officials reviewed the play .
Flyers fans howled in delight and Laviolette watched stern - faced as numerous replays on the big screen showed , in fact , the goal was good .
Referee Bill McCreary skated on the ice and declared , " Upon further review , we have a good goal . "
It seemed the fortuitous type of goal that would shift for good all the momentum toward the Orange and Black .
Not so fast .
The Blackhawks did n't reel off the second - longest road winning streak in NHL playoff history by wilting when the game got tough .
Sopel blasted a shot past Leighton from inside the point to make it 2 - 2 -- a shot the goalie likely never saw because of an ill - timed screen by Flyers defenseman Lukas Krajicek who was standing in front of him .
Chicago and Philadelphia swapped goals 20 seconds apart to make it 3 - 3 early in the third .
Kane was all alone on a breakaway when he beat Leighton stick side for his first goal of the Stanley Cup final and Chicago 's first lead , 3 - 2 .
Leino revived a suddenly hushed crowd when his rebound off Giroux 's shot tied it 3 - all .
" It 's a tough way to lose , especially in OT when you work as hard as you did , " Blackhawks center Jonathan Toews said .
" We had the lead in the third and they kind of came right back and took the momentum away . "
The Flyers seemed determined to win it in regulation and pounded Niemi in the third .
He delivered by stopping 14 of 15 shots .
Niemi was n't so lucky late in the first .
The Flyers struck first on Briere 's 11th goal of the postseason that simply left mouths agape .
Braydon Coburn 's shot bounced off Niemi's mitt , Hartnell made a blind backward pass to Briere who flipped a shot into the open net to make it 1 - 0 .
The first lucky bounce of the game came courtesy of Keith 's slapper that glanced off Jeff Carter 's stick and sailed into the net to tie it at 1 .
The goal was one of the few times the decibel level at the Wachovia Center returned to easy - listening levels .
The rocking sellout crowd of 20,297 was the largest ever watch an NHL game in Pennsylvania .
Until now , the WPA security version known as ‘ WPA2 ( AES encryption ) with 802.1x authentication ’ was considered as one of most secure WiFi deployments by most wireless security experts .
This is due to the resilience of this version to brute force dictionary attacks that can possibly cause intrusion into WPA / WPA2 PSK deployments .
Also , the version is free from the TKIP vulnerability that is present on WPA TKIP deployments and can be used to launch potential attacks .
However , with the newly discovered “ Hole 196 ” vulnerability , this version now too is exposed to practical security problems .
“ Hole 196 ” is the name of WPA2 vulnerability that will be showcased by AirTight Networks researchers in the coming Black Hat and Defcon security conferences in Las Vegas .
The vulnerability is , in fact , buried on the last line on page 196 of the 1232 - page IEEE 802.11 Standard ( Revision , 2007 ) .
And that ’s why AirTight Networks named the vulnerability as “ Hole 196 . ”
“ Hole 196 ” vulnerability can lead to a potentially fatal insider attack , where an insider can bypass the WPA2 private key encryption and authentication to scan the authorized devices for vulnerabilities , install malware on these and steal personal or confidential corporate information from the devices .
Although specifically mentioned for WPA2 , the vulnerability applies to the WPA version also , irrespective of the authentication method used .
Exploiting the ' Hole 196 ' vulnerability is simple and easy .
Hence , the vulnerability can lead to practical insider attacks ( launched by disgruntled employees or Cyberspies ) when compared with the WPA TKIP vulnerability , which was largely of theoretical interest and difficult to exploit for launching any practical attacks .
To learn more about the “ Hole 196 ” vulnerability , you need to wait for the live demo of the same entitled " WPA Too ? ! " , which is scheduled at BlackHat Arsenal on July 29 and at Defcon 18 on July 31 in Las Vegas .
A remake of 1994 film The Crow is starting to fly - producer Edward Pressman has confirmed he 's already offered the lead role to a " major actor " .
Brandon
Lee died while filming the original movie , about a murdered rocker who comes back from the dead to seek revenge .
Director Alex Proyas completed the film as a tribute to Lee , and now the story is to be remade later this year .
Pressman has opened up about his plans for the revamp , telling MTV , " ( We 've got an offer out ) to a major actor and things are moving ahead very aggressively , with the aim of doing the film this year .
( It will be ) quite different from Alex Proyas ' approach with the original Crow .
" The setting is the southwest - the Mexico / Arizona area - and an urban ( setting ) , Detroit or Pittsburgh or something like that .
There are two locations that the film is set ( in ) .
Its initial platform is in the southwest and then it moves to the big city in the north , middle or eastern America , and then back . "
Last night Jon Stewart took his critique of President Obama – and his response to the BP Oil Spill – to a level not seen since , well , the Bush administration .
How bad was it ?
Stewart even made fun of Obama ’s ass kicking commentary by busting out his old George W. Bush impersonation ( heh heh heh . )
Has Obama completely lost Stewart ( and his legion of fans ) ?
Probably not yet .
But when The Daily Show host notices looks like a pattern of rhetorical bullsh * t … well , perhaps we should stay tuned for more to come .
The White House communications office is probably a little more stressed today than normal , because losing the hearts and minds of Daily Show viewers cannot be good news .
In the following clip , Stewart took apart the many absurdities surrounding the oil spill ( and its media coverage ) but saved his harshest critiques for Obama , claiming that he ’s succumbed to pressure of media pundits who have demanded that he show more emotion ( ergo , the ass kicking line . )
But it was the president ’s professorial style , especially his oft - repeated comment that problems are “ complicated , ” that seemed to be Stewart ’s most effective criticism .
Playing repeated clips of Obama claiming that whatever issue of the day is complex and complicated – as he has said about health care , the oil spill clean - up and other countless topics – no longer has the intended effect of demonstrating a thoughtful mien ; it ’s beginning look more like a Presidential excuse , or worse , that every issue is too complicated for his administration to be effective .
Stewart summed up the nine - minute segment with a larger critique of any Government response as he exasperated , “ It can not be that the only thing that our government is good for anymore is war .
We have to at some point use the same urgency and preparedness that we brought to take other country ’s oil , to clean up our own .
So I ’m glad that you are looking for an ‘ ass to kick , ’ but right now I gotta tell you , the ass has been kicking you . ”
Have a tip we should know ?

The very special gift presented to 50 prop traders at Schonfeld Securities in advance of the celebratory July 4th holiday weekend ... was a pink slip .
The palliative reason given to these newly unemployed by founder Steven Schonfeld : it is all the fault of " black boxes , stat arb and high frequency trading . "
Welcome to the new paradigm - you are now all redundant .
Only robots are allowed to trade with robots .
But . But .
We thought they only provide liquidity ( er , viscocity - the specific gravity of motor oil is 0.8 ) .
Full letter below .
‘ On December 5 , 1988 we started Schonfeld Securities .
Very soon after , we started hiring prop traders , and many years later formed “ Opus Trading Fund ” .
Prop trading has always been and will always be an extremely important part of our business and certainly the one that is closest to our hearts .
The best Schonfeld traders will always have a place to trade and the capital to maximize their earnings potential .
We are committed to them and will always strive to provide an environment for them to succeed .
Sadly , however , we are re-thinking the notion that less skilled and less successful traders can be here forever without producing sufficiently for themselves and the firm .
For over 21 years we have always done everything we could , with the traders ' best interests in mind , to provide careers and opportunities for our traders .
We have always cared more than you could imagine for your careers , happiness , well being and future .
We truly admired many of your passions for trading and for the markets .
Over the years we have stood by you and you have stood by us as well .
There has been real loyalty on both ends and do n’t ever think we took your loyalty for granted for one second .
Bull and bear markets come and go .
Good trading markets come and go .
But unfortunately , our vision of the future of trading has changed .
It is getting much tougher for traders to make a living or get by .
The direct competition from black boxes , stat arb and high frequency trading which continues to grow at exponential rates is here to stay and has caused us to change our outlook for lesser skilled traders .
Based on the above competitive changes to the trading arena , we feel we are doing an injustice to both our lesser skilled traders and the firm by keeping them around .
At best , they will barely get by and that ’s not why we are in his business or what they should be here for .
Unfortunately the career of trading is not a good option for lesser skilled traders going forward .
We will be letting go many of these traders over the next 6 - 12 months .
It is with deep regret and the hardest thing we have had to do since the inception of the firm in 1988 .
It truly saddens us to do this , but we are doing the traders who will not be making a living going forward a favor , so they can venture into different careers .
It is even more painful since many of you have been so loyal and really good guys .
To those of you that we ultimately let go , we deeply apologize but whether you understand it immediately or not , it truly is best for you .
After discussions with the managers and exhaustive quantitative research our objective will be to reduce the number of traders we have down to those that we believe will make a great or very good living trading for years and years to come with the necessary skills needed .
The traders who are newer to trading will be given some extra time to potentially have their skills stand out .
The days of a trader making a living by generating $ 50 k to $ 75 k of adjusted gross annually are over .
There is room for only highly motivated , skilled and developing traders that can add value to each other and the firm .
Once again , we wish it was different and are extremely sorry for those that do n’t make it .
China is bracing itself for more floods , with a potential new deluge on the Yangtze river , downstream from the huge Three Gorges Dam .
Over 1,000 people are already dead or missing after what has been described as the worst flooding in decades .
The Red Cross warns that food supplies for the next six months will be disrupted .

Millions of people have been affected and more than 300,000 people had been moved out of the area , Qing Hui Gu , the Red Cross 's regional disaster management coordinator for east Asia , who has just returned from Hubei province , told RFI .
“ At the moment we ’re looking at relief supplies , tents and food supplies for these people living in temporary shelters , ” he says .
Floods often happen at this time of year , he says , but this year the rain has been so heavy that the river will probably not subside until September after the rainy season .
“ The big problem , " explains Qing , “ is the millions of hectares of farmland which have been destroyed .
We are concerned about the food for the next six months . ”
Qing says the Chinese government has intensified its contribution to the relief effort with families receiving help .
“ In the long run , there will be huge needs for support after the lost harvest , " he warns .
" There will be huge amounts of money needed for China to help support people back into their normal life . ”
On Friday , the three Gorges reservoir hit the 159 - metre mark .
That 's the highest mark ever , according to the water resources ministry - and only 16 metres below its maximum capacity .
The dam is also one of the world ’s largest hydroelectric project and is meant to be a barrier against floods , but authorities now face the delicate task of emptying the reservoir as fast as possible without creating more floods further down the stream .
Meanwhile , the Jiangxi government says the hard - hit eastern province downstream is at a “ critical juncture ” in terms of flood control .
Authorities have been ordered to increase flood prevention along the dozens of rivers that have been already affected by weeks of heavy rains .
Many Chinese rivers have exceeded their danger marks .
In recent weeks , the output of the dam ’s spill gates has risen from 25,000 cubic metres per second to 40,000 cubic metres .

About six weeks ago , when I blogged about the Adobe Reader / Flash 0 - day that was making the rounds back then , I talked about generating automated shellcode dumps with Pin .
In this post I want to talk a bit about Pin , dynamic binary instrumentation , and the shellcode dumper Pintool we developed at zynamics .
Dynamic binary instrumentation is a technique for analyzing binary files by executing the files and injecting analysis code into the binary file at runtime .
This method is not exactly new .
It has been in use for many years already , for example in program verification , profiling , and compiler optimization .
However , despite its amazing power and ease of use , dynamic binary instrumentation is still not widely used by binary code reverse engineers .
The two most important dynamic binary instrumentation tools for binary code reverse engineers are Pin and DynamoRIO .
Pin is developed by Intel and provided by the University of Virginia while DynamoRIO is a collaboration between Hewlett - Packard and MIT .
Both are free to use but only DynamoRIO is open source .
In general , both Pin and DynamoRIO are very similar to use .
If you want to use either tool you have to write a C or C++ plugin that contains your analysis code .
This code is then injected into the target process by Pin or DynamoRIO .
For most reverse engineering purposes , Pin and DynamoRIO are both equally useful and when you talk to reverse engineers who make use of dynamic binary instrumentation it often seems to be a matter of personal taste which tool they prefer .
At zynamics we use Pin because the API for analysis code seems cleaner to us .
Let ’s get back to shellcode dumping now .
The idea behind shellcode detection is rather simple :
Whenever an instruction is executed , check if that instruction belongs to a section of a loaded module in the address space of the target process .
If that ’s the case , then the instruction is considered legit ( not shellcode ) .
If , however , the instruction is outside of any module section , and therefore most likely on the stack or allocated heap memory , the instruction is considered shellcode .
This heuristic is not perfect , of course .
However , it works surprisingly well in practice .
In fact , the Pintool we developed does exactly this .
For every executed instruction in the target process it performs the check described in the above paragraph .
Until shellcode is found , the Pintool keeps track of up to 100 legit instructions executed before the shellcode .
Then , when shellcode is found , it dumps the legit instructions before the shellcode and the shellcode itself .
The big value of our Pintool is not that it dumps the shellcode .
The big value is that it tells you exactly where control flow is transferred from the legit code to the shellcode .
With this information you can quickly find the vulnerability in the exploited program .
If you are really interested in the shellcode , you can also just set a breakpoint on the last legit instruction before the shellcode and do a manual analysis from there .
You can find the complete documented source of our shellcode dumper Pintool on the zynamics GitHub .
The source code is surprisingly short and I did my best to document the code .
If you are having any questions about the source code , please leave a comment to this blog entry or contact me in some other way .
Let ’s take a look at the output of a sample run now .
You can find the full trace log on GitHub but here are the important parts .
What you always want to look for is the string “ Executed before ” .
These are the legit instructions before control flow is transferred to the shellcode .
Ignore the first occurence of this string .
I have not had a deeper look what code is recognized as shellcode there , but it might be JIT - compiled Adobe Reader JavaScript code ( which also does not belong to any section of any module and is therefore detected as shellcode ) .
The second occurence of the string is what you want to look at .

The log clearly shows that control flow is transferred from EScript.api ( the Adobe Reader JavaScript engine ) to Multimedia.api ( the Adobe Reader multimedia library ) and then to shellcode which does not lie in any module section .
You can even see that the exploit code controls the memory address of [ edx + 0x4 ] in the last executed instruction of Multimedia .api .
With this knowledge you can work back from this point to see what exactly the vulnerability is that was exploited .
In the example , the vulnerability was the use - after - free media .new Player vulnerability of older Adobe Reader versions .
This vulnerability uses JavaScript code to trigger a bug in the Multimedia API .
In case you are wondering about gaps in the instruction trace ( for example at calls ) , please note that each instruction is only dumped once .
So , if a function is called twice , the second call is not dumped to the output file anymore .
This behavior was added to keep log files small .
I think the shellcode dumper is a good example for a first Pintool .
The idea behind it is really simple and the actual Pintool can be improved by interested readers many ways ( dump register values or improve the shellcode detection heuristic , for example ) .
If you are making improvements to the tool , please let us know .
Endless War Causing Trouble At The Top ?
Are new war strategies putting too much strain on commanders in the field ?
Doug Mataconis · · 4 comments
In addition to the troops , and the American public , America ’s nine - year long War on Terror seems to be having an impact on America ’s military leadership :
Since 2001 , a dozen commanders have cycled through the top jobs in Iraq , Afghanistan and the U.S. Central Command , which oversees both wars .
Three of those commanders — including the recently dismissed Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal — have been fired or resigned under pressure .
History has judged many others harshly , and only two , Gen. David H. Petraeus and Gen. Ray Odierno , are widely praised as having mastered the complex mixture of skills that running America ’s wars demands .
For the military , this record of mediocrity raises a vexing question :
What is wrong with the system that produces top generals ?
Much of what top commanders do in such places as Afghanistan and Iraq bears little relation to the military skills that helped them rise through the ranks , military officials said .
Today ’s wars demand that top commanders act like modern viceroys , overseeing military operations and major economic development efforts .
They play dominant roles in the internal politics of the countries where their troops fight .
When support for these long wars inevitably flags back home , the White House often depends on its generals to sell the administration ’s approach to lawmakers and a skeptical American public .
To the military ’s extreme discomfort , its generals often act like shadow cabinet secretaries .
“ What we ask of these generals is a very unusual skill set , ” said Stephen Biddle , a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations , who has advised both Petraeus and McChrystal .
“ It is a hard thing for anyone to do , much less than someone who comes to it so late in life . ”
And the fact that , to some extent , the mission we ’re asking these Generals to fulfill is n’t exactly the one that they ’ve been spending their lives training for .
In addition to being successful on the battlefield , we ’re also asking them to be diplomats , cultural ambassadors , negotiators with local tribesman , and , of course , spokesmen to the international media .
None of these are skills that the military spends much time teaching it ’s officers and , it ’s clear that some of America ’s greatest Generals through history ( i.e. , Sherman , Patton , MacArthur , Bradley ) would not be well - suited to the task of being , so to say , a modern Major - General .
So , finding the right General for the task may not be as easy as it seems .
That does n’t mean that the military is n’t looking , though :
The struggle to produce successful senior commanders has spurred a search in the Pentagon for the magic formula that will produce more warrior - diplomats .
One school of thought holds that , given the breadth of skills required for today ’s high - command jobs , officers should be selected and groomed at an early stage of their careers , with tours in Washington , battlefield commands and time in civilian graduate schools .
Petraeus spent extensive time working for three top generals ; two of his tours were in the Pentagon , where he worked directly for the both the Army chief of staff and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the late 1990s .
His unusual career path generated grumbling among peers who thought that real officers should be in the field .
Others complained that he seemed to be trying too hard to make top rank .
But the experience is now seen as having given him the political savvy he has needed to be successful in the latter part of his career .
Currently , all of the armed services are hatching plans to send more of their high - performing young officers to graduate school .
Air Force Gen. Norton A. Schwartz , for example , has posited that more pilots with PhDs will increase his service ’s “ intellectual throw - weight . ”
But the military remains deeply uncomfortable with idea of targeting a subset of officers for an elite education , with the aim of installing them in senior command slots decades later .
(…)
There is also widespread skepticism that the military ’s slow - moving bureaucracy can come up with a system for routinely producing innovative officers with the political , bureaucratic and battlefield skills needed to lead at the highest levels .
“ A lot of the service ’s efforts feel like groping in the dark , ” said Biddle , of the Council on Foreign Relations .
One could say that about much of our current war strategy , actually .

The mystery of why thresher sharks have such huge tails has been solved .
For years , biologists have been unsure why thresher sharks uniquely sport tails that can grow as long as the shark 's body .
Now video footage has confirmed their true function : thresher sharks use their huge tails to swat and stun much smaller prey fish .
The discovery explains why thresher sharks are often caught by their tails by baited long - line fishing gear .
Three species of thresher shark swim the oceans : the common thresher ( Alopias vulpinus ) , bigeye thresher ( A. superciliosus ) and pelagic thresher ( A. pelagicus ) .
Each species has a similar general appearance , including an elongated tail which can extend up to half the total shark 's length .
Biologists have guessed that the sharks might use their tails to stun prey .
Thresher sharks are frequently caught by the tail by long - line fishing hooks baited with small fish , or by fishing boats dragging slow - moving lure fish .
There is also a report dating back to 1923 of a thresher shark being observed to use its tail while feeding .
But until now , there has been no documentary evidence proving what the sharks use their tails for .
That was until marine biologist Dr Chugey Sepulveda and colleagues at The Pfleger Institute of Environmental Research in Oceanside , California , US and the University of Massachusetts in Dartmouth , US decided to film thresher sharks feeding in the wild .
To flick or strike ?
To do so , the researchers towed a submersible video camera behind a research boat cruising the waters of southern California .
In front of the camera , they towed two baited lines , hoping to lure in common thresher sharks , which commonly feed on dense schools of anchovy and sardine .
Over 27 separate days , the team recorded 650 minutes of footage .
During this time , they filmed 33 common thresher sharks swimming near or approaching the bait .
Remarkably , 14 of the 33 sharks attempted to strike the bait fish with their tails , hitting the fish with a success rate of 65 % .
Common threshers are often hooked by baited long - lines
The sharks struck with their tails in two distinct ways : either they waggled their body and surged forward , creating a wave down their body that ended in a tail flick , or they positioned their body alongside the bait fish , before making a sideways strike with their tail .
These observations confirm that common thresher sharks use their long caudal fins to pursue and stun their prey , which are then easy to catch , the scientists report in the Journal of Fish Biology .
" The common thresher is for now , the only species that this feeding behaviour has been documented for .
But we hypothesise that all three actively pursue prey with their elongate caudal fins , " Dr Sepulveda told the BBC .
It also explains why so many thresher sharks are caught by their tail by long - line fisheries , which dangle fish on hooks attached to long drifting fishing lines .
Surviving the hook
The study by Dr Chugey Sepulveda and colleagues was supported by the National Science Foundation , the George T. Pfleger Foundation , the William H. and Mattie Wattis Harris Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Bycatch Reduction and Engineering Program .
They are now researching how many thresher sharks caught by recreational fisheries survive .
Fishermen often return sharks after the struggle of the catch , but because threshers tend to be caught by their tails , they have difficult breathing underwater when hooked .
Most sharks breathe by swimming forward , ensuring their gills are ventilated by the water moving over them .
Thresher sharks caught by their tail face the wrong way and are unable to do this , and Dr Sepulveda 's initial results suggest more die after release than other shark species .
The researchers now hope to encourage fishermen to use more traditional methods that capture thresher sharks by the mouth , which would at least allow the sharks to continue breathing until they are released .

Sure sure , Froyo is great and all , but Google just blew our minds with two previews of upcoming Android features at I/O : OTA application installation and remote music streaming .
OTA installation is just as simple as you 'd expect -- after browsing to an app on your desktop , you can push it to your phone and install it with just a single click , all done over the air .
Interestingly , Google also showed music being purchased and transferred from Android Marketplace in the same way , which could indicate a deeper push towards music integration , or just be a nice demo .
Either way , it 's pretty slick stuff -- the fewer wires we have to carry , the better .
The remote music streaming is a little crazier : Google bought a company called Simplify Media , which makes a bit of desktop software that can stream all your music directly from iTunes to your phone .
The demo was quite slick -- you just open the app and push " all , " and all your music is instantly available .
Whether or not this 'll work over 3G or be limited to the local network is still up in the air , but we 're dying to try it out .
If you update to newest version of Java 1.6.0 update 21 and try to run Eclipse you surely seen on of this : - Unhandled event loop exception - PermGen space
So Eclipse started to become pretty unusable WTF .
However for now there is simple workaround just edit your eclipse.ini like this :
- startup plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.1.0.v20100507.jar --launcher.library plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.win32.win32.x86_1.1.0.v20100503 - product org.eclipse.epp.package.jee.product --launcher.defaultAction openFile - showsplash org.eclipse.platform --launcher.XXMaxPermSize 256 m --launcher.defaultAction openFile -vmargs -XX: MaxPermSize=256 m - Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=1.5 - Xms40 m - Xmx512m
You have to add - XX : MaxPermSize=256 m .
The most interesting thing about this is reason why this problem reappeared , an old problem actually .
The reason is because somebody at Eclipse team hard - coded to check jvm signature by checking the file jvm.dll if the company name is “ Sun Microsystems ” .
And as we all know because of the Sun - Oracle merge , and end of Sun existence , the company name changed to “ Oracle ” , and also the jvm.dll signature changed .
more about this read on link
What have we learned from this , never ever hard - code a string that can change in the future , even when it is not likely to change , maybe there is some kind of “ Oracle ” that will come and “ buy your string ” .

In your search , you may have already encountered or even engaged several online marketing companies that have made promises of getting your website ranked number one in Google in a seemly short time - usually thirty days or less .
In truth , those promises are usually misleading because more than likely , the selected search term ( keyword ) has limited value because they are rarely used in searches and therefore will deliver little or NO traffic .

Give us a chance to work for with you , you will not be disappointed .
Our Approach
Pop music has a way of forgiving artists on a hot streak .
You can say , do , or get accused of horrible things , but most of time , if you 're delivering the goods , the public will remain on your side .
This is why R. Kelly is like Teflon , and why outrage regarding Michael Jackson 's scandals and peculiarities only truly hobbled him when the quality of his music began to slide in the early 1990s .
Madonna , too , has proven herself capable of multiple comebacks following creative missteps and P.R. disasters .
Right or wrong , the social contract is simple :
If you bring the hits , we 'll put up with your shit .
With *///\Y/* , M.I.A. has broken that contract .
And she could not have chosen a worse time to do it .
The album comes not long after a New York Times Magazine cover story that portrayed her as a pretentious , truffle fries - eating phony spouting radical politics at odds with her extremely comfortable lifestyle .
The piece was devastating to her credibility , and her childish response -- putting the author 's cell number on Twitter -- only made matters worse .
It seems likely that *///\Y/* will only accelerate this M.I.A. backlash .
The record is a shambling mess , devoid of the bangers that characterized Arular and Kala , two of the stronger pop albums of the past decade .
It aims to capture a technological and cultural zeitgeist in its over - stimulated , digitally degraded sound , but the songs are too flimsy to carry her bold conceit .
Without compelling tunes , the obnoxious public antics , dubious political messages , and thin voice that had grated on her naysayers have become impossible for even dedicated fans to ignore .
It 's as if everything that was great about M.I.A. has been stripped from this music , leaving behind only the most alienating aspects of her art and public persona .
It 's hard to tell whether *///\Y/* is half - assed or half - baked .
There are certainly a number of good ideas in the mix here , but the execution is lacking .
Tracks like " Story to Be Told " , " Lovealot " , and " Teqkilla " come across like mildly promising demos ready to be edited into sleeker , stronger compositions .
Lead single " XXXO " sounds unfinished , as if everyone involved figured they may as well wait around for someone else to make a better remix .
Most of the songs are built out of digital clangs and electronic noise , but unlike Kala 's " Bird Flu " , in which chaotic clatter was the basis for a brilliant track evoking panic and confusion , this cacophony does n't signify much of anything , aside from perhaps a desire to seem confrontational and daring .
There are moments of interesting noise , but in the absence of appealing grooves or memorable hooks , it barely matters .
The production credits on *///\Y /* are n't too different from Kala or Arular .
Regular collaborators Switch and Diplo are back , but their contributions are disappointing despite their previous chemistry with M.I.A. " Tell Me Why " , one of two songs with Diplo , aims in the general direction of the pop crossover success of " Paper Planes " , but the beat is limp , and the song is marred by a poor , heavily Auto - Tuned vocal performance .
" Born Free " , produced by M.I.A. with Switch , is appealingly aggressive and punky , but the intentionally amateurish sound diminishes rather than accentuates its visceral impact .
" Steppin ' Up " , a Switch collaboration with Rusko , is the album 's most successful attempt at grafting her jarring new aesthetic to a traditional M.I.A. rhyme , but it 's still a far cry from , say , " Bamboo Banga " or " Pull Up the People " .
Both producers get lost in this deliberate clutter .
M.I.A.'s new collaborators do n't fare any better .
Dubstep producer Rusko seems to be the most dialed - in to her current muse , but his tracks are better at evoking vague menace than provoking physical movement .
Sleigh Bells ' Derek E. Miller , author of some of 2010 's most inspired and aggressive bangers , is wasted here .
Rather than providing a track as enormous as " Kids " or " Crown on the Ground " , his riff from the Sleigh Bells tune " Treats " is mutated into the haphazard " Meds and Feds " .
That song is not a total disaster , but it 's certainly a missed opportunity and a poor application of a strong guitar riff .
Sugu 's intro track " The Message " is the worst thing on an album of failed experiments -- a bad demo with a simplistic , paranoid rap that 's as rhetorically effective as someone in a dorm room ranting about the C.I.A. inventing A.I.D.S.
It 's not the best idea to kick off your politically charged album with a song that demolishes the possibility of addressing a serious issue about privacy with any degree of depth or nuance .
It 's not exactly a surprise that M.I.A. would opt to create such an off - putting and anti-pop album at this point in her career .
She may be reaching for an interesting and provocative style , but her motives seem defensive in nature -- reasserting her artsy , agit - prop cred not long after breaking through to the mainstream and becoming engaged to the heir of the Bronfman liquor fortune .
On a superficial level , *///\Y/* is a challenge , but it 's really more of a retreat .
She 's shrinking from her chance to engage with a mainstream audience , and refusing to live up to her potential as a pop artist .
One hopes that *///\Y/* is just a detour , a misstep , something she had to get out of her system before getting back on track .
Facebook , the most popular social networking Web site in the world , was founded in a Harvard dorm room in the winter of 2004 .
Like Microsoft , that other famous technology company started by a Harvard dropout , Facebook was not particularly original .
A quarter - century earlier , Bill Gates , asked by IBM to provide the basic programming for its new personal computer , simply bought a program from another company and renamed it .
Mark Zuckerberg , the primary founder of Facebook , who dropped out of college six months after starting the site , took most of his ideas from existing social networks such as Friendster and MySpace .
But while Microsoft could as easily have originated at MIT or Caltech , it was no accident that Facebook came from Harvard .
What is “ social networking ” ?
For all the vagueness of the term , which now seems to encompass everything we do with other people online , it is usually associated with three basic activities : the creation of a personal Web page , or “ profile , ” that will serve as a surrogate home for the self ; a trip to a kind of virtual agora , where , along with amusedly studying passersby , you can take a stroll through the ghost town of acquaintanceships past , looking up every person who ’s crossed your path and whose name you can remember ; and finally , a chance to remove the digital barrier and reveal yourself to the unsuspecting subjects of your gaze by , as we have learned to put it with the Internet ’s peculiar eagerness for deforming our language , “ friending ” them , i.e. , requesting that you be connected online in some way .
Facebook was successful early on because it did n’t depart significantly from how its audience interacted , and because it started at the top of the social hierarchy .
Zuckerberg distinguished his site through one innovation : Facebook , initially at least , would be limited to Harvard .
The site thus extended one of the primary conceits of education at an elite university : that everyone on campus is , if not a friend , then a potential friend , one already vetted by the authorities .
Most previous social networks , such as MySpace and Friendster , had been dogged by the sense that , while one might use them with friends , they were to a substantial degree designed for meeting strangers .
But nobody is a stranger in college , or at least that ’s the assumption at a school like Harvard , so nobody would be a stranger on Facebook .
The site ’s connection to collegiate social codes could be seen most clearly in its name , which , unlike that of every previous social network — Friendster and MySpace , but also SixDegrees , Bebo , Orkut , etc.— actually came from a preexisting , even highly traditional item , the freshman “ facebook ” that many colleges distribute to incoming students , with a photo of each classmate and a few identifying details .
Zuckerberg ’s
Web site would retain the exclusivity of its namesake through one …
At www.bestmurders.co.uk, web surfers are presented with faked advertisements for “ Cooking With Cannibals - 101 human entrail recipes to suit all occasions ” and “ Crime Scene Cleaners - Let us clean up your mess .
No questions asked .
No refunds . ”
The fact that the site is a promotion for the BBC Two comedy Psychoville only becomes apparent through clicking on a small link marked “ More information ” at the bottom of the page .
There are many things to say about Alan Greenspan ’s op - ed yesterday , none of them complimentary .
But what struck me is the passage highlighted by Tim Fernholz :
Despite the surge in federal debt to the public during the past 18 months — to $ 8.6 trillion from $ 5.5 trillion — inflation and long - term interest rates , the typical symptoms of fiscal excess , have remained remarkably subdued .
This is regrettable , because it is fostering a sense of complacency that can have dire consequences .
You know , some people might take the fact that what ’s actually happening is exactly what people like me were saying would happen — namely , that deficits in the face of a liquidity trap do n’t drive up interest rates and do n’t cause inflation — lends credence to the Keynesian view .
But no : Greenspan KNOWS that deficits do these terrible things , and finds it “ regrettable ” that they are n’t actually happening .
The triumph of prejudices over the evidence is a wondrous thing to behold .
Unfortunately , millions of workers will pay the price for that triumph .

Gruit is a drink from olden times , a drink much like beer , but made without the use of hops .
Instead of hops , bittering herbs of different varieties were used , and there is evidence to support the idea that beer without hops is a different and livelier experience on many levels .
Gruit was swept under the rug when beer purity laws ravaged the brewers of Europe in the 1500s , but is now making a revival .
Today 's Gruit Ale Today , Gruit is making a comeback .
More and more , brewers are realizing that although Hops are a delicious herbal addition to beer , they have their fair share of down sides .
As with any brewed herb , Hops convey a number of qualities to the beer we drink .
Before the beer purity laws which swept Europe in the 1500s , beer was made with many different admixtures , and Gruit was one variety which was popular .
Recipes for gruit were different depending on which herbs grew locally .
According to GruitAle.com , gruit usually included the following herbs : Yarrow ( Achillea millefolium ) , Bog Myrtle ( Myrica Gale ) , and Marsh Rosemary ( Ledum palustre ) .
This claim is also supported by the book Sacred & Healing Herbal Beers , by Stephen Harrod Buhner .
This book contains many ancient recipes for beer , including a section on gruit .
Additional herbs which have been found in gruit recipes are Juniper berries , Mugwort , Wormwood , Labrador Tea , Heather , Licorice , and some others .
There are a few factors to consider when comparing the inebriatory qualities of gruit in comparison to more commonly made beer .
It is held amongst those experienced in gruit inebriation that gruit rivals hopped beer on many accounts .
One factor is that hops create a sedentary spirit in the imbiber .
Amongst those knowledgeable about herbs , hops tea is well known as a catalyst for dreams , and creates drowsiness for the beer drinker .
Hops is also an anaphradesiacal herb - meaning that it lessens sexual desire .
While the alcohol in beer can lessen inhibitions - which may result in bawdier activities in many - the anaphradesiacal effect of the hops does counter act this to some degree .
Gruit , on the other hand , does not counter this effect and also has a unique inebriatory effect due to the chemical composition of the herbs involved in its manufacture .
One of noticeable aspect of this chemical composition is the Thujone content .
Thujones are chemicals known as alkaloids , which cause an additional form of inebriation when imbibed in beer .
According to Jonathan
Ott 's book , Pharmaecotheon I , Thujones act upon some of the same receptors in the brain as tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC , as found in Marijuana ) , and are also present in the spirit known as Absinthe .
Gruit and Absinthe sometimes share the same herbs in their manufacture , such as Wormwood , Anise seed , and Nutmeg , but it is the herb Yarrow ( Achilles Millefolium ) that contains the lion 's share of thujones in the gruit concoction .
Yarrow is an herb with many uses and plays a profound part in history and myth .
According to Buhner , its use can be traced back 60,000 years .
Through many different cultures , from Dakota to ancient Romans , Yarrow has been used to staunch serious wounds - it is even rumored to have been used by Achilles ( hence the name Achilles Millefolium , the thousand leaved plant of Achilles ) .
According to Buhner , the plants aphrodisiacal qualities are also documented in the Navaho culture .
As an inebriant , it has been used in the Scandinavian countries and in North America as well .
Bog Myrtle ( Myrica gale ) and Wild Rosemary ( Ledum glandulosum ) also have many uses in the realm of herbalism , but not nearly as many as Yarrow .
Both tend to have inebriation enhancing effects in beer , but also tend to cause a headache and probably a wicked hangover , if too much is drunk .
The use of Bog Myrtle in ale was continued through the 1940s in Europe and the 1950s in outlying areas of England and the Scandinavian countries - Wild Rosemary probably through the 18th century .
Although some traditionally made non-hopped ales have survived the pervasiveness of hops in the world of beer , the craft of making gruit has largely been out of practice .
But , in the golden age of craft ales in which we live , we can see a re-newed interest in this ancient ale and others like it .
Namely , beer made without hops : Williams Brothers brewery 's Fraoch , a revival of an ancient Scottish recipe , uses heather , sweet gale , and ginger .
Belgium brewery Proefbrouwerji's Gageleer uses sweet gale .
England 's Lancelot brewery has mixed styles with their Cervoise , containing heather as well as hops .
I think we will see more herbal beers in the coming days that will open the world of beer to more and more unique forms of inebriation .

Combined with the resentment of the treatment of her predecessor , it could spell years of recovery for the Australian Labor Party , while Tony Abbott takes the country back to the Dark Ages with the towing of boats and ignoring climate change .
The Prime Minister is aware of the stakes .
She may think she 's dispensed with the three key issues of her pre-election premiership - the mining resources tax , climate change and asylum seekers - but all loom as election conflicts .
There is no issue as worrying and divisive as an election fought on the issue of asylum seekers .
Immigration Minister Chris Evans confessed this issue is '' killing ' ' Labor , but is this reason enough for Gillard to join the Opposition Leader in a ' ' race to the bottom ' ' , in the words of former prime minister Malcolm Fraser , on the issue ?
Gillard 's stance on asylum seekers may not simply be driven by polls .
In some respects , her views on this issue have been evident for a decade : I recall her disdain for the Democrats ' opposition to the Tampa - inspired border protection legislation in 2001 .
In the past few weeks , Gillard 's rhetoric on refugees has been about acknowledging voters ' '' anxieties ' ' .
Thus , she has been expressing sympathy for those of us desperate about the lack of compassion in the migration debate , while appealing to those who may fear Australia is being overrun by those seeking asylum .
Instead of explaining away people 's fears or crafting a policy based on our international obligations ( such as processing claims for asylum on shore ) , vulnerable people are being used as election props .
Nothing is as awful in the human predicament as being homeless and stateless and afraid with no future and only fear in the past .
Pandering to groundless fears of being '' swamped ' ' or of an ' ' open door policy ' ' is n't working : another way has to be found and it must be from the point of view that these are suffering human beings often fleeing from war .
We should consider a national summit with some voices other than the usual protagonists .
Australians are handicapped when it comes to understanding refugees .
We are an island ; and some have an insular mentality .
We tend to glorify battles , leading to a softer understanding of war , which is , in fact , brutal and brutalising without exception .
Australians need to learn more about the misery of refugees and walk a mile in their shoes .
So much of the debate occurs with opportunist politicians or indeed great champions from non-government organisations and the law .
But we need the stories and views of the people themselves .
In the debate , the Prime Minister may have indicated that her preferred location for a regional processing centre is in a country that is a signatory to the UN Convention but , apart from that , there seems little difference in her imitation of the ' ' tough ' ' stance of her predecessors .
So the dark cloud still hangs over the nation .
Few leaders have demonstrated a deep understanding of the refugee situation .
It is different from £ 10 Poms like Gillard 's family and herself .
Hard work will not necessarily get refugees what they need .
I fear our Prime Minister , for all her abilities , has attacked the problem simplistically and in no better way than the opposition .
It has marred her honeymoon : trying to win an election on the back of suffering refugees is an abomination .

Yes , we will be coming to the iPhone soon .
The currently Android - only Google Goggles app will " soon " be available for the iPhone OS .
Google Goggles is a visual search tool that allows users to identify and display information for certain objects .
Take a photo of the Golden Gate Bridge , The Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh , etc. , and Goggles will identify it and then provide Google web search results for the object .
Google admits this technology is still in its early stages and only works for extremely common objects like landmarks , famous artwork , books , logos , and the like .
Goggles also provide some functionality already found in some iPhone apps like reading bar codes and converting business cards into text , allowing you to more easily add that information to your Address Book .
When asked in a Q&A if Google Goggles would be coming to the iPhone , Google project manager Shailesh Nalawadi responded … Google says that new APIs in iPhone OS 4.0 will help them port the app to the iPhone platform more easily and successfully .
My guess is we should be getting at least a few more tidbits during and the immediate weeks after WWDC .

PHILADELPHIA —
A family of four needs to make almost $ 60,000 a year to live on a bare - bones budget here without food stamps or any other government assistance , according to a study reported by Philly.com .
The study by University of Washington released today said two adults with one preschooler and one school - age child has to take in $ 59,501 a year to make ends meet — $ 5,890 more than the same study found just two years ago — while nearly 62 percent of Philadelphia households have incomes less than $ 50,000 a year , according to the report .
A similar study for New Jersey had bare - bones incomes at $ 60,912 in Burlington County , $ 49,739 in Camden County , and $ 56,752 in Gloucester County , the report said .
Measures include the costs of food , housing , transportation , and health and child care , and the writers of the study contrast that with the federal poverty level , $ 22,050 a year , which was based on costs in the 1960s .
Editor 's note : CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a best - selling author whose books include " Late Edition : A Love Story " and " Duty : A Father , His Son , and the Man Who Won the War . "
( CNN ) --
Those of us who knew Alex Clowson understood that his baseball dreams were all behind him .
We could n't have been more wrong .
Alex -- he insisted that we call him that ; " Mr. Clowson , " he said , was too formal -- was the one man in our central Ohio town of 13,000 who had been a professional ballplayer .
He had been captain of the baseball team at Ohio State , and had led the Big Ten in hitting in 1932 and 1933 .
The people who knew him back then thought he would have a shining career in the majors .
And in fact , the Cleveland Indians organization signed him to a contract .
But he injured his knee , and in the big leagues being just half a step slow means you 're probably not going to make it .
So from 1935 to 1941 , he played in the low minor leagues , for Class C and Class D teams like the Zanesville , Ohio , Greys , and the Oswego , New York , Netherlands , and the Monessen , Pennsylvania , Indians .
Which was all right with him .
Baseball was the love of his life , and he was very good at it , and he was being paid , although not much , to play it .
Then World War II arrived , and he was called to military service and his days on the diamond were over .
Those of us who knew him in the 1950s and 1960s were friends of his children , with whom we were growing up .
Alex and his wife , Betty , raised their young family , and Alex ran a succession of taverns and restaurants , some more successful than others .
His love of baseball never died .
He was an assistant coach at Ohio State for 10 years , and after that he seemed to be a volunteer coach for just about every league in town .
" Dad 's been gone for more than 10 years , " his daughter Wendy told me the other day .
" And I still run into people who tell me , ' Your dad was my Little League coach . '
Or , ' Your father give me my first baseball glove . ' "
If you were a kid in a summer league around town , you probably saw Alex Clowson in the stands .
He was always so encouraging ; his opinion meant more than anyone else 's , because he was the man who had been a pro ballplayer .
If you were n't especially good -- I can vouch for this -- it meant the world to you to hear Alex 's voice shouting " Nice throw , " or " Good hustle . "
Why am I telling you this today ?
Because in the early 1950s , before any of us were old enough to know him , he ran a tavern called the Musical Bar .
He was the owner and the bartender .
One of his steady customers was a young Air Force second lieutenant assigned to nearby Lockbourne Air Force Base .
The customer 's name was George Steinbrenner .
" Daddy told me that Mr. Steinbrenner never ordered an alcoholic beverage , " Wendy Clowson said .
" He would come in and order a Coke with a cherry in it .
And he would sit there and he and my father would talk about baseball for hours on end . "
This was many years before Steinbrenner , who died last week at the age of 80 , bought the New York Yankees ; George Steinbrenner with his Coca - Cola and Alex Clowson behind the bar were just two guys who loved to talk baseball .
Clowson never struck it rich in business , but Steinbrenner , of course , did , and despite the difference in their worlds they remained friends over the years .
" Every time we would see Mr. Steinbrenner , he would say to us children , ' Your father taught me everything I know about baseball , ' " Wendy said .
It may not have been literally true , but it was a lovely thing to tell the Clowson children , and they always were grateful for how Steinbrenner treated their dad .
When Alex Clowson was dying in the summer of 1999 , Wendy said , " the thing that he hated the most was that he had macular degeneration , which meant that his eyesight had badly failed .
He could n't read the baseball box scores in the newspapers any more .
That made him really sad . "
Three weeks before he died in a nursing home , he received a telephone call from Steinbrenner .
" They talked for a very long time , " Wendy said .
" We did n't hear the conversation , but we knew what it was about .
Dad and Mr. Steinbrenner talked about baseball .
Just like they always did . "
Clowson died on a July Thursday in 1999 .
Before the funeral , Betty Clowson 's telephone rang .
It was Steinbrenner .
He said he planned to do something to honor her husband .
And so it was , on the day Clowson was buried in Ohio , that Steinbrenner issued an order to his staff at Yankee Stadium in New York .
The Yankees were n't playing at home that day .
But Steinbrenner ordered that the big American flag in center field be raised , and then lowered to half - staff .
For Alex .
Several weeks later , a package arrived at Betty Clowson 's home .
Inside it was the flag , along with a photo of it at half - staff overlooking the most famous baseball palace in the world .
" I know that Mr. Steinbrenner was a controversial guy , and that there were a lot of people who did n't like him , " Wendy Clowson said .
" But I hope you can understand why our family loved him . "
We who knew Alex Clowson thought his dreams of baseball glory had drifted away .
But what did we know ?
In the end , against all odds and expectations , this impossible thing came true :
He made it all the way to Yankee Stadium .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene .
On 14 June , this year an interpreter for the US army called Hameed al - Daraji was shot dead as he was sleeping in his house in Samarra , a city 60 miles north of Baghdad .
In some respects there was nothing strange about the killing , since 26 Iraqi civilians were murdered in different parts of the country on the same day .
As well as working periodically for the Americans since 2003 , Mr Daraji may have recently converted to Christianity and unwisely taken to wearing a crucifix around his neck - a gesture quite enough to make him a target in the Sunni Arab heartlands .
What made Iraqis , inured to violence though they are , pay particular attention to the murder of Mr Daraji was the identity of his killer .
Arrested soon after the body was discovered , his son is reported to have confessed to his father 's murder , explaining that his father 's job and change of religion brought such shame on the family that there was no alternative to shooting him .
A second son and Mr Daraji 's nephew are also wanted for the killing and all three of the young men are alleged to have links to al - Qa'ida .
The story illustrates the degree to which Iraq remains an extraordinarily violent place .
Without the rest of the world paying much attention , some 160 Iraqis have been killed , and hundreds wounded , over the past two weeks .
Civilian casualties in Iraq are still higher than in Afghanistan , though these days the latter has a near - monopoly of media attention .
But the killing of Mr Daraji should give pause to those who imagine that the US occupation of Iraq somehow came right in its final years , and that American combat troops might even care to linger on in Iraq beyond their scheduled departure date in six weeks ' time on 31 August .
All remaining US troops are to be out at the end of 2011 under a Status of Forces Agreement signed by President Bush in 2008 during his last days at the White House .
American troops will leave behind a country that is a barely floating wreck .
Baghdad feels like a city under military occupation , with horrendous traffic jams caused by the 1,500 checkpoints and streets blocked off by miles of concrete blast walls that strangle communications within the city .
The situation in Iraq is in many ways " better " than it was , but it could hardly be anything else , given that killings at their peak in 2006 - 2007 were running at about 3,000 a month .
That said , Baghdad remains one of the most dangerous cities in the world , riskier to walk around than Kabul or Kandahar .
Not everything can be blamed on the present political leadership .
Iraq is recovering from 30 years of dictatorship , war and sanctions , and the recovery is grindingly slow and incomplete because the impact of the multiple disasters to strike Iraq after 1980 was so great .
Saddam Hussein poured money into his self - inflicted war with Iran , leaving nothing for hospitals or schools .
Defeat by the US - led coalition in Kuwait provoked a collapse in the currency and 13 years of UN sanctions that amounted to an economic siege .
Iraq has never recovered from these catastrophes .
When the UN tried to arrange the replacement of equipment at the power stations and water - treatment plants in the 1990s , the original manufacturers said the plant was so antique that spare parts were no longer manufactured .
During sanctions , the government had no money and ceased to pay its officials , who therefore charged for their services .
These days , they receive good salaries but the old tradition of doing nothing without a bribe has not died away .
Saturation levels of corruption render the state dysfunctional .
To give a small example : one friend teaching at a university in Baghdad became pregnant and applied for a month 's paid leave to have her baby , as was her right .
The university administrators said she could only have the leave , but on condition that she handed over the month 's salary to them .
What makes corruption in Iraq so devastating in its effects is that it cripples the state apparatus and prevents it performing its most essential functions .
In 2004 - 2005 , for instance , the entire military procurement budget of $ 1.2bn ( £ 787 m ) was stolen , though this may have been explained by the chaos of the first years of the post - Saddam Iraqi state , with the Americans calling many of the shots and nobody sure who really held power .
Five years later , would be reasonable to suppose that military procurement had improved , especially when it comes to essential pieces of equipment for the security forces .
Here , there is no greater priority for the government than stopping al - Qa'ida suicide bombers driving vehicles packed with explosives into central Baghdad and blowing themselves up outside government ministries , killing and wounding hundreds of people .
Iraqis often ask why these bombers are able to pass unsuspected through so many checkpoints .
Over the past year , it has become clear that there is an appallingly simple reason for this that explains much about the weakness of the Iraqi state machine .
The extraordinary truth is that keeping bombers out of Baghdad is , to say the least , undermined because the main bomb - detecting device used by troops and police to find explosives is a proven fake .
The government paid large sums for the detector , called a " sonar " by Iraqis , though it comes without a power source - and supposedly receives this from the man holding it , who is meant to shuffle his feet to generate static electricity .
Useless though it is , the " sonar " , a black plastic grip with a silver - coloured wand like a television aerial sticking out the front , is the main method by which suspect vehicles in Baghdad are checked by soldiers and police .
If arms or explosives are present , the wand is meant to incline towards them , operating in the same way as a water diviner 's rod .
What is striking about the bomb detector , officially known as the ADE - 651 , is that it has been repeatedly exposed as useless by government experts , newspapers and television .
It was originally produced in Britain , on a disused milk farm in Somerset , but the managing director of the company behind it was arrested in the UK on suspicion of fraud and its export has now been banned .
The only electronic component in the device is a small disk , worth a few pennies , similar to that attached to clothes in high - street shops to stop people walking away with them without paying .
Though each " sonar " costs only about $ 50 to make , Iraq spent $ 85 m buying the bomb detectors in 2008 and 2009 .
Despite being exposed as worthless , they have never been withdrawn and remain the main device for detecting al - Qa'ida bombers before they reach their target .
An Iraqi police chief told me privately that the police know their detectors do not work but go on using them because they are ordered to do so .
The presumption in Baghdad is that somebody was paid a large bribe to buy the " sonars " and does not want to admit they are junk .
Unsurprisingly , bombs which explode with devastating effect in the heart of the capital turn out to have passed through a dozen checkpoints undetected .
Corruption explains much in Iraq - but it is not the only reason why it has been so difficult to create a functioning government .
Saddam Hussein should not be a hard act to follow .
Part of the problem here is that the US invasion and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein had revolutionary consequences because it shifted power from the Sunni Arab Baathists to the 60 per cent of Iraqis who are Shia and in alliance with the Kurds .
Iraq had a new ruling class rooted in the rural Shia population and headed by former exiles with no experience of running anything .
In many ways , their idea of government is to recreate Saddam 's system , only this time with the Shia in charge .
It used to be said that Iraq was under the thumb of Sunni Arabs from Tikrit , Saddam Hussein 's home city north of Baghdad .
These days people in Baghdad complain that a similar tight - knit gang from the Shia city of Nasiriyah surrounds the Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki .
In many ways , Iraq is becoming like Lebanon , its politics and society irredeemably divided by sectarian and communal loyalties .
The outcome of the parliamentary election on 7 March could easily be forecast by assuming that most Iraqis would vote as Sunni , Shia or Kurds .
Jobs at the top of government and throughout the bureaucracy are filled unofficially according to sectarian affiliation .
In a crude way , this does give everybody a share of the cake , but the cake is too small to satisfy more than a fraction of Iraqis .
Government is also weakened because ministers are representatives of some party , faction or community and cannot be dismissed because they are crooked or incompetent .
Going back to Baghdad last month , after being away for some time , I was struck by how little had changed .
The airport was still among the worst in the world .
When I wanted to fly to Basra , Iraq 's second biggest city and the centre of the oil industry , Iraqi Airways said they had only one flight during the week and they were none too certain when that would leave .
Violence may be down , but few of the 2 million Iraqi refugees in Jordan and Syria think it safe enough to go home .
A further 1.5 million people are Internally Displaced Persons ( IDPs ) , forced out of their homes by sectarian pogroms in 2006 and 2007 and too frightened to return .
Of these , some half a million people try to survive in squatter camps which Refugees International describes as lacking " basic services , including water , sanitation and electricity , and built on precarious places - under bridges , alongside railroad tracks and amongst garbage tracks " .
A worrying fact about these camps is that the number of people in them should be shrinking as sectarian warfare ebbs , but in fact the IDP population is growing .
These days refugees come to the camps not because of fear of the death squads but because of poverty , joblessness and the prolonged drought which is driving farmers off their land .
Iraq is full of people who have little left to lose and have a deep anger towards a government which they see as being run by a kleptomaniac elite gobbling up Iraq 's oil revenues .
As in Lebanon and Afghanistan , where disparities in wealth are also huge , class hatred and religious differences combine to exacerbate the hatred felt between and within communities .
The anger of the dispossessed explains the savagery of the looting of Baghdad in 2003 , as people poured out of the slums of Sadr City to plunder government ministries and offices .
Iraq differs from Lebanon in one crucial respect .
It is an oil state with annual revenues of $ 60 bn last year and with unexploited oil reserves among the largest in the world .
Its oil exports may quadruple over the next decade under contracts signed with international oil companies last year .
There ought to be enough money to raise standards of living and rebuild the infrastructure after long neglect .
At first sight , oil could be the solution to Iraq 's innumerable problems ; but in Iraq in the past , and in other oil states , it has proved a political curse as well as an economic blessing .
Countries reliant on oil and gas exports are almost invariably dictatorships or monarchies .
Control of oil revenues , not popular support , appears to rulers to be the source of their power .
If there is opposition , then oil wealth enables leaders to build up and pay for security forces to crush it .
BLANKS : Post apocalyptic robot exoskeletons made of reclaimed wood
BLANKS is a series of wooden Robots and robotic exoskeletons created by Tyler Jackson .
Set in the post - apocalyptic world , the robotic exoskeleton would provide protection to its users against poisonous gases , viruses and scavengers .
For the present and more importantly , the sculptures speak of the artist ’s desire to reduce his carbon footprint and spread awareness about the environmental impact our actions have .
The robotic sculptures are made of found wood , and other objects the artist collected over several years .
In the words of Tyler :
An interesting thing happened while I was creating these characters .
I discovered the true importance of the hand of the artist in the work .
Along the way there were natural flaws , bumps , and even some mistakes .
These little incidents give the work character and are not something that can be recreated in a factory , but only as a true product of the process .
This is what makes the narrative compelling and the work truly unique .

As unfair as it is , what initially gave us hesitation about Mad Catz and Squier 's Stratocaster Pro guitar controller was that , well , it 's Fender 's second - tier brand .
Despite these prejudices from our youth , Harmonix pretty much sold us on it with one pretty badass trick : the ability to simultaneously play Rock Band 3 on Pro Expert and rock the same tune through an amplifier .
Bonus : in the presentation we saw , extra notes and added fills did n't seem to affect score .
So , that just about turns the uncanny valley of plastic peripherals on its head .
Just make sure you crank your TV 's sound system to 11 to not be drowned out from what 's likely an even worse screw - up sound .

The Knesset witnessed a rare eruption of violence on Wednesday when MK Haneen Zoabi ( Balad ) was cursed and shoved after relating her experience as a passenger on the Knesset members from coalition and opposition parties alike sought to shout down the freshman MK , but the furor reached a climax when Anastasia Michaeli ( Israel Beiteinu ) charged the podium in an attempt to physically block Zoabi from continuing her speech .
It took a battery of ushers to remove MK Eli Aflalo ( Kadima ) , who was called to order three times but remained standing in an aisle yelling and gesticulating until he was forcibly removed .
During the pandemonium , Arab and Jewish MKs scuffled in the aisles , and ushers were summoned to separate them .
“ Go back to Gaza , you traitor ! ” MK Miri Regev ( Likud ) yelled in Arabicat Zoabi during the heated debate on the Free Gaza flotilla .
Zoabi was released from police custody early Tuesday morning .
At the podium , Zoabi said she was “ astonished by the incitement ” and “ despised the words ” she had heard during the Knesset debate on the Monday morning incident .
She said that she had agreed to participate in the flotilla , as it wasa “ political , human and moral imperative to oppose the imprisonment of1.5 million people .
” She described the blockade of Gaza as an “ illegal , inhuman , illegitimate siege opposed by every politician who has a moralposition ... only the immoral support the blockade .
” She blasted the MKs attacking her , saying , “ Who is the criminal ?
Did I murder anyone ?
” At that point , one MK shouted , “ Check if she has a knife ! ” resulting in an uproar .
When Michaeli took the podium and attempted to stand between Zoabi and the microphone , Balad chairman Jamal Zahalka also ran forward to try todefend Zoabi .
A number of other Arab MKs also moved toward the podium , yelling .
Michaeli and Zahalka were both expelled from the hearing by Knessetushers .
Deputy Knesset Speaker Carmel Shama repeatedly tried to call the plenumto order , but was eventually forced to call a five - minute break whenthe MKs refused to calm down .
Over half an hour into the hearing , Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlindecided to change his schedule and to return to run the stormy plenum .
“ My role is to ensure Israeli democracy , and I am willing to take chances in order to do so , ” Rivlin admonished the MKs .
When Zoabi again took the podium , MK Yoel Hasson ( Kadima ) yelled toRivlin to “ be careful , because there is a terrorist standing next toyou .
” Although Zoabi , like the other speakers in the debate on the Gazaflotilla , was originally allotted one minute to deliver her speech , hertime was repeatedly extended due to catcalls and interruptions by MKs .
Rivlin finally told the outspoken MK to return to her seat , but sherefused and was forcibly removed from the podium by the ushers .
Following the incident , the Balad faction coordinator , Musa Diab , whorushed into the plenum during the confrontation , was told that he wastemporarily forbidden to enter the hall .
Also on Wednesday , MK Danny Danon said the Ministerial Committee forLegislation had agreed to debate a bill on Sunday that he had recentlydrafted , to allow for removing an acting MK from his position if he orshe were found to have committed incitement against the State of Israel .
Regev ’s office said that she had submitted a similar bill to the Knesset secretary on Wednesday afternoon .
Shama , shortly before the hearing , also announced that he had submitteda request to the Central Elections Committee to block Zoabi from beingable to run in any future Knesset election .

Defenseman Tyler Myers of the Buffalo Sabres has won the Calder Memorial Trophy for 2009 - 2010 , awarded " to the player selected as the most proficient in his first year of competition in the National Hockey League . " Myers received 94 of 133 first - place votes and 1,178 points , outdistancing Detroit Red Wings goaltender Jimmy Howard ( 778 points ) and Colorado Avalanche center Matt Duchene ( 755 ) .
Myers not only won an NHL roster spot as a 19 - year - old , he posted statistics befitting an established veteran .
The 6 ' 8 " , 222 - lb .
defenseman led the Sabres in ice time per game ( 23:44 ) , three minutes more than blueline partner Henrik Tallinder who ranked second .
He shared second place on the club in plus-minus ( +13 ) and was fifth in scoring ( 11-37 -- 48 ) .
Myers ranked at or near the top in several rookie categories , including average ice time ( first ) , shorthanded time ( first , 3:04 ) , assists ( first ) , blocked shots ( first , 137 ) , plus-minus ( T - second ) and points ( third ) .
He also was one of four rookies to play all 82 games .
The Sabres ' top pick , 12th overall , in the 2008 Entry Draft , Myers is the first defenseman to win the Calder since St. Louis ' Barret Jackman in 2003 and the third player in franchise history , following Gilbert Perreault ( 1971 ) and Tom Barrasso ( 1984 ) .
The Curious Rabbit Case Teacher Loses ' Rabbit - Phobia ' Trial
A German teacher has lost a defamation suit Tuesday in which she claims that a 16 - year - old student spread vicious rumors saying that she has a rabbit phobia .
The court case , which triggered nationwide headlines , was dismissed on the grounds that the student proved the teacher 's phobia as fact .
LEADERS of the global Islamist group Hizb ut - Tahrir have called on Australian Muslims to spurn secular democracy and Western notions of moderate Islam and join the struggle for a transnational Islamic state .
British Hizb ut - Tahrir leader Burhan Hanif told participants at a conference in western Sydney yesterday that democracy is " haram " ( forbidden ) for Muslims , whose political engagement should be be based purely on Islamic law .
" We must adhere to Islam and Islam alone , " Mr Hanif told about 500 participants attending the convention in Lidcombe .
" We should not be conned or succumb to the disingenuous and flawed narrative that the only way to engage politically is through the secular democratic process .
It is prohibited and haram . "
He said democracy was incompatible with Islam because the Koran insisted Allah was the sole lawmaker , and Muslim political involvement could not be based on " secular and erroneous concepts such as democracy and freedom " .
His view was echoed by an Australian HT official , Wassim Dourehi , who told the conference Muslims should not support " any kafir ( non-believer ) political party " , because humans have no right to make laws .
Mr Dourehi also urged Muslims to spurn the concept of moderate Islam promoted by governments in the West , including in " this godforsaken country " of Australia .
" We need to reject this new secular version of Islam , " he said .
" It is a perverted concoction of Western governments .
" It is a perversion that seeks to wipe away the political aspects of Islam and localise our concerns .
We must reject it and challenge the proponents of this aberration of Islam . "
The conference , which followed the theme
The struggle for Islam in the West ' was the first major event held by the Australian branch of HT since a seminar in 2007 which coincided with calls for the group to be banned .
HT is outlawed in much of the Middle East but operates legally in more than 40 countries , campaigning for the establishment of a caliphate or Islamic state .
HT 's platform rejects the use of violence in its quest for an Islamic state , but supports the military destruction of Israel .
But the group 's presence sparked angry protests outside as members of the Australian Protectionist Party ( APP ) yelled anti-Islam chants .
The APP met in a small park to express their need to " protect " the Australian way of life .
Conflict between the APP and HT amounted to an exchange of words , anti-Islam chants and the occasional drive - by of young Muslim men yelling obscenities from their car at the APP protesters .
One passer - by , a young Muslim man , yelled at the APP group : " You people have absolutely no idea " , sparking a fiery exchange of accusations and finger - pointing .
Nick Folkes , the Sydney organiser for the APP , believes that the HT should be banned in Australia and thinks that practising sharia law should be illegal in Australia .
" Sharia law is an archaic legal system that treats woman as second - class citizens , " he said .
" We 're not asking them to change their skin colour or religion .
But if they come here , they must reject sharia law . "

An explosion took place Tuesday morning near the border fence by the northern Gaza Strip .
An initial IDF probe revealed that the explosion was the result of a bomb planted on a cart harnessed to a donkey .
The donkey was killed in the blast .
The incident took place dozens of meters from the border fence .
One estimate is that the incident was an attempt by gunmen to lure forces to the site and activate the bomb , as the cart was unmanned .
The IDF is also looking into how the device was activated , and whether those behind its detonation planned to activate it at the time .
Besides the donkey , no one was injured and no damage was caused .
Military sources noted on Tuesday that terror organizations in the past have attempted to carry out terror attacks in various ways , including using animals .
Last year , the military thwarted an attempt by Gaza gunmen who used booby - trapped horses loaded with explosive devices and mines .
Meanwhile , later Tuesday , two mortar shells were fired at Israel .
No one was injured .
Last weekend saw an escalation on the southern border .
On Friday , two terrorists trying to infiltrate into Israel were killed by IDF forces .
Hours later , an IDF soldier was moderately injured from Palestinian sniper fire .
Watching the MSM Media yesterday , I observed that the coverage presented Israel ’s position almost exclusively .
Former Ambassador , Edward Peck , was on a smaller ship .
Edward Peck told the hosts of CNN ’s American Morning on Wednesday , " The purpose was humanitarian .
We posed no threat to anybody .
We were unarmed . " …
A former US ambassador who was on the flotilla that was intercepted by Israeli forces at it attempted to bring humanitarian aid to the blockaded Gaza Strip says " the people on the ship were defending " themselves when they attempted to fight off Israeli soldiers .
Inserted from < Raw Story >
The account of a member of the Israeli Parliament is more revealing .
An Arab member of the Israeli parliament who was on board the international flotilla that was attacked on Monday as it tried to take humanitarian aid to Gaza accused Israel yesterday of intending to kill peace activists as a way to deter future convoys .
Haneen Zoubi said Israeli naval vessels had surrounded the flotilla ’s flagship , the Mavi Marmara , and fired on it a few minutes before commandos abseiled from a helicopter directly above them .
Terrified passengers had been forced off the deck when water was sprayed at them .
She said she was not aware of any provocation or resistance by the passengers , who were all unarmed .
She added that within minutes of the raid beginning , three bodies had been brought to the main room on the upper deck in which she and most other passengers were confined .
Two had gunshot wounds to the head , in what she suggested had been executions .
Two other passengers slowly bled to death in the room after Israeli soldiers ignored messages in Hebrew she had held up at the window calling for medical help to save them .
She said she saw seven other passengers seriously wounded .
" Israel had days to plan this military operation , " she told a press conference in Nazareth .
" They wanted many deaths to terrorise [ sic ] us and to send a message that no future aid convoys should try to break the siege of Gaza . "
Released early yesterday by police , apparently because of her parliamentary immunity , she said she was speaking out while most of the hundreds of other peace activists were either being held by Israel for deportation or were under arrest .
Three other leaders of Israel ’s large Palestinian Arab minority , including Sheikh Raed Salah , a spiritual leader , were arrested as their ships docked in the southern port of Ashdod .
Lawyers said that under Israeli law they could be held and questioned for up to 30 days without being charged .
Contradicting Israeli claims ,
Ms Zoubi said a search by the soldiers after they took control of the Marmara discovered no arms or other weapons .
It was vital , she added , that the world demand an independent UN inquiry to find out what had happened on the ship rather than allow Israel to carry out a " whitewash " with its own military investigation … [ emphasis added ]

Software Development with Code Maps
Could those ubiquitous hand - drawn code diagrams become a thing of the past ?
Robert DeLine , Gina Venolia , and Kael Rowan , Microsoft Research
Software developers regularly draw diagrams of their systems .
To get a sense of how diagramming fits into a developer 's daily work , consider this fictitious , but representative , story :
Jane is a developer who has been on her team so long that everyone calls her the team historian .
Since the product just shipped a few weeks ago , Jane is finally getting around to some code cleanup she had planned for ages — namely , dropping a dependency on a library that is no longer supported .
Jane uses her development environment to search for all the places where her product uses the unsupported library .
She clicks through the results one by one and reads the code to understand how it uses the library .
As she jumps around the code base , she sketches a class diagram on a notepad to capture the architectural dependencies she discovers .
Partway through this code - understanding task , there 's a knock at the door .
It 's Joe , the newest member of the team .
He is working on a bug and is confused about how one of the product 's features is implemented .
As the team historian , Jane is used to this type of question .
They start the conversation by looking at an architectural diagram tacked to the wall near Jane 's computer .
To get into specifics , Jane draws a version of the diagram on the whiteboard , sketching only the relevant parts of the architecture but in more detail than the printed diagram .
As she talks Joe through a use case , she overlays the diagram with arrows to show how different parts of the system interact .
From time to time , she brings up relevant code in her development environment to relate the diagram back to the code .
After several minutes , Joe feels confident he understands the design and heads back to his office .
Jane goes back to her own work .
Between exploring the search results and answering Joe 's questions , Jane 's development environment now has dozens of open documents .
Jane tries to resume her task but cannot find where she left off in all the clutter .
She closes all open documents , reissues her original search , finds her place in the search results , and carries on exploring the dependency on the unsupported library .
This story illustrates the wide range of diagramming practice .
The diagrams range in quality from sketches to high - quality posters ; in formality , from idiosyncratic scribbles to well - defined notations ; in longevity , from the duration of a single task to an entire release cycle ; and in audience , from solo use , to anchoring a conversation , to communicating with the whole team or user community .
Although the practice illustrated in the story is widespread and useful , there are a few downsides where software could make an improvement .
First , the diagrams are typically not tied to the code .
To go from architecture - level to code - level discussions requires switching tools — for example , from the whiteboard to the development environment .
This separation also causes poor task support .
For example , Jane 's code search and notepad diagram are not tied together in any way .
The two can easily get out of sync and cannot be stored or retrieved together , as when Jane 's diagram was available during task resumption but her search results were gone .
Second , there is no transition between team - level documentation and task - or conversation - specific diagrams .
For example , Jane has to reproduce parts of the poster on the whiteboard in order to answer Joe 's specific questions .
Third , there is a lost opportunity to help deal with the disorientation Jane feels when confronting all the open documents on resuming her task .
Getting lost in a large code base is altogether too easy .
The code consists of many thousands of symbols , with few visual landmarks to guide the eye .
As a developer navigates the code , she follows hyperlinks , such as jumping from a method caller to a callee , with no visual transition to show where the jump landed .
The more she navigates , the greater the pileup of document tabs .
These navigation steps are not just for editing the code .
Software developers also have a frequent need for information during their programming tasks .
8,9
To try to find answers , they browse around the code and other documents , which adds both relevant and irrelevant documents to the environment 's working set .
With so much discontinuous navigation , a developer can easily become disoriented .
Better support for code diagrams in the development environment could support code understanding and communication , and could serve as a " map " to help keep developers oriented .
The software visualization community has previously explored different types of maps , such as zoomable box - and - line diagrams10 and cityscapes , 11 for tasks such as program understanding and analyzing project data .
These maps are typically designed to supplement a standard development environment .
Our goal is to integrate maps into the development environment such that developers can carry out most tasks within the map .
To address these issues , using a user - centered approach we are designing an interactive code map for development environments .
In preparation for our initial design we conducted a series of field studies at Microsoft Corporation .
We interviewed developers to find how and why they draw diagrams of their code , and we collected many example diagrams along the way .
3
We also directly observed developers at work to watch their information - seeking behavior and to catalog their information needs .
8
Finally , we did a participatory design of a paper - based code map to allow a development team to design its content and appearance and to witness how it supported their conversations .
1
Using insights from these three studies , we are actively prototyping Code Canvas , a Microsoft Visual Studio plug - in that replaces the tabbed documents with a zoomable code map .

How and Why Developers Diagram
To better understand how professional software developers use visual representations of their code , we interviewed nine developers at Microsoft to identify common scenarios , and then surveyed more than 400 developers to understand the scenarios more deeply .
3
The three most frequently mentioned scenarios were :
Understanding existing code .
Examining source code and its behavior to develop an understanding of it .
Examining source code and its behavior to develop an understanding of it .
Designing / refactoring .
Planning how to implement new functionality , fix a bug , or make the program structure better match its functionality .
Planning how to implement new functionality , fix a bug , or make the program structure better match its functionality .
Ad - hoc meetings .
Asking a coworker to explain existing code , vet a decision , or help work through a problem .
Developers rated these three among the most important to their job functions .
More than half of survey respondents indicated that diagrams were important in these scenarios .
Most ad - hoc meetings were small , involving two or at most five people .
While often done solo , understanding existing code and designing / refactoring involved pairs or small groups surprisingly often .
In a separate study we sought to understand developers ' information needs while carrying out their development tasks .
8
We observed 17 developers at Microsoft for about 90 minutes each , manually recorded their activity minute by minute , and coded these logs into 334 instances of information - seeking behavior .
From this data , we identified 21 general information needs , clustered into seven work categories .
Consistent with the previous study , we found that many of their information needs fell into the categories of understanding execution behavior and reasoning about design , summarized in table 1 .
Table 1 . Information Needs That Are Related to Diagramming Behavior
Understanding execution behavior Reasoning about design
What code could have caused this behavior ?
What is statically related to this code ?
What code caused this program state ?
What is the purpose of this code ?
What is the program supposed to do ?
Why was this code implemented this way ?
What are the implications of this change ?
In our observations , ad - hoc communication with coworkers was a common way of addressing a variety of information needs .
Information needs most frequently addressed by talking with coworkers included the following :
What have my coworkers been doing ?
What are the implications of this change ?
Is this problem worth fixing ?
What is the program supposed to do ?
In what situations does this failure occur How have resources I depend on changed ?
What code could have caused this behavior
This reliance on conversations with coworkers corresponds with the ad - hoc meeting scenario from the diagramming study .
From these two studies we know that developers have frequent , specific information needs when trying to understand existing code and planning code changes , and they often use diagrams when looking for answers .
This suggests the plausible utility of a code map that answers these needs either directly or through interaction .
We also know that developers often turn to coworkers to find the answers they need , and they create diagrams to supplement their conversations .
This suggests that the code map should be shared among teammates so that they have a common spatial frame of reference .
Designing a Code Map
The question remains , what should the code map look like ?
We collected many examples of developers ' visual representations of their code and identified the visual conventions they used .
3
These ranged from sketches on whiteboards to diagrams carefully made using a drawing tool .
We also looked at the visual conventions used by developers when representing code .
2
Box - and - arrow diagrams were by far the most common representation , where each box represented some kind of software entity and each arrow indicated a relationship between two entities .
Boxes were typically labeled , but arrows almost never were .
Some of these diagrams made casual use of visual notations , such as UML ( Unified Modeling Language ) , but this was uncommon .
Adjacency was sometimes used to indicate a relationship between two entities .
Generally boxes were arranged so that relationships flowed in a more - or - less orderly direction , top to bottom or left to right .
High - level groupings were indicated by surrounding boxes or curves , or by dividing lines .
These visual conventions suggest a starting point for the design of a code map .
Armed with this general knowledge , we worked closely with a software development team called Oahu ( a pseudonym ) to develop a paper prototype of a code map .
2
The Oahu team consisted of a few dozen people working on an incubation project of around 75,000 lines of C# .
We first had each developer separately sketch the Oahu project on a large piece of paper .
Four of these sketches are shown in Figure 1 .
Next we synthesized into a master drawing the common features and interesting exceptions that appeared in the sketches .
For several weeks we repeated a daily cycle where we printed this drawing , hung it in the developers ' offices , interviewed the team members for changes and reports of how they used it , and then revised the drawing based on their feedback .
At their request , we incorporated types and method signatures reverse - engineered from their code , using a tool that we developed for the purpose .
Figure 1 . Four Diagrams of the Oahu System
Through this process we arrived at a design ( figure 2 ) that represented the code in a way that was meaningful to the team .
The final design was basically an architectural layer diagram sprinkled with types ( white boxes ) containing method signatures .
It closely followed the visual conventions we found in the earlier study .
It also included some features that are not typical in architectural diagrams , such as representations of planned , but nonexistent code ( for example , the empty white box beneath the mobile phones ) , colorized identifier fragments to aid visual searching ( which we call concept keyword colorization ) , and the vertical banding representing concepts that cut across architectural layers .
Figure 2 . The Oahu Code Map Designed through Team Participation
The callout shows the map at full resolution .
The dashed rectangle is the map region shown in figure 3 .
From these studies we learned that it is possible to design a code map from a simple set of visual conventions .
The Oahu code map showed that a single map could represent an entire software project in a way that was meaningful to all the developers on the team .
The team 's response to the map was mixed .
Two new hires on the Oahu team used the map extensively as part of their " onboarding " process , studying and annotating it often .
Other team members had several criticisms , all stemming from the lack of interaction .
They wanted to tailor the level of detail and the element positions to the needs of the discussion to change the content for the task ( e.g. , add call graphs to the map ) .
We were able to address all these concerns in our Code Canvas , described next .
Maps at the Center of the Development Environment
We 've incorporated insights from these studies into a prototype user interface for Microsoft Visual Studio , called Code Canvas , which makes a code map the central metaphor of the development experience .
5
Rather than relying on tabbed documents and hierarchical overviews to navigate and edit the code , Code Canvas places all of a project 's documents ( code files , icons , user interface designs , etc. ) onto a panning , zooming code map .
The user can zoom out to get an overview of the project 's structure and zoom in to view or edit code and other documents .
( A video of Code Canvas is available here . )
We designed the look of the Code Canvas map based on our experience with the Oahu team .
Figure 3 shows the Oahu project loaded into Code Canvas , in particular the upper left - hand corner of the UI layer ( the area indicated with a dashed rectangle in figure 2 ) .
Using the visual conventions from the Oahu map , the Code Canvas map shows types as white boxes , with the identifiers labeled using concept keyword colorization , and with types organized into labeled bands ( PopupMenu , Reminders , etc. ) .
The type and concept boxes are positioned in Code Canvas in the same layout as the Oahu map .
Figure 3 . The Code Canvas Version of the Oahu Map
The map is focused on the upper left corner of the UI layer and includes two overlays : search results in yellow and an execution trace as a series of red arrows .
The callout shows the result of zooming into a method to edit its code .
An important lesson from the Oahu research is that developers assign meaning to the spatial layout of the code .
Code Canvas therefore takes a mixed initiative approach to layout .
The user is able to place any box on the map through direct manipulation , but Code Canvas also uses the MSAGL ( Microsoft Automatic Graph Layout ) engine to provide an initial layout for new code maps and to prevent occlusion and maintain relationships as the user makes subsequent changes to the layout .
Code Canvas uses a technique called semantic zoom to show different levels of detail at different levels of zoom .
At the 10 - percent level of zoom , the code itself is invisible because its size is less than a pixel per line , but the type names and member names are shown at a readable size .
The callout in figure 3 shows the 100 - percent level of zoom , where the code file itself is displayed using the standard editor , which provides the usual syntactic formatting and coloring and standard editor features such as code completion .
At intermediate levels of zoom the code becomes visible , first in a skeletal form ( in the style of Seesoft , 6 a well - known software visualization tool from the early 1990s ) , then as readable text .
For a tour of Code Canvas 's features , let 's replay our initial story .
Jane 's development environment shows an overview map of the whole project , called the HOME canvas .
Its layout is as familiar to her as her hometown , since she has been moving around both of them for years .
To start her task of understanding her project 's dependency on the unsupported library , she searches for uses of the library .
The search results are overlaid on the map in yellow boxes ( as shown in figure 3 ) in addition to being listed in a separate window .
She immediately sees the two parts of the code that depend on the library .
She zooms into one of them to look more closely at exactly which classes are implicated and then clicks on an individual search result to look at the code itself .
After exploring this way for a while , she decides to focus on just the relevant code , so she creates a new " filtered canvas " in a new tab that contains the subset of the code containing the search results , maintaining the spatial relationships that help her stay oriented .
As on the HOME canvas , the code on the filtered canvas is shown inside boxes representing the relevant classes and interfaces .
In essence , this filtered canvas acts as the class diagram Jane previously drew on her notepad , except that , here , the search results and class diagram are automatically kept in sync and are persisted together .
Joe knocks on the door and asks Jane a question .
She clicks over to the HOME canvas tab , zooms out , and points at parts of it to support what she 's saying .
The HOME canvas is shared among all team members , precisely to provide a common ground around which the team can have discussions .
To explain the feature that is puzzling Joe , Jane sets a debugger breakpoint and runs the program .
When the breakpoint is reached , Code Canvas shows the call stack using a series of red execution arrows , like those in figure 3 .
Jane then creates a second filtered canvas , focused on this call stack .
She zooms out to give Joe a tour of the parts of the code involved in the feature .
When Joe asks detailed questions about the algorithms , Jane zooms in on the relevant code .
When the conversation with Joe is over , Jane simply closes the new tabs and returns to the one where she was working , which looks exactly as she left it .
In short , Code Canvas provides explicit task support through multiple canvases and uses stable , spatial layouts to keep users oriented .
These design goals are shared by the Code Bubbles project at Brown University .
1 Code Bubbles ' strategy is to start with an empty canvas and add items as the user searches and browses the project .
In contrast , Code Canvas starts with an overview and allows users to filter down to items of interest .
In our future work , we will explore hybrids of the two approaches .
Conclusion
Based on the work practices we observed in our field studies , we believe making a code map central to the user interface of the development environment promises to reduce disorientation , answer common information needs , and anchor team conversations .
Spatial memory and reasoning are little used by software developers today .
In a lab - based evaluation of a previous version of our code - map design , we showed that developers form a reliable spatial memory of a code map during 90 - minute sessions of programming tasks .
4
By exploiting these cognitive resources , code maps will allow developers to be better grounded in the code , whether working solo or collaboratively .
We believe that this will fundamentally change and improve the software development experience .

This article describes our work in using online photo collections to reconstruct information about the world and its inhabitants at both global and local scales .
This work has been driven by the dramatic growth of social content - sharing Web sites , which have created immense online collections of user - generated visual data .

The increasing scale and availability of digital data provides an extraordinary resource for informing public policy , scientific discovery , business strategy , and even our personal lives .
To get the most out of such data , however , users must be able to make sense of it : to pursue questions , uncover patterns of interest , and identify ( and potentially correct ) errors .
In concert with data - management systems and statistical algorithms , analysis requires contextualized human judgments regarding the domain - specific significance of the clusters , trends , and outliers discovered in data .

When I/O latency is presented as a visual heat map , some intriguing and beautiful patterns can emerge .
These patterns provide insight into how a system is actually performing and what kinds of latency end - user applications experience .
Many characteristics seen in these patterns are still not understood , but so far their analysis is revealing systemic behaviors that were previously unknown .

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC Radio 5 Live 's Declan Curry explains just what GDP stands for , and why we should care
The UK economy grew by a faster - than - expected 1.1 % in the second quarter of the year , according to official data .
The figure - a preliminary estimate from the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) - was almost double the 0.6 % growth rate expected by economists .
It was the fastest quarterly expansion since 2006 , and marked a sharp pick - up in pace from the 0.3 % growth of the first three months of the year .
Much of the growth came from the key services sector .
Within the services sector , which accounts for about three - quarters of the UK economy , business and finance posted its strongest rise in almost three years , rising by 1.3 % over the quarter .
There was a big contribution from the construction industry , which grew at its fastest pace since 1963 , in part because bad weather at the start of the year meant builders were catching up on work that should have taken place then .
Stephanomics Predictably , politicians on both sides of the argument over the economy have taken today 's figures as support for their view Risk , politics and GDP
The only sector to register a fall was transport and communications - down 0.7 % on the quarter following the impact of Iceland 's volcanic ash cloud in April .
The ONS said the last time the UK had growth of more 1.1 % in any quarter was in 1999 .
' Strong rise '
The Chancellor , George Osborne , said the figures proved his plan to cut the public sector was right .
He said : " In the Budget , I set out a plan to restore confidence in our economy by dealing with the deficit , starting this year , and to rebalance growth from the public to private sector .
" Today 's figures show the private sector contributing all but 0.1 % of the growth in the second quarter , and put beyond doubt that it was right to begin acting on the deficit now . "
His predecessor , Alistair Darling , said the figures owed more to his government 's policy .
He said they vindicated the " measured and balanced " approach taken by the Labour government .
The BBC 's economics editor , Stephanie Flanders , said it was always important not to read too much into one set of figures - however striking .
What is GDP ?
Gross domestic product
A measure of a country 's economic activity , namely of all the services and goods produced in a year Q&A : What is GDP ?
And economists said the rise did not mean the UK economy had fully recovered .
George Buckley , economist at Deutsche Bank , said : " This is a very strong rise .
It is good news to the extent that the recovery seems to be gaining traction , the bad news is that it is going to take a long time before we get back to the peak levels we saw at the start of 2008 . "
And the phrase " as good as it gets " summed up the view of a number of observers , including the Institute of Directors ( IoD ) .
Graeme Leach , the IoD 's chief economist , said : " The latest quarterly GDP figures were good news , but we think they 're likely to be as good as it gets .
We do not think this rate of growth can be maintained .
La situazione politica si arroventa .
Il governo a causa della legge bavaglio traballa e al Tg1 l’informazione viene del tutto sostituita dalla propaganda .
Mentre Silvio Berlusconi , dopo aver occupato venerd ì sera gli schermi dei due principali telegiornali italiani , rilascia una nuova intervista al Tg4 , i sedicenti colleghi della rete ammiraglia Rai scendono di nuovo in campo .
Questa volta , per dimostrare che siamo tutti intercettati , gli uomini di Augusto Minzolini forniscono ai loro telespettatori dei dati falsi .
“ I bersagli veri e propri messi sotto controllo ogni anno sono 130 mila ” , dice il Tg1 , “ e chi ha parlato con questi è stato anch ’egli ascoltato .
Dunque i 130 mila devono essere moltiplicati e si arriva a milioni di italiani ” .
Bugie allo stato puro : perché i 130 mila bersagli non corrispondono al numero degli utenti , ma delle utenze intercettate ( ciascun di noi possiede diversi apparecchi e schede e chi è abituato a delinquere le cambia più spesso degli altri ) .
Al tribunale di Torino , per esempio , quando scatta un ’indagine con intercettazione vengono messe sotto controllo in media 10 utenze a persona .
Infatti i malviventi sanno benissimo di poter finire sotto ascolto e allora usano apparecchi intestati ad altri , cambiandoli spesso .
Gli investigatori partono così dai numeri di telefono ufficiali ( magari quelli di casa ) e ascoltano le telefonate per alcuni giorni finché la persona da controllare non chiama la moglie o la madre .
A quel punto i primi ascolti vengono interrotti – difficile trovare uno spacciatore che utilizzi il telefono di casa – e si passa a controllare il cellulare giusto .
Per questo le statistiche si gonfiano
Insomma i calcoli del Tg1 non stanno né in cielo né in terra ( Chissà quanti di noi sono stati intercettati in questi anni … ” , si chiede spaventata la giornalista ) .
E anche a voler fare una media prudenziale ci si rende conto che le persone realmente intercettate nel nostro
Paese non superano le 30 mila unità .
Sono poche o sono tante ?
Dipende dai punti vista : ogni anno in Italia si compiono più di 3 milioni di reati .
Tanto che sempre a Torino su 200 mila fascicoli aperti , 25 mila dei quali contro indagati noti , i fascicoli in cui vengono richieste intercettazioni sono 300 .
Un ’altra scoperta interessante si fa poi se si va a guardare per che tipo di crimini gli ascolti vengono autorizzati : quei 300 fascicoli , magari relativi a più persone , riguardano al 50 per cento il traffico di droga .
E il rimanente va così suddiviso : 15 per cento omicidi consumati o tentati e reati contro la persona ; un altro 15 per cento attiene poi alla criminalità organizzata ” ; 10 per cento violenze sessuali o pedofilia e ancora il rimanente 10 per cento reati commessi da colletti bianchi .
Il Tg1 tutto questo però non lo dice .
E non dice nemmeno che il calcolo delle 130 mila bersagli intercettati ( che come abbiamo visto va diviso almeno per cinque ) è già sbagliato in origine .
Infatti i dati esatti al ministero non ci sono perché ciascuna utenza può essere ascoltata per 20 giorni al massimo , poi per proseguire occorrono le proroghe del giudice .
Dunque il tutto va diviso per il numero delle utenze e delle proroghe .
Un fatto però è certo .
Le milioni di persone sotto controllo indiretto esistono solo nella fantasia o nella malafede della rete ammiraglia della Rai .
Che si guarda bene anche dal spiegare che i costi degli ascolti , ampiamente recuperati grazie ai sequestri di beni e capitali ( 380 milioni di euro solo per le indagini sui furbetti del quartierino del 2005 ) potrebbero essere annullati se solo lo Stato chiedesse alle compagnie di fornire gratis le linee ( come accade in Francia o in Germania ) e se si decidesse ad acquistare le macchine per intercettare che oggi affitta .
Ma quando l’informazione si trasforma in propaganda per sostenere le ragioni del potente di turno , i fatti scompaiono .
E molti sedicenti giornalisti fanno carriera .
Del resto hanno stomaco forte .
Tutte le mattine si alzano e riescono sorridenti a guardarsi allo specchio .
I veri numeri delle intercettazioni di Antonella Mascali
Intercettare fa bene ( alle casse dello Stato ) di Sandra Amurri
A week after one of their own assumed the nation ’s top job , red heads across the country have been dealt a blow after complaints about vilification on the basis of hair colour was knocked back by the nation ’s advertising watchdog .
Loading
The complaints centred on two ads , both of which featured unfavourable portrayals of red-heads : a VicRoads road safety commercial that warns using a mobile phone while driving causes " gingas " to get sleep with each other , and an ANZ bank ad featuring ' Barbara ' , a carrot - topped clerk whose stubbornness reminds customers of the worst aspects of dealing with banks .
' Gingers grow wings ' ... a still from the controversial road safety campaign .
In both cases the Advertising Standards Bureau found that the ads were intended to be humorous and did not constitute vilification .
The ANZ ad has already been subject to complaints by the financial sector union , which say it creates a bad image of bank staff , however the latest complaint focuses on the hair colour of Barbara , played by veteran performer Genevieve Morris .
‘‘ The advertisement patently slurs red - haired persons as obnoxious and inferior , ’’ the anonymous complainant wrrote .
‘‘ If any other ethnic group was identified thus you would promptly shrink from allowing the advertisement and brand the producer . ’’
The bank has defended its advertisement , saying Morris was chosen for the role because of her comic ability rather than her copper locks .
‘‘ Once humour was selected as the method of communicating ANZ ’s message , careful consideration was given to the form of humour chosen , ’’ the bank wrote in its formal response .
‘‘‘ Barbara ’ is a satirical representation of a bank employee in a customer service role .
ANZ ’s decision to use this particular actress to play ‘ Barbara ’ in the advertisement was based on the actress ’s ability to deliver the comedic script in a satirical manner and also because of her expressions and mannerisms . ’’
In dismissing the complaint — which relied on the advertising code clause that prohibits vilification on the basis of race , ethnicity , nationality , sex , age , sexual preference , religion , disability or political belief — the advertising watchdog agreed the humour did not focus on hair colour .
‘‘ The board agreed that the advertisement was intended to be a tongue - in - cheek mockery of bad customer service .
The board considered that the exaggerated depiction of a person providing bad service made it likely that most people in the community would not link this behaviour to people with the physical characteristic of red hair generally . ’’
The VicRoads advertisement , while more pointed in its negative portrayal of those with ginger roots , was also deemed okay .
The Don't be a Dickhead campaign shows two red - headed people in bed and makes the cheeky suggestion that every time a driver uses their mobile phone behind the wheel , " gingers get fresh with other gingers " and " a red - head gets it 's wings " .
It also pokes fun at Emos and shows a man walking around impaled with a street sign .
The ad , aimed at young drivers , was uploaded to the VicRoads website in March and has to date received more than 33,000 hits on YouTube .
Pages of complaints were lodged with the ASB on the basis the ad was discriminatory and offensive .
" What would be the problem if two blonde people had sex ?
What makes it OK to attack red heads just because there is less of us ? " one complainant wrote .
" After being bullied all through school having my hair pulled and cut by kids and teens to getting a part time job at a pub to pay my way through uni where I suffered even more abuse from drunk adults who wanted to see if my pubic hairs matched my head hairs I think I have suffered enough for my colouring .
I do n't think my own government should contribute to the belittling of a minority . "
Another said : " I am appalled as a visitor from the UK that the notion of redheads having sex is seen as a bad thing .
I think this is a basic human rights issue .
It 's racism it 's prejudice and it's a very very bad joke . "
Others complained the ad would encourage bullying in schools .
" I am also a teacher and I know that students will be quoting this ad to me and this will make any read - headed students feel uncomfortable and possibly could lead to bullying .
I also object to using the term ' dickhead ' in the ad as many students will use this term justifying it by the fact that it was in a VicRoads ad so it must be OK to say it .
" I find it utterly repulsive that my tax dollars now support a campaign which reinforces the derogatory message that it is supposedly ' hip / trendy / funny ' to ridicule people such as myself . "
In a decision handed down in April , and published online , the ASB found the clips did not breach the advertising code of ethics .
" The board noted that the Code does not refer to hair colour or physical attributes of a person and considered that having red hair is not a disability , " it concluded .
" The board considered that the advertisement did not discriminate against or vilify red headed people . "
It also ruled Emos had not been vilified for the same reason , and responded to complaints that the depiction of an impaled man was too graphic by saying the scenario was " exaggerated and clearly unrealistic " so as not to be taken seriously by viewers .
( Natural News ) A California lawsuit is accusing several fish oil supplement manufacturers of selling fish oils that contain unsafe levels of polychlorinated biphenyl compounds , also known as PCBs .
The state 's Proposition 65 requires products that may contain toxic ingredients above safe levels to have warning labels for consumer safety .
Five supplement companies , CVS and Rite Aid drug stores , and Omega Protein , Inc. , the world 's largest producer of omega - 3 fish oil , are all named in the suit , which the plaintiffs hope will bring light to fish oil contamination problems .
They also hope to see more accurate labeling of fish oils that includes specifics about contaminants like PCBs ; that way , consumers will be able to make better decisions about which kinds are safe to buy .
The PCB chemical family consists of 209 different chemical compounds , all of which were tested for in the lawsuit by a California lab .
That same lab also tested each of the product samples for 12 of the most toxic PCB compounds .
It then evaluated each sample in terms of daily exposure to PCBs overall , and daily exposure to PCBs in terms of toxicity .
The brands tested included Nature Made , Twinlab , Now Foods , Solgar and GNC .
Each brand included various types of fish oil , including cod liver , shark liver and salmon .
Those that tested the lowest for PCBs contained one - 70th the amount of those with the highest levels , indicating a significant difference in contamination among various brands , and types , of fish oil According to David Roe , the man who filed the lawsuit in San Francisco 's Superior Court , the oils that tested highest exceed California 's daily limit for PCBs by a factor of ten in terms of cancer risk .
On the same token , some of the oils tested very low , and are not of particular concern to consumers .
Both Nature Made and Twinlab issued immediate responses to the lawsuit in defense of their respective brands ' safety .
Erin Hlasney from the Council for Responsible Nutrition ( CRN ) , a supplement industry trade group , also came to the defense of fish oils in general , explaining that they have been used safely for decades .
But the plaintiffs contend that it is not enough to simply say that a product meets guidelines ; consumers have a right to know how a product actually tests for contaminants once it arrives on store shelves .
Many brands claim that their fish oils have been purified and treated to reduce or remove contaminants , but few actually explain to what extent these toxins have been removed .

A Linux distribution made out of fluff , bunnies , unicorns and awesome .
First Tour
Parley
It all started out with Parley .
We justed wanted to test the amazing theming capabilities in the upcoming 4.5 release of Parley , and eventually we ended up doing a whole distribution 🙂
Parley is a wonderful application that helps you learn all those beautiful languages out there using a flash card approach and an incredibly magnificant grading technique , so that you always know where you stand .
Our Fluffy
Bunny theme will also be part of the regular Parley release .
So also users of other distributions will be able to enjoy our work .
KBlocks
Fluffy will by default come with some of the best games the KDE software collection has to offer .
For KBlocks , one of these incredibly entertaining KDE Games , there already happened to be a theme which fits our overall branding right away .
KBlocks and its Pink Bunny theme will be part of the Fluffy default installation , in case one already learned all languages on this planet using Parley .
Kopete
Kopete is the chat application that millions of users use to stay in touch .
We acknowledge this fact and also work hard on bringing more fluffyness to Kopete .
What is especially awesome about the theme version you see above , is that the background was contributed by one of our first fans – it will also be available as full feature version as desktop wallpaper .
Rekonq
There are a lot of web browsers available for the user to choose from .
Also in the area of KDE software there is more than one .
One of the currently uprising new browsers is called Rekonq and it also got a fair share of fluff .
Whether Rekonq will be the default browser on Fluffy is not yet decided , but those that wish to use it , advanced fluffyness will be available .
Plasma
Years ago Florian Schepper created one of the first Plasma themes .
It was called Fluffy Bunny .
What Florian did not know back then was that Fluffy Bunny would become one of the all time favorite themes among users and developers of the KDE software compilation .
Unfortunately over time Plasma became greatly incompatible with the theme and fans were denied the possibility to use this most unique piece of art .
Now Fluffy Bunny will be reinvented for the Fluffy Linux distribution !
Installation CD
Fluffy will be based on the magnificant Kubuntu operating system .
The famous , but unfortunately now deserted Hannah Montana Linux also used Kubuntu as a base .
We are currently working on some minor disturbances , so that soon you will be able to run an early alpha version of Fluffy already .
Motivation
Fluffy will introduce Linux and the idea of Free / Libre Open Source Software to everyone who enjoys a pink , fluffy and good looking desktop .
Fluffy is not about writing letters or doing one ’s taxes , Fluffy is about enjoying Linux and KDE software in the best way possible .
It replaces a boring computer with a world of wonders and imagination , where everything seems to be alive and an amazing graphical experience is waiting around every corner .
A world of unicorns and bunnies and fluffyness .

OK , if you want to know nothing more about how Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows : Part II ends then read no further and most definitely do not click on the images below .
Jon put some images up last week from the set of the final Harry Potter movie and now SnitchSeeker have a few more for us where we get to see most the male cast including Daniel Radcliffe , Emma Watson , Rupert Grint and Tom Felton with rather odd beards and Hermione ( Watson ) still looking rather trendy and cool !
All these images were taken outside Kings Cross train station on London during the film for the epilogue at the end of the second movie .
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows : Part 1 is released 19th November with the second part being released 15th July 2011 .
Both movies are being directed by David Yates and will be converted into 3d .

The huge and continually rising cost of that decision has spurred national debate about federal subsidies for mortgage lending .
Republicans want to sever ties with Fannie and Freddie once the crisis abates .
The Obama administration and Congressional Democrats have insisted on postponing the argument until after the midterm elections .
Image A foreclosed home in Casa Grande , Ariz. , has been refurbished , inside and out .
It is listed by Mr. Bridwell ’s agency .

In the meantime , Fannie and Freddie are editing the results of the housing boom at public expense , removing owners who cannot afford their homes , reselling the houses at much lower prices and financing mortgage loans for the new owners .
The two companies together accounted for 17 percent of real estate sales in Arizona during the first four months of the year , almost three times their share of the market during the same period last year , according to an analysis by MDA DataQuick .
Valarie Ross , who lives in the Phoenix suburb of Avondale , has watched six of the nine homes visible from her lawn chair emptied by moving trucks during the last year .
Four have been resold by the government .
“ One by one , ” she said .
“ Just amazing . ”
The population of Pinal County , where Mr. Bridwell lives and works , roughly doubled to 340,000 over the last decade .
Developers built an entirely new city called Maricopa on land assembled from farmers .
Buyers camped outside new developments , waiting to purchase homes .
One builder laid out a 300 - lot subdivision at the end of a three - mile dirt road and still managed to sell 30 of the homes .
Mr. Bridwell sold plenty of those houses during the boom , then cut workers as prices crashed .
Now his firm , Golden Touch Realty , again employs as many people as at the height of the boom , all working exclusively for Fannie Mae .
The payroll now includes a locksmith to secure foreclosed homes and two clerks devoted to federal paperwork .
Golden
Touch gets more listings from Fannie Mae than any other firm in Pinal County .
Mr. Bridwell said he was ready to jump because he remembered the last time the government ended up owning thousands of Arizona houses , after the late - 1980s collapse of the savings and loan industry .
Old Spice Guy Goes Vegan

“ Can u cook Vegan , ” Isaiah Mustafa tweeted last week , “ On a diet … frustrating . ”
Fear not Old Spice Man , there are plenty of delicious recipes for embracing a vegan diet without the frustration .
Not surprisingly , even PETA tweeted its support for your cleanse :
“ Dear @OldSpice guy , ur #vegan & like 2 get nekked — sounds like a PETA man 2 us ! 1 more vid b4 u go 4 ur animal - loving fans ? ”
There you go , ladies .

( with Luciano Lavecchia )
Mr Lavecchia is a fellow and Dr. Stagnaro the research and studies director at Istituto Bruno Leoni .
This post follows the release of their recent analysis for Italy showing that for every ‘ green ’ job created by government , 4.8 ‘ gray ’ jobs are lost in the private sector .
Tradeoffs : if you chose this , you ca n’t chose that .
In economics this is called opportunity cost , which is the next - best alternative to what is actually chosen .
The proverb in popular culture for this is “ you ca n’t have the cake and eat it , too . ”
The Italian translation is “ you ca n’t have a full barrel and a drunk wife . ”
Apparently , politicians are less familiar with such a everyday - life concept .
To some extent , they are right : they can get a full barrel and a drunk wife at the same time , provided that taxpayers and / or future generations will pay for it .
Yet , even politicians are subject to constraints .
That is particularly true in a period of crisis like now : shrinking public budgets and a slowing economy force even the politicians to make choices .
EU Retrenchment
This brings us to the crisis of climate politics in Europe where most EU countries are considering cuts to the green subsidies .
The Socialist government in Spain dwarfed its support to solar power , causing a collapse in investments and thousands people to lose their jobs .
In Germany , the conservative chancellor Angela Merkel proposed a similar reduction and is facing a huge Parliamentary opposition .
Italy decided as well to pare green incentives .
How is that possible ?
After all , virtually every official EU document claims that the “ green deal ” will make us not just more sustainable , but also economically better off .
We will not deal with the environmental side of the issue in this post , leaving it to the wise words of Dr Gwyn Prins , for example , and perhaps a future post .
Uneconomic RES
But what about the claim that renewable energy sources ( RES ) are good for the economy ?
There is no spaghetti on this plate .
If green sources are really cheaper than fossil fuels , there is no need to subsidize them , because households and businesses would have a built - in economic incentive to rely on RES , rather than on supposedly dirty , more expensive , energies .
Yet people are not investing in RES without government incentives .
So either people are stupid when it comes to energy , or RES are more expensive .
If RES are more expensive , then they need subsidies to increase their share of energy consumption .
If more costly energies are subsidized , energy cost will likewise increase , and energy - intensive products or processes will either become more costly , or less competitive – or both .
So , the whole macroeconomic outcome of this is that society will become poorer .
Sometimes a different , more subtle , argument is made : RES may turn out to be a social cost , but they are good to create employment .
The argument goes like this : we are in a time of crisis .
Lack of GDP growth is a big problem , but raising unemployment is a much bigger problem .
So , there may be a tradeoff between getting sooner a higher rate of growth , and finding a job for people who may have problems to make it until the end of the month .
Under this approach , a comparatively slower , later growth rate is an acceptable price to pay to keep people employed , for the sake of social peace .
We will not discuss this point of view , either , although we regard it as economically insane .
But taking it seriously for the sake of argument , the implication is that resources spent in RES will generate more jobs , all else being equal , than the same resources invested in other sectors of the economy .
Green Jobs Studies
Let ’s look at the evidence .
Recent studies on Spain , Germany , and Denmark suggest that , in fact , RES subsidies destroy , not create , jobs – a remarkable result , since these three countries are widely regarded as the most successful models in Europe .
The U.S. Congressional Budget Office found similar results .
We performed a similar study on Italy .
Our estimates on the opportunity cost of green jobs show that , on average , every single green job comes at the expenses of 4.8 “ grey ” jobs .
If we are correct , pro-RES policies should be carefully assessed , especially in Italy , a country with strong debt , weak GDP growth and an history of environmentalism which caused , of all the crazy things we could do , the shutdown of four nuclear power plants after a referendum in 1987 .
( Whatever you think about nuclear power , since most of its cost is embodies in the initial investment , the most crazy thing you can do is to shut down them before their technical life is expired : by doing so you get all the financial and possibly environmental pain and no gain at all . )
While the idea that subsidies to RES will indeed create some jobs is for free , the question is at what price .
In fact , the creation of green jobs leads to the destruction of job opportunities in other industries , because of the misallocation of resources , forcibly taken out from society and politically allocated in favor of RES .
In our country , green energies are subsidized through a premium that every electricity consumer pays on her electricity bill ( about 4.3 % of the average bill ) , which contributes to make Italy ’s electricity bills among the most expensive in Europe .
Particularly , big industrial consumers pay the most expensive electricity bills in Europe ( some 25 % above the EU average in 2008 ) .
In order to assess the net balance of jobs created vs. job destroyed , we have estimated the number of green jobs that would be created by the subsidies that have already been granted or committed .
We have assumed that , by 2020 , Italy will reach its “ maximum potential ” for wind and photovoltaic ( PV ) power , following the position paper issued by the Italian government in 2007 .
Moreover , we have collected the available estimates on the currently existing green jobs , even though we believe they are biased upwards ( especially the optimistic ones ) .
We have concluded that , in different scenarios , 50,000 to 112,000 jobs will be created ( Figure 1 and Figure 2 ) , the most of — at least 60 % – will be installers or other temporary jobs .
Particularly these ones will depend on the flow of new investments and disappear whenever a photovoltaic panel , or a wind tower , is operative .
Figure 1 – Jobs ( two scenarios ) and subsidies to the wind power industry .
Figure 2 – Jobs ( two scenarios ) and subsidies to the PV power industry .
We have estimated that the cost of such jobs will peak at around € 6bn per year in 2020 , not far from the figure expected by Italy ’s energy regulator ( €7bn ) , even though the economic crisis could indeed reduce the total amount .
Finally , we have computed the entire amount of public capital that is committed for the creation of those jobs , and calculated the average stock of public capital per worker in the green sector — a measure of how much labor - intensive is an economic sector .
The stock of capital per worker , depending on the scenario , is of about 566,000 to 1,260,000 euro .
If that is compared with the average stock of capital per worker in the entire economy and in the industrial sector , a ratio is found of 3.5 to 7.7 and 5.0 to 11.2 ( see Figure 3 ) , respectively .
Hence , on average a green job is equivalent to 4.8 jobs in the entire economy , or 6.9 jobs in the industrial sector .
Figure 3 – Average stock of capital per worker in the RES with respect with the average stock of capital in the industry .
Some argued that indeed the stock of capital employed in the energy production business should be used instead .
While we understand the ratio behind , we disagree for three main reasons : 1 ) it is very unlikely , due to the stochastic nature of RES , that the new installed capacity will “ crowd - out ” the more “ traditional ” energy production systems ; 2 ) the feed - in tariffs and green certificates which are used for sustaining the RES are indeed funded from , or passed onto , all citizens from all over the economy and particularly the most energy intensive subjects ( the industrial sector ) ; 3 ) we have tried to assess whether subsidizing RES is per-se an efficient way to create new jobs , thus every sector could be used as benchmark .
Conclusion
Our research is not contra RES per se : we are just underlying that , if the green economy is intended to create jobs , it is a very inefficient tool .
The same amount of subsidies could produce 4.8 jobs instead of just one “ green ” job if spent elsewhere in the economy , leaving the market free to do its job ( something which is far from being understood by the Italian Leviathan ) .
We argue the robustness of our results for two reasons : on the one hand we use existing estimates of green jobs , some of which are grossly overstated ; on the other hand , even if the subsidies actually given to the green energies will were to be just half as much as we assume ( a ridiculously low hypothesis ) , one green job would still be equivalent to 2.4 conventional jobs .
Our figures , then , seem to confirm what is intuitive : the green economy is capital - intensive , thus it may be very profitable for some .
But it looks pretty much as a zero - or negative - sum than a positive - sum game at a social level .

reports that Asia - Europe container trade has continued to rebound in April .
1.1 million teu ( twenty - foot equivalent units ) of box volume was shipped from Asia to Europe during the month , up substantially from 878,129 teu one year ago .
For the first quarter , volume was up 21 % .
Asia - Europe freight rates also rose in April from March with a price index hitting 122 from 116 .
( base year 2008 = 100 )
European demand weakness did n't materialize in April .
Still , transport research firm Transport Trackers ( TT ) finds 'it difficult to expect Europe to magically keep up a strong demand in the face of a massive need for austerity following a long period of Debt Gone Wild . '
So perhaps weakness is on the way .
Interestingly , it has been Asian demand for European goods which weakened in April .
Eastbound container traffic fell 7 % in April year over year , despite having gone up by 23 % year over year in the first quarter .
Given the weakening euro , this data seems counter intuitive , one would have expected European demand to be the first to drop .
Perhaps
May will bring good news for Asia - bound traffic , given that it was the month when the euro truly collapsed , as shown below .
Transport Trackers notes separately that Asia - Europe rates fell slightly ( 1.4 % ) in May vs. April , but note that this could be a ship - supply driven response .
Previously idle ships ( put into lay over during the recent downturn ) have been pouring back onto the market .
TT :
Idle fleet down big time ( 1+m TEU ) : According to Alphaliner , the idle boxship fleet has fallen to 263 ships or 549,000 TEU of capacity , a 17 ‐ month low , after 75 vessels or another 358,000 TEU of capacity has been re‐ activated in last few weeks .
The reduction of almost 1 m TEU of idle tonnage , since the peak of 1.52 m TEU recorded in December 2009 , was largely driven by the shortages in the 4,000 +
TEU size ships , given also that many new services ( with 4,000 + TEU ) were recently launched for summer peak season
Regardless , container trade activity continues to show reasonable strength , even along Asia - Europe .
The threat now , as TT highlights above , is that idle capacity could come back to eagerly , and combine with an expected 9 - 10 % 2010 fleet growth to create a new environment of overcapacity .
Still , this remains to be seen , and for now the key take away is that we have n't seen significant European contagion yet via container trade data .
( CNN ) --
One of the most outspoken gay critics of the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy said Thursday that he has been discharged from the Army .
Lt. Dan Choi , who was arrested in March for handcuffing himself to a White House fence in protest of the policy , released a statement saying he had been honorably discharged .
The " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy bars people who are openly gay or lesbian from serving in the military .
" This is both an infuriating and painful announcement , " Choi said .
" But my service continues .
...
Remaining silent when our family and community members are fired or punished for who they truly are would be an unequivocal moral dereliction that tarnishes the honor of the uniform and insults the meaning of America . "
Choi told CNN he received the news through a phone call from his Army National Guard battalion commander .
His discharge , however , actually became effective on June 29 , according to Eric Durr , a National Guard spokesman .
" You prepare yourself , " Choi said .
" I built an armor up . "
Choi , a 2003 West Point graduate who is fluent in Arabic , was an infantry platoon leader , serving with his unit in Iraq in 2006 and 2007 .
He admitted his sexual orientation publicly for the first time last year on MSNBC's " The Rachel Maddow Show , " prompting the Army to initiate proceedings to discharge him .
Choi , who lives in New York City , founded KnightsOut.org , an advocacy and education organization of West Point graduates who are gay , lesbian , transgender or bisexual .
Knights
Out estimates there are 65,000 gays in the military .
President Barack Obama is pushing for a repeal of the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy .
A bill that would overturn the measure after a Pentagon review is completed in December is currently before Congress .
More than 12,500 gays have been booted from the military since " do n't ask , do n't tell " went into effect .
CNN 's Adam Levine , Chris Lawrence and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report
With Tropical Depression Bonnie dissipating , the slow process of getting all of the boats back in place and workers back to work is now beginning .
Much of the discussion at Admiral Allen 's press conference on Saturday , however , was about the expected impact of the Bonnie .
NOAA Administrator Dr. Jane Lubchenco was present to explain the impacts .
She indicated she expected a number of positive benefits of the storm :
Dr. Lubchenco would n't quite go as far as say that she expected the storm to be a net benefit , though .
She said it would depend on where you are .
Some places might be better , but others might be worse .
In some places , oil might be pushed farther inland , although with little storm surge , this would be a relatively smaller problem .
The storm would n't have any impact on the deep oil mixed with the water .
Admiral Allen mentioned that it had been possible to keep two vessels on the scene , so they were able to be with the ROVs overnight .
Thus , they were able to continue monitoring pressure readings .
Pressure readings continue to slowly rise ( 6,891 psi at midnight last night ) , showing evidence of integrity at the well head .
New Oil Spill Containment System Planned by Chevron , Conoco Phillips , ExxonMobil , and Shell
I thought I would shift gears and show some information about the new oil spill containment system that the four other major oil companies are working on , which you have probably read about in the news .
The information I am quoting and the image are from the Containment System Fact Sheet .
Further information is available on a Press Release .
According to the Overview :
This system offers key advantages to the current response equipment in that it will be pre-engineered , constructed , tested and ready for rapid deployment in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico .
Its primary objective is to fully contain the oil with no flow to the sea .
The system will be flexible and adaptable .
It will be responsive to a wide range of potential scenarios , deepwater depths up to 10,000 feet , weather conditions and flow rates exceeding the size and scope of the current spill .
Once constructed , the system components will be fully tested to ensure functionality and will be maintained in a state of continuous operational readiness .
In the event of a future incident , mobilization to the field will start within days and the system will be fully operational within weeks .
Subsea components :
• A newly designed and fabricated subsea containment assembly will create a permanent connection and seal to prevent oil from escaping into the water .
•
The assembly will be equipped with a suite of adapters and connectors to interact with various interface points such as the wellhead , blowout preventer stack , lower marine riser package and casing strings , including any well design and equipment used by the various operators in the Gulf of Mexico . •
The assembly will be designed to prevent hydrate formation and blockage .
•
Capture caisson assemblies will also be built for use if required to enclose a damaged connector or leak outside the well casing .
Once installed , these assemblies will create a seal with the seabed to prevent seawater from entering the system . •
The oil would be captured by the subsea containment assembly and flow through flexible pipe to a riser assembly .
Riser assemblies are made of a seabed foundation , vertical pipe , buoyancy tanks and a flexible pipe specifically configured to connect to the capture vessels .
•
The subsea system will be supplied with the necessary hydraulic / electric controls and chemical injection ( such as hydrate inhibitors ) through an umbilical .
•
A manifold will distribute the oil from the subsea containment assembly to multiple riser assemblies if more than one capture vessel is necessary .
•
Riser assemblies and umbilical will be designed to quickly disconnect from capture vessels so that all subsea equipment stays in place in the event of a hurricane .
An additional system component will be available to inject dispersant into the subsea containment assembly if required .
There are also surface vessels , which I wo n't describe .
The fact sheet indicates that the initial investment is expected to be approximately $ 1 billion .
The new system is targeted for completion within 18 months .
ExxonMobil has been designated to lead the engineering , procurement and construction of the system components .
The companies behind this endeavor will form a new non-profit organization , the Marine Well Containment Company ( MWC ) , to operate and maintain the system .

From Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell :
There ’s no evidence whatsoever that the Bush tax cuts actually diminished revenue .
They increased revenue , because of the vibrancy of these tax cuts in the economy .
I keep hearing that conservatives actually have a nuanced view of tax cuts , not the laughable caricature that liberals impute to them .
But it sure looks like their top guy in the Senate has exactly the laughable caricature we ’ve always thought he did .
I now eagerly await an outpouring of criticism from conservatives upset at McConnell for being such a pandering rube and giving the movement a bad name .
UPDATE : Karl Smith at Modeled Behavior tweets : “ I have a chart I use on Bush tax cuts , has broken even the hardest of partisans .
Will post & tweet later . ”
Really ?
The hardest of partisans ?
This I have to see …..
UPDATE 2 : Well , here ’s the chart .
And it ’s a good one !
But I somehow have a feeling that the hardest of partisans will remain unmoved .
" In 2008 , 94 pc of public sector employees were members of a [ final salary ] pension scheme , compared with just 11 pc in the private sector , " it said .
" It may have been previously right to argue that generous pensions in the public sector made up for lower pay ... but pay in the public sector is now higher than in the private sector at almost all levels . "

( CNN ) --
A typhoon was expected to make landfall on the Philippines late Tuesday , CNN meteorologists say .
Tropical Storm Conson was producing 69 mph ( 111 kph ) winds Monday .
But the wind was forecast to pick up to 86 mph ( 139 kph ) , turning Conson into a typhoon .
A typhoon of this size is similar to a Category 2 hurricane .
The typhoon was predicted to cause flooding and strong winds .
Authorities warned residents in Manila , the nation 's capital , not to venture into the rain due to strong dangers posed by lightning .
Istanbul , Turkey ( CNN ) --
Autopsy results by forensics experts in Istanbul revealed that all nine of the men killed by Israeli commandoes aboard the humanitarian convoy that had planned to dock in Gaza died of gunshot wounds .
The autopsy results give clues about how the violence unfolded after Israeli commandoes stormed the Turkish ship Mavi Marmara in the pre-dawn hours on Monday .
Five of the men died with bullet wounds to the head , said Dr. Haluk Ince , the director of Istanbul 's Medical Examination Institute , said Friday .
One casualty , a 19 - year - old dual national Turkish - American citizen named Furkan Dogan , was found to have bullet wounds in his head and multiple bullets in his body , Ince said .
According to the U.S. State department , Dogan was born in Troy , New York and had been living in Turkey .
American diplomats have been extending consular services to the deceased 's family .
In one case , Ince said , a gunshot victim had been shot at at extremely close range .
" From the analysis of the bullet distance on one of the bodies , " Dr. Ince said , " the gun was fired between 2 and 14 centimeters ' distance from the victim 's head . "
In one month , the forensic report will be submitted to an Istanbul prosecutor 's office .
There have already been petitions from families of Turkish activists this week , submitted to state prosecutors to sue the government of Israel on charges of murder .
The dead activists were treated like fallen heroes at a mass funeral held at Istanbul 's Fatih Mosque on Thursday .
Crowds gathered in a courtyard , below the domes of the centuries ' old Ottoman mosque , in front of the coffins , which were wrapped in Turkish and Palestinian flags .
In one case , a flag from the Palestinian movement Hamas lay over a casket .
" We will remember this , what Israel did , " said a young Turkish volunteer named Muhamed Sahin , who was helping hold back the surging crowd .
" Everybody has to learn what is going on in Gaza , on the ship , what Israel did . "
Periodically , the crowd chanted " Israel , terrorist " and " Damn Israel . "
The bodies of the 9 dead , as well as more then 460 surviving passengers from the convoy arrived at Istanbul airport before dawn on Thursday .
They were treated to a hero 's welcome , particularly Bulent Yildirim , the chairman of the Islamist , fiercely pro-Palestinian Turkish charity the Humanitarian Relief Foundation ( IHH ) .
IHH was one of the main groups organizing the blockade - busting flotilla .
In remarks to the press , Yildirim said his colleagues fought Israeli troops in self - defense aboard the Mavi Marmara .
He added that in the early stages of the clashes , his activists captured several Israel commandoes , as well as their weapons , and took them below decks .
The Israeli troops were given water , Yildirim said .
He insisted none of the activists fired the captured Israeli guns .
Israeli officials have accused the protesters of firing captured weapons during the battle at sea .
The Israeli military has also shown images of a commando being beaten with a plastic chair , as well as photos of knives , metal poles , slingshots and marbles as evidence that the Mavi Marmara was a " ship of hatred " full of terrorist sympathizers rather then a " love boat " filled with peace - loving human rights activists .
" The defense of the boat was quite well organized , " said Espen Goffeng , a 38 - year - old activist from Norway who sailed aboard the Mavi Marmara .
" There was a plan to keep soldiers off the boat . "
Goffeng said passengers aboard the lead ship Mavi Marmara at first successfully repelled Israeli troops on boats .
Then , he said , soldiers began their helicopters assault on the vessel .
" They started off with some kind of paintball bullets with glass in them that left terrible soft tissue wounds .
And then rubber bullets .
And then live ammunition afterwards .
And that 's when things started to get really dangerous , " Goffeng added .
Despite the tears and sobbing at Istanbul 's Fatih Mosque on Thursday , many of the people gathered for the activists ' funeral called this week a " victory , " because it brought international attention to Israel 's 3 - year blockade of Gaza .
Turkey , once Israel 's closest Muslim ally in the Middle East , has accused Israel of committing an act of international piracy .
" From now on , Turkish - Israeli ties will never be the same , " Turkish President Abdullah Gul said on Thursday .
" The incident has left a deep and irreparable scar . "
According to a spokesman for the Turkish Foreign Ministry , Ankara has issued 3 demands to Israel : apologize for the raid , organize an independent investigation , and lift the blockade of Gaza .
Attendees were treated to the usual Wal - Mart jamboree that has come to be expected at its annual meetings , with music from singers Mariah Carey and Mary J Blige as well as entertainment from special guest Jamie Foxx , the Academy Award winning actor .
Apple Reverses " Ulysses " Decision , But ...
At this year 's Bloomsday celebration down at the Ulysses Pub in the financial district , we met up with novelist and winner of the National Book Award Colum McCann to get his opinion about Apple 's censorship of the Ulysses comic book adaptation " Ulysses Seen . "
JONES : I heard somewhere that they were going to be adapting " Ulysses " for HBO , and you were going to be uh ...
MCCANN : Did you hear that ?
JONES : Yeah , yeah .
MCCANN : Okay .
What you have to do -- it 's actually really quite wonderful -- you have to look at the date of the article and the time the article was written .
It was written on April the 1st .
JONES : You 're telling me this whole thing was a ...
MCCANN : It 's April the 1st !
I did n't even know about it !
Then people started coming up to me .
People are like : " Ooo , you 're working with Colin Farrell !
You 're adapting " Ulysses ! "
That 's fucking brilliant !
That 's fantastic !
Ooo , HBO ! "
But no .
I 'm not .
I WOULD do .
I WOULD do .
JONES : You'd do it if you could ?
MCCANN : Yeah , yeah , yeah .
I 'd involve all these people who are down here as well ( gesturing to the Bloomsday celebrants )
But no , no .
Seriously .
It was a blag , it was a joke , it was a fucking ... like one of those mad moments when somebody invented something on the internet that 's like a ... but look at it .
The date of the article is April the 1st .
So , no .
JONES : Cheers , mate .
I wrote that article .
I 'm fucking with you again .
MCCANN : Are you fucking Miracle ?
You bastard !
JONES : I am a bastard .
But it 's nice to see you .
MCCANN : ( to those gathered around )
This man played a fucking blag on me on April 1st !
Said I was adapting " Ulysses " for HBO !
And then he comes up as a fucking reporter for the Village Voice saying " I hear you 're adapting ... AW SOME FUCKING ASSHOLE WROTE ABOUT ME.JONES : ( explaining to the crowd )
No , he was kind about it .
He was kind about it .
MCCANN : You read last time !
How come you did n't read this year ?
JONES : I had to work !
I just became a bartender !
MCCANN : You missed the whole thing !
JONES : I know , I saw the end of it .
I was actually wondering ... I do n't know if you heard or not , but did you see that Apple was censoring " Ulysses " ?
Well , I write for The Internet , and I was wondering if you had anything to say about it .
As like , King of Bloomsday .
MCCANN : I mean , it 's ridiculous .
The book is set in 1904 , the book was written between 1914 and 1921 .
We had a fucking CENTURY .
Like , the worst of times the best of times .
Like between then and now ?
I mean , seriously , as a century it was the most horrific and the most beautiful of centuries .
And then we can't fucking turn around and ... and Apple comes along and censors one of our great relics ?
It 's like going into your grandmother 's closet and going through her underwear and going " Oh look -- these are way too short .
Oooo , you should n't have worn those .
" It 's mad , right ?
Mad , mad , mad , mad , mad .
It 's just silliness , though .
Corporate silliness .
I do n't think anybody really wants to censor " Ulysses . "
I mean , I think it 's part of their mainstream idea that you have to put like a gate around language or something like that .
It 's silly .
Silly , silly , silly .
But I think if you went to Steve Jobs and Apple ... and ... hey Tony .
You should meet each other .
This man wrote a fucking blag about me on the fucking internet .
said I was adapting Ulysses for HBO .
and you know how many people came up to me TODAY ALONE ?
JONES : How many people ?
How many people ?
MCCANN : Four people came up to me TODAY ALONE .
Michael Patrick McDonald .
Talk to Michael Patrick McDonald .
You know the guy ?
He wrote " Old Souls . "
He 's a fantastic writer .
He says : " Jesus !
You 're fucking adapting " Ulysses ? " McCann did n't think Apple REALLY wanted to censor " Ulysses , " and was certain that if we all went to Steve Jobs and sat down with him to speak together about this as reasonable adults , he would lift this ban on " Ulysses .
" And he was right .
Today , Apple has agreed to reverse its decision about " Ulysses Seen . "
Fucking A!
But does this mean that now " Ulysses Seen " can be as explicit as possible in the later chapters that contain actual sex and nudity ?
What does Apple actually mean when they say they are establishing new parameters that reflect artistic growth ?
Will the piecemeal publication of this " Ulysses " comic app slowly erode all of Apple 's boundaries until they are forced to say " YES " to EVERYTHING ?
I 'm more cynical than McCann .
I think PR pressure made Apple lift this ban , not glorious magnanimity .
And what about all those other apps that are n't THE GREATEST NOVEL EVER WRITTEN ?
What about all those other apps that are n't being banned on the HOLIDAY OF THEIR VERY EXISTENCE ?
We will have to keep this public pressure on , every single time we want to do something that tests Apple 's constantly - evolving policies , until Apple breaks down and keeps the same standard as the actual internet , letting everything through without gatekeeping , allowing the whole world of possibilities to be accessed through their sleek , steel , perfect devices .
Mr. Jobs : will you please stop going through our grandmother 's underwear ?
This is a frame from Westall 66 : A Suburban UFO Mystery which aired on the Australian Sci-Fi Channel on June 4th .
I did not get to see the show , as it has not aired in the United States as of this writing ; but my educated guess is that the filmmakers were attempting to illustrate the investigative process , by eliminating possibilities .
( To learn about the 1966 Westall UFO , you can check out my Skeptoid episode about it . )
Their presentation purports that there are only three possibilities to explain the UFO sighting : Hoax or hysteria ; experimental aircraft ; or an object of extraterrestrial origin .
Actually , that ’s four possibilities , since a hoax and mass hysteria are two completely different things .
After we eliminate hoaxing , hysteria , and experimental aircraft , the only remaining possibility is that this was an extraterrestrial object .
Let ’s hope Australian television audiences are outraged by that insult to intelligence .
I ’m going to help out the show ’s producers .
They left out the two overwhelmingly most likely possibilities : mistaken identification , and unknown .
Their list should have read like this :
Hoax –
Not very likely in this case , but always a possibility .
Hysteria – Highly unlikely .
Mass hysteria does not create shared visual hallucinations .
Mistaken identification – Most likely .
The witnesses did see something , they were simply unable to identify it .
Maybe it was seen from an odd angle , maybe it was something weird looking they were n’t familiar with .
This does n’t mean nobody would have known what it was .
Unknown –
We do not have an explanation for what the witnesses reported .
Extraterrestrial object – I ’ve struck this one out because it ’s not a supportable conclusion .
In order to positively identify the Westall object , we ’d have to be able to reliably test it against a known sample .
We do n’t have a known sample of an “ extraterrestrial object ” to compare it against , so there ’s really no way to get past # 4 on this list and make a positive identification of “ alien spaceship ” .
Before this “ documentary ” came out , I was able to scoop it on my Skeptoid podcast by a few days , thanks to a heads - up from Maynard in Australia , who also provided this screen capture ( many thanks , sir ) .
On that show , I found that there are indeed some good possibilities for what the witnesses saw .
The first half of the sighting coincided with a weather balloon , known to be in the area at the time , and sounding quite a lot like what some of the witnesses reported .
The second half of the sighting is harder to pin down , so I ’m completely comfortable with calling it unidentified .
I ’m reasonably comfortable saying it was probably a misidentification , and there ’s a good explanation of that if you want to check out my episode .
Remember : “ I do n’t know ” does NOT mean “ I do know , and it was an alien spaceship . ”
To those who say this is the only possible explanation , I invite them to show us exactly how they were able to match up the Westall story to what ’s known of alien spaceships .
If they can ’t , I invite them to revise their conclusion to admit that maybe the explanation is unknown .
Brian 's company needs to track financial information indexed by 100 digit routing numbers .
Now , obviously , not all of those digits are significant , so if a user enters " 123 " , the application needs to be smart enough to pad out the other 97 digits with leading zeros .
Sane people might think this should be implemented as a one - line call to a built - in method .
The more DIY among us might waste time building up a for loop .
And , of course , a LISP fan would simply torture future coders with recursion and parentheses .
Then there 's this approach that Brian found :

SNIPPED FOR REALLY LONG AND REPETITIVE CODE ... */ if ( length == 2 ) { NewData = " 000000000000000000000000 " + " 00000000000000000 " + " 0000000000000000 " + " 0000000000000000 " + " 0000000000000000000000000 " + Data.substring ( length -2,length ) ; } if ( length == 1 ) { NewData = " 0000000000000000000000000 " + " 00000000000000000 " + " 0000000000000000 " + " 0000000000000000 " + " 0000000000000000000000000 " + Data.substring ( length -1,length ) ; } return NewData ; }
When Howard Dean appeared on Fox Sunday , he took the opportunity to tell the conservative network exactly what he thought of their coverage of the USDA worker who was forced to resign last week .
Dean told Fox News ' Chris Wallace that the network had behaved in a racist way when it came to the way they reported on the tape of Shirley Sherrod that was posted to Andrew Breitbart 's BigGovernment.com .
Breitbart posted a video clip that appeared to show Sherrod saying she had withheld help from a white farmer because of the color of his skin .
The NAACP condemned Sherrod and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack asked for her resignation .
After the unedited video surfaced , it was clear that Sherrod was actually telling a story about how she overcame racism .
The NAACP and Vilsack both quickly apologized for their mistake .
Appearing alongside Newt Gingrich , Dean was blunt with his accusation .
" I do n't think Newt Gingrich is a racist and you 're certainly not a racist but Fox News did something that was absolutely racist , " said Dean .
" They had a obligation to find out what was really in the clip .
They have been pushing a theme of black racism , phony Black Panther crap and this business and Sotomayor and all this other stuff .
The Tea Party called out their racist fringe and I think the Republican Party has got to stop appealing to its racist fringe , " Dean continued .
" And Fox News is what did that .
You put that on , " he said .
" Wait , wait , wait , " interrupted Chris Wallace .
" I know facts are inconvenient things but let 's try to deal with the facts .
The fact is that the Obama administration fired or forced Shirley Sherrod to quit before her name had ever been mentioned on Fox News Channel . "
While it's true that the that Fox News Channel did not air the video until after Sherrod resigned , their websites did push the story before her resignation .
The Los Angeles Times ' James Rainey reports :
Too bad that message did n't reach the operators of Fox 's websites and commentator Bill O'Reilly .
FoxNews.com posted the story on Monday , and the FoxNation.com website followed with the video and the accusatory headline : " Caught on Tape : Obama Official Discriminates Against White Farmer . "
That night , O'Reilly called on Sherrod to resign .
( She had already agreed to leave her post before the O'Reilly segment aired . )
O'Reilly at least apologized for proceeding without all the facts .
( Though he then proceeded to backhand Sherrod for two days running , suggesting she might be too dangerously left wing for government service . )
The Fox corporate rep who took my phone call this week would n't explain why Fox 's Web newsers made the same mistake — failing to recognize that the Breitbart video was a clip job or that Sherrod 's story dated to a quarter - century ago , long before she worked for the feds .
" Fox News was not blameless during this , " countered Dean .
" I do n't know if ever there was a clip of the white farmer saying ' Wait a minute , this woman helped us save the farm . '
Did that ever appear on Fox News ? "
" I do n't know because I was n't covering that part of the story but we certainly reported that part of the story , " Wallace replied .
" Did Fox News play the clip that turned out to be inaccurate ? " asked Dean .
" After she was fired , " answered Wallace .
" Right .
I do n't think it matters whether it was before or after .
The fact is you played it .
You did n't do your job , said Dean .
" There 's been this ongoing theme [ at Fox News ] about black racism in America . "

Why you should care about Basel III
Now that Dodd - Frank has passed , there 's not a lot of interest in following a meeting of international bank regulators .
But Basel III matters -- some argue that it matters more even than Dodd - Frank -- and Brookings 's Doug Elliott , author of this primer on the proceedings , will tell you why .
We just passed financial reform .
There was a signing ceremony and everything .
So why should we care about Basel III ?
Will it actually matter for our financial system ?
It matters immensely .
The Dodd - Frank bill was the biggest set of changes in financial reform since the Great Depression , but it ’s only half the battle .
It leaves many important things to be decided by the regulators .
Of those , the most important is the level of capital that banks have to hold in order to deal with the unexpected .
The Basel III process is a way of getting countries around the world to agree on how much capital banks will carry .
And that ’s a tricky balance :
On the one hand , we clearly need larger safety margins .
We do n’t want to have to go through this crisis again .
On the other hand , safety margins are expensive .
If there are too many , bank loans will become more expensive for consumers .
And who ’s at Basel making these decisions ?
Who does America send ?
The Basel Committee is a club of the world ’s financial regulators who get together to coordinate their approach , particularly to these safety margins .
You have representation from the Federal Reserve , the FDIC and some other bodies .
The U.S. regulatory system is a little fragmented .
And why should we trust them ?
Basel II let banks hold less capital if they had assets that the rating agencies had stamped AAA .
Then those assets crashed .
Why should we be confident that the Baselites wo n’t make a similar mistake .
They have a clearer idea now of where the mistakes can be made .
They ’re adding a simpler measure of the safety margin .
The core of the Basel approach is to say we can estimate how risky the loans and investments are that a bank makes , and the riskier the investments , the more you need to hold .
That leaves the danger that we might guess wrong , and that the market might be wrong .
So they ’ll also have a straight leverage ratio , which just says that the amount of capital you have has to be a certain percent of your total loans and assets .
And included in that is going to be something for all your off - balance sheet assets .
They ’ve suggested 3 percent to start .
That sounds extremely low .
I ’d like to see the ratio higher than 3 percent , but the ratios traditionally used do n’t have off - balance assets in there .
So it ’s more conservative than it would be if it was just applying to on - balance sheet assets .
It ’s probably more like 4 or 5 percent .
That ’s still low but not crazily so .
What I hope is that over time they ’ll raise that number .
The reason they ’re not making it tougher to start with and why they ’re taking eight years to phase it in is that it ’ll have a big effect on European banks .
Our regulators already use a simple capital ratio , so this wo n’t be a huge adjustment for our banks .
The Europeans do n’t , so their banks hold more assets , but they ’re less risky .
We have riskier assets , but fewer of them .
How much power do the banks themselves have over this process ?
The banks lobby the regulators at Basel , just as they lobby legislators and regulators about other issues .
They do n’t have any direct control over the decisions , but they ’ve spent a lot of time trying to make their case .
The banking industry does not like Basel III .
They have argued it could slow the economy , and they ’ve fought hard on this .
The regulators have made some concessions , but they ’ve stuck with an approach substantially tougher than the existing rules .
The banks would really have preferred something less stringent .
And your calculations have suggested that the banks are overstating their case : Tougher capital requirements wo n’t do much damage to the economy .
That is correct .
I believe these requirements will have a fairly minimal effect .
But if you took everything together , you may find the economy slows by a quarter of a percent a year or so .
That ’s nothing to sneeze at , but if it ’s the price we pay to avoid having a massive recession with effects lasting years every few decades , it ’s worth it .
And will the regulations be enforced ?
What ’s to stop one country or another from simply ignoring them ?
It ’s a non-binding , global agreement .
So national regulators could decide not to follow it .
But in practice , regulators around the world gave been fairly honest about trying to stick with these agreements .
The big markets like the U.S. or England or even Europe know that if one part of the world begins regulating too loosely , it can be disaster for the whole system .
the problem with avoiding religion ’s dark side
While faitheists and accommodationists urge atheists to be nice to religious zealots , the most fervent believers feel no need to treat atheists and other faithful as human , much less worthy of respect .
Illustration by Fredherico Silva
Today ’s narrative for religious apologists and fundamentalists seeking to force their will into law usually goes something like this : atheists are arrogant and were responsible for all the genocides of the last century , while religious people are humble and peaceful folk who answer to a higher authority .
For a good example of all the mistakes and fallacies of this position , as well as how it ’s being advanced , just take a look back at the WoWT teardown of an interview with the governor of Indiana and consider something that ’s frequently missed by a vast majority of religious apologists coming from accommodationist stances , or organizations trying to buy their way into scientific institutions .
As they argue about all the positives of religion , they avoid discussing a disturbing continuation of torture and barbaric honor killings in the name of religious traditions as anything but random acts of violence by deluded people .
And that view ignores just how frighteningly common these cases are , and how the practice of religion by some of its strictest devotees can easily fall into the realm of theodicy .
But wait a second , how could I say that ?
No truly religious person would ever do something like this !
Religion is all about peace , love and understanding , teaching us how to be good to our fellow humans and inspiring a whole lot of art , literature and scientific research into existential problems , right ?
Actually , the notion of faith as an exploratory tool rather than a rigid set of principles by which all of us must live or face dire consequences , is an idea cultures developed during their periods of learning and scientific advancements when a number of aspiring polymaths asked questions about the natural world and justified their pursuits as a God - given ability which should n’t be suppressed by dogmatism .
But historically speaking , today ’s big religions were created at a time when people who spoke the same language , worshipped the same deities , and lived in one particular area usually kept their distance from those who spoke other languages and worshipped other gods .
And as a result , many religious texts talk about loving thy neighbor while at the same time preaching death to heretics , those who disobey the religious tenets , and distrust of those from foreign lands .
In today ’s world , where every major city is within just a day or two of travel from each other and we have quite a few ways of communicating instantly across the globe , these ancient rules lead to a lot of tension .
In Christian nations , many a pundit warn about Muslim immigrants being the first wave of anti-Western crusaders who will impose Sharia law on the world , when in reality , the vast majority of them is just looking for a better life .
On the flip side , we have incendiary Muslim clerics demanding the death of anyone who looks at them the wrong way , or dares to make light of their actions , backwards laws that punish victims of rape and assault in the UAE , and a culture of brutal honor killings and violent assaults and kidnappings in the name of following an arcane rule in ancient holy books .
Just consider the barbaric murder of a young couple in India whose only offense was dating across religiously dictated sub-castes , or the honor killing of a young girl for disobeying her father , or death threats to barbers for daring to cut a man ’s beard in Pakistan .
There are dozens of cases like this on a weekly basis all across the world , and each of them can be linked to religious ideas .
While high minded theologians complain about atheists ’ lack of metaphysical sophistication , demanding that those who decided they want nothing to do with theism shed a solemn tear for God , the sad fact is that as the more tolerant and peaceful members of religious movements try to help the less fortunate , somewhere , there is a father beheading his daughter for not following a holy book closely enough , or a group of people beating a young man to death for daring to wear the wrong clothes , or read the wrong book .
Even in the U.S. , where this kind of behavior will easily land you in one of the most severe penitentiaries in the nation , and very possibly on death row , parents will deny medical treatment to their children because they see the child ’s disease as a test of their faith , running for faith healers instead of doctors .
Maybe those theologians who lament any form of secularism or non-theism as dangerously blind nihilism could at least try to explain the darker side of faith rather than sweep it under the rug ?
Or if they ’re so interested in a tit - for - tat , can they tell us about the last time they saw a news story about a father killing one of his kids for not reading Dawkins or not visiting Pharyngula on a daily , or at least weekly basis ?
Sure , we could just blame it all on the people .
After all , it ’s true that there are authoritarian , anti-social humans out there just looking to justify their inhumanly cruel actions .
For an “ evolutionist ” like me , all humans are part of the same species and we all need each other to survive and keep evolving .
For most faithful , all people are God ’s children and we should all treat each other with respect .
But for disturbingly many , religion is used as a tool for instituting draconian order over societies , a justification for xenophobia , war , and discrimination .
How long did it take most Christian nations to acknowledge that darker skin or internal reproductive organs did not make someone a lesser human being ?
How long will it take Muslim clerics to stop treating women as males ’ personal property ?
There ’s something very wrong when societies will obsess over Grand Theft Auto , trying to ban games like it after every crime involving a teenager , but when honor killings take the lives of young adults because their parents think it ’s their divinely ordained duty to slaughter their children if they do n’t obey ancient laws in the holy texts they follow , nobody seems to want to point to the holy book as a potential problem .
As people lose their lives over arcane dogmas , how can we honestly pretend that religion is , and always was , such an inspiration for everything good in life that without it we would all become savages who ’ll go on killing sprees in between bloody orgies ?
Seems to me that following religious texts and customs literally results in a whole lot of misery , bloodshed and grief , a good deal of of which could be avoided if more people took tomes of ancient customs , traditions , and metaphysically infused punditry , far less seriously than we do …

The corruption scandal has involved dozens of officials in Chongqing
China has executed the top justice official in the city of Chongqing as part of a crackdown on corruption .
Wen Qiang , former director of the Chongqing Municipal Judicial Bureau , was the highest - ranking official charged in connection with the scandal .
He was convicted of accepting bribes , rape and shielding criminal gangs .
Dozens of officials have been prosecuted as part of the clampdown , initiated by Chongqing 's Communist Party boss Bo Xilai .
Wen served as the huge municipality 's deputy police chief for 16 years before becoming its top judicial official .
According to Xinhua news agency , he was convicted of taking more than 12 m yuan ( $ 1.76 m , £ 1.16 m ) in bribes either in person or through his wife .
He also took bribes to protect five organised crime gangs and , in August 2007 , raped a university student .
In May Wen lost an appeal against his death sentence , after the high court said the evidence against him was clear .
His wife and three of his associates were tried alongside him and jailed .
His sister - in - law , Xie Caiping , was also sentenced last year to 18 years in prison , for running illegal gambling dens .
To date more than 90 officials have been prosecuted as part of the high - profile crackdown , which began in the southern city in mid-2009 .
It has increased the popularity of Bo Xilai , and is being seen by some as an attempt on his part to secure a spot in the governing politburo .
But despite this high - profile campaign corruption among officials remains widespread , says the BBC's Damian Grammaticas in Beijing .
This worries China 's leaders , who are seriously concerned that public anger at levels of corruption is undermining support for the Communist Party .
PyPy is the Future of Python
Currently the most common implementation of Python is known as CPython , and it ’s the version of Python you get at python.org , probably 99.9 % of Python developers are using it .
However , I think over the next couple of years we ’re going to see a move away from this towards PyPy , Python written in Python .
This is going to happen because PyPy offers better speed , more flexibility , and is a better platform for Python ’s growth , and the most important thing is you can make this transition happen .
The first thing to consider : speed .
PyPy is a lot faster than CPython for a lot of tasks , and they ’ve got the benchmarks to prove it .
There ’s room for improvement , but it ’s clear that for a lot of benchmarks PyPy screams , and it ’s not just number crunching ( although PyPy is good at that too ) .
Although Python performance might not be a bottleneck for a lot of us ( especially us web developers who like to push performance down the stack to our database ) , would you say no to having your code run 2 x faster ?
The next factor is the flexibility .
By writing their interpreter in RPython PyPy can automatically generate C code ( like CPython ) , but also JVM and .NET versions of the interpreter .
Instead of writing entirely separate Jython and IronPython implementations of Python , just automatically generate them from one shared codebase .
PyPy can also have its binary generated with a stackless option , just like stackless Python , again no separate implementations to maintain .
Lastly , PyPy ’s JIT is almost totally separate from the interpreter , this means changes to the language itself can be made without needing to update the JIT , contrast this with many JITs that need to statically define fast - paths for various operations .
And finally that it ’s a better platform for growth .
The last point is a good example of this : one can keep the speed from the JIT while making changes to the language , you do n’t need to be an assembly expert to write a new bytecode , or play with the builtin types , the JIT generator takes care of it for you .
Also , it ’s written in Python , it may be RPython which is n’t as high level as regular Python , but compare the implementations of of ``map` [ from CPython and PyPy :
static PyObject * builtin_map ( PyObject * self , PyObject * args ) { typedef struct { PyObject * it ; /* the iterator object */ int saw_StopIteration ; /* bool : did the iterator end ? */ } sequence ; PyObject * func , * result ; sequence * seqs = NULL , * sqp ; Py_ssize_t n , len ; register int i , j ; n = PyTuple_Size ( args ) ; if ( n ] ( 2 ) { PyErr_SetString ( PyExc_TypeError , " map ( ) requires at least two args " ) ; return NULL ; } func = PyTuple_GetItem( args , 0 ) ; n -- ; if ( func == Py_None ) { if ( PyErr_WarnPy3 k ( " map ( None , ... ) not supported in 3.x ; " " use list ( ... ) " , 1 ) < 0 ) return NULL ; if ( n == 1 ) { /* map( None , S ) is the same as list ( S ) .
*/ return PySequence_List( PyTuple_GetItem( args , 1 ) ) ; } } /*
Get space for sequence descriptors .
Must NULL out the iterator * pointers so that jumping to Fail _2 later does n't see trash .
*/ if ( ( seqs = PyMem_NEW ( sequence , n ) ) == NULL ) { PyErr_NoMemory ( ) ; return NULL ; } for ( i = 0 ; i < n ; ++ i ) { seqs [ i ]. it = ( PyObject * ) NULL ; seqs[i].saw_StopIteration = 0 ; } /*
Do a first pass to obtain iterators for the arguments , and set len * to the largest of their lengths .
*/ len = 0 ; for ( i = 0 , sqp = seqs ; i < n ; ++ i , ++ sqp ) { PyObject * curseq ; Py_ssize_t curlen ; /*
Get iterator . */ curseq = PyTuple_GetItem( args , i + 1 ) ; sqp -> it = PyObject_GetIter( curseq ) ; if ( sqp -> it == NULL ) { static char errmsg [ ] = " argument %d to map ( ) must support iteration " ; char errbuf [ sizeof ( errmsg ) + 25 ] ; PyOS_snprintf ( errbuf , sizeof ( errbuf ) , errmsg , i + 2 ) ; PyErr_SetString( PyExc_TypeError , errbuf ) ; goto Fail_2 ; } /* Update len. */ curlen = _ PyObject_LengthHint( curseq , 8 ) ; if ( curlen > len ) len = curlen ; } /*
Get space for the result list .
*/ if ( ( result = ( PyObject * ) PyList_New ( len ) ) == NULL ) goto Fail_2 ; /* Iterate over the sequences until all have stopped .
*/ for ( i = 0 ; ; ++ i ) { PyObject * alist , * item = NULL , * value ; int numactive = 0 ; if ( func == Py_None && n == 1 ) alist = NULL ; else if ( ( alist = PyTuple_New ( n ) ) == NULL ) goto Fail_1 ; for ( j = 0 , sqp = seqs ; j < n ; ++ j , ++ sqp ) { if ( sqp -> saw_StopIteration ) { Py_INCREF ( Py_None ) ; item = Py_None ; } else { item = PyIter_Next ( sqp -> it ) ; if ( item ) ++ numactive ; else { if ( PyErr_Occurred ( ) ) { Py_XDECREF ( alist ) ; goto Fail_1 ; } Py_INCREF ( Py_None ) ; item = Py_None ; sqp -> saw_StopIteration = 1 ; } } if ( alist ) PyTuple_SET_ITEM( alist , j , item ) ; else break ; } if ( ! alist ) alist = item ; if ( numactive == 0 ) { Py_DECREF ( alist ) ; break ; } if ( func == Py_None ) value = alist ; else { value = PyEval_CallObject ( func , alist ) ; Py_DECREF ( alist ) ; if ( value == NULL ) goto Fail_1 ; } if ( i >= len ) { int status = PyList_Append ( result , value ) ; Py_DECREF ( value ) ; if ( status < 0 ) goto Fail_1 ; } else if ( PyList_SetItem ( result , i , value ) < 0 ) goto Fail_1 ; } if ( i < len && PyList_SetSlice ( result , i , len , NULL ) < 0 ) goto Fail_1 ; goto Succeed ; Fail_1 : Py_DECREF ( result ) ; Fail_2 : result = NULL ; Succeed : assert ( seqs ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i < n ; ++ i) Py_XDECREF ( seqs [ i ].it ) ; PyMem_DEL ( seqs ) ; return result ; }
That ’s a lot of code !
It would n’t be bad , for C code , except for the fact that there ’s far too much boilerplate : every single call into the C - API needs to check for an exception , and INCREF and DECREF calls are littered throughout the code .
Compare this with PyPy ’s RPython implementation :
def map ( space , w_func , collections_w ) : " " " does 3 separate things , hence this enormous docstring .
1 . if function is None , return a list of tuples , each with one item from each collection .
If the collections have different lengths , shorter ones are padded with None .
2 . if function is not None , and there is only one collection , apply function to every item in the collection and return a list of the results .
3 . if function is not None , and there are several collections , repeatedly call the function with one argument from each collection .
If the collections have different lengths , shorter ones are padded with None " " " if not collections_w : msg = " map ( ) requires at least two arguments " raise OperationError ( space .
w_TypeError , space . wrap ( msg ) ) num_collections = len( collections_w ) none_func = space .
is_w ( w_func , space . w_None ) if none_func and num_collections == 1 : return space .
call_function ( space .
w_list , collections_w [ 0 ] ) result_w = [ ] iterators_w = [ space . iter ( w_seq ) for w_seq in collections_w ] num_iterators = len( iterators_w ) while True : cont =
False args_w = [ space .
w_None ] * num_iterators for i in range ( len( iterators_w ) ) : try : args_w [ i ] = space . next ( iterators_w[i ] ) except OperationError , e : if not e . match ( space , space . w_StopIteration ) : raise else : cont =
True w_args = space . newtuple ( args_w ) if cont : if none_func : result_w . append ( w_args ) else : w_res = space .
call ( w_func , w_args ) result_w . append ( w_res ) else : return space .
newlist ( result_w ) map .
unwrap_spec = [ ObjSpace , W_Root , " args_w " ]
It ’s not exactly what you ’d write for a pure Python implementation of map , but it ’s a hell of a lot closer than the C version .
The case for PyPy being the future is strong , I think , however it ’s not all sunshine are roses , there are a few issues .
It lags behind CPython ’s version ( right now Python 2.5 is implemented ) , C extension compatibility is n’t there yet , and not enough people are trying it out yet .
But PyPy is getting there , and you can help .
On Tuesday last week , customers at Deb ’s Books in Cullman , Ala . started coming in and calling with an odd request :
They wanted copies of “ The Road to Serfdom , ” a book economist Friedrich Hayek wrote over 65 years ago .
Customers at Schuler Books and Music , in Grand Rapids , Mich .
were also looking Hayek ’s book .
Same with the Book Shop in Green Valley , Ariz .
On Amazon , it shot to number one where it remained for a week .
The reason : Fox News television host Glenn Beck , whose recommendations have lately had an Oprah Winfrey - like effect on book sales , had just devoted a section of his show to the Road to Serfdom .
But Mr. Hayek ’s book is no beach read .
Rather , it ’s dense polemic against socialism that argues that centralized planning by the government will inevitably lead to an oppressive state .
Mr. Hayek wrote it while living in England in the early 1940s out of concern that a shift toward collectivism there would give rise to something akin to Nazism .
Even before Mr. Beck ’s show , there was a surge in interest in Mr. Hayek , a Nobel - prize winner who died in 1992 .
A member of the so - called Austrian school of economics , Mr. Hayek believed that the economy was simply too complex for the government to attempt to manage its ups and downs .
He argued that economist John Maynard Keynes ’s recommendation that government spend money to allay an economic downturn could actually make the downturn worse , as well as lead to an inflation problem later .
With many people angry over the financial crisis , the recession and the government ’s large - scale response to both of those things , Mr. Hayek ’s ideas are striking a chord .
Late last year George Mason University economist Russell Roberts helped put together a rap video that pitted Mr. Keynes against Mr. Hayek that so far has garnered over a million hits on YouTube .
Below is the first trailer for the new ‘ Harry Potter ’ films … Part 1 hits theaters this November , and Part 2 next summer !

As if the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) did n't have enough to look for .
It is already charged with hunting for the fabled Higgs boson , extra dimensions and supersymmetry , but physicists are now adding even more elaborate phenom­ena to its shopping list -- including vanishing dimensions that could explain the accelerating expansion of the Universe .
Some argue that signs of new and exotic physics could show up in the LHC far sooner than expected .
In March , the LHC , sited at CERN , Europe 's particle - physics facility near Geneva , Switzerland , began colliding protons at energies of 7 trillion electronvolts -- half the final target but already three times greater than its nearest rival , the Tevatron in Batavia , Illinois .
This week , particle physicists gather at the International Conference on High Energy Physics ( ICHEP ) in Paris to discuss what they hope to find -- and when the discoveries might emerge .
Still topping physicists ' wish lists is the Higgs boson , the elusive particle thought to be part of the mechanism that gives other particles their mass .
If the standard model of particle physics has correctly predicted its characteristics , gathering enough data to find the Higgs should take about two more years , says Albert de Roeck , deputy spokesman for the Compact Muon Solenoid ( CMS ) experiment at the LHC .
But beyond the Higgs , researchers hope to see evidence of new physics .
So far , accelerator experiments have repeatedly confirmed the predictions of the standard model , which encompasses all discovered particles , the Higgs and three of the fundamental forces of nature : electromagnetism ; the weak force that controls radioactivity ; and the strong force that binds quarks together .
" It 's annoying , because from a mathematical perspective , we know that the standard model must be wrong , " says Greg Landsberg , a particle physicist at Brown University in Providence , R.I .
The model breaks down at high energies ( such as those predicted in the early Universe ) , giving infinite answers for the strength of particle interactions , unless physicists fudge the numbers .
One addendum to the standard model that does away with this fine - tuning is supersymmetry ( SUSY ) , which posits the existence of heavier twins for all known particles .
These SUSY twins could show up at the LHC within a couple of years , says de Roeck .
The other big prize for the LHC would be evidence of extra dimensions .
These are proposed by some forms of string theory , which describes the fundamental building blocks of the Universe as endlessly vibrating strands .
If extra dimensions exist , their presence could show up as a shortfall in the energy of collision debris , indicating that some particles created in the smash can access these dimensions .
Miniature black holes appearing during collisions could also betray the gravitational effects of these dimensions , de Roeck says .
The accelerator has already hit the high energies needed for these new particles and exotic effects to pop up .
But the machine needs to ramp up its collision rate to generate enough data to prove that rare anomalies are more than statistical blips , says de Roeck .
Some argue that by focusing on SUSY and extra dimensions , physicists could miss earlier signs of new physics .
Zoltan Ligeti , a physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California , and his colleagues have calculated that as it ramps up , the LHC will generate enough collisions to produce clear signatures of a hypothetical " diquark " particle proposed by some forms of string theory .
" Even with relatively little LHC data , you could show that the standard model is wrong , if you know what to look for , " says Ligeti , who has a list of new particles to watch for that he will unveil at ICHEP .
Landsberg hopes to trump the standard model in grander style .
He is presenting an ambitious new theory in which the number of dimensions in the Universe increases as it grows in size .
He and his colleagues propose that the Universe began with just one spatial dimension and one time dimension .
" Think of the Universe as a one - dimensional thread that gradually wove itself into a two - dimensional tapestry as it grew , and then wrapped itself up further to create three dimensions , " he says .
Reducing the spatial dimensions of the early Universe avoids the problems with the standard model , because the unwanted infinities arise only for equations describing three dimensions , says Landsberg .
The team has also calculated that a fourth spatial dimension would show up as an intrinsic energy that pushes the three - dimensional Universe outwards .
The effect roughly matches the acceleration of cosmic expansion , currently attributed to the mysterious " dark energy . "
" Dark energy is an echo of the fourth dimension of space , " Landsberg argues .
Vanishing dimensions
The LHC could reveal " spectacular evidence " of one spatial dimension vanishing as the machine approaches the high - energy conditions seen soon after the Big Bang , says Landsberg .
If his ideas are correct , then the LHC will soon start to access a two - dimensional universe .
" Collision debris that you would expect to spray out in three dimensions , will instead be confined to a two - dimensional plane , " he says .
Evidence of vanishing dimensions may already have been spotted in the shower of particles created by cosmic rays entering our atmosphere .
De Roeck was recently approached by a team of physicists who had found some " peculiar results " while reanalysing cosmic - ray data collected 15 years ago in the Pamir mountains in central Asia .
" Instead of particle jets spraying everywhere , as expected , the jets were oddly aligned in a way that can't be explained by conventional models , " says de Roeck .
The CMS collaboration is already planning to see if the effect can be reproduced at the LHC ( M. Deile et al .
http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3527v1; 2010 ) .
" Landsberg 's model remains highly speculative , but it may just be that the signature for it has been seen , " says de Roeck .
" That 's something we certainly want to try to confirm or rule out at the LHC . "

Nato probes reports raid killed 45 Afghan civilians By David Loyn
BBC News , Kabul Published duration 25 July 2010
image caption Dozens were said to be sheltering in the village from nearby fighting
International forces in Afghanistan say they are urgently investigating reports as many as 45 civilians died in an air strike in Helmand province on Friday .
Nato 's initial investigation found no evidence , but a BBC journalist visiting Regey village spoke to several people who said they had seen the incident .
At the time , dozens were sheltering in the village from nearby fighting .
A significant civilian loss of life would be rare this year as a new policy of restraint has reduced casualties .
' Lying asleep '
Witnesses said the attack had come in daylight as dozens sheltered from fighting in nearby Joshani .
Mohammed Khan , a boy aged about 16 , said helicopters had circled over the village before the incident .
He said that he had warned other children to take cover .
But his mother told him not to worry them .
He went further away and was shielded by a wall that saved his life when the attack started .
" I heard the sound of the rocket land on our house .
I rushed in screaming with my father and saw bodies lying in the dust …
I found I was even standing on a dead body . "
One of the bodies was his brother .
" He had been lying asleep in the afternoon when they were killed , " Mohammed said .
After the attack relatives and neighbours came to assist in digging out the dead and taking the injured to hospital .
Sher Mohammed said that the owner of the house had been his cousin .
He said it had taken until late into the night to dig out the bodies .
Rescuers buried 39 and believed six were left under the rubble , he added .
The bodies were buried at daylight .
Haji Rahim could not contain his tears .
He said that after a sleepless night , he and other villagers had gone to talk to a Nato patrol .

He said : " They can see something as small as an insect just four inches on the ground , so how were they not able to see all of those women and children when they bombed them ? "
For several months there has been a significant reduction in civilian casualties and very few air strikes under a new policy of restraint ordered by Gen Stanley McChrystal .
He was forced from his post recently after talking too frankly to journalists .
A spokesman for the international forces , Lt Col Chris Hughes , said : " A preliminary investigation by [ Nato's ]
Isaf forces and the provincial governor , which included a meeting with local elders , gives no indication of a mass casualty incident caused by coalition forces in Sangin . "

The docking in El - Arish last Wednesday of the Libyan Gaza - bound “ aid ship ” marks – from the Israeli perspective – a desirable ending to another maritime provocation .
In our circumstances , nothing is ever guaranteed outright , but this may signal a new approach following thefiasco .
This latest installment in what doubtlessly is an ongoing saga may just possibly indicate that operative conclusions have been drawn from what went wrong last time .
It ’s clear such stunts will continue .
Every last drop of propaganda - profit will be squeezed out before these ships are abandoned in favor of new ploys .
The handling of theprovides an object lesson in just how to crisis - manage such challenges .
The approach may not always work .
Much , crucially , depends on the degree of aggression and malice onboard .
But some of the practicable rules followed in this case will be applicable henceforth .
Most prominent in the new approach is the resort to diplomatic channels .
The advantage is twofold : world opinion is put on notice that Israel wishes to avoid confrontation without sacrificing its vital security interests .
Simultaneously , indirect contacts are utilized to avoid confrontation , and lead to the sort of compromise that redirected the Amalthea to Egypt .
In a sense , Israel came out having its cake and eating it too .
It deterred the Libyans without resorting to violence – and without the attendant bad press .
It ’s obvious that , this time , the legal ramifications of blocking foreign intruders were taken into account .
Hence the decision not to engage thein international waters .
The Libyans were shadowed and warned throughout , but they were n’t to be physically thwarted unless and until they were out of international waters .
THE ROLE of the Cuban captain also needs to be focused upon .
Theincident had shown ship owners that they have much to lose when collaborating in the Hamas - inspired campaign to embarrass Israel and create a false façade of starvation in Gaza .
Theis n’t back in the business of making money for its owners .
It ’s still moored at Ashdod Port and there is no telling when it will be released .
This certainly is another potent weapon in Israel ’s hands and one which should not be relinquished too quickly .
The combination of military deterrent and diplomatic action had already proved itself in the cases of the Iranian and Lebanese / Iranian - proxy boats .
Although the intelligence services continue to keep watch for the possibility of such sailings , it was n’t for nothing that they “ rescheduled ” / called off their much - touted plans .
Likewise , the outcome of the Libyan episode is nothing to downplay .
Potentially the Libyans are no less dangerous .
Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi now serves as Arab League chairman and apparently feels obliged to prove that Arabs can outdo anything the Turks boast about .
He cannot let Ankara ’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan become the new Muslim super - hero .
Hamas , for its part , has every incentive to escalate the “ nautical intifada . ”
This is a surefire popularity booster in the Palestinian context as well as in the domestic contexts of assorted Arab states .
The approaching month of Ramadan is only likely to raise flotilla - fervor and its demagogic value .
Hamas needs to crush the Israeli blockade to facilitate large - scale rearmament .
This is n’t only an anti-Israeli gambit but one calculated to give Hamas the upper hand against Fatah .
That is why Hamas refused to accept the Egyptian - brokered truce with the PA recently .
This is all about creating a viable Iranian outpost in Gaza .
And that is something Egypt also wishes to foil .
The way in which the Libyan maneuver was resolved serves all anti-Hamas / Iran forces in the region .
With that in mind , the El Arish solution sets an important precedent for Israel , one it can cite as a workable solution and one which demonstrates Israel ’s disinclination for belligerence .
The very establishment of this precedent will hopefully reduce at least some of the pressure on Israel – and take some of the wind out of the sails of Hamas and its well - wishers abroad .
Maybe it was at a party , a family event , or even at work , but you have probably encountered before a person whom we would call a conspiracy theorist .
Were you cornered as they became more and more animated , discussing how the shadow world government is slowly preparing for world domination using chemtrails and vaccines ?
Perhaps you became progressively sheepish as every logical question was met with an even more absurd bit of circular reasoning , accompanied by accusations of being naive , until physical escape was your only option .
This , of course , is an extreme example while conspiracy thinking occurs on a spectrum – we all have a little conspiracy theorist inside of us to some degree .
Understanding conspiracy thinking in its subtle and extreme forms seems like an important topic of psychological investigation , and yet there is a paucity of good scientific research .
Perhaps this is due to the stigma of conspiracies – academics do n’t want to get the stench of conspiracy theories on them .
But there is some interesting research , and recently psychologists Viren Swami and Rebecca Coles reviewed this research in their article The Truth is Out There .
This is a keeper – one for the skeptical files , if for nothing else than that they provide a handy list of references on conspiracy research .
They discuss that early papers on conspiracy theories focused on characterizing the theories themselves , rather than the people who hold them .
They reference Hofstadter ’s 1966 “ seminal ” paper on conspiracy theories in which he provided the following definition :
( Belief in a ) “ vast , insidious , preternaturally effective international conspiratorial network designed to perpetrate acts of the most fiendish character . ”
That sums it up nicely .
But the more interesting work came later when researchers began to explore the psychology of the people who hold conspiracy theories .
It seems that in this area ideas followed a typical historical pattern – in that at first conspiracy thinking was seen as a form of psychopathology involving paranoid delusional ideation .
More recently conspiracy thinking is seen as fulfilling certain universal psychological needs perhaps triggered by situational factors .
In my view both approaches are correct – there appears to be a spectrum of inherent predisposition to conspiracy thinking .
At the same time there is a universal appeal to conspiracy theories and situations in which they are more likely to occur , even among the more rational .
For example , the authors write :
To the extent that conspiracy theories fill a need for certainty , it is thought they may gain more widespread acceptance in instances when establishment or mainstream explanations contain erroneous information , discrepancies , or ambiguities ( Miller , 2002 ) .
A conspiracy theory , in this sense , helps explain those ambiguities and ‘ provides a convenient alternative to living with uncertainty ’ ( Zarefsky , 1984 , p.72 ) .
Or as Young and colleagues ( 1990 , p.104 ) have put it , ‘[ T ] he human desire for explanations of all natural phenomena – a drive that spurs inquiry on many levels – aids the conspiracist in the quest for public acceptance . ’
Conspiracy thinking is rooted in a desire for control and understanding , triggered by a lack of control and information , or ambiguous and unsatisfying information about big events .
The authors emphasize that the public often has a lack of access to adequate information to explain historical events ( a situational factor ) .
This can be coupled with what has been called a “ crippled epistemology ” – a tendency to utilize circular reasoning , confirmation bias , and poor logic coupled with this lack of information .
The result is a popular conspiracy theory that makes sense ( even if a perverse sense ) of events .
One tidbit I found interesting was the offer of the fundamental attribution error as a partial explanation for conspiracy thinking .
This is the notion that people tend to assume or overemphasize internal factors ( inherent character ) as an explanation for the behavior of others , rather than situational or external factors .
If we see someone trip while walking down the sidewalk we think they are clumsy , rather than that there was a crack in the sidewalk .
We , of course , exempt ourselves from this assumption are are happy to attribute our missteps to unavoidable external factors .
Conspiracy theorists take this attribution error to the extreme , and will often attribute the behavior of others to internal goals ( the conspiracy ) rather than benign situational factors .
One factor that was not mentioned in the article was the related notion of agency detection – the human tendency to see agency in objects and events .
We tend to see a hidden agent where there is none .
With respect to conspiracy theories this results from seeing an invisible hand behind otherwise disconnected events .
This also relates to the desire for control , understanding , and privileged knowledge .
If you have any interest in conspiracy theories the entire article is worth a read .
And as I said , the list of references alone is worth keeping this one in the files .
Can fathers get postnatal depression ?
Although postnatal depression is common in mothers there is new research to suggest that 1 in 25 fathers also suffer from the symptoms of postnatal depression .
The symptoms of postnatal depression in men may be similar to that of the symptoms exhibited by women suffering from PND .
However , many fathers tend to show a more hostile approach if they are suffering from PND .
There are many causes of postnatal depression in men , as described in more detail below :
Financial pressure to look after the family
Changes in the relationship with your partner
Increased responsibility at home
A change in your lifestyle and routine
The pressure of dealing with fatherhood
If you are a father who has recently had a baby and are experiencing symptoms of PND then it is best to visit the doctor to discuss your feelings .
Lack of acknowledgment from health professionals can also contribute to frustration and hostility .
What makes fathers prone to PND ?
If the mother is suffering from PND than the father may be 3 - 7 % more likely to suffer symptoms
The changing relationship with the mother can also affect the father
The attention on the baby can leave some fathers left out
First time fathers can often feel the new pressure of responsibility
Older fathers may be more prone to PND
What can fathers do to alleviate their depression ?
Leading psychiatrists have dismissed the fact that fathers can suffer from PND due to the association of female hormones which arouses PND .
They do however acknowledge that fathers can suffer from depression .
If you do feel depressed you should visit your doctor immediately to discuss your feelings and sometimes talking to someone about your feelings can really help you to feel better .
In cases of severe depression your doctor may prescribe you with antidepressants .

You may have heard that Activision is hosting an independent games competition , like a much higher stakes version of the Independent Games Festival .
We 've been getting messages from fans about it , encouraging us to enter .
However , after reading the finalized terms , this seems to be an entirely different kind of competition : an indie game / business plan jam to create investment opportunities and world - exclusive development prototypes for Activision to profit from .
The competition is pretty polarizing : Many stories see it and immediately laud Activision for helping the indie community , while many stories are quick to trash it , noting dubious clauses in the fine print .
As an indie developer , I thought I 'd take a closer look myself .
Illustrated scenario from Aubrey Illustrated scenario from Aubrey
Let 's look at some of the terms for this competition , starting with the eligibility requirements :
The Submission cannot have been submitted previously in a promotion of any kind or exhibited or displayed publicly through any means .
Activision 's main site says that the contest is for completed or in - progress games .
Are there really a bunch of indie games in the United States ( the contest is limited to the US ) that are in complete stealth mode ?
As an advocate of open development , this makes me pretty sad .
While this immediately disqualifies Overgrowth , and in fact , every indie game you 've ever publicly heard of , I really hope it does n't discourage people from being open about their games .
It looks like Activision wants first dibs on exclusive , never - before - seen indie titles .
It is sort of amusing that a competition demands exclusivity from other competitions .
Is that an anti-competitive competition ?
Must include an expected schedule , budget , team make up for development of the game , and execution plan .
Asking for this kind of business info seems a little weird , but I can see how this makes sense to Activision .
This is n't really about highlighting indie games in the same way that the Independent Game Festival , Indie Game Challenge , and other contests do -- your business plan is included in the judging .
This seems pretty irrelevant to the quality of a video game , but read on , and this becomes a little clearer .
In order to be a Finalist , entrant must sign certain Submission documentation provided by Sponsor , which may include some or all of the following : release of claims against Sponsor ; acknowledgement of Sponsor 's development of game concepts that may be similar to entrant 's Submission ; first right of refusal to Sponsor for any development or publishing of Submission ; agreement to provide Sponsor with splash / title / credits and logo credit similar to " funded in part by the Activision Independent Games Competition Prize 2010 " ; grant of name and likeness publicity rights to Sponsor ; and full representations and warranties regarding the IP ownership of the Submission .
This is where it gets a little scary .
To become a finalist , you may have to grant " first right of refusal to [ Activision ] for any development or publishing of Submission " .
If you 're unfamiliar with the right of first refusal it basically means that you need to give the holder of the right of first refusal the option to have the same deal someone else has offered you first .
In other words , if Indie Fund , Valve , or [ insert your favorite entity here ] offers you " any development or publishing " for your game , whatever deal comes on the table , you must allow Activision the option to give you the same terms first .
Only if Activision passes on that deal , are you legally allowed to follow up with the other entity .
Update !
I received an email from someone I highly regard about this point .
I may be confusing right of first refusal with first and last matching rights .
I really recommend waiting until Activision clarifies these terms before seriously entering .
Initial Conclusion
While this contest is getting lauded by many news outlets and sort of seems similar to other feel - good indie contests and festivals , as it stands , it 's a bit dubious .
It feels more like a hybrid of a business plan competition to get some investment capital from Activision .
There 's nothing wrong with that ( although I would n't personally advise it ) but just know what you 're getting into first !
This is very , very different from the Independent Game Festival or other contests that you hear about on indie sites like TIGSource .
I may be out of line , so if any indies are actually going to enter this , feel free to set me straight in the comments ( do n't mention your game or you will be disqualified though ) .
I 'd also be interested in hearing from someone from Activision to clarify these points .
The Misconception :
When your emotions run high , people can look at you and tell what you are thinking and feeling .
The Truth : Your subjective experience is not observable , and you overestimate how much you telegraph your inner thoughts and emotions .
You stand in front of your speech class with your outline centered on the lectern , your stomach performing gymnastics .
You sat through all the other speeches , tapping the floor , transferring nervous energy into the tiles through a restless foot , periodically wiping your hands on the top of your pants to wick away the sweat .
Each time the speaker summed up and the class applauded , you clapped along with everyone else , and as it subsided you realized how loud your heart was thumping when a fresh silence settled .
Finally , the instructor called your name , and your eyes cranked open .
You felt as if you had eaten a spoonful of sawdust as you walked up to the blackboard planting each foot carefully so as not to stumble .
As you begin to speak the lines you ’ve rehearsed , you search the faces of your classmates .
“ Why is he smiling ?
What is she scribbling ?
Is that a frown ? ”
“ Oh no , ” you think , “ they can see how nervous I am . ”
I must look like an idiot .
I ’m bombing , are n’t I ?
This is horrible .
Please let a meteor hit this classroom before I have to say another word .
“ I ’m sorry , ” you say to the audience .
“ Let me start over . ”
Now it ’s even worse .
What kind of moron apologizes in the middle of a speech ?
Your voice quavers .
Flop sweat gathers behind your neck .
You become certain your skin must be glowing red and everyone in the room is holding back laughter .
Except , they are n’t .
They are just bored .
Your anxiety is peaking , and it feels like waves of emotional energy must be radiating from your head like some sort of despair halo , but there is nothing to see on the outside other than your facial expressions .
Keep those under control and you are home free .
“ If you ’re quiet at a party , people do n’t know if it ’s because you ’re arrogant and you think you ’re better than everyone else or because you ’re shy and do n’t know how to talk to people … but you know , because you know your thoughts and feelings .
So things like anxiety , optimism and pessimism , your tendency to daydream , and your general level of happiness — what ’s going on inside of you , rather than things you do — those are things other people have a hard time knowing . ” – Simine Vazire from a 2009 interview in Psychology Today conducted by Sam Gosling
To get information out of one head and into another , it has to be transmitted through some sort of communication .
Faces , sounds , gestures , words like the ones you are reading now – we must depend on these clunky tools because no matter how strong an emotion or how powerful an idea , it never seems as intense or potent to the world outside your mind as it does to the one within .
This is the illusion of transparency .
You know what you are feeling , what you are thinking , and you tend to believe those thoughts and emotions are leaking out of your pores , visible to the world , perceivable to the outside .
You overestimate how obvious what you truly think must be and fail to recognize other people in your life are in their own bubbles , thinking the same thing about their inner worlds .
When you try to imagine what other people are thinking , you have no choice but to start from inside your noggin .
In there , with your perturbations pushing up against you , among your inescapable self , you think your thoughts and feelings must be evident .
Sure , when people are paying attention , they can read you to an extent , but you grossly overestimate how much so .
You can test the illusion of transparency using a method created by Elizabeth Newton .
Pick a song everyone knows , like your national anthem , and have someone else sit across from you .
Now , tap out the song with your fingertips .
After a verse or two , ask the other person what you were tapping .
In your mind , you can hear every note , every instrument .
In their mind , they can hear your fingers tapping .
( If you record a video performing this experiment yourself and post it on YouTube , I ’ll add it to this post if you send me the link . )
Pause here and try it out .
I ’ll wait .
Ok .
I ’m going to assume you ’ve been tapping .
How did you do ?
Did they figure out what you were trying to play ?
Probably not .
How confident were you ?
Was it frustrating ?
In Newton ’s study , the tappers predicted the listeners would be able to guess the tune half of the time , but the listeners correctly guessed about 3 percent of the songs .
The rich , complex experience of being you is impossible to see .
Your subjective experience is wholly unobservable to anyone but yourself .
Yet , much of the time , you assume this is n’t so , that what you think and feel must be apparent .
The huge discrepancy between what you think people will understand and what they really do has probably lead to all sorts of mistakes in text messages and emails .
If you are like me , you often have to back up and restate your case , or answer questions about your tone , or reword everything and try sending it again .
We always know what we mean by our words , and so we expect others to know it too .
Reading our own writing , the intended interpretation falls easily into place , guided by our knowledge of what we really meant .
It ’s hard to empathize with someone who must interpret blindly , guided only by the words .
– Eliezer Yudowsky from Lesswrong.com
On the Internet , people often include “ / s ” at the end of a statement to indicate sarcasm .
It was so hard to communicate tone online we had to create a new punctuation mark .
Getting an idea out of one head and into another is difficult , and much can be lost in the information transfer .
An insight which slams into you like an avalanche wo n’t have the same impact coming out of your mouth or fingertips .
In 1998 , Thomas Gilovich , Victoria Medvec and Kenneth Savitsky published their research on the illusion of transparency in The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .
They reasoned your subjective experience , or phenomenology , was so potent you would have a hard time seeing beyond it when you were in a heightened emotional state .
Their hypothesis was based on the spotlight effect – the belief everyone is looking right at you , judging your actions and appearance , when in reality you disappear into the background most of the time .
Gilovich , Medvec and Savitsky figured the effect was so powerful it made you feel as if the imaginary spotlight could penetrate your gestures , words and expressions and reveal your private world as well .
They had Cornell students divide into groups .
An audience would listen as individuals read questions from index cards and then answered them out loud .
They either lied or told the truth based on what the card said to do on a label only they could see .
Audience members were told they would get prizes based on how many liars they detected .
Liars would say something like , “ I have met David Letterman . ”
They then had to guess how many people could tell they had lied while the audience tried to figure out who out of the five was fibbing .
The results ?
Half of the liars thought they had been caught , but only a quarter were – they strongly overestimated their transparency .
In subsequent experiments the variables were shuffled around and the lies presented in other ways ; the results were nearly identical .
Studies all throughout the 1980s showed you are confident in your ability to see through liars , yet you are actually terrible at it .
On the other side , you think your lies will be easy to detect , that you are more transparent than you are .
Gilovich , Medvec and Savitsky moved on to another experiment .
They sat students down in front of a video camera and a row of 15 cups filled with red liquid .
They asked to students to hide their expressions as they tasted the beverages because five of the drinks were going to be rat nasty .
They then had 10 people watch the tape and asked the students who did the tasting to estimate how many of the observers would be able to tell when they had imbibed something gross .
About a third of the observers could tell when people were disgusted , or at least they said they could and guessed well .
The people doing the tasting predicted about half would be able to see through their attempts to hide revulsion .
The illusion of transparency jacked up the powers of observation they imagined in their judges .
Pushing ahead , they tried another experiment based on the research of Miller and McFarland on the bystander effect ( the more people who witness an emergency , the less likely any one person will leap into action ) .
“ When confronted with a potential emergency , people typically play it cool , adopt a look of nonchalance , and monitor the reactions of others to determine if a crisis is really at hand .
No one wants to overreact , after all , if it might not be a true emergency .
However , because each individual holds back , looks nonchalant , and monitors the reactions of others , sometimes everyone concludes ( perhaps erroneously ) that the situation is not an emergency and hence does not require intervention . ” – Gilovich , Medvec and Savitsky from their study of The Illusion of Transparency
Once again , their research showed when people were in a situation in which they felt concerned and alarmed , they assumed it was written all over their faces when it reality it was n’t .
In turn , they thought if other people were freaking out , they would be able to see it .
In 2003 , Kenneth Savitsky and Thomas Gilovich conducted a study to determine if they could short - circuit the illusion of transparency .
They had people give public speeches on the spot and then rate how nervous they thought they looked to their audience .
Sure enough , they said they looked like a wreck , but the onlookers did n’t notice it .
Still , in this experiment some people got stuck in a feedback loop .
They thought they appeared nervous , so they started to try and compensate , and then they thought the compensation was noticeable and tried to cover that up which they then felt was more obvious , and so on until they worked themselves up into a state where they were obviously freaking out .
They decided to run the experiment again , but this time they explained the illusion of transparency to some of the subjects , telling them they might feel like everyone could see them losing it , but they probably could n’t .
This time , the feedback loop was broken .
Those told about the illusion felt less stressed , gave better speeches and the audiences said they were more composed .
Our results thus lend credence to the notion that “ the truth can set you free ” : Knowing the truth about the illusion of transparency set participants free from the cycle of anxiety … – Kenneth Savitsky and Thomas Gilovich
When your emotions take over , when your own mental state becomes the focus of your attention , your ability to gauge what other people are experiencing gets muted .
If you are trying to see yourself through their eyes , you will fail .
Knowing this , you can plan for the effect and overcome it .
When you get near the person you have a crush on and feel the war drums in your gut , do n’t freak out .
You do n’t look as nervous as you feel .
When you stand in front of an audience or get interviewed on camera , there might be a thunderstorm of anxiety in your brain , but it ca n’t get out ; you look far more composed than you believe .
Smile .
When your mother - in - law cooks a meal better fit for a dog bowl , she ca n’t hear your brain stem begging you to spit it out .
If you are trying to communicate something complex , or you have vast knowledge of a subject someone else does not , realize it is going to be difficult to put yourself in their shoes .
The explanation process may become thorny , but do n’t take it out on them .
Just because they ca n’t see inside your mind does n’t mean they are not so smart .
You do n’t suddenly become telepathic when angry , anxious or alarmed .
Keep calm and carry on .
If you buy one book this year …well , I suppose you should get something you ’ve had your eye on for a while .
But , if you buy two or more books this year , might I recommend one of them be a celebration of self delusion ?
Give the gift of humility ( to yourself or someone else you love ) .

Mixed Signals from Psychology Today
Inception is completely mind bending , there ’s no doubt about it .
When it comes down to it there really is no way to figure out the film .
No matter what explanation you come up with for the film there will always be evidence to contradict it .
Every theory and idea as to what went on in the film has at least a couple plot holes .
That being said , there are a few things that have been made clear .
A few concepts , burning questions and theories have recently had some light shed on them .
After seeing the movie twice , I now feel that I have a pretty good grasp on what happened and I think I can explain a fair bit about what really went on .
So without further ado , here it is , Dream A Little Bigger : A Guide To Understanding Inception .
Be warned , there are spoilers in this article .
1 . What was up with the train on the street ?
The explanation for the freight train that came crashing through the street can be one of two things .
Firstly , some people like to think it came from Fischer .
Fischer , being the important person that he is , has had his mind trained to defend itself from people like Cobb .
This is why the team has such a tough time to begin with .
Fischer ’s subconscious is trying to protect itself from the extractors , hence the fact that the team is constantly being chased .
The train is simply just another safeguard that is trying to deter the team from their goal .
Another explanation that people tend to think is that it came from Cobb ’s subconscious , aka Mal .
The train was the same one that took Cobb and Mal out of their dream world so it could be that Cobb unintentionally brought the train into the dream .
2 . How does one wake up from a dream ?
The bottom line on waking up from dreams is as follows .
There are only 4 ways one can escape from a dream .
To wake up , you must either receive a kick , the timer on the machine must run out , you must die in the dream or the sedative must wear off .
That is the only way to wake up from a dream when you are hooked up to one of those machines .
3 . Why is Saito so much older than Cobb when Cobb visits him in limbo ?
The reason that Saito appears to be so much older than Cobb when they are in limbo is because of the time .
Saito entered limbo before Cobb and due to the fact that time moves differently in limbo , this means that although Saito only entered limbo a short time before Cobb did , he will still appear much older since time moves at a different rate depending on how far down you are .
Although it does n’t look it , the script says that Cobb has also aged slightly when he goes to visit Saito .
Cobb technically spent years looking for Saito in limbo .
This is why he looks so dazed and confused when he finally finds Saito .
He is only able to remember Saito ’s name at first , but after talking with Saito , the two start to remember everything .

Articles in Details Magazine and in Boston Edge report that many Pentacostal and Evangelical churches across the United States practice " exorcism rituals " aimed at driving out demons thought to cause homosexuality .
What defenders of the practice call the " free exercise of religion " may amount to child abuse .
Many who undergo exorcisms to " cure " homosexuality are minors ; many of the ritual ’s aspects appear to be forms of psychological and physical abuse .
Joanne Highley of L.I.F.E. Ministry , who performs gay exorcisms , told Details that her rituals force evil spirits " out of genitals , of course out of anal canals , out of intestines , out of throats and mouths if there ’s been ungodly deposit of semen in those areas , " so that vomiting or diarrhea is seen as a physically manifestation of evil .
Last year a video of an exorcism performed on a 16 - year old gay teenager in Bridgeport , Connecticut , appeared on YouTube .
In it , a pastor and several church members press on the boy ’s stomach with their hands and feet until he vomits .
Critics reported the episode to Connecticut ’s department of children and families , but the controversy passed when the boy later declared that he was unharmed and no longer gay .
But critics say events of this kind are not isolated incidents .
Kamora Herrington , mentoring - program director of a non-profit organization called True Colors , says that " At least once or twice a month I get a call from someone who ’s been exorcised .
And no one wants to believe this is happening in beautiful , genteel Connecticut . "
Details also reports on Vincent Cervantes , who was subjected to an exorcism ritual by two men , but whose attraction to men remained unchanged .
Cervantes told Details the psychological toll he suffered was unbearable : " I felt I had failed God . . .
Nothing , not even an exorcism , can fix me .
In my mind I was going to go to hell .
I became very suicidal .
I absolutely hated myself . "
Details noted , " As many of these ‘ exorcism ’ abuses are inflicted upon children , some have demanded that the government intervene .
But child welfare agencies and prosecutors have cited freedom of religion protections and have done nothing . "
As of now , there appear to be no legal cases in the United States challenging gay exorcism .
Three Spaniards file charges over Israel flotilla raid Published duration 23 July 2010

The activists say the Israeli raid broke international law
Two Spanish activists and a journalist arrested in a raid by Israel on a Gaza - bound flotilla are filing charges against Israel 's prime minister .
The three accuse Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu , six cabinet ministers and the navy commander of illegal detention , torture and deportation .
The UN has meanwhile named a team of experts to investigate the raid .
Earlier , Israel said it would return the three Turkish vessels it had seized during the interception on 31 May .
Nine Turkish activists died when Israeli marines attacked the flotilla , sparking an international outcry .
The pro-Palestinian convoy was carrying 10,000 tonnes of aid for Gaza in an attempt to break Israel 's blockade of the territory .
Laura Arau , Manuel Tapial and David Segarra , who were on the Mavi Marmara ship , say they were held illegally in international waters by Israeli forces , tortured and forcibly deported to Turkey .
They claim the move contravened international law .
Spanish courts are yet to accept the case .
' No conditions '
The UN Human Rights Council has appointed three independent experts to investigate whether the raid violated international law , after the 47 - member forum voted last month for an inquiry .
These include Sir Desmond de Silva from Britain , Karl Hudson - Phillips from Trinidad and Tobago , and Mary Shanthi Dairiam from Malaysia .
Israel has said it is undertaking its own investigation , but critics say it will not be impartial .
Israel announced earlier on Friday that it will return three ships that were part of the convoy to Turkey , Israeli public radio has reported .
Turkey had already been informed of the decision by the inner cabinet in Jerusalem , the report said .
Talks were held up by Israel 's demand that the ships ' owners should sign guarantees that they would not mount new aid missions to Gaza .
However , the inner cabinet decided to return the vessels without further conditions , an Israeli official is reported to have said .

When you reach the end of the year , it 's my experience that three things happen : you speed up , then you tally up , and then , all things ...
With considerable fanfare this week , Gov. Patrick J. Quinn signed into law a measure to improve rape investigations by Illinois authorities .
But it came too late for women like Christina .
After a night out with a friend and the friend ’s boyfriend in April 2007 , Christina went with the pair to the friend ’s Hyde Park apartment to sleep on the living room couch .
When she was alone , she said , the boyfriend came into the room , pushed her roughly to the floor and raped her .
Christina said she was upset and concerned about medical costs so she waited two days before she went to the University of Chicago Medical Center .
She reported the rape , and waited nearly all night for a rape kit , which preserves evidence after a sexual assault .
A nurse noted signs of forced penetration in her medical records .
The next day , Christina called the detective who had interviewed her and written her report and asked how long it would take to get results from the rape kit .
Two weeks , he told her .
VILLERS -AU -TERTRE , France ( AP ) — A French woman who admitted suffocating eight of her newborns and concealing their corpses in the garden and garage of her home has been charged with manslaughter , a prosecutor said Thursday .
Dominique Cottrez , a 46 - year - old nurse 's aide by profession , said that after a bad experience with her first pregnancy she never again wanted to see a doctor .
She admitted delivering the babies herself and placing the corpses in plastic bags .
She buried two of the newborns in the garden and hid the rest of them in the garage , prosecutor Eric Vaillant said .
" She explained that she did n't want any more children and that she did n't want to see a doctor to take contraceptives , " Vaillant told a news conference .
" She was perfectly conscious of the fact that she was pregnant each time . "
Cottrez and her husband , Pierre - Marie Cottrez , were detained Wednesday after two corpses were discovered by the new owners in plastic bags in the garden of a house that had belonged to the woman 's father in the town of Villers - au - Tertre in northern France .
Under questioning , the woman admitted that there were six other corpses and told investigators that they were in plastic bags in the garage of her home where they were found .
The woman is still in detention and will undergo further psychiatric testing , Vaillant said .
Her husband was freed from custody and not charged , although he remains under judicial control .
He claimed that he knew nothing about the pregnancies of his wife , who is very large and apparently easily concealed her condition .
Earlier , Vaillant said in a statement that the husband could be charged with failure to report a crime and concealment of corpses .
The couple 's two grown daughters , who are in their 20s , have been questioned , Vaillant said .
He refused to provide any further details about them or what they said .
The discovery was not major news Thursday in the mainstream French newspapers , which briefly noted them on their front pages but buried the stories inside .
The main stories were the ban of bullfighting in Catalonia , Spain and the movie that French first lady Carla Sarkozy - Bruni is making with Woody Allen .
Police sealed the doors , gate and windows of the house where the remains of some of the babies were discovered .
DNA tests are being conducted to establish for sure whether the couple are the parents , and autopsies are being conducted on the corpses to try to determine the cause of death .
France has seen a string of cases in recent years of mothers killing their newborns and saving and hiding the corpses .
In one case , Celine Lesage was sentenced in March to 15 years in prison after acknowledging in court that she killed six of her newborns , whose corpses were found in plastic bags in her basement in northwest France .
Another Frenchwoman , Veronique Courjault , was convicted last year of murdering three of her newborn children .
Her husband discovered two of the corpses in a freezer while the two were living in South Korea .
During the trial psychiatrists testified that she suffered from a psychological condition known as " pregnancy denial . "
Germany also has seen similar cases .
In one , a woman was convicted of manslaughter in 2006 and sentenced to the maximum 15 years in prison for killing eight of her newborn babies and burying them in flower pots and a fish tank in the garden of her parents ' home near the German - Polish border .
The 73 - page report , based on interviews with 203 Tibetan witnesses who had fled China and visitors who were in the Tibetan areas at the time , is the most comprehensive independent assessment so far of the mayhem two years ago .
While the broad contours of the violence were known , many of the witness accounts and details of events in the report had not been documented before because foreign journalists were barred from the Tibetan areas .
The authors said the report “ finds that the scale of human rights violations related to suppressing the protests was far greater than previously believed , and that Chinese forces broke international law  including prohibitions against disproportionate use of force , torture and arbitrary detention , as well as the right to peaceful assembly  despite government claims to the contrary . ”
“ It also reveals that violations continue , including disappearances , wrongful convictions and imprisonment , persecution of families , and the targeting people suspected of sympathizing with the protest movement . ”
Chinese officials have said the security forces exercised sufficient restraint and that Tibetans perpetrated the most heinous acts of violence .
At least 19 people were killed in the rioting that unfolded in and around Lhasa on March 14 , 2008 , when Tibetans burned and looted hundreds of stores run by Han and ethnic Hui merchants , the Chinese government said .
Xinhua , the official Chinese news agency , reported in spring 2008 that more than 150 episodes of unrest took place from March 10 to March 28 in Tibetan areas .
The government has blamed the Dalai Lama , the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet , for catalyzing the protests , although the Dalai Lama has denied any such role .
“ In dealing with the incident , all related departments abided by the law and enforced it in a civil manner , ” Qin Gang , a Foreign Ministry spokesman , said Thursday in a written statement responding to faxed questions about the report .
“ The accused are fully guaranteed the rights of litigation , and their ethnic customs as well as their dignity are respected . ”
The outcast cinema student , Stephen Grace , does not drive cars due to the trauma of losing his brother in a car accident .
He befriends , Quaid , who since the age of 6 has experienced dreadful nightmares and daydreams about the death of his parents .
Quaid proposes they research about each one 's innermost fear .
Stephen sees the chance of developing an original thesis for college and invites his friend , Cheryl , to work with them .
Among the interviewees , Stephen talks to his colleague , Abby who works with him in the library .
Abby has a complex about the way she looks .
When the work is almost complete , Quaid has an outburst at one interviewee 's and ends up destroying the camera and editing equipment .
Stephen begins to re-evaluate the situation .

Emmanuel EBOUE ’s unofficial diary part III
Dear diary ,
How are you today ?
That ’s good .
We ’ve finally started pre-season training this week so I ’ve returned to sleeping at night .
When we had our first session I could sense something was n’t right .
As I entered the ground and met with the players there was a sombre tension among everyone .
Usually it ’s just Almunia who ’s jittery ( especially when he starts reminiscing to us about his part as a subway ghost in that Patrick Swayze movie ) but this time it was a lot more pronounced – he ’s infected the others .
I ’m guessing it ’s to do with the whole Cesc fiasco .
I noticed that he was n’t around …he must still be celebrating with his fellow teammates countrymen .
At about 7 am this morning I started my own warm - up routine ( training does n’t start until 10 but I usually dance for at least 2 hours to loosen up ) .
At 10 am the lads did a couple of laps ; I did a couple extra because it ’s been cold for the past few days .
As I was running past the Boss ’s office ( I call it the Boffice ) all I could hear was him shouting repeatedly that ‘ Arsenal Football Club does NOT negotiate with terrorists ’.
I can only guess which club president he was talking to .
After the morning session , at around noon , the Boss called me in .
He asked if I ’d learnt anything from my experience in South Africa .
I told him I had .
He was pleased so we began discussing and slowly Cesc became more and more the subject of our musings .
I do n’t know if anyone realised but against North Korea I cleverly eavesdropped on their player / manager exchanges – it ’s led to some startling insights on how to promote greater club loyalty from individuals .
The Boss and I have decided for Cesc to train on his own for the large part of pre-season .
With the help of Iain Dowie we designed a multi- purpose training facility just for Cesc .
The facility is filled with Arsenal memorabilia and DVDs in one half , the ‘ good ’ half , and Barcelona stuff in the other – the ‘ evil ’ half .
It ’s simply a moralistic education program : when Arsenal DVDs are chosen to be played on the projector the room becomes extremely peaceful , pastoral images skate across the ceiling and some Tchaikovsky plays lightly through a sound system .
When Barcelona VHSs are played however , a high pitched screeching is heard , uninterrupted , for ten minutes and is followed by every minute of Ade ’s World Cup commentary from BBC1 being projected onto each wall .
We ’ve also placed two buttons in the centre of the facility : an ‘ Arsenal ’ button and a ‘ Barcelona ’ button .
When he presses the Arsenal button he will be provided with food and water ( and I may even sing for him ) .
You do n’t want to know what happens when the Barcelona button is pressed , though .
Let ’s just say it involves Ade , William , and tapas .
Cesc ’s a smart lad .
I ’m sure he wo n’t be pressing the Barca button .

Google Apps users who want access to all the same products that regular Google Accounts have wo n’t have to wait much longer .
An anonymous tipster tells me a Google Trusted Tester program is underway right now , which “ transitions ” Google Apps accounts to full access to all GOOG products , including Voice , Reader , Buzz , Analytics , and more .
Here ’s the official Help page which includes a visualization of the transition , in the screenshot here .
( Here ’s a PDF , in case they pull access to the link . )
On this week ’s episode of TWiG , Leo , Jeff , and I were hoping aloud that there would be some way to merge existing Google / Apps accounts into one .
It does n’t look like that will be possible .
However , if you have a Google account that “ conflicts ” with your Apps account because you ’ve assigned the same email address to both , GOOG will resolve the conflict by adding a + personal to your regular account ’s sign - in address .
Stay with me here .
Here ’s what that means .
If you have a Google account for sue@example.com as well as a Google Apps account for sue@example.com , after the transition you ’ll still be able to sign into your Google account using sue+personal@example.com .
It ’s a bit confusing , and a little more work than the one - click account merge we ’d hoped for .
However , thanks in large part to Google ’s internal Data Liberation Front , many of Google ’s tools offer data export features .
So , while it ’ll take some time , it should n’t be difficult to export your data from your Google account and import it into your Google Apps account after this transition is done .
The only product I ’m worried about ?
Google Voice .
Since it ’s got my primary phone number associated with it , transitioning it from my Google account to my Google Apps account wo n’t be a simple data export / import operation .
I hope I ’ll be able to port my Voice number from my original account to my Google Apps account when all this goes down .
No word on when exactly that will be , but the fact that it ’s in Trusted Tester phase means “ pretty dang soon . ”
Update : Hooray !!
You can currently request to port your Google Voice account to another Google account ( though not a Google Apps account–yet ? )
Thanks , programzeta !

Postmortem : Tale of Tales ' The Path
By Michael Samyn , Auriea Harvey
The Path was released on March 18 , 2009 , from Tale of Tales , Steam and Direct2 Drive simultaneously .
Since then , our Little Red Riding Hood - inspired horror video game has met with both mean - spirited criticism and over - the - top adoration , and not much in between -- a divisive title if there ever was one .
And most definitely a breathtaking journey and a deeply personal experience for Auriea Harvey & Michaël Samyn , yours truly , designers of The Path .
This is the story of how The Path came to be .
Through the dark forest
History of the project
1999 , San Francisco , Triton Hotel : we meet in person for the first time .
We had found each other via our medium , the networked computer , and had a brief but passionate virtual love affair .
We got to know each other doing what we loved doing most : making websites and interactive artwork online .
We begin living and working together soon after .
2003 : Leaving behind careers of net.art and web design , the two of us radically redirect all our creative attention towards the medium of video games .
February 2005 : After two years of designing and prototyping , our first project , 8 , is rejected by games publishers , then the only source of funding .
We are devastated but determined to continue and to keep our independence .
Reboot .
September 2005 : Launch of The Endless Forest .
October 2006 : presentation of the Realtime Art Manifesto at the Mediaterra festival in Athens .
January 2007 : Drama Princess engine complete .
March 2008 : Launch of The Graveyard .
March 2009 , San Francisco , Triton Hotel : launch of The Path .
Preparation
The idea for The Path is almost as old as Tale of Tales itself .
In a June 2002 business plan , we presented our first project -- 8 , a dreamy adventure game based on Sleeping Beauty -- as part of a series of games , each based on a classic fairy tale and with a number as its title .
In another description of the 8 project , from October 2004 , we express that we have " plans for a survival - horror game based on Little Red Riding Hood " .
This game would be called 144 .
In 2005 , we started looking around for a production budget for 144 .
Some early requests with local Belgian arts funding bodies were rejected .
But at the end of the year , the USA - based arts organization Creative Capital came through with an initial grant of 10,000 U.S. dollars .
We were still working on the Drama Princess project at the time , but started directing it away from its original goal of driving the autonomous behavior of the main character in 8 , towards the more general character behavior manager required by the new project .
Not that The Path was a very clear idea at that time .
But motivated by the support of Creative Capital , the design gradually became more concrete .
Prototyping
In July 2006 , a first prototype was committed to our 144 repository .
The Deaf Mute Girl in the Pretty White Dress from the 8 project grew up a bit and became the Girl in White in 144 .
We decided not only to re-use the Girl in White character from 8 and the Drama Princess engine for autonomous characters , but also the environment rendering system of The Endless Forest .
This re-use was one of our ways to reduce the development budget .
After not being able to secure the -- for us -- gargantuan sum of 1.5 million dollars required for 8 , we were determined to make a game for a budget that was so small that we did n't need the support of the games industry .
For this reason , The Path was going to be a short game that was mostly non-linear ( no plot - based narrative , emergent behavior , few cut scenes ) .
And we were going to focus on digital distribution exclusively , not only because it makes sense in terms of technology , but also because it reduces production and marketing costs while drastically increasing the revenue share for the developer ( meaning a much smaller volume of sales is required to break even ) .
At the very start of the project , we were n't really sure if The Path was going to be a commercial title or more of an artistic experiment .
As we continued to refine the design , we realized that the concept had several things that spoke in favor of commercial exploitation : it was going to be a horror game , thus easy to categorize by the market ( unlike 8 , for which the main problem with publishers was that its genre was undefinable . )
In The Path , we knew we were going to have stylish , dark , girl characters at a time where Gothic Lolita style and Pop Surrealism were very trendy .
Cult rock star Jarboe had agreed to do the sound track .
But most of all , we felt a sort of obligation , to at least try and make this step towards a market , instead of safely playing in the margins .
Up until the day of launch , we had no idea how well this was going to work .
But we decided to take the risk .
By the end of 2006 , we had secured another 26,000 euro from the Flemish Audiovisual Fund and Design Flanders for a first phase of the production .
The support of Creative Capital continued throughout the project until the day of launch ( which they funded ) .
Ultimately , they have contributed almost 50,000 US Dollars to the budget ( sadly , at a time when the dollar was at an all time low ) .
Production
In January 2007 , we implemented the Drama Princess engine in the 144 prototype , which signified to us the start of the actual pre-production .
Making a commercial game and deciding to publish it ourselves immediately meant that we were going to have to work on our marketing .
In February 2007 we stopped resisting Web 2.0 and started the Tale of Tales blog .
In March of that year , Michael gave up on his five year old ban against traveling to the USA to attend the Game Developers Conference ( GDC ) in San Francisco .
We were offered the opportunity of sharing a booth with other Belgian developers , cheaply .
So we took it .
It was then that we decided that we needed a more descriptive title for the game .
However dear the cryptic 144 was to us , we felt we had to give up on being obscure and do as much as we can to make it easier for the audience to connect to our work .
More photos ...
In May 2007 , a first prototype of The Path was sent to our collaborators , animator Laura Raines Smith , and musicians Jarboe and Kris Force , after which they joined the project in earnest .
With their help , we created one of the six chapters of the game , featuring Ruby as its main character .
This demo was entered in the Independent Games Festival in October 2007 .
You can watch the first teaser .
In November 2007 , we showed this demo to Valve and to Sony in Liverpool , but neither was ready to sign us up for their platform ( Steam and PlayStation Network ) at the time .
They seemed a little bit worried about where we were going to take the rest of the project , afraid that it might turn out to be too much art , and too little entertainment ( which was considered a liability back then ) .
That same month , November 2007 , things got really serious when we signed a contract with CultuurInvest for a 90,000 euro loan .
As of then , working on a commercial project turned from being an exciting experiment into dealing with a scary Sword of Damocles that would play a part in each and every decision we were going to make .
We realized all too well that paying back 100,000 euro ( the loan plus interest ) is a serious commitment for even the most commercial independent company , let alone an artistically - motivated two - person collective .
Michael in our booth at Game Connection , Lyon 2007
December 2007 was an encouraging month .
We had decided to pay the 3,000 euro participation fee for Game Connection in Lyon .
Game Connection is an event where developers can present their projects to publishers through very short back - to - back meetings over the course of three days .
Thanks to the loan , we did n't really need publisher investment -- but we wanted to see how commercially - minded people would respond to our idea .
Because we still were n't sure if we were completely crazy or not .
The response was remarkably positive .
So much so that we even followed up on a few of the contacts made .
But as usual , all of it fell in the water sooner or later .
Publishers seem so disorganized and unreliable sometimes .
In that same December 2007 , Edge magazine featured a double spread about Tale of Tales that focused on our new production .
And our demo of The Path was selected for " Excellence in Visual Art " in the Independent Games Festival .
We personally had no doubt about the quality of our project .
But we also had no illusions about the bias of the IGF jury towards more " game - like " video games .
They had rejected The Endless Forest the year before , so we were n't expecting much better for The Path .
And we still think that our game was not just selected on its own merit , but partially because of our big mouth .
We had triggered a lot of discussions with several blog posts that were very critical of the current state of game design , without which it would have been a lot easier to ignore us .
In short : the marketing plan was working !
The four - page article in Edge Magazine , December 2007 was very exciting and encouraging !
So , in February 2008 , we were presenting The Path in the Game Developers Conference again .
This time with a proper playable demo in the Independent Games Festival pavilion , among dozens of indie colleagues in the year when indie games really made their big push towards public recognition .
It was quite an exhilarating experience -- an intense three - day long playtest session from which we gathered heaps of information .
Partially to force ourselves to take a break , and partially because of marketing benefits , we decided to interrupt the production of The Path briefly to develop a small game that we had acquired some arts funding for .
In March 2008 , we released The Graveyard .
Since we had applied some of the ideas in The Path about minimalist interaction design to it , The Graveyard became an interesting test to find out how the audience would respond to our ideas .
It was also a way to figure out the whole e-commerce thing .
The Graveyard was not designed as a commercial title but selling a " full version " of the game with only one difference ( the possibility of the death of the protagonist ) was part of the artistic concept .
And it makes no difference to PayPal what your intentions behind charging are .
This experience helped us prepare for the commercial launch of The Path a year later .
Launch
On 17 March , the day before leaving for the Game Developers Conference , we " pre-launched " The Path with co-producer Villanella in the Muhka Media Film Museum in Antwerp .
The evening consisted of an interview with Flemish culture diva Chantal Pattyn , a short playthrough of the game on a big screen , the opportunity for the audience to play The Path before its official launch date in the company of a Robin cosplayer , our first !

On 18 March 2009 , at 9 o'clock in the evening , The Path was launched from a room in the hotel in San Francisco where we had first met 10 years ago .
We released our seven daughters from our hotel bed and checked email on our laptops over and over again to see the messages flow in .
It was a joyous moment .
On 24 March , we had our public launch event in the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts , right around the corner of the Moscone Center where the Game Developers Conference was taking place .
It was an intimate gathering , about 80 invited guests , with wine and bread and a play session projected on the big screen , accompanied by live music performed on the stage of the small cinema by Jarboe and Kris Force .

Girls at play
Designing for exploration
Uncertain design in the beginning .
The Path was an idea born with the title 144 .
It could have turned out very differently .
The name 144 encompassed the spirit of the project .
Somehow that number came to symbolize a girl 's restlessness , the sound of footsteps on dry leaves , the smell of pine trees , dim sunlight through filtering clouds .
There were thoughts of graphite scribblings and white gouache on paper , of tricky betrayals of lovers , and of parents and children .
Fearless naivete , anxiousness to meet your adulthood head - on , in the face and body of a wolf .
He - wolf .
She - wolf .
The conception of the 144 idea was heady , painful and soul - searching , in both art direction and interaction design , as we tried to discover the core of " what it all meant " in order to communicate even a fraction of these sensations , emotions , and inner stories to the player of a computer game .
In the beginning there were in fact moments when we thought it would be best not to make the project at all .
" Waldeinsamkeit " is a German word which means the feeling of being alone in the woods .
We once had the notion that there would be 144 Red Riding Hoods and the player would play each one .
Each time , the story would lead to her death .
We came down from that illusion and narrowed the cast down to six girls , each representing a different aspect of a girl 's life .
The number six was decided upon somewhat arbitrarily by dividing the number 144 and considering the aesthetics the number six provided , and how six girls could fit into a chronology of growing up , from age nine to age 19 .
We decided each girl needed her wolf , an alter - ego .
And that she should meet this nemesis in a specific place in the Forest .
We called these locations " Attractions . "
There were also to be " Distractions " which are the objects one encounters , that keep you dallying in the Forest instead of continuing on to Grandmother 's like a good girl .
We thought perhaps each girl should meet each wolf and the player could mix Girl / Wolf / Attraction and match the experience and place .
This also seemed like too much to do technically for us -- too many possibilities to plan for .
So , early on the idea was simplified to each girl having a set scenario .
A representative area to meet her wolf in and a division of objects and environments some shared and some unique .
Character Design and Environment Design : Artistic impression vs. accessible game : a personal meaning
Regarding the design of the girls , we kept a fairly detailed diary of the making of each girl .
We did n't give them names until the game was almost done .
All along we 'd referred to them by the archetype they represented for us .
The girls got names : Kid Red ( Robin ) , Innocent Red ( Rose ) , Tomboy Red ( Ginger ) , Goth Red ( Ruby ) , Sexy Red ( Carmen ) , and Stern Red ( Scarlet ) .
The wolves and other characters remain nameless .
When designing The Red Girls , in addition to too many outside references to name , I ( Auriea ) did a lot of looking inward .
I was not meant to be the sole designer or modeler of all protagonists .
I did n't want to do it out of a lack of self - confidence , and also I was worried that I 'd put a bit too much of myself into them .
In the end that is what happened .
And in some ways I think this is what leads to many misunderstandings of the narrative of the game .
Some say blindly that the game is " about rape . "
And while that could be one of the interpretations -- and I understand it -- for me , those black - out moments after meeting her wolf are the moments of realization .
Those are the times when a girl grows .
And what happens in Grandmother 's House is not a murder but a shedding of childhood and an initiation to womanhood .
Each girl one step closer to her fate .
Due to our method of control you do not really control the girl at all .
There is a moment where you realize that all outcomes are the result of her choices .
And she could have prevented it by not acting for that one moment , by not seeking the " good time " of her nemesis .
By staying on the path .
We force the player into that compromising situation much like a film director does .
You do n't have much choice in the matter .
Every time it is a choice of letting her go , or doing nothing , or wandering endlessly in the forest , or shutting down the game entirely .
If you play on , we hope that you will draw your own conclusions .
Maybe there are things in there that relate to your own life .
For many girls and women there were , in fact , and they have told us so .
It is beyond amazing to learn of the many ways these scenes impacted and reflected what people felt about their lives and the choices they have made .
The game becomes a tool for this reflection .
And I think if at first I had not also gone through that process , of letting each girl come out of me , no one would have felt anything at all .
It is a question of the characters feeling real in an ethereal way .
They are mere expressions of what you are already thinking .
So , whatever your interpretation , it says more about you than about whatever the situation has meant to me .
In that vagary of the blackout lies infinite possibility .
We 've never really spoken much about the Wolves .
Inspirations for Wolf characters ...
I could n't even explain it .
Every girl has her wolf , no ?
I tried categorizing every boyfriend I ever had into one of these archetypes .
Not that I believed " all men " are one way ; more , it 's about the way I had experienced them , and the relationship I 'd had , or that I 'd wished had been .
Woodsmen Wolves were silent and no matter what , always chopping endlessly at the same tree .
They need to be provoked to get any reaction from them at all .
Cloud Wolves are silent beautiful spirits .
And though they seem skinless and vulnerable , perhaps it is just a lure into a thunderstorm .
We wanted our Werewolf to be at once comical and scary -- " cuddly " , for lack of a better word .
And you have to want to walk up to him and climb on his back for a ride .
The inclusion of one female wolf , one which the Tomboy , Ginger , meets is more a reflection of her femininity .
The Girl in Red Wolf disappears as you try to approach her -- bursting into a hundred butterflies .
Only when you turn your back and let her come to you do you get a chance to meet her face to face .
In all cases we did not want to make typical male game characters that looked like they would overpower the girls .
No , the wolves need to be ordinary -- thus to raise a question in the player 's mind about who is exactly in control of the encounters in the forest .
We made up stories about each one of these characters , how and why they need each other , and what that meeting does to the endgame .
Very early on we worked with concept artists .
I was anxious to prove that it would be possible to bring in some amazing artists who could take our vague ideas and surprise us with a new interpretation .
We got three great people working on The Forest , the Red characters and Grandmother 's House to prepare for making our first real demo of the game .
The demo would contain Ruby , her wolf , " Charming " , and the Girl In White .
There were things we knew about them .
I tried to distill this into reference sheets and vivid descriptions .
And we loved the character drawings coming from Ted Pendergraft .
But he was super busy at the time and we really could n't afford him .
He left the project , continuing on for awhile as a consultant to us ; it was nice that he gave us a bit of his time .
Stacey Diana Clark seemed to get what we were going for right away and we ended up using her gorgeous artwork of the forest all the way through the design process .
The only pity was that we could n't afford to have her make more !
We had long conversations with Pedro Murteira and he had exactly to right kind of imagination for our rambling ideas of Grandmother 's House .
We put him though such phrases as " it is a memory of a house .
A girl child enters the place of a woman whose life is done , what does she really know about her ? "
Grandmother 's
House is based , at least in part , on a recurring nightmare I had about my grandmother 's old house in the ' 80s .
We needed a way to express in " reality " all these dreams .
In many ways these talks and quick sketches very early on totally helped us organize our thoughts , as for the first time we had to express into words what we were hoping other people could understand .
The work of Ted Pendergraft , Stacey Diana Clark and Pedro Muteira was great , and our time with them too short .
It was a big question who would actually do the modeling of the characters and environments .
For the first demo we had help from Dragon - Fly for objects .
The rest were modified from objects we downloaded from Turbosquid or made from scratch .
Back then , I did n't have a whole lot of confidence in my modeling skills .
I had no problem with the Forest parts because I have become a tree modeling , forest making expert due to The Endless Forest work .
But I thought , surely , we would contract out the building of Grandmother 's house , at least .
We ended up searching for people and wasting a lot of money in the process .
We had tested several modelers to work with us and had high hopes of finding someone that we could work with permanently .
But it did n't work out .
The problem was that we knew far too well what we wanted by that time .
Model design style : dolls but not cartoons , a kind of creepy - cute look .
But we felt that a 3D style is something where you have to trust the individual modeler to give .
We wanted to find something outside of our preconceived ideas about these characters .
We did n't have detailed character concept drawings and must have been a nightmare to make a test for .
We learned how to work with other people , and how not to work with them .
Our experience reinforced the feeling that we should not , under any circumstances , be managers of other people .
This is why we work the way we do now .
In Fatale , the project we made immediately after The Path , we put it to the test by working in a purely collaborative method with modeler Takayoshi Sato .
We work in this loose way with musicians all the time .
And when Laura Raines Smith animates , we have a relationship of artistic trust .
We know she understands what we want and we do n't have to edit her .
This is the relationship we want to have with all our collaborators from now on .
Everyone invested in the work , everyone with their specific part , and in the end we maintain the vision but mix all of these parts into the whole .
Test models by Ben Regimbal , Vykarian , Billy Miller , and Greg Savoia .
Guys , we 're sorry we did n't know what we were asking of you .
After the GDC 2008 demo , due to time and money , a deep connection to the game 's themes , and riding the wave of adrenaline after presenting the demo for days at the Independent Games Festival -- and this incredible feeling of " LETS JUST GET THIS THING DONE ! " --
I decided the only way forward was to make everything myself .
In the end I am overjoyed that I took the job and literally forced myself to grow up to the tremendous challenge of making all 14 character models , and the three environments .
But it was a difficult development period and it was literally insane of me to do this all by myself in the short development time we had .
And so , there is not a lot of beautiful concept art from the project .
It is not that I did n't want it , but I must admit I doubted its practical usefulness , anyway , in bringing out what I wanted this fully 3D world to be .
2D is not 3D .
I needed to feel this world with my hands .
Michaël had programmed up all these cool tools for us to use in Quest3D , like a viewer with all the characters standing in a line and it let us cycle through all their animations .
And a sort of dollhouse view of Grandmother 's House to see all the possible configurations , add and remove objects , and follow each girl 's path through the house .
I do n't know if we will use Quest3D again for a project , but it was truly beautiful at times to be able to make changes , paint flora in the forest , walk with the girl in realtime without having to stop and compile .
What I saw was what I got .
" Concept art " for me became things like the glitches which would sometimes spring up in Quest3D 's realtime window .
We kept an archive of beautiful glitches .
Or serendipitous interactions between bad programming and the sound in my headphones : glitch - filled journeys through Grandmother 's
House while working listening to music in my headphones ( above ) , influenced the design of the teaser videos released once the musical score was finalized .
That was the experience I wanted the players to ultimately have : moments where my heart was moved but I do n't quite know why .
Moments of pure beauty , and pure joy , and pure pain .
Looking for an aesthetic style
It was our desire all along to experiment with the forest , to stylize trees , foliage and flowers .
We followed our motto that it is more important that the place feel real than look real .
I chose abstract baroque ornaments and patterns for things like leaves and flowers .
The trees give the impression of having realistic looking leaves as you run past them .
Everything is rendered in black without detail .
This not only kept the amount of work to be done on them to a minimum , it also gave the world a somber surreal feeling .
Bits of color come out only in the Attraction areas where the world bursts into full over - saturation .
We looked at artifacts from failed photographic processes : light leaks , bokeh , Polaroid film glitches .
We soften and blur the image and give it a patina , making the screen dirty , then finding a use for the dirt .
We came to the " double exposure " effect of overlaying the center of interest as a clue .
All the little scratches or paw prints on the screen lead you to your wolf ; the white swirl leads to the Girl In White .
It was important that all of these effects have a purpose and there is nothing on the screen that does n't in some way serve as a clue for the player .
The Quest3D Nature Paint system made it very easy to quickly paint in the trees .
We had help from Paladin Studios to help us refine the ground shaders and optimize the post processing shaders .
When it came to overall color , I knew that I wanted a way for the color itself to be horrific .
I wanted neither a typical film - like graininess nor blue - for - night effect , but to really strike people with the color , like a Dario Argento horror film .
I feel it sets our horror game apart from the rest .
The color and stylization of the forest contrast with the more somber versions of Grandmother 's House and make the Wolf - violated versions all the more striking .
We did not want to compete on 3D graphics with big 3D game titles .
We wanted it to be unique , as if every screen were somehow handmade .
When we changed the name of the game from 144 to The Path we designed a logo .
We got tired of constantly searching for an answer whenever someone asked " What does 144 mean ? "
Also we wanted an easier name to remember .
After a while we got the feeling that the logo we 'd made was way too much like a movie logo , or a too typical " grunge " type treatment .
We commissioned typographer and graphic artist Marian Bantjes to make us a logo which felt more in - keeping with the spirit of the girls and the forest .
And the rest is history .
Prototypes and Demos and Music
Our process consists of making the game and then designing it .
That means using prototypes as a tool for guiding the design .
As soon as we can , we want to have something in the game engine to play with .
It really cannot exist for us in theory ; only once we have " made it real " in prototype can the idea mean anything .
We do not want to be mislead by a pretty drawing or model .
We want to get a camera in place , work out some preliminary navigation .
We are then constantly looking at that prototype , or videos of it .
And from these we iteratively make the decisions which become the final game .
Through this process we came up with ideas and quickly implemented them in the game with the actual characters , so we would get an idea if things are a good idea or not .
Since the engine had originally shared code from The Endless Forest we thought we might make the player into a kind of puppeteer .
We had interfaces of buttons connected to animations which needed to play out in a certain sequence to act out a scene .
In one early prototype , we had made a version where you could switch between characters and play the Red Girl , The Girl in White or The Wolf at any time .
It was inspiring , like a play where actors can jump from one body to the next !
But we felt it would add too much work to make it this way unless we were to have only three characters in the game .
In another version we had a dance choreographed between Ruby and Charming Wolf !
Rejected gameplay idea :
The dance - off !
Yeah !
Once we got a few of the final music tracks , we could tell that this was not going to be in any way a lightweight game .
The music Jarboe and Kris Force made for the game had such an enormous effect that it changed our thinking about the game design .
And this , we feel , is as it should be .
A video game should not be seen as its individual parts .
Each individual model is not a sculpture unto itself , but more like a brushstroke in a larger picture .
The entire game is the sculpture .
I just put emphasis -- more detail -- on the parts where the player 's interest should be held the most .
And this philosophy is quite helpful to the indie developer making a 3D game .
One need not waste time and assets trying to make each individual thing perfect and " realistic " ; make it beautiful instead in its totality .
Let imperfection shine by putting together assets made with the whole heart and the intention of making a complete world .
In the belly of the beast
The Path was our first commercial video game project .
And it's also the biggest project we 've worked on so far .
It was a completely independent production : managed by ourselves and funded with art grants and a loan .
It was both an experiment with the " punk economy " advocated by our Manifesto and a conscious effort to make our art more accessible to gamers and less savvy computers users alike , while optimizing its appeal to a non-gaming audience .
What Went Wrong
Not enough time
This probably happens in every video game production : many great ideas need to be abandoned because of lack of time .
In the production of The Path , we also had to make some tough choices between improving our technology and polishing art .
Since we thought the aesthetic appeal of The Path was going to be one of its strongest features and since we are far from master programmers , we compromised heavily on the technology side .
It did n't matter too much to us that characters would walk through trees once in a while or that their AI did n't always kick in at the right times .
We even enjoyed the chaos this produced , as long as the game felt right .
But some players were turned off by the lack of technical excellence .
It 's surprising how many gamers are only vaguely aware of the enormous cost of game development and the precarious situation of independent developers , while in our experience , things like bad performance on some hardware is directly related to budget limitations .
Recruiting a modeler
We did n't originally intend for Auriea to design , model , and texture all the characters .
This is a time - consuming task , and her tasks as data director were far more crucial to the project .
But all the modelers we tested just could n't get the style right .
To create stylized characters for a horror game that are not cartoony but still attractive is apparently a skill not taught in 3D academies .
Part of the reason , probably , was that we only got male candidates .
Our experience with finding our wonderful animator Laura Raines Smith had taught us that it takes a woman to animate girls properly .
Maybe it takes a woman to model girls as well .
We do n't blame the men ; we blame the fact that more women do n't choose 3D modeling as a career !
And that we could n't find the right person when we needed her .
Bad crunch
We had planned the production to be finished quite a bit before launch , to allow us sufficient time to fine - tune the experience .
But as the work kept piling up and progress was slower than expected , we started eating into that time as if it were a mere buffer zone .
To compensate for this loss , we worked harder .
For four months in a row , we worked 14 hours per day .
After a while you get used to it .
It 's even easy to some extent , because the extreme pressure forces you to only work on the most important parts of the production while you can safely ignore everything else .
But it 's just not a good idea .
It 's bad for your temper , bad for your health and worst of all , it 's ultimately bad for the project , because there 's no time for reflection when making decisions .
Sadly , the only way to have prevented the crunch would have been to reduce the scope of the game .
So in the end , we do n't really regret it , even if we are determined to stick better to the plan next time .
Publishers & Console Companies
We did n't really need support from publishers for the development of The Path .
But had we not designed the production to fit into a small budget , it is safe to say that The Path would have followed 8 to the Land of Unfinished Dreams .
The climate in the games industry has certainly improved , thanks to the commercial viability of a greater variety of games .
The success of casual games and Nintendo's Wii and DS consoles had certainly stimulated the interest of publishers in games that might be smaller than blockbusters and perhaps even original in design .
But in the end , it is still the bean counters that make the decisions .
So while the interest was great , the support was ultimately non-existent .
The non -gamer audience
A more painful place for us to fail was our hope to reach an audience outside of the typical gamer demographic .
We thought that designing a game with an original aesthetic appeal and theme and an interaction system that was very easy and forgiving would be enough .
But without proper marketing , this just does n't work .
It 's easy to market to gamers because they form a very well organized subculture with a blooming press and myriads of supportive blogs .
But outside of the niche , the audience is fragmented , and in general fairly hostile towards video games .
This is a serious problem for independent developers , and somewhat of a vicious circle for innovation in the industry .
There 's a contradiction in the fact that it takes independent developers to create projects that may appeal outside of the core audience and that it takes a corporate budget to market to this audience .
We 've always found it strange that the small companies are the ones taking the risks , while surely the big ones are a lot more resistant to failure .
Things being the way they are , growing the audience for video games towards a greater diversion will be a slow project , if it ever happens .
This puts us in a strange position .
On the one hand , we really want to create titles that show non-gamers how enjoyable video games can be .
But on the other , ultimately , only gamers will buy our products .
It is difficult to resist the urge to give in and make our games more game - like .
But if we do n't explore the vast terrain outside of games , who will ?
No post - launch budget
By launch time , we were virtually broke .
Independent marketing consists for the most part of manual labor : sending emails , posting to forums , talking to press , making blog posts , etcetera .
But we could n't afford to do that full - time .
Let alone purchase advertisements or investigate even more expensive options like porting the game to a console or developing new downloadable content .
We did n't even have a budget for developing a representative demo .
If we had n't made such a bad deal with CultuurInvest concerning paying back the loan ( we owed them 100 percent of our income until the loan was paid back ) , we could have reinvested some of the money coming in into increasing the reach of the game .
We should not have accepted that part of the deal .
It only took us half a year to pay back the loan , but by that time a lot of opportunities had passed us by , and sales had obviously declined .
Not commercially viable
We were never certain how much money we would make with The Path .
Not in the slightest .
We did n't know if we were going to sell a few hundred copies or hundreds of thousands .
We literally had no idea .
The total production budget of The Path was around 300,000 euro .
And so far , one year after launch , the Path has brought about 135,000 euro back to us .
A quarter of the budget was covered by previously - developed technology .
But even if we would subtract that , we would still be 90,000 euro short of breaking even .
It 's doubtful if The Path will make that much in the second year of the two - year period we gave ourselves to sell the game .
But , of course , one never knows .
On the positive side , however , we have been able to pay back the loan .
And the rest of the budget was covered by non-commercial arts funding .
So , in purely financial terms , we did break even .
We were just hoping that The Path could be a test case for demonstrating the viability of artistic projects in a commercial environment .
But so far it looks like the support of non-commercial funding is still required to do this type of work .
What Went Right
Did it
We succeeded in what we set out to do : to create a mid-sized video game from start and finish and publish and distribute it to an audience .
This may seem obvious .
But each video game that is created is a little miracle .
Video game production is a constant struggle with what the technology is capable of and what it will let you do .
And developing with a small team on a limited budget does not make that easier .
So whatever anyone may think , however we may feel about the outcome , we are proud simply of having made this thing .
Because , as we often say , it 's better to make something than nothing .
Accessible technology
One of the main reasons why a small team without engineers is able to create a complex piece of software like The Path is the technology that is available now .
We did all of the modeling and texturing in Blender and all of the programming in Quest3D .
The latter deserves a special mention because it is quite a unique tool .
( Click for full size )
In Quest3D , you do n't write code .
You express your ideas about processes and interactions through flowcharts -- much like the flowcharts a programmer might draw to design a certain routine before coding it .
However , in Quest3D , the flowchart actually works , with no additional coding .
And it works in real time !
As you connect the elements of your flowchart , the behavior of your application changes .
The visible programming interface combined with the direct feedback makes Quest3D a superb tool for artists to work with software .
The biggest downside to Quest3D is that it can only output applications for Windows .
Luckily we found Transgaming , which was willing to port The Path to Mac OSX through its Cider technology .
This was not straightforward , but between the excellent engineers at Transgaming , the personal assistance of the Quest3D team , and our own modification of the game , we succeeded in making a Mac version of The Path by May 2009 .
Working with artists
Each member on the development team for The Path is an artist .
Not just an " artist " in the games industry sense of the pairs of hands required to make Thee Mighty Code look and sound pretty to human players , but an artist in the sense that they are capable of communicating on a profound level through their medium .
We chose to work with certain people because of their artistic gift , not to fill vacancies .
Between Auriea and Michaël , there 's sufficient skill to make an entire game at Tale of Tales .
But we knew that the contributions of Laura , Jarboe , Kris , Hans , and Marian would make The Path immeasurably better .
Common knowledge has it that artists are difficult people to work with .
They tend to have strong personalities and huge egos and are all but team players .
We are artists ; we know .
But our collaboration with these people came out of a deep respect for their work .
We did not just need people to do the stuff we had no time for .
We really wanted their contribution in our game .
Sometimes we felt like gallery owners setting up a show for them .
We created a place for their work in ours and expected them to fill it with greatness .
And this turned out to be an excellent way to get a group of headstrong individuals to create a thing of beauty together .
It probably did n't hurt that most of us were female , but that 's another topic .
Testing
Before The Path , we had never done a lot of playtesting for any of our projects .
Here and there , we had people try out early versions of our work .
But this rarely had any real impact on the design of the game .
This time , we sent a message to our mailing list to invite people who live in or near Belgium and were available for an entire day to come and play The Path at our studio .
Many people responded , and in the end we made 12 appointments .
Each tester would come to our studio and play the game in a room set up for the occasion .
The first few hours we would sit there and watch them play without saying much .
Then we would evaluate their experience over tea .
After that , we would leave them alone for a few more hours , to play the game in private .
This series of thorough playtests has really been eye - opening to us and probably greatly contributed to the accessibility of The Path .
Many things were changed in response to these tests .
Sometimes it was difficult to find a balance between fine - tuning the game for a specific audience and opening it up to a wider one .
So we had to make some hard decisions about whom we were making the game for ( in the end , the enthusiasm of the newbie player trumped the skepticism of the hardcore gamer ) .
We observed the testers playing the game .
and wrote a short summary on the blog at the time about each session .
A second round of tests was done when the game was almost finished , mostly to find technical errors .
This test was done through the internet .
Testers would download the latest build of the game and play it for hours , days , weeks .
Some people were very dedicated .
They would report their problems via a web - based bug tracking system ( Mantis ) .
Using a bug tracker was also a first for us .
We are -- and all players of the game should be -- very grateful for their devoted volunteering because it made The Path as stable and reliable as it is today .
It 's counter - intuitive for a creative person to allow an outsider to influence their work .
But we 're very glad we did it .
It 's not like you lose control over your work ; you just add a few more factors to the decision - making process .
No artist is ever completely certain about anything .
Doubts are , in fact , an important motivator .
The reactions of outsiders are not the only outcome of playtests .
Your reactions to these reactions are important as well .
And together they give you a lot more data to inform your creative decisions .
Marketing
We had always been very active on the internet .
In a way , the internet had been our home , our country , for a long time .
When Web 2.0 happened , it felt like our land was being overrun by immigrants .
And we retreated ... into video games , actually .
So when , a few years later , we figured out how to publish a commercial game independently , reconnecting with the internet felt like exploring a land that was still very familiar but where lots of things were done differently .
But we felt more than comfortable with the idea of using the network for the promotion and distribution of our new work .
As of then , to some extent , everything we did online served as marketing for The Path .
The Tale of Tales blog served as a central hub .
It was n't like we did n't have any controversial ideas , or interesting thoughts .
We just did n't have a lot of desire to share these ideas and thoughts .
Our " Game Design Forum " had been quite sufficient for that ( although it had been overrun by the players of The Endless Forest by that time ) .
But thanks to the blog , publishing our opinion pieces instantly became marketing for our game .
And that was all the motivation we needed .
It was n't always fun .
We actually get deeply upset by the extreme flaming our deviant scribbles sometimes provoke on the internets .
But it did do the job .
By the time The Path was launched , the number of visitors to our website had more than quadrupled , with an all time high of 14,000 unique visitors on 21 March .
And even now , a year after launch , we still get 4,000 people per day .
Next to the main Tale of Tales blog , we also ran a development blog , to share information with dedicated followers , and also to keep a record of the history of the project .
The blog was only one aspect of the marketing , though .
We also created a plan of sending out one press release per month throughout the entire production to a list of email addresses we had started for The Endless Forest but which grew exponentially throughout the production period of The Path .
We did these press releases not necessarily because we were hoping for a publication ( which often did n't happen ) , but to get the journalists acquainted with our work .
So that when we were ready for launch , they would at least have heard the name of the game before , or perhaps even be familiar with some of our ideas .
A special element in the marketing were the LiveJournals that each of the Red Girls kept during production .
These were probably not very effective as marketing , but they were the reason we felt comfortable including text in The Path .
For multiple reasons , we have never been a great proponent of written or spoken text in our work .
The Path did not contain any text in game up until the playtests .
When we saw that some players had difficulty to let their imagination work when playing , we came up with the idea of showing some of the protagonists ' musings on screen , to give the player 's mind a little nudge .
Since the response to the LiveJournal writing had been so positive , we felt it could even add something to the game for many people .
And a final key element in the marketing was the release of smaller titles .
We added a Halloween feature to The Endless Forest in November 2007 and a Carnival feature in February 2008 .
And in April 2008 we gave the players of The Endless Forest a dedicated community website where they can keep blogs , share fanart and organize events .
We released The Graveyard in March 2008 and Fatale post - launch in October 2009 .
Switching between projects turned out to be beneficial for the work on The Path as well , because it allowed us to refresh ourselves and prevented burn - out .
Press and audience
The biggest surprise for us has been the overwhelmingly positive response of the gaming press .
While almost every article starts with the warning that The Path may not really be a game , and that as such it may divide the audience in extreme camps , almost every journalist ends with appreciating either the experience itself or the boldness of our design .
Only a few " rogue websites " published articles that bordered on declarations of war in which each and every feature of The Path was destroyed .
So there was some controversy but overall we got pretty lucky and The Path ended up with Metacritic score of almost 80 .
This is kind of amusing , since many journalists refused to score the game because they considered that to be inappropriate -- since it was considered to be an art piece first .
We 're actually quite proud of having instigated that mini-rebellion .
The audience , however , was a lot less united .
There were many blog posts that celebrated the experience of our work .
But at some point it seemed like it had become fashionable to hate not only The Path , but Tale of Tales and everything it stood for .
When The Graveyard was released , it confused a lot of people but that did n't lead to public outrage .
The Path , on the other hand , got a lot of press , and a lot of positive press at that .
This may have been too much for the hardcore gamers on the internet .
Not only did our design insult their sensibilities , it was also celebrated by people in ways they failed to comprehend .
It 's hard to say what effect the controversy has had on the success of the project .
On the one hand , it 's not very nice if people say bad things about your work .
But on the other , while they are talking about it , they keep the work fresh in the mind of the community .
Girls
It 's a bit of a cliché by now to discuss female gamers , because the success of casual games and social games with women , and the explicit acceptance of hardcore gaming by some girl - oriented blogs and websites has diluted the point somewhat .
But that does n't diminish the pride we take in having created a video game that women can really feel is about them .
The Path does n't just give girls a female avatar to play boy games with , and it does n't paint everything pink with smiling faces and hearts .
The Path is a game that is about things that can be deeply important to women , and it is played in a feminine way .
Artistic success
Despite explicitly trying to make something with at least some commercial viability , The Path became an emotionally deep and intellectually stimulating experience for many .
Myriad are the expressions of virtual disbelief .
Many people had no idea that a video game could be so artistic .
Even the games press universally sang the same song :
The Path is not a game , but it 's an amazing experience .
This puts us in an awkward situation : when we try to make something widely appealing , it is received as being excessively artsy .
So what would happen if we would try to be artsy on purpose ?
We have not tried that yet .
But we have made games in which we do n't put a lot of effort in the public appeal ( like Fatale and Vanitas ) .
What happens is that people largely ignore them .
Of course , it could be that The Path became a better work of art because we cared more about the audience .
We 're not as romantic as to believe that good art should always be exclusively personal .
Perhaps by making
The Path less art , it became art for more people .
Next to the online success , The Path has also been part of several festivals and exhibitions of artistic games .
Since
The Path is such an intimate experience , we tend to be a bit reluctant to show it in a social context .
But our vanity often gets the better of us .
It 's nice to be a part of this international trend of featuring certain games in a fine arts context .
And it 's nice to see how most of these games are independently created , like The Path .
It 's a form of recognition we are not really looking for ( the online community is far more important to us ) but it 's pleasant nonetheless .
Financial success
If The Path had been a pure for - profit project , it would have been a financial failure ( at least so far ) .
But The Path was not purely commercial .
Less than half of the production budget came from a source that required a return on investment .
And The Path more than returned that investment .
The rest of the budget came from multiple non-commercial art grants .
So our accounts are clean ; we 're in the black .
It 's true that part of us was hoping that , despite of the fact that it was n't necessary , The Path would return sufficient money to cover its entire production budget .
Then it could have been used as proof that experimental artistic games could be commercially viable .
But the more important conclusion is that it is possible to create this kind of work without going bankrupt .
This is important because we think the medium of video games needs to be explored and experimented with much more than is happening today .
And the financing of The Path shows one way in which this research can be funded .
Of course , this particular way requires the explicit desire of the creator to make a work of art ( in order to get access to non-commercial arts funding ) .
But the games industry could do a lot worse .
What 's in the basket ?
Press
We have found more than 500 reviews and articles about The Path .
Most of them are in online publications , but many were in print magazines as well -- mostly the games press .
It was highly amusing to read how our game inspired literary adventures that may or may not have informed the audience .
But while unusual , we were enormously flattered by the recognition from an area that we admittedly had n't expected it from .
It felt like many journalists welcomed The Path , even if they did n't like it , as something that added some weight to their profession .
Here 's a handful of quotes from English language publications .
" I kind of do n't like the game .
This is not a criticism .
If anything , it 's the highest compliment I could pay it . " - John Walker , Rock , Paper , Shotgun , March 2009
" In the end , The Path is a little bit like getting punched in the nose by a centaur .
It 's momentarily painful , but you get to spend the next few days trying to figure out precisely what the hell just happened to you . "
- Justin McElroy , Joystiq , March 2009
" It feels like being the only person laughing in a cinema -- except the film you 're watching is Schindler 's List . " - Joe Martin , bit - tech.net , March 2009
" The Path is a strange , unusual , progressive and unique game , which may even be important for the industry and the development of the form in a handful of ways .
It 's also so arty that it makes Braid look like 50 Cent : Blood on the Sand . " - Kieron Gillen , Eurogamer , April 2009
" The Path is a sort of anti-game in a way , a game turned inside out in service to something deeply personal , human and disturbing . " - Mike " Scout " Gust , Tap - Repeatedly , May 2009
" The Path found those long - forgotten ideas laying around in the back of my mind , and woke them from their decades - long slumber .
For a moment I was able to be an adult seeing myself as a kid picturing myself as a grown - up .
The game reached into my childhood and played with old fears that never even had a name . "
- Shamus Young , Twenty Sided , August 2009
" For me , The Path is about what a remarkably fine line it is that separates childhood from adulthood , innocence from cynicism , and how utterly not black - and - white most things in life are . "
- Heather Chaplin , Filmmaker Magazine , October 2009
To a lot of journalists , The Path became much more than a deeply moving experience .
It seemed to confirm the high hopes they had always had for the medium , or at least ignite a desire for a different kind of game , a game that was more mature and that delved deeper into narrative and meaning .
Some writings became so hyperbolic , it made us giggle .
It 's one thing to boast about one 's own work because one is always aware of one 's own bias or naiveté .
It 's something entirely different to read that another person thinks it 's important .
" The Path challenges the very core of what you think a video game can be and what themes they can tackle . "
- Iain McCafferty , Videogamer.com , March 2009
" The Path represents a prime paradox in the world of games .
It is simple to play , but incredibly deep in its execution .
It 's mystical , often perplexing , and more disturbing than pleasant . " -
Dan Liebman , Game Zone , March 2009
" This is the game that real gamers scream for at the top of their lungs .
This is something new .
This is what needs to be heralded from rooftops , shown to every new developer ; when you bought FEAR or Doom , you did n't know it , but that disgust on your face was you screaming ' WHY CAN'T YOU BE THE PATH ?!?!?!!'"
- Ophilye , Couple Gaming , April 2009
" If you do n't play video games at all or if you think most of them are plain stupid , brutal , vulgar or meaningless -- this one may be the first made for you . "
- Tetelo , Femina Ludens , April 2009
" The Path is probably the best independent game ever made .
And it 's one of the best adventure games , period , even when compared against the big boys .
But it 's also an outstanding piece of non-linear interactive narrative , which proves again that entertainment can legitimately double as art .
Playing The Path is as rewarding as reading a literary novel . "
- Christopher Lim , The Business Times , April 2009
" Without titles like The Path , games risk being relegated to permanent insularity .
Audiences and designers who care about games must play -- and buy -- these kinds of games , and accept their role in the future legitimacy of the medium . "
- Leigh Alexander , Kotaku , April 2009
" Many wo n't enjoy it and some wo n't understand , but this is an important step in the evolution of gaming .
This sort of experimentation deserves recognition and reward and I only hope we 'll see more like it . "
- Dave James , PC Format , June 2009
This does n't mean that there was n't any opposition .
A few journalists and bloggers have written scathing reviews of The Path .
But these tended to be so filled with passionate hatred and deep disgust that it was difficult to take them seriously .
Usually the criticism boiled down to the reviewer blaming the designer for making a game that they did n't understand .
Which must have been all the more painful to the writers -- because clearly a lot of other people did enjoy the game tremendously , so the only possible conclusion was that all these people were delusional or snobbish , and that nobody dared to admit that the emperor was n't wearing any clothes .
To some extent , those critics were right .
The Path only wears imaginary clothing .
You have to be willing to put yourself in the game , to let it touch you in places where you might not want to be touched .
The Path is about you , your life , your memories , your stories .
There 's an inherent risk in such a design that some people will not be able to enjoy it because they either have no life experiences that correlate with anything in the game , or they are unable or unwilling to open up to the experience , which is entirely understandable and perfectly fine .
And it does n't mean that The Path is beyond criticism .
But if you 're going to judge the flavor of a dish , you need to chew and swallow -- even if it makes you sick .
Fans
When we dropped all of our analog artwork -- a change that took place in from one day in 1995 to the next -- we did it mostly because of the opportunities that the internet offered to communicate directly to an audience , without having to go through galleries or publishers , and without limitations of state borders and even culture and language , to some extent .
This has remained the driving motivator behind many of our work decisions to this very day .
Being able to release a title whenever we please and being able to talk about it with the people who experience it is the best part of being a digital artist .
And it also greatly improves the quality of our work .
Our multiplayer screensaver
The Endless Forest deserves a special mention here because it allowed us to observe how other people play with our design and because its community of players has been a continuous source of encouragement and inspiration .
So , no matter how much praise we get from the press , no matter how many high profile exhibitions our work is shown in and no matter how the game sells , the thing that really satisfies us is the personal response of the people who enjoy our work .
That 's why we started using this medium .
And that 's why we continue to do it .
Interpretations
Since
The Path was designed to be as open - ended as possible ( within the theme of Little Red Riding Hood ) , we were expecting players to actively interpret what is going on in the game .
What we did not expect was the enthusiasm with which they would be sharing and comparing their interpretations .
It almost became a game on top of the game .
And it was a delight to see that people were not looking for a single definite explanation that everyone could agree upon , but instead tried to come up with as many plausible stories that would make sense .
Some of these interpretations were moving confessions of players who had come to understand or accept something really bad that had happened in their lives , while others were delirious fantasies that even we could never have come up with .
This was especially gratifying because the potential for multiple meanings to actively co-exist in a single piece has always been one of the key features that attracts us to the medium .
It looks like The Path really worked as the tool for exploring a certain theme that we intended it to be .
We 're really happy that players were able to use it to explore their own psyche .
It 's the most meaningful reward any artist can expect .
Fanart & Cosplay
The openness of the design naturally attracted players who were very creative .
The Path inspired many to create fan drawings and paintings .
Somebody even made a fan song !
And of course , the iconic design of the Red Girls is hard to resist for any cosplayer worth their salt .
Translations
Some fans even contributed to the software itself , by offering to translate the text in the game for free .
Since a lot of this text is quite poetic and cannot be translated literally , we did screen these people for having the required skill and talent .
Thanks to their hard work , The Path can now be played in Danish , French , German , Hungarian , Italian , Portuguese , Romanian and Spanish next to the original English and Dutch and the publisher - localized Polish , Russian , and Japanese .
We 've also been contacted by volunteers to translate The Path into Arabic , Czech , Farsi , Korean , Lithuanian , and Swedish .
So this story will continue .
Sales
Price
The Path is being sold at 10 US dollars .
This is a very low price for a game of its size .
It was difficult to decide on a price .
A year ago , when The Path was launched , the standard price for an indie game was still 20 or 25 dollars .
So throughout development , this was the price point that we had in the back of our heads .
But after making a deal with the gamer - oriented platforms Steam and Direct2 Drive to launch The Path simultaneously with us , we started thinking .
We realized that The Path was a very different game .
We were not anticipating the enthusiastic response from the games press at all .
We actually thought The Path would be largely ignored by the press , or receive a lukewarm reception -- but we really wanted people to play it .
So in order to reduce the risk of purchasing a game that you can't find a decent review for , we decided to make the price as low as possible .
We 're still not certain of this was the right decision .
The Path received a lot more publicity than we had expected .
But would the reviews have been equally favorable if the price had been " normal " ?
And would an increase in price have compensated for the inevitable decrease in copies sold at a higher price ?
These are questions we have no answer to .
The Path sales graph over time shows a typical " long tail " : a steep spike at launch and a long period of mediocre sales numbers .
This situation continues , except for the " rude interruption " of the Indie Bundle sale on Steam ( the spike of which is a lot taller than is visible on the graph ) .
The first month and a half of sales ( March and April ) were good for a quarter of the entire year .
When Valve launched the Indie Bundle discount sales , we sold even more than in the first month .
Another , much smaller spike was caused by an interview on U.S. ' NPR radio network .
Per region
Almost 50,000 copies of The Path have been sold to this day -- most of these ( 90 percent ) via digital download through the internet .
The Path has been our first product to be sold through retail as well .
Topware published a localized version in Poland and 1C in the Russian speaking countries .
Almost half of the people who bought The Path live in North America , predominantly in the U.S. , though Canada did very well too .
A good quarter of sales were made in Europe , mostly in the UK , Germany , and France .
About 10 percent of our sales were made in Russia and Russian - speaking countries , almost all of these through retail .
More than half of our sales happened in English - speaking countries .
The fact that our website and most of our marketing is in English may be one reason for this .
The fact that most of our sales were made through channels owned by U.S. - based companies is another .
Per channel
We were lucky enough to sell The Path through Steam .
Quite a bit more than half of our sales happened through Valve 's distribution platform .
More than half of those sales come from discount bundles that were sold over a single weekend ( these bundles contained several other indie games as well ) .
But even if we remove the bundle sales from the equation , Steam sales still still account for almost half .
Because of the success of The Graveyard on Mac OSX , we were very eager to release The Path on Mac .
Thanks to the help of Transgaming , we were able to release a Mac version in May 2009 .
Mac sales have not been as good as expected .
Part of the reason for this is probably that the Mac version did not benefit from the excitement surrounding the launch in March 2009 .
Another reason is undoubtedly that our major distributors only carried the PC version of The Path .
Still , if we extract the numbers of on an unbiased channel like our website , Mac sales only account for little over a quarter of sales .
Even if we only count sales since the Mac launch , the PC version still sold almost twice as well as the Mac version .
There is no woodsman to save the women
Conclusion
Producing and releasing
The Path has taught us that the amount of effort ( and time and money ) we put into a creation directly affects its public appeal .
The Path has been our biggest production to date .
And it has both received the highest praise and found the largest audience of any of our projects .
Yet while it is nice to know that our hard work has been rewarded , the commercial success was too moderate to really justify a repeat of this same formula .
Even if arts funding allows us to minimize commercial concerns , we feel that there is more opportunity out there , in terms of finding an audience .
We have learned that designing purely for non-gamers is relatively futile , because the limited marketing means of an independent developer do not suffice to reach this audience .
On the other hand , we have also learned that at least part of the gamer audience is very open to the experiences we create , even if they cannot strictly be categorized as games .
Taking care of the interaction design and the storytelling may be enough to appeal to this audience with a whole new range of themes and emotions .
Perhaps the PC / Mac market is too small for mid-sized indie games like The Path .
We 're still hoping somebody can help us port the game to a console .
And we are certainly considering console development more seriously for future projects , now that we know that there is a sizable enough audience for our work .
The Path shows that it is possible to talk about intimately personal things through the medium of video games .
Not just things which are personal to the authors , but also to each individual player .
Through non-linearity , interactivity , and procedural generation , we have created a piece that is really about the player .
Not in a rigid , engineering kind of way , but in a playful , evocative way .
We do n't know what everything in The Path means either .
It does n't matter , not anymore .
Creating The Path was as much an intuitive experience as playing it can be .
The Path was not an easy project to make .
It delves deeply into our psyches and touches on some very sensitive bare nerves -- things that we have trouble talking about .
We used the creation of The Path as a roundabout way to explore these things .
And roundabout is probably the only way we can talk about them , because they are complex and are accompanied by contradictory feelings .
It 's probably good that language does not allow us to approach this .
Language expresses these kinds of ambiguous feelings with difficulty .
The Path is about fear and doubt , and about embracing both .
It 's about control .
And losing control .
About a secret desire to submit , to let go , to fall , but proudly .
A morbid fascination with helplessness .
The fragility that becomes us because it makes us human .
We are all like those girls , lost in a colorless forest , in search of our wolf .
And in that split second , as his claws rip open our tender skin , like lightning in the dead of night , we are .
We know the intensity of these emotions .
We know how disruptive they can be .
That next to them , nothing seems real .
And this frightens us , because we cannot live like that .
The intensity is unbearable .
The truth of pain slits the night of life with blinding light .
We seek shelter in the lie , in the mask , in the story , and in the game .
We are not ashamed .
It is the only path through the forest .
Let 's go .

Washington Roundup
Who would have believed that twitchy paranoiacs are actually onto something ?
Incredibly , they are : the New York Times has revealed that the US National Security Agency ( NSA ) has been spying on American citizens .
Previously , the Agency had shown itself to be scrupulous about avoiding this sort of activity .
But according to numerous un-named sources paraphrased in the Times , the President signed a secret order authorizing him to intercept phone calls and emails from US persons in communication with persons outside the US , and all without the slightest bit of judicial oversight .
The White House claims that a September , 2001 Congressional resolution authorizing the so - called war on terror gives the President authority to conduct domestic surveillance without a warrant , even though it is forbidden by federal law .
Interestingly , the Times says that the spy program was curtailed when it became clear to the Administration that the story was about to come out , which implies something a bit shy of full confidence that the order really was legal .
The US Senate on Friday declined to re-authorize the 16 sunset provisions of the so - called " Patriot " Act , and promptly packed its bags for the holidays .
Senate Republicans fell short of the 60 votes needed to halt a Democrat filibuster , and the Act's 16 sunset provisions are therefore bound to expire at the end of the year .
A large minority of Members believe that the re-authorization conference report lacks adequate provisions for judicial oversight .
Senate majority leader Bill Frist ( Republican , Tennessee ) has threatened to keep the Senate in session until the Act is re-authorized , presumably very briefly , say , until Congress comes back to work next year .
But Frist is on the record saying that a temporary re-authorization is unacceptable , and the White House has echoed this as well .
It does not seem likely that Frist would get more than a temporary agreement , so keeping the Senate in session hardly seems worth the bother .
Meanwhile , the House last week rolled over on the Pat Act and approved the conference report , but it did something uncharacteristically brave as well .
It defied the White House on torture as a method of fighting the so - called war on terror .
The Administration has been extremely keen on stopping an anti-torture bill sponsored by past torture victim and current US Senator John McCain ( Republican , Arizona ) , notwithstanding the fact that the President , the Secretary of State , and the Attorney General have all insisted publicly that the USA does not torture anyone , or condone torture at the hands of its allies .
So why the Administration should be so adamantly opposed to a bill which outlaws something it never does sure is a puzzler .
Although the House passed a resolution , rather than the actual bill , it sent a clear signal to the White House that the veto it had threatened can easily be overridden .
And this had the very pleasant effect of persuading the President to praise McCain and his bill during a press conference .
Updating our recent item
It 's official : Diebold election bugware can't be trusted , we find that the North Carolina Board of Elections has certified Diebold systems ( and two competitors ' systems ) without obtaining all of the source code as required by state law .
Now , it 's quite possible that there 's not much of a story here , as it's unclear if Diebold is being given a pass , quite understandably , because it simply has n't got the source code to some of the software it uses ( physical impossibility is a mighty good defence ) , or if it 's being given special permission to flout the law .
We will know more soon , as the EFF is suing the state elections board .
" The Board of Elections has simply ignored its mandatory obligations under North Carolina election law , " EFF spokesman Matt Zimmerman explains .
We 'll soon see if it really is that simple .
It is also worth noting that company CEO Walden O'Dell resigned unexpectedly last week , to the delight of investors and critics alike .
O'Dell had the rather poor judgment to express publicly his dedication to seeing " Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the President . "
The company has failed to shake off the suspicions raised by such a partisan statement from a fellow in charge of a company that makes notoriously buggy election terminals .
In entertainment news , Washington 's most popular lobbying outfit , the Motion Picture Ass. of America ( MPAA ) , has given the kiss of death , otherwise known as an NC - 17 rating , to a documentary movie critical of - you guessed it , the MPAA .
The movie , entitled This Film Is Not Yet Rated , will premiere at the Sundance Film Festival and will be aired on the Independent Film Channel .
MPAA says that it axed the movie due to " some graphic sexual content " .
Quite a few movie theaters and video rental outfits refuse to carry NC - 17 movies , so only a very small number of people will be perverted by its erotic naughtiness , or its skepticism . ®
