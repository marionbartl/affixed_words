Hillary Clinton will suspend her campaign on Saturday , and once she endorses Barack Obama this weekend , the Democratic Party will be able to fully move on towards November .
It is amazing to consider that despite the fact that Obama had clinched the Democratic nomination last night , Hillary Clinton was still in no hurry to admit defeat , and let her dream of being president in 2008 go .
Clinton viewed her exit as negotiable , and it took an intervention by 20 of her supporters in Congress , before she finally was able to admit to herself that it was over .
In part , her feelings are understandable .
Everything that the Clintons have done since Bill left office in 2001 was designed to lead up to Hillary returning them to the White House in 2008 .
Relocating to New York and winning the Senate seat was a move designed to make Mrs. Clinton a national political figure and a presidential candidate .

However , the Clintons did n’t count on such a dramatic change occurring in the political mood of the nation .
The Obama camp understood the mood among Democrats , and they tapped into it perfectly .
Clinton ran much of her early campaign as if time had stood still since 2001 , and the world had not changed .
Her campaign had been notoriously slow to adapt and change , so it should not be any surprise that it took the political equivalent of a ton of bricks to get her to see that it is over .
Hillary Clinton needed an intervention by her strongest supporters to show her how self destructive and detrimental her thinking was becoming not only to her party , but also to her own career .
The blind zealots who urged her to keep fighting were her enablers .
The Democratic Party owes a debt of gratitude to Charlie Rangel for organizing this intervention to talk some sense into Hillary Clinton and getting her out of the race , because if Hillary had her way this thing might have dragged on until August .

While re-digging his pond recently , Mongal Member at Sultanpur of Brahmanbaria Sadar upazila found a 10th century statue of Lord Vishnu five metres below the ground .
The night after the discovery , the so - called Magnet Party ( smuggling group ) of the locality offered Mongal Tk 10 lakh for the statue .
He refused the offer .
He feared about the safety of the artefact and contacted the local police station to handover custody of the statue .
Meanwhile , local journalist and cultural activists contacted Asiatic Society of Bangladesh ( ASB ) and urged them to help preserve the statue properly .
Editor of Smatat Barta , a local daily of Brahmanbaria , Manjurul Alam said , " We thought it is our responsibility to protect our heritage from the clutches of smugglers . "
Chairman of ASB Prof Sirajul Islam along with archaeological experts rushed there to have a look at the statue .
The experts claimed the five feet high and 2.6 feet wide statute of Lord Vishnu , weighing 262 kg , is an artefact of 10th century made during the Chandra dynasty 's rule of Samatat Kingdom , now the greater Comilla district .
Renowned archaeologist AKM Zakaria went to the spot to look at the artefact just after it was discovered on June 14 .
He said , " It is a unique piece of art made with superior quality black stone … could be made of high - quality Basalt .
It is one of the finest and one of the largest artefacts discovered in the country . "
" The decoration of the artefact follows the school of art developed during the Pala dynasty .
However , I suspect it was made during the rule of Kalyan Chandra , of the Chandra dynasty , who ruled the ancient Samatat region during the 10th century , " he added .
Zakaria said , " The halo of the statute confirms that it was made before 11th century .
However , the excess use of decorations indicates that it was not made before 10th century .
Other features of the statute follow the 10th century trends . "
On why the artefact was found five metres under the ground , Zakaria said it was a practice of the ancient Hindu community to bury the image of a deity , when a part of it was distorted .
Of the four hands , two hands and the nose of the Vishnu statute are broken .
Chairman of ASB Prof Sirajul Islam said , " The artefact deserves special treatment which is why we have offered a fellowship to archaeologist Mokammel Hossain Bhuiyan of Jahangirnagar University to do a comparative study on the archaeological value of it . "
Despite locals ' demand of keeping the statue at the National Museum in Dhaka , the artefact was taken to the Mainamati Museum , Comilla Sunday for preservation as per the decision of the Department of Archaeology under the Ministry of Cultural Affairs .
The editor of Smatat Barta said , " When Brahmanbaria police asked a local court to give directions on where to keep the artefact , the additional chief judicial magistrate of Brahmanbaria on June 15 asked the National Museum at Shahbagh , Dhaka to preserve it .
However , the Department Archaeology took the artefact from Brahmanbaria Police Station 's custody and placed it in Mainamati Museum . "
" This is a violation of court order .
Moreover , the unique artefact deserves to be preserved at the National Museum , " he added .
Director of the Department of Archaeology Shafiqul Alam said , " As per Antiquities Act , 1964 [ amended , 1976 ] , it is the responsibility of the department to maintain , conserve and repair protected sites and monuments all over the country . "
" The recently discovered Lord Vishnu 's statute should be preserved at Mainamati Museum at Comilla along with the other artefacts of the region .
Moreover , at present the National Museum does not have the space to preserve more statues , " he added .
On June 19 , 2008 , in the wake of decades of reports of vicious sexual violence in conflicts across the globe , the United Nations Security Council declared that it is time to act .
On June 19 , 2008 , the United
Nations Security Council made history by declaring that rape in war
is such a bad idea they plan to do something about it .
That ’s right .
After
decades of reports on vicious sexual violence in conflicts across the
globe , the highest decision - making body
of the United Nations has decided that it is time to act .
In fact , no other international
actor has as much power to do something about rape in war , and as disappointing
a record , as the United Nations Security Council .
It is not that the Security
Council has n’t talked about the issue before .
In 2000 , the Security
Council — under intense pressure from women ’s groups and UN field
personnel — established a link between the Council’s
mandate and the way in which women and girls are affected differently
by conflict than men and boys .
This link is contained in a resolution ,
known mostly by its number ( 1325/2000 ) , which includes an urgent call
to end impunity for sexual violence and for the United Nations system
to gather information on issues related to women and girls in conflict
and report these to the Security Council .
Action to back up these good
intentions has , however , been scarce .
Every year in October since
2000 , the Council has celebrated the anniversary of resolution 1325
by announcing the importance of the gender perspective in its work ,
and then proceeded to largely ignore it for the rest of the year .

Abortion .

Up until last Thursday , that
is .
On Thursday , the Security Council declared its readiness to act
on sexual violence in a resolution that contains three key components :
The resolution establishes
sexual violence in conflict and post - conflict as a topic within the
purview of the Council ’s work .
" Obviously ! " you might say , and you ’d
be right .
There is no conflict in recent history where women and girls
have not been targeted for sexual violence , whether as a form of torture ,
as a method to humiliate the enemy , or with a view to spreading terror
and despair .
If that ’s not potentially relevant to the protection
of international peace and security , what is ?
But the inclusion
of this clause is essential because some members of the Security Council ,
in particular Russia and China , at times have portrayed rape in war
as an issue that does n’t deserve the Council ’s attention .
With the new resolution , they will no longer be able to do so .
The resolution creates
a clear mandate for the Security Council to intervene , including through
sanctions , where the levels or form of sexual violence merit it .
Again ,
this might seem self - evident .
The Security Council is mandated under
the UN Charter to address situations that present a threat to international
peace and security .
It has the power to chastise countries waging war
without proper cause — notably , not in self - defense — or by illegal
methods , such as the use of child soldiers and , indeed , using rape as
a weapon of war .
Despite this mandate , the Council has so far
done little to prevent or punish states for rape in war .
In fact ,
it would seem it at times has consciously avoided doing so .
This was , for example , the case during the July 2007 discussions regarding
the mandate - renewal for the UN mission in Côte d’Ivoire .
Despite having received information regarding intolerably high levels
of sexual and gender - based violence in that country , the Council did
not empower its field staff to address the violence .
The resolution asks
the Secretary - General to provide a comprehensive report on the extent
to which the resolution has been implemented , as well as on his views
on how to improve information flow to the Council on sexual violence .
This is tremendously important .
In the past , the prevalence and
patterns of sexual violence have barely featured in the reports the
Council commissions and receives from the field offices of the United
Nations .
This is in part because the Security Council until now
more often than not did n’t ask for such information to be included in the
reports .
This crucial failure has been addressed in last Thursday ’s
resolution , which asks for information on sexual violence to be included
in all reports .
Still , the UN system may in many cases not be
equipped to gather information on sexual violence in conflict - affected
situations in a consistent and ethical manner .
This is a root
cause of the lack of Security Council attention to sexual violence .
And last Thursday ’s resolution asks the UN Secretary - General to propose
a lasting solution .
Thursday ’s debate and the
resulting resolution also added a new word to the Council ’s sometimes
dusty vocabulary : never before has a Security Council resolution called
on parties to " debunk " myths that fuel sexual violence .
But
the historic contribution of Thursday ’s debate was to " debunk "
the Council ’s own and self - perpetuating myth that sexual violence
in conflict simply did n’t happen because it did n’t feature prominently
in UN reports to the Council — which , in turn , had been commissioned without seeking to elicit any information or insights on rape in war .
Of course , any UN resolution
is only as good as its follow - up .
In fact , it is possible that
the Security Council ’s until now tepid attention to sexual violence
in conflict - affected situations is a symptom of a more onerous problem :
a deep - seated reluctance to address rape at all , mirroring the failure
of national governments to prosecute and address violence against women
more generally .
Moreover , the UN system cannot change overnight :
while it is now legally empowered to provide information on sexual violence
in conflict situations , it still needs to be appropriately structured and resourced to do so .
This requires investment in training and service - provision , and it requires
the prioritization of this issue at the highest level : field missions ,
UN agencies , and peacekeeping troops should be evaluated , amongst other
things , on the effectiveness and ethics of their approach to sexual
violence .
It is incumbent upon UN members states , Security Council
members , UN agencies , and civil society to make sure this happens .
The road was paved last Thursday .
Now it ’s time to see if the
United Nations can walk the walk .

Ask me about my mom finding my fake plastic vagina
OK , it 's not a flesh light ...
It 's a " Lexie UR3 Pocket Pussy " and even more blatantly a place to stick your wiener than a flesh light .
I had planned on EdenFantasys 's discreet shipping policy to save me from any embarrassing moments with the parents or neighbors , but I think it went far worse than I could have imagined ...
http://img.waffleimages.com/0bffdbe...561_06_bx_l.jpg
I 'm surfin ' the net one day when I stumble across a promotion for this sex toy .
I 've never been interested in sex toys before , but all of a sudden I got really into the idea .
I 'm not a lame - rear end who can't get any real sex .
( I currently have a girlfriend with a REAL vagina )
No , I just thought it might make for a good time for when I was bored and had no motivation .
So I say , " gently caress it ! " and order the drat thing .
I track it online and plan it to be delivered on a day when my parents are gone ...
The day comes and I lay watchful of the mailbox ...
I am ready to snatch up the package before anyone can see !
And ... it never comes .
I am scared all of a sudden .
The online tracker says the item has been delivered !
I call the post office and the woman has to take a report so I have to tell her that the contents of the package was a sex toy and that it never showed up .
A couple hours later a guy from my local post office calls me and says , " So Mr. Tanaka ... it says here you ordered a sex toy and it never arrived ?
Yeah well ...
The postman scans it then puts it in your mailbox , so it was definitely delivered .
I do n't know what to tell you .
Someone must have stolen it . "
I 'm like poo poo oh well ...
At least I did n't get embarrassed in person .
A week goes by and I totally forget I even ordered it .
And it turns out I do n't even want it anymore because I started having sex with this girl I went to high school with .
( Same girl as stated above .
It 's a very new relationship . )
All is well in the Tanaka household ... until ...
Today I wake up from a nice long sleep and open my bedroom door to find an odd package on the ground all ripped up with a note on top .
Click here for the full 852x571 image .
OH GOD !!!
The freakin pocket pussy is sticking out of the side of the box .
And there 's a note from my mom AND the neighbors !?
I open it up to find that jiggly pink thing outside of the inner box so it had DEFINITELY been opened .
I 'm sure the neighbor probably opened it up and whacked his wife on the head with it or something before thinking of returning it .
Click here for the full 415x620 image .
I mean he could have even used it !
My mom was right - That 's GROSS !
So basically now everyone thinks I 'm a perv .
I 'm waiting for my parents to come home from work right now ...
What should I tell them ?
--- Sorry for the delay guys I was at a baseball game ---
Pocket Pussy Update :
OK I decided to tell my mom that it was a gag gift for a friend 's birthday and she bought it ...
Or at least I think she did ...
She laughed and said it was a funny idea .
Actually she said it was a real " hoot " .
I could n't believe I got off so easily on this one , so I decided to give her a little surprise when she goes to work tomorrow .
I left this outside our front door :

Update 2 :
I woke up for work this morning with the pocket pussy and slimy banana peels next to my head .
My mom is a sly one .
She later told me that I can't give it to my friend now because I made it dirty with bananas .
I guess I 'll keep it for when I 'm single then !

Statement on House Congressional Resolution 362 before the US House of Representatives , June 28 , 2008
Today the Dow Jones Average was down 350 - some points , gold was up $ 32 , and oil was up another $ 5 .
There is a lot of chaos out there and everyone is worried about $ 4 gasoline .
But I do n’t think there is a clear understanding [ of ] exactly why that has occurred .
We do know that there is a supply and demand issue , but there are other reasons for the high cost of energy .
One is inflation .
In order to pay for the war that has been going on , and the domestic spending , we ’ve been spending a lot more money than we have .
So what do we do ?
We send the bills over to the Federal Reserve and they create new money , and in the last three years , our government , through the Federal Reserve and the banking system , has created $ 4 trillion of new money .
That is one of the main reasons why we have this high cost of energy and $ 4 per gallon gasoline .
But there is another factor that I want to talk about tonight , and that is not only the fear of inflation and future inflation , but the fear factor dealing with our foreign policy .
In the last several weeks , if not for months , we have heard a lot of talk about the potential of Israel and / or the United States bombing Iran .
And it is in the marketplace .
Energy prices are being bid up because of this fear .
It has been predicted that if bombs start dropping , that we will see energy prices double or triple .
It is just the thought of it right now that is helping to push these energy prices up .
And that is a very real thing going on right now .
But to me it is almost like deja vu all over again .
We listened to the rhetoric for years and years before we went into Iraq .
We did not go in the correct manner , we did not declare war , we are there and it is an endless struggle .
And I cannot believe it , that we may well be on the verge of initiating the bombing of Iran !
Leaders on both sides of the aisle , and in the administration , have all said so often , “ No options should be taken off the table  including a nuclear first strike on Iran . ”
The fear is , they say , maybe someday [ Iran is ] going to get a nuclear weapon , even though our own CIA ’s National Intelligence Estimate has said that the Iranians have not been working on a nuclear weapon since 2003 .
They say they ’re enriching uranium , but they have no evidence whatsoever that they ’re enriching uranium for weapons purposes .
They may well be enriching uranium for peaceful purposes , and that is perfectly legal .
They have been a member of the non-proliferation treaties , and they are under the investigation of the IAEA , and El Baradei has verified that in the last year there have been nine unannounced investigations and examinations of the Iranian nuclear structure and they have never been found to be in violation .
And yet , this country and Israel are talking about a preventive war  starting bombing for this reason , without negotiations , without talks .
Now the one issue that I do want to mention tonight is a resolution that is about to come to this floor if our suspicions are correct , after the July 4th holiday .
And this bill will probably be brought up under suspension .
It will be expected to be passed easily .
It probably will be .
And it is just more war propaganda , just more preparation to go to war against Iran .
This resolution , H.J. Res 362 [ listed as H. Con. Res 362 online ] is a virtual war resolution .
It is the declaration of tremendous sanctions , and boycotts and embargoes on the Iranians .
It is very , very severe .
Let me just read what is involved if this bill passes and what we ’re telling the President what he must do :
“ This demands that the President impose stringent inspection requirements on all persons , vehicles , ships , planes , trains and cargo entering or departing Iran , and prohibiting the international movement of all Iranian officials . ”
This is unbelievable !
This is closing down Iran .
Where do we have this authority ?
Where do we get the moral authority ?
Where do we get the international legality for this ?
Where do we get the Constitutional authority for this ?
This is what we did for ten years before we went into Iraq .
We starved children  500,000 individuals it was admitted probably died because of the sanctions on the Iraqis .
They were incapable at the time of attacking us .
And all the propaganda that was given for our need to go into Iraq was not true .
And it is not true today about the severity [ of the need to attack Iran ] .
But they say , “ Yeah , but Ahmadinejad  he ’s a bad guy .
He ’s threatened violence . ”
But you know what ?
Us threatening violence is very , very similar .
We must look at this carefully .
We just ca n’t go to war again under these careless , frivolous conditions .
Should US deserters from Iraq be given refuge in Canada , a country that welcomed tens of thousands of Vietnam draft - dodgers and deserters ?
It 's a burning question in Canada as the authorities prepare to deport 25 - year - old Corey Glass to face trial in the US .
Here , Corey argues he should be allowed to stay , while below Jonathan Kay from Canada 's conservative National Post newspaper says deserters should be sent home .
COREY GLASS , CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR / DESERTER
In 2002 , I joined the Indiana National Guard .
When I joined , I was told I would only be in combat if there were troops occupying the United States .
I should have been in New Orleans after Katrina , not in Iraq
Corey Glass
I signed up to defend people and do humanitarian work filling sandbags if there was a hurricane .
I had no conception I would be deployed to fight on foreign shores .
But in 2005 , I was deployed with my unit to Camp Anaconda near Balad , Iraq .
My job in Iraq was in military intelligence .
Through this job I had access to a lot of information about what was happening on the ground in Iraq .
I realised innocent people were being killed unjustly and I tried to quit the military while in Iraq .
My commander told me I was stressed out and needed R&R , because I was doing a job I was not trained to do .
I went home on leave and said I was not coming back .
I was told desertion is punishable by death .
I was Absent Without Leave ( AWOL ) in America for eight months .
I searched the internet and found out about US war resisters in Canada .
I arrived in Toronto two weeks later .
TIMES THEY HAVE A CHANGED During the Vietnam War , Pierre Trudeau declared Canada '' a refuge from militarism ' '
Tens of thousands of American draft - dodgers and deserters took refuge in Canada Canada 's immigration laws are much stricter now : refugees must prove that they would face persecution - not just prosecution - if sent back home
On 3 June , Canada 's parliament passed a non-binding motion in favour of allowing deserters to stay I should have been in New Orleans after Katrina , not in Iraq .
I believe the Iraq War is illegal and morally wrong .
I believe I have a duty to refuse to take part in a war not sanctioned by the United Nations , started on the basis of lies .
I have been in Toronto since August 2006 .
In my time here , I have been self - sufficient and I have made many friends .
I have built a life here .
Last week I was in Ottawa , when the House of Commons passed a motion saying that the Canadian government should make it possible for conscientious objectors to get permanent residence in Canada .
The motion also said that all deportation proceedings against us should be stopped .
But I may be deported anyway .
On 21 May I was told that my last chance to stay in Canada had failed , and I must leave by 12 June ( since extended to 10 July ) .
I know that if I return to the US I will face imprisonment and possibly a criminal record .
I do n't think it is fair that I should be returned to the United States to face unjust punishment for doing what I felt morally obligated to do .
I am hoping that Canada , which stayed out of the Iraq War for reasons similar to my own , will reverse the deportation order and let me stay , as parliament has urged .
There are several dozen other war resisters like me in Canada now .
They all deserve to stay here and get on with their lives .
I hope the new American President will end the Iraq War and bring the troops home .
But until that happens , I believe it is every soldier 's right to refuse to take part in that war , if that is what his or her conscience says they must do .
JONATHAN KAY , CANADA'S NATIONAL POST Should Corey Glass have enlisted in the US National Guard back in 2002 ?
Probably not .
From what I saw and heard of his 21 May press conference in Toronto , my first impression was that this pale , lanky 25 - year - old should be playing synth in a Gothic emo band - not kicking down doors in Iraq .
But for whatever reason , Glass did sign up for military service .
There 's no draft in the United States - as there was in the Vietnam era :
No one forced him to put on a uniform .
Why should Canadians help this deserter go back on his freely given word ?
America 's fair - weather soldiers should n't be permitted to make a mockery of a Canadian refugee system that was originally designed to protect migrants fleeing assassination and torture .
During his 21 May appearance , Glass said he was " morally obligated " to desert the US military rather than return to fight an " unjust war " in Iraq .
At the same press conference , anti-war activist Jane Orion Smith argued that Glass is legally entitled to asylum in Canada because the applicable UN standard covers conscientious objectors involved in military actions that are " condemned by the international community " .
Even if this label could fairly be applied to the 2003 liberation of Iraq ( a premise I would dispute ) , it definitely did not apply to the Iraq conflict in 2005 , which is when Glass deserted .
By that time , the UN Security Council had already passed Resolutions 1483 ( recognising the United States and Britain as " occupying powers " under international law ) and 1546 ( endorsing the creation of an Iraqi Interim Government ) .
Does Canada really want to cast itself as the protector of fair - weather American soldiers fleeing their duty ?
Glass 's mission was not to invade Iraq , his mission was to help protect the emergence of a free , peaceful , sovereign Iraqi state .
With the recent deployment of the Iraqi army to Basra , Mosul and the Sadr City neighbourhood of Baghdad , that goal is now close to being realised - no thanks to Glass , nor to the dozens of other " conscientious objectors " now residing in Canada .
Moreover , from a purely political standpoint , giving asylum to the likes of Glass would send a terrible message .
It would undermine America 's war effort in Iraq - even as Canadian and American soldiers fight side by side on another front in the war on terror , Afghanistan .
Given this shared enterprise , does Canada really want to cast itself as the protector of fair - weather American soldiers fleeing their duty ?
Six years ago , Corey Glass picked the wrong career .
Three years ago , he picked an illegal way to abandon it .
It 's time for this ex-soldier to go home and pay the price for what he 's done .
Jonathan Kay is managing editor for comment at Canada 's National Post newspaper .
Some of your comments on the story He was a part of the National Guard .
The last line to go to war , so the fact that he was sent to Iraq says a lot about the situation within our military and this " war " , who will we send next , the merchant marines ?
Tresor Gopaul , Montclair NJ , USA Jonathan
Kay really needs to look up what the term " National Guard " means .
Glass was the US equivalent of a reservist .
So they shipped a reservist overseas when the country is n't even formally at war ( and when the Nation , which he signed up to Guard , is not under threat ) , and Kay thinks this is something he signed up for ?
Geez .
Sergiy Grynko , Toronto , Canada Send him home .
He needs to learn to stand up and fulfil his commitment instead of being a coward .
It may not be pretty in Iraq , and he may not agree with what is being done , but he signed up for it regardless .
I 'm sure there were plenty in Vietnam that did n't agree with the policies , but still did what was asked of them .
Mike , NC USA I sympathise with this guy , but guilty or innocent is not the question here :
The point is that that 's up to America to decide .
He should make his case and be judged there .
Canada has no responsibility either way .
Eric , Swindon I am a Canadian who supports Corey Glass in his struggle to stay in Canada .
Not only that , I support any US military person who has decided to come to Canada on the grounds that the war in Iraq is wrong .
Thousands of Viet Nam - era draft dodgers and deserters came to Canada and have since become outstanding Canadians .
They were pardoned by Jimmy Carter .
Why should n't Iraq objectors be given the same treatment , instead of having to lay down their lives for George Bush ?
Paul Brooke , Vancouver , Canada I joined the Army National Guard in 1992 .
We all knew and it was made perfectly clear many times , before and after we joined , that we were in the United States Military and were required to defend the nation at home and abroad .
We were never once told , nor was it inferred , that all we would do is " fill sandbags " for humanitarian reasons .
Corey Glass joined the " ARMY National Guard " not the Peace Corps , Salvation Army , or any other humanitarian organization .
The difference is that the Military pays more money .
That is why Corey Glass joined .
You train with guns , grenades , claymores ; you train to fight a war .
Not once in basic training was Corey Glass trained , nor was it ever mentioned in any class , or any Army field manual how to fill sandbags to stop a flood .
Corey Glass learned to fill sandbags for a bunker to defend a military forward operating base from enemy attack .
If it is for moral reasons then do what other conscientious objectors with standards have done : serve your time in a military prison for going back on the oath you gave to your country and fellow military personnel .
Chris
CK , LIC , NY I would have thought it was the duty of any country to offer refuge for anyone refusing to fight in an illegal war .
Stef Robertson , London , UK I believe that Corey Glass and other conscientious objectors who originally signed up to U.S. National Guard service should be given the chance by Canada to stay on Canadian soil and be productive members of Canadian society .
It is an outrage and disgrace that National Guard members , who everyone who I 've ever talked to had understood them to be ONLY utilized for service on U.S. soil , have been sent overseas for ANY mission .
Canada , please continue to be a beacon of human rights that the U.S. has failed to be .
Please protect our National Guard soldiers who were misled and misused .
Laura Luckey , New Mexico , U.S. Mr. Kay 's argument is based on the concepts of A ) Consequences for one 's actions and B ) World perception of Canadian policy .
Regarding A ) it may be said that Mr. Glass 's flight to Canada is also the consequence of his action - to board a plane to Iraq and see things in person before making a decision to not be a part of that anymore .
Regarding his comment that Mr. Glass should n't have joined up , is Mr. Kay indirectly suggesting that if Mr. Glass had made his decision not to participate via second - hand information obtained through the media it would be respected but it being based on first - hand information is not grounds for respecting his decision to no longer participate ?
Regarding B ) I think it is well established by now that the world community does not support an attack on , or the invasion and occupation of a sovereign nation except in defense of a prior attack or through consensus of the world body , the UN , whether or not it is deemed a " liberation " ( one man 's meat , etc . )
It should also be noted that as many have done before , he links the American war effort in Iraq with the war in Afghanistan .
Surely the significant presence of Canadian troops in Afghanistan but not in Iraq itself is lucid indication of what image of itself Canada wishes to project .
Given all this , I realize that cause and effect are universal truths .
Fairness and unfairness are human inventions .
So , by the way , are good and evil .
danin , Santa Cruz , CA Corey is a victim of deception ( bait - and - switch ) , and should have the right to break his duplicitous contract with the U.S. military .
Even if this were not so , he should be awarded conscientious objector status and given an honorable discharge to be a free man , to live wherever he chooses .
Canada should remain a beacon of hope and refuge for oppressed immigration aspirants from around the world , including the USA 's monstrous military machine .
Phil Klein , Coralville IA USA I agree very strongly with Mr. Kay on this point .
I have known men to have registered as conscientious objectors in WW1 and WW2 .
In the former case , a young Christian man was dragged in chains through the streets of Kilwinning for holding firmly to his Christian beliefs about war .
In the latter case , I know of a man who was locked in gaol because the government lost his CO paperwork .
Another friend and mentor lost any chance of a career in enginnering because of his CO status .
These were men who peacably refused to renege on their beliefs about war and paid a very heavy price for it in their society .
Corey Glass volunteered for the military and now he 's changed his mind because he 's seen war up close and personal .
If he really believed the US government could not send its National Guard abroad legally he should have refused to go in the first place .
Or he sould have learned that the National Guard supplied 40 % of America 's WW1 army in France and supplied 19 divisons in WW2 .
!
Furthermore , if Canada does allow him to remain it makes a mockery of the Conscientious Objector .
The man 's a coward and his behaviour is shameful to soldier and CO alike .
Well said , Mr. Kay .
Graham McDonald , Cumbernauld , UK I view Mr. Glass as a hero .
There is nothing wrong with deserting a military unit once it has served YOUR purposes .
I certainly would want my son to do the same .
Regretfully , I did n't possess Mr. Glass ' good sense and bravery when I enlisted in the Marine Corp back in 1980 .
I joined out of a sense of loyalty and patriotism to my country .
Now , I just feel like a chump as I 'm sure others do upon returning from Iraq .
Those four years I lost forever could have been better spent in college .
Many people make poor career choices but only in the military can you face criminal charges .
It 's not a job you can just quit as Mr. Kay implies .
I would like to ask what branch of Canada 's military did he serve .
And if he is so impressed by the progress we 're making in Iraq , why does n't he take Mr. Glass ' place .
Chris Perricone , Springfield , Virginia , USA As a U.S. Marine and patriotic American citizen , I fell Corey Glass has abandoned his country .
Whether or not the War in Iraq is morally right or wrong , Glass still swore an oath to defend the United States from all enemies , foreign and domestic .
That means if a nation halfway around the world is a threat to U.S. national security , it is his job to go in and stop them .
It does n't matter if he joined the Marine Corps or the National Guard .
I 'll bet Glass was one of those who enlisted for the benefits and college money , hoping he would n't have to give back for what he 's taking .
It 's a selfish way to think .
Well , his country called and he is now refusing to give back .
Last time I checked , no one in this country is forced to " sign the dotted line . "
No , he made a choice to volunteer to serve in the American armed forces .
I agree with Jonathon Kay wholeheartedly .
The burden is not on Canada .
It is on Corey Glass .
Send that coward back to the U.S. and let a military court martial decide his fate .
Nick Dunn , Milford , NH , United States / Twentynine Palms , CA , United States
I do n't think that my country should accept any american refugees for a reason or another , but at the same time , I understand this is a major problem and we should try to solve the problem because it keeps happening everyday .
But Mister Kay sounds like he's too confident about the US Army and thinks the situation over Iraq is under control .
Maybe we should send him to Iraq and see what will be his opinion about deserting a country with millions of people who do n't like you .
The US Army forces are not welcomed by any Iraqi people .
When you enroll to help people and want feel like you 're doing something good , " protecting " the emergence of a free , peaceful , sovereign Iraqi state like Jonathan Kay says does n't make you feel good when you this war is a big scam .
I think we should put pressure on the United States government so they can change their policy on deserting from a war 70 % of people around Earth disagree with .
Bruno , Montreal , Quebec , Canada Although the National Guard is the oldest component of the Armed Forces of the United States , its primary function is to defend the Nation in case of attack and help in case of natural disasters .
Corey Glass ' case is not rare , several americans serving in the NG were taken by surprise when they found out that they were sent to Iraq .
Canada like most other countries recognized that the Iraq war was unjustified and that is why it did not join the US - lead forces .
Moreover , Canada has a long tradition of protecting Human Rights .
The United Nations Commission on Human Rights resolution 1998 /77  officially recognized that persons [ already ] performing military service may develop conscientious objections . , and that conscientious objections is a Human right .
Canada should honor its long cherished tradition and grant asylum to Corey Glass .
Francois Rose , Stockton , CA , USA
While I feel we can all sympathize with Mr. Glass and the tough situation he found himself in once deployed to Iraq , Jonathan Kay 's points are well made ...
Mr. Glass should not be allowed to hide from his responsibilities in Canada .
Among other things , he surely does not fall neatly into the category of conscientious objector .
He finds war unsavory , stressful and shocking ... and walked away from his unit .
That 's clearly desertion .
Completely different situation ... sorry , mate .
Go face the music .
Steve Lewis , Rosseau , Canada Corey Glass has to be sent back home , plain and simple ; and there is a moral reason for doing so .
The US is one of the most democratic systems in the world .
While it has its own flaws , and elections may be marred by dirty tactics - the government that currently resides in the US is one that was chosen by the political community to which Corey belonged to .
That government consists not only of the Bush administration , but also of the Congress and the Senate , both of which represent American people , and both of which have approved the War in Iraq .
As a member of the American political community , Corey gave his consent to be governed by its law , whether he agrees with all of them or not .
By voting in elections , paying taxes , getting education in a publicly funded school or college ( these are just examples of what Corey most likely has done in his life ) he implicitly declared his consent to be a member of the political community and to follow its commonly agreed on rules .
Participation in wars that have been approved by the democratically elected government , if you have signed up for active duty , is one of such rules .
It does not differ from rules such as bans on theft , murder , or even the status of abortion ( whatever it is in any given state ) .
A member of a political community , once consenting to be a part of it , can not pick and chose which rules they decide to follow .
The reasons for this are both prudential ( it would be chaos otherwise ) and moral .
The moral aspect of it has to do with the common life that the community members agree to build .
The common life is built on a contract between " the living , the dead , and those who are yet to be born . "
The rules that the political community decided to govern itself by are part of that contract .
By deserting , for whatever reasons , he violates the rule and thus the contract , which is moral in nature .
He is betraying not the government of the US or its policies , but the principles upon which his political community has been built upon .
He is betraying his fellow country persons ; and that includes those who supported the war , those who opposed it , and most of all , those who participated in it .
I objected the War in Iraq at its inception and I feel sorry for all those who had to fight , and worst of all - die , for the war that had no legal , moral , or practical basis .
That , however , does not change the fact that what Corey has done is simply wrong .
Finally , if Corey believes the Iraq war to be such an immoral act , he should be willing to pay the price for not participating in it , rather than trying to get out of it all together .
Amir , Vancouver , Canada and London , UK I do not believe that Mr. Glass should be awarded Canadian Refugee status .
I am vehemently opposed to the war in Iraq and it is unfortunate that he had such false illusions regarding military service .
Should the United States implement a draft I would feel differently about granting refugee status to deserters but not to a soldier who made a poor career choice .
I do not feel it is Canadas responsibility to provide permanent resident status to someone who would be granted a fair trial and a right to a lawyer when he is returned to face the consequences of his actions .
Refugee status was established to protect individuals who are victims of human rights violations .
Misty , Dallas , USA
In my eyes what appears to be the main issue is whether or not someone who volunteered to serve in the military is entitled to declare conscientious objector status versus someone who was drafted by their government .
Granted the notion that someone would knowingly volunteer for military service and then be appalled that they are going to be sent into a combat zone is a tad odd given the job description of a soldier is to knowingly put oneself in harms way and to do harm to others .
Mr. Glass has declared that he did not sign up to fight overseas but rather to defend American soil .
This argument is valid , I believe in business it is known as a bait & switch , Mr. Glass believes he was lied to .
Personally I believe Mr. Glass should be granted amnesty in Canada as all other deserters should be , honestly how sane is it say someone should be punished for wanting to live ?
Drew L. , Toronto , Ontario , Canada
I whole - heartedly agree with the comments made by Jonathan Kay .
NO ONE made Corey Glass enlist , he did it of his own free will .
What kind of message would it send , that anyone who objects to the orders they are given in the Armed Services can simply " object " and quit on their country ?
Is n't THAT what being in the military is about ( at least partially ) ?
Or what , now - a - days it 's ok that 25 year old kids think they know what is better for the country ?
A , Baltimore , MD To me , Corey Glass represents a critical issue that challenges our freedom .
In the states we have an electoral college that can override the presidential vote of every American .
On top of that our legislators create loop holes to remove themselves from accountability .
Our military is no different as they have set up lawyers , judge and jury all from the same pool of military conformity ( see Guantanamo 's current legal proceedings )
This has to stop somewhere and Corey 's battle is an obvious example of how our right to free thought has been infringed upon .
I do n't agree with his decision but it points to a larger problem here in the US and we have the change to make him a " poster boy " for reform .
America loves celebrities , and this would be soldier could start a wave of public conscience in our political development .
Our freedom has been stolen and replaced with a set of laws that protect private and big money interests .
Corey could be the first step in taking back our actual freedom before the power that control out country destroy it 's success .
Jamison Bourque , Denver , CO I disagree with Mr. Kay that these are " fair weather soilders fleeing their duty " .
Cory Glass is a prime example of the disallusionment that prevails amongst many young americans who have joined the US military .
The duties of the National Guard are to stay in the country and protect against foreign invaders as well as provide aid during natural disasters .
He was told he would only go to war if the US were to be invaded and occupied by hostile foreign military troops .
It has always been my understanding that The National Guard 's role is to Stay in the US unlike the Army , Navy , Marines , and Airforce .
Since there is no longer a draft in the US it seems that recruiters have resorted to lying in order to secure their quota .
But at least they are consistent -- after all it just came out in the Senate hearings that Bush and his administration DID lie to the american public ( and the rest of the world ) regarding the Irag invasion .
Mr. Kay , before you condemn these " deserters " , I implore you to do a little more research .
Edna Daniel , Denver , USA I 'm sorry to say I agree with Jonathan from the post , Corey made a commitment , of his own free will to sign up and serve with the national guard A conscientious objector would n't sign up to serve in a military force , and can you imagine the result if for every single engagement an army got into soldiers were given a free choice as to whether they served in this particular war ?
Paul , Manchester UK
The key issue is how solid was the pledge given to Mr. Glass that he would only remain in the US for the duration of his service .
There is a big difference between defending your country on your own turf and invading a sovereign country for dubious reasons .
And speaking of differences , Jonathan Kay makes a clear distinction between the 2003 liberation  and the 2005 conflict , but would the average Iraqi do the same ?
Mike Berrigan , Oyster Pond , Nova Scotia , Canada I totally agree with Jonathan Kay .
Glass signed up for duty , and by abandoning his troop he was in effect saying " I think more about myself than I do about you " .
As I read his message it sounded like he was using the usual points of contention about the Iraqi war , to substantiate his actions .
Does n't work Corey !
If you sign up for something and you quit , your word , which is the only thing of true value you ever own , means nothing .
Go home , and if you truly believe what you say , tell the US Government , and leave asylum for those truly in danger .
ann broomfield , British Columbia , Canada
My father , brother and husband are all serving in Iraq right now .
I have only one word to say to this man , " COWARD . "
Veronica , San Diego , CA USA he United States is a repressive society today and any person of conscience would never receive a fair hearing there .
Allow him to stay where there is a more tolerant society and things are not so politicized .
Wayne Dickson , Halifax , Canada I agree with Mr Kay .
Since the military in the United States is a volunteer force you can't be a conscientious objector .
I might be a bit biased though since my father fought in Vietnam and I have met a Canadian who was there as well .
Robert Hall , Dallas , TX , USA Corey is absolutely right and if I had sons in this situation I 'd send them to Canada or Switzerland .
He was told he would not be in combat unless we were at war here in the U.S.
This is Bush 's war on oil .
Had we stayed in Afghanistan it would be a different story because it was a fight against the Taliban that attacked us .
I 'd send Bush in his place to Iraq .
Linda Sable , USA
As a veteran myself , I say send him back and let him rot in prison for abandoning his fellow soldiers .
Fifty years ago , we would n't be having this conversation , he just would have been sent home in a box after a summary execution .
I respect Canada and its stance , but this is purely a US matter that needs to be handled here .
Rodney Reynolds , St. Louis , MO I believe Mr. Kay 's comment ironically says exactly why Mr. Glass should be given asylum : " ... giving asylum to the likes of Glass would send a terrible message .
It would undermine America 's war effort in Iraq ... "
Canada has the golden opportunity of figuratively if not literally saving a young man 's life while simultaneously helping stop a war that never should have been started .
Mimi Leland , Albuquerque , New Mexico , USA Mr Kay 's comments are very interesting indeed .
Tell me , Mr. Kay , is the Canadian economy being ruined by your governments continuing presence in Iraq ?
As far I know , you have no troops in Iraq , and about 2500 in Afganistan serving as part of ISAF .
It 's easy to be all for the war when your Nation is n't hemorraging money , your infrastructure is n't collapsing and your kids are n't getting substandard educations .
And i'm sure Canadian reservists would be thrilled to be activated en mass for a deployment to Iraq .
Would you go ?
Edward S. Renouard , III , Spokane , Washington , USA
The very fact that the National Guard was called up to be sent overseas is absurd .
If Glass had signed up for the Army , and was objecting the war , I would say - send him back .
He is right , however , the National Guard are intended to be the force that stays on US soil to respond to events here - not be sent to the other side of the globe .
John , Cincinnati , US
He should definitely not be sent back .
Noone should be forced to fight and kill innocent people .
The US should be ashamed of their actions in Iraq and for sending their own young men and women into a dangerous and futile situation .
Alice , Spain
As Jonathan points out there is no draft , he signed up freely .
When you sign up for active duty , you know full well that you might be ordered to go whereever .
It is ludicris that he should receive asylum .
He should be made to account for his actions .
I have friends and family in harms way at the moment .
They are doing their duty in Iraq , whatever their personal feeling .
Just my .02
Michael Cardiff , Crowley , Louisiania USA
I was in the British Armed Forces , and despite my opposition to the Ieaq War - if I was still in the forces , I would be obliged to serve in Iraq .
It 's was my job !
Mr Glass signed up to serve within the US army , and I 'm sure that he was not misled else thousands of other deserters would exist .
Perhaps I should refuse to pay my credit card bill as I feel morally obliged not to pay it ?
No - I signed up to the card and now I have the responsibility to pay anything I put on it .
Get a backbone Mr Glass .
Stephen , Cardiff , Wales Jonathan Kay is ignoring a very important part of why many young men and women join the National Guard in the United States .
To pay for college , to get out of dead end hometowns , to have an extra source of income to supplement an unfair working class wage .
I believe the people who joined for Corey Glass ' reasons are victims of systematic denial of access to improving their own lives in any other way .
The United States does n't need a draft , in fact if we had one that would end the war very quickly .
All my government needs to do is keep up the just and socially irresponsible systems that keep young people struggling to get a head .
As long as those are around there will always be people willing to join .
Corey Glass fits this picture , someone who was trying to get a head by being a good citizen , but never expected to fight a war for oil .
Daina , Washington , DC Jonathon Kay 's article is typical of what one is expected to see in mainstream media , a distortion of the facts and a language and use of words that well conforms to state ideology .
Distortion one : " From what I saw and heard of his 21 May press conference in Toronto , my first impression was that this pale , lanky 25 - year - old should be playing synth in a Gothic emo band - not kicking down doors in Iraq .
But for whatever reason , Glass did sign up for military service . "
Corey Glass did not sign up to kick doors down in Iraq , as he himself stated he " signed up to defend people and do humanitarian work filling sandbags if there was a hurricane " in the National guard .
Distortion two : " Glass 's mission was not to invade Iraq , his mission was to help protect the emergence of a free , peaceful , sovereign Iraqi state . "
This is not a fact , this is one perspective of what the United States is doing in Iraq .
This view is not shared by everyone and more so makes it obvious why Jonathon Kay would support deportation , he strictly conforms to the spectrum of allowed thought dictated not by Canada , but by the US .
Distortion three : " Even if this label could fairly be applied to the 2003 liberation of Iraq ( a premise I would dispute ) , it definitely did not apply to the Iraq conflict in 2005 , which is when Glass deserted . "
At the time of the initial invasion the war was unilateral and illegal by international standards .
This is known .
Jesse , London Canada Glass ' claim that he was told my the Reserves that he would only see duty if the US was occupied is ridiculous .
Where was he when the Regular Army and Reserves were employed to fight in the Persian Gulf in 1991 and since ?
Terry Duncan ,
This guy was in the army for 3 years before deserting , so all was well until he was sent into war ... it 's the army !
That 's what the army does , that 's why most people do n't sign up to it unless they like violence !
" I thought I would be filling bags with sand . "
No , you probably thought it was cool that you could tell people you carry a gun at work .
How long is minimum service ?
In the UK it 's 3 years and then you can leave , did he sign up for a few more years of service ?
As the US and UK are occupying forces in Iraq as ratified by the UN , that is why they can deploy the National Guard there .
He sounds like someone who thought it would be a good idea and that his career may impress the girls but when push came to shove he fled , plus it says he was in intelligence and nowhere does it say he was near the front lines .
Definitely should be deported as his reasons for " asylum " are desertion and it's consequences from a voluntary armed force ( no one forced you to put pen to paper ) .
He should have read the small print in his contract , methinks .

What are these ?
Pity ITV .
No really - drop to your knees and pity it .
Last week the culture secretary Andy Burnham refused to accept a European Union directive that would have paved the way for product placement on British television .
On hearing the news , ITV 's face fell .
Its shares soon followed suit .
As advertising revenue continues to dwindle , money is leaking from ITV 's business model like blood from a harpooned steak .
Cutbacks will be inevitable , and chances are we 'll see the results on screen .
Forget dumbing - down ; fear cheapening - up .
Instead of a star - studded Doctor Who knock - off stuffed with pricey CGI dinosaurs , the next series of Primeval will be a reality show in which Patrick Kielty and Lembit Opik drive around Staines in an ice - cream van trying to catch dogs in a net .
Loose Women will become Loose Woman , a daytime talk show in which a menopausal fishwife stands alone in a cupboard - sized studio , staring into a mirror and gossiping about herself .
And in a bid to cut down on location fees , from now on the detectives in Lewis will be solving murders that have taken place in their imaginations ; each episode will consist of nothing but footage of Lawrence Fox and Kevin Whately sitting in chairs screwing their eyes up and frowning a bit .
Boo hoo hoo .
Bad news for telly .
On the face of it , Burnham 's reasons for rejecting product placement could n't be more sound .
Trust in television is already at an all - time low following last year 's string of call - in scandals , when viewers were effectively pick - pocketed by the box in the corner of their living room .
Many people now stare at their TV set for hours not because they like the programmes it shows , but because they 're worred it might start nicking stuff while their back 's turned .
And Burnham recognises that blurring the line between shows and ads wo n't exactly help matters .
" Product placement exacerbates this decline in trust and contaminates our programmes , " he said .
" As a viewer I do n't want to feel the script has been written by the commercial marketing director . "
He 's got a point there , although it might be worth giving the commercial marketing director a go - just once , in the spirit of fairness - to see what he comes up with .
Love in the Time of the Arrow Information Paradox ?
The New
Adventures of Spreadsheet , PI ?
Brand Awareness
Way ?
OK , so the dialogue might be impenetrable , but it could n't possibly be as boring as the latest Poliakoff exercise in mastur - guff .
Anyway , Burnham 's right .
But the world is wrong .
ITV's got to pay for its programmes somehow and , in the current environment , prohibiting product placement altogether seems a bit like telling a bunch of starving plane crash survivors shivering in a lifeboat that they 're not allowed to start eating corpses for sustenance .
No one wants to switch on the box and see Fireman Sam banging on about the great taste of Disprin , but desperate times call for desperate measures .
One solution is to allow product placement after all , provided it 's subtle , and provided the advertisers have no say in the editorial content .
Lingering pack shots , or dialogue such as , " Taggart , according to an animated multimedia text I 've just received on my new Sony Ericcson t85X , there 's been a murder " are out , obviously .
But I for one could n't give a toss if Doc Martin is shown spreading Marmite - proper , branded Marmite - on his toast .
Actually , I do n't care if he spreads it on his balls , because I do n't watch Doc Martin , but you get the point - if Marmite wants to pay to stock his on - screen kitchen , and that makes the show cheaper , which in turn means fewer ad breaks in the middle of it , therefore allowing me to spend more time wallowing in a world of uninterrupted fiction , then I 'm happy .
Well , OK , not happy - never happy - but not much closer to suicide either .
That 's a plus .
Another option is to advertise in new and exciting ways .
A few weeks ago Honda ran a live skydiving commercial .
Why stop there ?
Why not stage your own advertorial Olympics consisting solely of 30 - second sponsored events broadcast live across the globe ?
( Nanoseconds after typing this I 've realised it 's a brilliant idea , so any ad agencies reading this should consider it copyrighted by me as of now .
Use it if you like , but it 'll cost you - give my slice of the royalties to Amnesty International , just to annoy the Chinese . )
Or turn hardcore .
Let 's say you 're trying to launch a new soft drink .
Traditionally you 'd have to spend millions on a commercial , and millions more booking airtime for it .
Screw that .
Here 's what you do : put up one billboard .
Just one .
Somewhere on a route near Buckingham Palace or Downing Street .
Point a camera at it 24 / 7 .
Then simply pay a sniper to assassinate someone of global importance when they pass in front of it .
Bingo !
The clip will run on an endless loop on every news channel in the world , for eternity .
Even as viewers gasp in horror watching the victim's head explode like a watermelon , they 'll simultaneously be thinking " What 's that ?
New Plum - Flavoured Pepsi ? Cool ! " each time a chunk of skull flies past your logo .
Talk about brand awareness .
That 's the future , right there .
All it needs is its own twatty marketing - speak buzzterm - something like " Killvertising " or " Atroci- publicity " - and within about six months it 'll even seem halfway acceptable .
Go creatives .
Go you .
LONDON - The experts at London 's Natural History Museum pride themselves on being able to identify species from around the globe , from birds and mammals to insects and snakes .
Yet they can't figure out a tiny red-and - black bug that has appeared in the museum 's own gardens .
The almond - shaped insect , about the size of a grain of rice , and was first seen in March 2007 on some of the plane trees that grow on the grounds of the 19th century museum , collections manager Max Barclay said Tuesday .
Within three months , it had become the most common insect in the garden , and it was also spotted in other central London parks , he said .
The museum has more than 28 million insect species in its collection , but none is an exact match for this one .
Still , Barclay is cautious about calling it a new discovery .
" I do n't expect to find a new species in the gardens of a museum , " he said .
" Deep inside a tropical rainforest , yes , but not in central London . "
The bug resembles the Arocatus roeselii , which is usually found in central Europe but is a brighter red and lives on alder trees .
Entomologists suspect the new bug could be a version of the roeselii that has adapted to live on plane trees , but acknowledge it could be a new species .
Either way , it appears the museum 's tiny visitor , which appears harmless , is here to stay .
" We waited to see if the insect would survive the British winter , " Barclay said .
" It did and it 's thriving , so now we had better figure out what it is . "

June 11 , 2008 --
The Indian ruling class is striving to forge what it calls a ``strategic partnership ’’ with the United States , and in this aim the major ruling - class political parties are united .
The previous government -- a coalition termed the National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ) headed by the Hindu majoritarian Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) -- which was in power from 1999 - 2004 , had in the wake of 9/11 strived to prove to the US rulers that India was a more stable and suitable ally on the subcontinent for the US ``war on terror ’’ than Pakistan .
The BJP - led NDA government even proposed a grandiose ``Triad Against Terrorism ’’ comprising India , Israel and the US , thereby overturning decades of Indian foreign policy that had favoured the Palestinian cause .
The BJP is known for its viciously anti-Muslim agenda , is notorious for the state - sponsored pogrom which killed thousands of Muslims in the Indian state of Gujarat in 2002 , and its goal is to turn secular India into a `` Hindu ’’ nation .
The BJP , drawing on the ``clash of civilisations ’’ notion of Christians , Jews and Hindus against Muslims , spoke of a supposed ``natural affinity ’’ between India – the ``Hindu homeland ’’ – besieged by the terrorism of its Islamic neighbour Pakistan , and Israel – the ``Jewish homeland ’’ – besieged by ``Muslim ’’ Palestine ’s ``terrorism ’’.
In May 2003 , India 's national security advisor Brajesh Mishra , addressing a meeting of the American Jewish Committee – a Zionist outfit – in Washington , called for a ``core , consisting of democratic societies ... which can take on international terrorism ’’ – and the Indo - US - Israel axis was to constitute this ``core ’’ .
The NDA government had even been willing to send Indian troops to assist the Anglo - American occupation of Iraq , but nationwide protests resulted in a unanimous vote in parliament against such a move .
When the NDA government was badly defeated in the May 2004 Indian parliamentary elections , it was succeeded by the United Progressive Alliance government , a coalition led by the Indian National Congress and dependent on the crucial support of the bloc of left parties led by the Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) – CPI ( M ) -- and the Communist Party of India ( CPI ) .
The UPA government ’s ``Common Minimum Programme ’’ ( a document representing the coalition ’s united manifesto for governance ) , even as it promised to ``maintain the independence of India ’s foreign policy position on all regional and global issues ’’ , also declared , in the same breath , its intention to pursue ``closer engagement and relations with the USA ’’ .
So the doors were left wide open for continuing with the NDA government ’s policy of ``strategic alliance ’’ with the USA while genuflecting to the principle of an ``independent ’’ foreign policy .
The new prime minister , Manmohan Singh , did not waste much time showing that he had every intention of intensifying India ’s ``strategic ’’ ties with imperialist nations .
On his way to deliver his first address at the UN General Assembly in September 2004 , he had his first direct encounter with both British PM Tony Blair and US President George Bush .
Manmohan ’s joint declaration with Blair talked of a long - term comprehensive strategic partnership between Britain and India : specifically over defence cooperation , joint military training and exercises , and cooperation between police and other law enforcement agencies in the criminal justice system .
At a time when Blair was beleaguered by protests at home over the lies he told to justify his role in the invasion and occupation of Iraq , Manmohan made it a point to declare that the war on Iraq was a chapter of the past , and short of committing Indian troops to Iraq , he offered all kinds of assistance in policing Iraq .
The joint statement issued after Manmohan ’s hour - long meeting with Bush described Indo - US bilateral ties to have ``never been as close as they are at present ’’ , and emphasised ``expanded defence cooperation … ( as ) an integral aspect of the expanding ties ’ ’.
Nepal and Myanmar [ Burma ] were also prominent issues covered during Manmohan ’s breakfast meeting with Bush .
Strategic partnership
It is worth examining the ``strategy ’’ involved in the ``Indo - US strategic partnership ’’ touted by India ’s ruling parties .
A report was commissioned by the US Defence Department in 2002 , titled * Indo - US Military Relations : Expectations and Perceptions ’ outlines exactly how India fits into the US ’ strategic requirements * ( see * Liberation * , July 2003 , ``US Eying Military Bases in India ’’ ) .
In that report , senior Pentagon officers speak of the need to have access to Indian bases so as to be ``closer to areas of instability ’’.
Also , in order to avoid the gaze of Indian public opinion , which is quick to see ``colonialism through the back door ’’ , they remarked that the US Navy may be a good place to begin , since the US Navy can conduct joint exercises conveniently ``out of sight ’’ and without leaving any telltale ``footprints … on the ground ’’ in India !
A key US strategic objective is to contain and encircle China ; and ``strategic partnership with India ’’ is obviously an important means of achieving this objective .
In 2005 , once again the Indian government made several leaps ahead in cementing the partnership with US imperialism .
Indian Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee , during his visit to the US in June , sealed a 10 - year Defence Framework – the Indo - US ``Next Steps in Strategic Partnership ( NSSP ) ’’.
This was followed by another visit by Manmohan Singh to the US .
Both the text of the NSSP and Manmohan Singh ’s speeches invoked the rhetoric of ``natural partnership ’’ and ``shared concerns ’’ between the ``two democracies ’’ – a favourite theme for rulers of both nations .
Manmohan Singh ’s speech declared that ``Democracies provide legitimate means for expressing dissent ’’.
Did the US government heed ``dissent ’’ when it railroaded the antiwar protests and invaded Iraq ?
Manmohan glossed over such inconvenient issues , and having paid lip service to democracy , proceeded to suggest , not so subtly , that democracies were especially vulnerable to terror ( thereby implying that curbs on freedoms were called for to fight ``terror ’’ ) .
``Terrorism exploits the freedom our open societies provide to destroy our freedoms ’’ , said Manmohan .
The clear implication was : Muslim immigrants in Britain and the US , as well as Muslims in India , bite the hand that feeds them – and that ’s why draconian acts like the PATRIOT Act in the US and the Prevention of Terrorism Act in India are needed .
Several elements in the Defence Framework indicated the UPA government ’s readiness to help the US in the arduous task of policing Iraq and other ``trouble spots ’’ in Asia : the framework spoke of commitment to ``multinational defence operations ’’ ; to ``defeating religious extremism ’’ ; to ``spreading democracy worldwide ’’; ``peacekeeping ’’ in Asia and so on .
Clearly , for the US , India is a suitable candidate to be a tough cop in what Pranab Mukherjee during his 2005 US visit called a ``dangerous neighbourhood ’’!
Manmohan Singh , like Bush and Blair , deliberately ignored the fact that terrorism , far from being the scourge of ``open societies ’’ , in fact harvests the seeds obligingly sown by imperialist aggression and state - sponsored racism and communalism .
In India , the problem of terrorism has overwhelmingly been the result of unresolved domestic crises .
By joining the US ``war on terror ’’ , India would in fact be inviting the ``global ’’ variety on its soil !
This is one of the reasons why Indians have been vehemently against Indian troop deployment in Iraq .
The other powerful historical reason being the legacy of two centuries of colonial rule and anti-colonial struggle in India , which has left Indians with a strong affinity for the struggles of the occupied peoples of Palestine and Iraq .
Rulers embarrassed by India ’s anti-colonial sentiment
However , for the Indian ruling class that legacy of anti-colonial struggle is an embarrassment – an impediment in cementing the much - coveted bond with imperialism today .
Manmohan Singh , just prior to his 2005 US visit , delivered a speech in his alma mater Oxford University in August 2005 , in which he sought to correct what he called ``perceived negative consequences of British imperial rule ’’.
Praising the British sense of ``fair play ’’ , he claimed that the Indian freedom struggle against colonial rule ``did not entirely reject the British claim to good governance ’’ , rather it ``merely asserted our natural right to self - governance ’’ .
He claimed that the values and institutions of modernity and democracy in India were ``fashioned in the crucible where an age old civilisation met the dominant Empire of the day ’’ .
Manmohan
Singh was not simply trying to please his hosts : these are views he has expressed at home in India too .
Addressing a District Collectors ’ Conference in Delhi in the same year , he had declared that the British Empire was ``an act of enterprise , adventure , creativity ’’ .

What makes it necessary for an Indian prime minister to turn the infamy of two centuries of colonial exploitation and brutal domination – the racism , the massacres of thousands of freedom fighters , the devastation of Indian agriculture that resulted in terrible famines – into a feat of ``adventure and enterprise ’’ ?
The Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano has remarked that , ``To turn infamies into feats , the memory of the North is divorced from the memory of the South , accumulation is detached from despoliation , opulence has nothing to do with plunder .
Broken memory leads us to believe that wealth is innocent of poverty ... amnesia that makes history repeat itself , repeat itself as nightmare .
Amnesia implies impunity , and impunity encourages crime . ’’
` Green Revolution ’ ; nuclear deal
Manmohan Singh ’s myth of the benefits which followed when Indian civilisation ``met ’’ the ``dominant Empire of the day ’’ is an act of amnesia which the Indian ruling class needs as it ``meets ’’ the dominant empire of today – the USA .
In the US visit that followed on the heels of his Oxford speech , Manmohan Singh laid the foundations for the Indo - US nuclear deal , which under cover of exemptions from norms to regulate nuclear proliferation , will essentially tie India ’s diplomatic relations , foreign policy , as well as its domestic energy policy , to US diktats .
Interestingly , during the same visit , Manmohan Singh also announced the launch of a ``second generation of India - US collaboration in agriculture ’’ .
Much in the same manner as he had praised the generosity of British colonialism , he claimed that India ’s first Green Revolution in the 1960s , which according to him ``lifted countless millions above poverty ’’ , were thanks to the ``agricultural universities you ( America ) helped establish ’’ .
Quite a joke , given the revelation that Henry Kissinger , US Secretary of State in 1971 , had said that `` What Indians need is a mass famine ’’!
The first Green Revolution is now reaping its harvest of famine and suicides in India , in the very Indian states like Punjab and Maharashtra which were the Green Revolution showpieces – and the second ``green revolution ’’ is further preparing to enslave Indian peasants to US multinational corporations .
Manmohan Singh was finance minister in the early 1990s , and is credited with ushering in the policies of liberalisation .
Those policies today have reduced India to the same levels of hunger that India last experienced during the colonial Raj - era famines .
No doubt India ’s rulers are happy to be providing the same standards of ``good governance ’’ as their colonial forbears !
In his conversation with Bush during the 2005 US visit , Manmohan Singh also rued the fact that domestic opposition was placing hurdles in the path of the Indo - US nuke deal .
On the question of economic policy , too , Manmohan Singh lamented the Indian handicap of ``democracy ’’ which has slowed the pace of structural adjustment , assuring Bush , however , that ``reforms ’’ were ``durable and irreversible ’’ .
India joins US campaign against Iran
Increasingly , the Manmohan regime began to appease the USA by echoing the latter ’s ``concern ’’ ( in other words , endorsing the threats ) regarding Iran ’s nuclear program .
The UPA government is supposed to be committed to a project of procuring natural gas through a pipeline from Iran ; but on occasion after occasion when Iran is threatened and bullied by the US , India ’s government has chosen to help the US camp to corner and coerce Iran , rather than opposing Washington ’s moves to extend its Iraq war to Iran .
On two separate occasions , India has done a volte face in its foreign policy direction , and has voted against Iran at the IAEA .
For all Manmohan Singh ’s assurances that India is ``not a client state ’’ , it is transparently obvious that the Indo - US nuclear deal has been the instrument that has eroded India ’s sovereignty and has bent India ’s foreign policy in the direction desired and dictated by the US .
In May 2006 , eight prominent US senators , including both Republicans and Democrats , sent a letter ( in the context of the Indo - US nuke deal ) to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh calling on India to ``sever ’’ military ties with Iran and ``terminate ’’ all cooperation with Iran in the energy sector .
The letter declared : `` It is difficult for us to fathom why India , a democracy engaged in its own struggle against terrorism , would want to enhance security cooperation with a repressive government widely regarded as the world ’s most active state sponsor of terrorism . ’’
The letter objected to ``the exchange of visits between high - level [ Indian ] officials , enhanced military ties , and negotiations of agreements to establish closer economic relations ’’ with Iran .
It demanded that India ``publicly declare your intent to refrain from further cooperation with Iran ’’ .
The US senators , of course , failed to see that the Indian people cannot fathom why their government is drawing their nation into the embrace of the world ’s foremost sponsor of colonial occupation , racist Islamophobia , repression , war and terrorism !
The Hyde Act passed by the US Congress in December 2006 , the enabling legislation for the Indo - US nuclear deal , further spelt out the Indian obligation to help the US contain Iran .
In Section 105 of the Act , the US president is called upon to submit a ``written determination that …
India is fully and actively participating in United States and international efforts to dissuade , sanction , and contain Iran for its nuclear program consistent with United Nations Security Council resolutions ’’ .
The Bush visit to India in March 2006 marked another watershed in the changing contours of India ’s foreign and domestic policy .
Bush in India had proclaimed , and India ’s ruling establishment agreed , that the Indo - US nuclear deal would provide India with ``clean energy ’’ to meet the growing electricity needs of India in order to match its economic growth .
The fact , however , is that the US itself meets only some 20 % of its energy requirements from this source and in India even the ambitious official estimates are unable to claim that nuclear energy from the deal will be able to provide more than a small fraction of India ’s energy needs .
There is only one gainer from the Indo - US nuclear deal : the crisis - ridden nuclear power industry in the US and other industrialised countries , which will now find a ready market for their products in India .
Soon after the deal was mooted , US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice wrote in a leading US daily that India is going to import about 12 nuclear reactors in the next few years , and even if just two of these orders come to the United States , that will mean a lot in terms of profits and jobs .
`McCurry ’
In his speech at the Purana Qila ( the Old Fort ) in Delhi , Bush claimed that India and Pakistan were now better off because they have developed closer relations with the US and therefore urged India ``to continue to lift its caps on foreign investment , to make its rules and regulations more transparent , and to continue to lower its tariffs and open its markets to American agricultural products , industrial goods and services ’’.
``Americans who come to this country will see Indian consumers buying McCurry Meals from McDonald ’s , home appliances from Whirpool ’’ – Bush enthused – ``they will see Indian businesses buying American products like the 68 planes that Air India recently ordered from Boeing ’’ .
He also called upon India as a ``strategic ally ’’ of the US , to help carry freedom and democracy to ``the darkest corners of the earth ’’ ( regime changes in Iran , Venezuela etc . ? ) .
Not long after Bush ’s promotion of the business interests of US corporations on Indian soil , then US ambassador David Mulford spelt out the quid pro quo for the nuclear deal : `` There is an expectation among US companies , the public and the political class that we have helped India , and that the US companies should get a favourable treatment ’’ , Mulford ’s remarks came in the context of an exhibition in Bangalore by the world ’s top aeronautics companies that are exploring partnerships with local firms and lobbying defence officials .
Executives from 52 US companies ( more than ever before ) attended the event .
The Bush regime ’s National Security Strategy ( NSS ) released on March 16 , 2006 reiterated India ’s role in the US strategic game plan .
While admonishing China ’s leaders for ``holding on to old ways of thinking and acting that exacerbate concerns throughout the region and the world ’’ , the document went on to note that ``South and Central Asia is a region of great strategic importance where American interests and values are engaged as never before .
We have made great strides in transforming America ’s relationship with India … India now is poised to shoulder global obligations in cooperation with the United States in a way befitting a major power . ’’
Of course , Pakistan will continue to be a favoured ally of the US : its impeccable 60 - year track record of steadfast allegiance , its location on the border of Afghanistan and many other factors ensure that it will retain a very important place in the US scheme .
But with respect to size of market , economic growth rate and political stability , the US finds India a far better candidate as the number one US partner in the subcontinent .
While Pakistan remains a hotbed of so - called ``Islamic terrorism ’’ , which the US demonises , Hindu fundamentalism and communalism in India are regarded as much less of a problem in Washington , if not actually helpful in fighting ``political Islam ’’!
Left allies refuse to withdraw support
India has not as yet been able to complete the formalities that would bring the Indo - US nuclear deal into effect .
The pace has been slowed by the opposition of the UPA government ’s left allies , mainly the CPI and the CPI ( M ) .
Unfortunately , these left allies have kept their opposition within self - proscribed limits , and have made it clear that despite repeated threats , they will not withdraw support to the UPA government on account of the nuclear deal .
While the CPI and CPI ( M ) have kept up a facade of guarded opposition , the UPA government has gone ahead with the task of framing modalities with the IAEA .
Whether the nuclear deal comes into being or is stranded indefinitely remains to be seen .
But the fact will remain that India ’s ruling - class parties are fast proceeding with their plans to ensure India ’s subservience to US imperialism .
Humiliatingly , US undersecretary Nicholas Burns in an interview patronisingly referred to India as ``the country whose nose was pressed against the glass and the great powers of the world would n’t let it in ’’ , as though India were a poor cousin , a waif wistfully gazing at a toy shop , who has been allowed to come in and play as a Christmas gift by Uncle Sam .
In spite of such offensive treatment , the Indian ruling class is continuing to compromise India ’s self - respect and sovereignty by further tying India to US strategic requirements .

Air Force : Nuclear missile crew fell asleep on duty
David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster

The Air Force said Thursday that it plans to punish three officers who fell asleep on July 12 while guarding a classified nuclear launch codes device .
The device contained codes that had been deactivated , but nevertheless their lapse of unconsciousness constituted a ' procedural violation ' -- and one which the Air Force wishes to avoid in the wake of Minot Air Force Base 's 5th Bomb Wing accidentally flying six warheads over the United States last August .
The sleeping officers on July 12 were also from Minot .
" While waiting for permission to bring the device back to base , the three officers with the code component in their possession fell asleep , " reported the Air Force Times .
" The fourth officer was not present .
" When they woke up , the officers reported the incident to their command , said Col. Dewey Ford , a Space Command spokesman .
Representatives from U.S. Strategic Command , Space Command , the 91st Missile Wing at Minot , the 20th Air Force  headquartered at F.E. Warren Air Force Base , Wyo. , and the National Security Agency investigated the incident .
They found that the missile launch codes were not compromised . "
" This does bring a new meaning to the phrase , ' Asleep at the switch , ' " said Barbara Starr , a CNN Pentagon correspondent .

Enlarge By Manuel Balce Ceneta , AP Protestors demonstrate the use of water boarding to volunteer Maboud Ebrahim Zadeh , Nov. 5 , 2007 , in front of the Justice Department in Washington .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The U.S. Justice Department in 2002 told the CIA that its interrogators would be safe from prosecution for violations of anti-torture laws if they believed " in good faith " that harsh techniques used to break prisoners ' will would not cause " prolonged mental harm . "
That heavily censored memo , released Thursday , approved the CIA 's harsh interrogation techniques method by method , but warned that if the circumstances changed , interrogators could be running afoul of anti-torture laws .
The Aug. 1 , 2002 memo signed by then - Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee was issued the same day he wrote a memo for then - White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales defining torture as only those " extreme acts " that cause pain similar in intensity to that caused by death or organ failure .
That memo was never rescinded .
Waterboarding is a form of simulated drowning that critics call torture .
CIA Director Michael Hayden banned waterboarding in 2006 but government officials have said it remains a possibility if approved by the attorney general , the CIA chief and the president .
Secret Bush administration memos authorizing harsh interrogation techniques have been made public starting in 2004 , when the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal revealed detainee mistreatment .
Thursday 's release adds to the growing record of the still secret program launched after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
The new Bybee memo was obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union along with two other previously unreleased documents dealing with the CIA 's interrogation program .
The Bybee memo specifically approved proposed interrogation techniques that were devised for use against al - Qaeda suspects who were resistant to traditional questioning methods .
The standards used to judge how physically rough an interrogation could be are blacked out .
But interrogations that stress a detainee psychologically or emotionally were not allowed to cause " prolonged mental harm . "
That was defined as harm lasting months or even years after the interrogation .
The memo suggests psychiatrists or psychologists should be consulted prior to interrogations to assess the likely mental health effect on the prisoner .
" The healthier the individual , the less likely that the use of any one procedure or set of procedures will result in prolonged mental harm , " the memo states .
The new documents indicate that senior Bush administration officials were aware of the controversial and potentially problematic use of certain interrogation methods , including waterboarding .
In a second memo , dated Jan. 28 , 2003 , then - CIA Director George Tenet authorized CIA officers to interrogate a terror suspect using an " enhanced technique " and ordered a record to be kept of it as the interrogation was happening .
It was not clear whether such a record would be taken via notes , videotape or audiotape , but it was to include the " nature and duration of each such technique employed , the identities of those present " and other factors .
Tenet 's memo also authorized the use of both " enhanced techniques " and " standard techniques , " and said no other methods could be used " unless otherwise approved by headquarters . "
Jameel Jaffer , director of the ACLU 's national security project , said the Tenet document suggests the CIA at least contemplated techniques that went beyond waterboarding .
He said the interrogation records , if released , could be used as evidence by defendants in military tribunals at Guantanamo to prove they were tortured or coerced .
A third document released Thursday is undated but likely was written in 2004 , well after the last confirmed use of waterboarding against a CIA prisoner .
It addresses a planned interrogation , saying that it should go forward only with the clear understanding of all policies pertaining to the treatment of prisoners .
That unsigned memo defends interrogations but warns those authorizing them to be fully aware of the then - emerging international and U.S. legal debate surrounding the issue .
It appears to serve as groundwork to defend the legality of interrogations — including waterboarding — if necessary .
" Intelligence gained using the interrogation techniques has saved Americans lives and property , " the unsigned memo states .
It pointed to the Aug. 2002 Justice Department opinion that concluded " interrogation techniques including the waterboard do not violate the torture statute . "
For several years , the Bush administration relied on the findings in that 2002 opinion to maintain its interrogations did not amount to torture — and therefore had not violated any U.S. or international treaties on how detainees are treated .
However , the one - page undated memo highlights legislation by Sen. Dick Durbin , a Democrat , prohibiting cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment of detainees .
The amendment was approved by the Senate in June 2004 and was part of a 2005 military budget bill that became law in October 2004 .
It also notes a 2004 Supreme Court decision — which found that terror suspects held at Guantanamo Bay could challenge their detention in U.S. courts — that " raises possible concerns about judicial review of the program , and these issues . "
The Bush administration maintains waterboarding was legal when it was used by CIA interrogators in 2002 and 2003 against top al - Qaeda detainees Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , Abu Zubaydah and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri .
CIA Director Hayden said waterboarding was used , in part , because of widespread belief among U.S. intelligence officials that more catastrophic attacks were imminent .

7 . Most over used phrase or expression during E3 season .
8 . You are asked to make suggestions for an E3 survival kit- what three items HAVE to be included ?
9 . What advice would you have for someone who has never experienced E3 ?
10 . Describe what you anticipate from 2007 ’s newly formatted E3 in five words or less .
The plan is to do something similar , only I ’ll be shooting video so you can better get to know the faces behind the games you ’ll be playing over the next year or so .
Looking at this list , I ’m thinking not all of these questions are relevant this year .
So what would * you * ask ?
Keep in mind I ’m asking the same questions to everyone I interview , and that it ’s more focused on the person and the event than the games – I ’ll of course invite you to share your game - specific questions * at* E3 .
So please do n’t post : “ how many multiplayer stages will there be in R2 ? ? ”
I ’ll ask that * next * month .
Oh , and later on tomorrow night , I ’m going to drop by the Hollywood launch of Metal Gear Solid 4 .
Anything you ’d like me to ask David Hayter ( the incredibly gruff voice of Snake ) or any of the producers on hand ?
Speaking of MGS launches , if you end up taking some good pics of yourself in line ( especially if you ’re dressed up like Snake or Eva or Ocelot ) , give us some link love in the comments .
PS if you ’re lining up at the West Hollywood Best Buy , make sure to say hi .
Twenty - five years ago , Radio Shack released the first wildly successful laptop computer in the United States .
The TRS - 80 Model 100 was simple , rugged , plentiful , and reliable , selling over six million units during its eight - year life span .
With ample battery life , light weight ( about 3 pounds ) , compact size , instant - on capability , and a small suite of built - in applications , the Model 100 served as the portable computing workhorse of its day .
Bill Gates ' also ranks it as one of his favorite computers of all time , in large part because he and a friend wrote the firmware it uses .
The Model 100 ( not to be confused with the TRS - 80 Model 1 , one of our 25 greatest PCs of all time ) still inspires an awful lot of admiration .
PC
World chose it as one of the 10 most important laptops of all time .
And even though so many were built that it's not highly valuable , it 's still one of the most collected of vintage computers .
( You can see 18 other digital antique treasures in our slideshow . )
And the Model 100 has not one but two active fan clubs , Club 100 and Bitchin 100 .
Let 's take a look inside this Lilliputian marvel .
Our Story
We grew tired of mediocre marketing companies providing sub -par services .
Our goal is to create the greatest marketing company in the world .
Over the years we ’ve seen it all .
From the rise and fall of marketing companies to huge shifts that destroyed remade industries over night .
We plan on being different , but at a minimum , we ’ll always be a Portland SEO company you can trust .
But among all the failures and success , one common factor emerged :
Motivated teams , who felt like they were doing the work that needed to be done , created the best outcome for their clients .
And the clients who felt like we were serving their interests ended up being the most loyal .
Together we built incredible campaigns that changed lives .
What we saw too often was half - hearted management from lackadaisical workers once the ink on the contract was dry .
We live to fight for our clients .
Every day we get up with the goal of doing the best work we can for you .
And we refuse to give an inch to the competition , the fluctuations of the market , or any little algorithm change .
Things will change , but I can promise you that we will do what we can to keep your business growing .
Researchers believe that gold nanoparticles may breathe new life into once - promising drug candidates , in particular a compound designed to stop the spread of HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ) that was shelved because of side effects .
The compound — TAK - 779 — was first proposed by researchers in 1996 and proved effective at blocking the virus from infiltrating body 's immune system .
But it was scuttled by 2005 , because recipients suffered severe irritation at injection sites and oral doses were ineffective .
Researchers have known for years that ammonium salt molecules in the compound triggered the bad reaction .
But they could not find a benign replacement able to perform its function of binding the drug to T cells , white blood cells that fight infection including HIV .
Given TAK - 779's success , however , Christian Melander , an assistant professor of chemistry at North Carolina State University in Raleigh , says scientists continued to search for a substitute , which they may finally have found .
Melander and colleagues David Margolis , a professor of infectious disease at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , and Daniel Feldheim , an associate professor of analytical and materials chemistry at the University of Colorado at Boulder , reported online in the Journal of the American Chemical Society that gold nanoparticles may be the answer .
Scientists have already established that microscopic particles — including gold and silver — can help ferry chemical compounds from one place to another in lab tests .
Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( M.I.T. ) engineers since 2004 have been studying the potential of gold nanoparticles ( coated with alternating bands of two different kinds of molecules ) in particular to penetrate the protective membranes around cells without damaging them .
But , whereas the M.I.T. scientists are using nanoparticles simply as an agent to assist drug delivery , Melander and his team want nanoparticles to also be an integral part of the drug itself .
Melander says the key was to determine whether gold nanoparticles would , like the ammonium salt , latch onto receptors ( protein molecules embedded in a cell 's membrane ) on the outside of T cells to shield them from HIV .
" It seemed you could take a particle and decorate it with something that would bind to the receptor to block it , " he says .
" Gold is nontoxic , and there 's a great body of literature that shows you how to put a molecule on a gold particle . "
Researchers found during lab tests that attaching 12 molecules of TAK - 779 — modified to exclude ammonium salt molecules — to one gold nanoparticle restored the drug 's ability to prevent HIV infection .
" This was a proof of concept that this will work , " says Melander , who began the project two years ago .
The size of the gold particles — two nanometers ( two billionths of a meter ) in diameter — is comparable to that of the HIV proteins they are trying to block .
This should make them well suited to stop viral proteins from coming in contact with key receptors , says Joseph Wedekind , an associate professor of biochemistry and biophysics in the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry .
The problem is that HIV targets different receptors on T - cells — and researchers only tested their compound on one of them .
Another potential hitch is HIV 's ability to mutate , and thereby become resistant to treatments over time , Melander says .
He notes that the next step will be to do a long - term study on whether HIV could change , eventually rendering the new compound impotent .
Melander and his colleagues are also probing whether gold nanoparticles can be used to deliver an anti-HIV medicine directly to the human brain , where HIV is known to hide , replicate and mutate .
" A lot of drugs can't get into the brain , " he says , " even though the virus can . "
Japan 's tour bus -sized Kibo laboratory module ( right ) is moved into position on the side of the International Space Station during its June 3 , 2008 delivery by STS - 124 astronauts .
Thisstory was updated at 1:39 p.m. EDT .
HOUSTON ? Astronauts aboard the International Space Station ( ISS ) appeared to solve theorbiting lab ?s toilet troubles Wednesday as they prepared to open a newJapanese laboratory for business .
Spacestation flight engineer Oleg Kononenkoreplaced a failed pump in the station ? s Russian - built commode in a fix thatrestored the space toilet ?s ability to collect liquid waste .
? I see airflow right away , ?
Kononenkosaid after activating the system , which uses flowing air in place of gravity to collect waste in weightlessness .
Threeinitial tests of the system appeared to be successful , with Russian engineersgiving the station crew the go ahead to use the repaired toilet for now andreport on its status .
? Okay , let ?s start using it , ?
Russian flight controllers told Kononenko aftertwo and a half hours of work .
Built intothe station ? s Russian Zvezda service module , thespace toilet went on the fritz about 10 days ago .
Station astronauts were ableto make partial repairs , though the fix required extra flush water andtime - consuming overhauls every three uses , mission managers said .
?
It ? sunfortunate that we ?re talking about toilets , but that really is the life and the future of human exploration in space , ? said Kirk Shireman , NASA ?s deputystation program manager , of today ?s space toilet surgery .
Even in space , thesame mundane maintenance jobs found on Earth are required , he added .
NASAmission managers added a last - minutespare pump to Discovery ?s cargo list before the shuttle ?s
May 31 launch so astronauts could try once more to repair the seven - year - old toilet .
They also included extra liquid waste receptacles in case the fix should fail .
? We usethese primarily for research purposes , but we can use those for everyday use ifyou will , ? said Shireman , adding that with Discovery ?s delivery , the stationhas enough bathroom supplies to last until the next Russian cargo shipmentlater this summer .
Commandedby veteran spaceflyer Mark Kelly , Discovery ?s seven - astronaut crew is in themiddle of a 14 - daymission to deliver Japan ?s giant Kibo laboratory , fix the station ? s toiletand swap out one crewmember aboard the orbital outpost .
ChristeningKibo
Latertoday , Discovery astronauts are expected to christen the station ?s new tourbus - sized Kibo laboratory , a $ 1 billion new lab installed during a Tuesday spacewalk .
The spaceflyers willcheck their shuttle ?s heat shield inspection boom , which was retrieved from astorage berth on the ISS during yesterday ?s spacewalk , today to ensure it ?s inworking order .
? We have anew ' hope ' on the International Space Station , ? said astronaut Akihiko Hoshideof the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) after helping install the newKibo lab ( whose name means ? hope ? in Japanese ) on Tuesday .
Hoshide andhis crewmates are scheduled to open the Kibo lab for business today at about4:52 p.m. EDT ( 2052 GMT ) today .
At 37 feet ( 11 meters ) long and 14.4 feet ( 4.4 meters ) wide , Japan ?s
Kibo laboratory isthe largest single room ever launched to the ISS and is only one of threesegments that make up the station ?s entire Japanese space research facility .
Itis designed to host a wide variety of internal and external experiments tostudy fluid physics , materials science and astronomy .
?
We ? reextremely happy to see the Kibo pressurized module attached to its permanentlocation , ?
JAXA ?s deputy Kibo operations project manager Tetsuro Yokoyama saidTuesday .
The 32,000 - pound ( 14,514 - kg )
Kibo module follows an attic - likestorage room , which astronauts delivered to the station in March , andincludes two small windows , an airlock and a robotic arm at one end to accessan external platform slated to launch next year .
A control center in TsukubaSpace Center , just north of Tokyo in Japan , will oversee the Kibo facility fromEarth .
Hoshidetold SPACE.com before Discovery ?s
May 31 launch that he would likelyopen the new module with some sort of speech , though what he planned to say wasstill up in the air .
Yokoyamasaid he expects Japanese station flight controllers and engineers will befairly busy during the module ?s activation today , but there is an air ofanticipation as well .
? We will bewaiting , ?
Yokoyama said .

BOSTON , March 4 ( Reuters ) - Illinois Sen. Barack Obama won the Vermont Democratic contest to pick a U.S. presidential candidate on Tuesday , adding to his lead over rival Hillary Clinton in the race to be the party ’s nominee for the November general election , media projected .
Obama has won a string of state contests over the past month , catapulting him into the lead in the race for delegates to the party ’s nominating contest this summer .
Clinton , the New York senator and former first lady , needs victories in the delegate - rich states of Texas and Ohio on Tuesday in order to catch up , analysts say .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
The head of the Senate 's government affairs committee Wednesday unveiled a series of restrictive proposals aimed at financial speculators in commodities , including one that would place an outright ban on big pension funds buying agricultural and energy futures .
The three legislative ideas from Connecticut 's Joe Lieberman , which the independent senator plans to discuss at a hearing June 24 , count as the most drastic efforts yet from lawmakers targeting potential culprits behind high oil and grain prices .
The most severe would prohibit private and public pension funds with more than $ 500 million in assets from investing in agricultural and energy commodities traded on a U.S. futures exchange , foreign exchange or over the counter , according to materials provided by Lieberman 's office .
A second plan would direct the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to establish total limits on the share of the commodity market held by financial investors .
A third proposal would direct the futures regulator to impose speculative - position limits on any stakes not related to real hedging activities , an action that could limit the commodities - swaps activities of big investment banks such as Goldman Sachs Group GS , - 1.14 % and Morgan Stanley MS , - 2.35 % .
" We are not , as some continue to argue , witnessing the ebb and flow of natural market forces at work .
We are instead seeing excessive market speculation at work and that is why our government must step in with new laws to protect our economy and our consumers , " said Lieberman in a statement .
Lieberman will most likely introduce legislation with Sen. Susan Collins , R - Maine , after the July 4 holiday recess , said a staff representative of Lieberman .
That legislation could incorporate some or all of these proposals , depending on feedback from witnesses at the hearing , as well as the public .
Investment banks and pension funds are n't waiting for that forum to make their anxiety about Lieberman 's proposals known .
A statement penned by six influential trade groups , including the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association , the Financial Services Roundtable and the Investment Company Institute , warned that efforts to bar financial investors from commodities markets could " substantially harm the ability of Americans to protect themselves against inflation . "
" Blaming speculation or any specific trading practice for rising or falling commodity and energy prices without real evidence of wrongdoing is misguided , " said the statement .
" Those kinds of charges create the very real possibility that speculators will choose to abandon these markets and use their investment dollars elsewhere , " and such an exodus threatens the healthy functioning of the markets , it said .
The CFTC , under pressure from Congress to show it is working to rein in excess speculation in commodities markets , said Tuesday that it was closing the " London loophole " by making London traders of the benchmark U.S. oil contract follow the same speculative - position limits as their U.S. counterparts .
See earlier story .
Despite analysis from the futures watchdog that there 's little correlation between high commodities prices and the recent wave of financial investing , many big users of energy and grain markets argue that supply and demand can't be the only reason for the commodities boom .
They 've called for more regulation of financial investments in commodities .
Yo , Western Europe !
Holla !
How are you ?
Is n’t it great how frequently we get to see one another these days , because the dollar is so weak and you keep coming to visit ?
It ’s so helpful that you ’re here to buy up all of those luxury things we ca n’t afford .
Someone has to wear those Armani bathing suits , right ?
And we ’re certainly not fitting into them these days .
Ha-ha !
Can we borrow some oil ?
Just kidding .
Did we just make things awkward ?
What we really wanted to talk about was Barack Obama .
We ’re still trying to decide between him and John McCain over here .
We know , we know , you hate George Bush and you are afraid McCain will be the same — but we have a lot of thinking to do .
Like , a few months ’ worth .
We ’ve begun reading stories over the past few days , since Obama secured the Democratic nomination , about how much you ’d like the Illinois senator to be our next president .
The Times of London said you were all for him , and that it was “ unfortunate ” that you got no vote .
In Spain , El Pais has been running an adorable photo series of the handsome candidate .
In Belgium , Le Soir ’s American - politics Website boasted that 74 percent of the country supports Obama ( over a measly 12 percent for McCain ) .
That ’s a lot of support !
But you know what would really help your candidate get elected ?
If you shut the hell up .
The Americans who would listen to the advice of Western Europe are the ones who listen to the BBC feed on NPR in the morning for their international news and opinion — in other words , the people who are already going to vote for Obama .
The people who he is trying to win over at this very moment , as he campaigns in the red states , are the ones who will view a European endorsement as a total minus .
Remember when there was a movement to rename French Fries “ Freedom Fries ” over here ?
Yeah , it ’s those people who will be alienated by your support .
Frankly , they think you ’re a bunch of Socialist sissies .
We ’re not saying they ’re right .
But you guys , who are always slightly smug about your understanding of our politics , have clearly missed out on the nuance here .
A true endorsement of Barack Obama from you would be no endorsement at all .
We know we totally butted in that time in Finland , so we ’re total hypocrites .
But what can we say , we ’re Americans .
Anyway , toodles !
See you at Century 21 !
Barack Obama Would Win Big —
In Europe [ WSJ ]
The HuffPo :
This is the week that should have effectively ended John McCain ’s efforts to become the next president of the United States .
But you would n’t know it if you watched any of the mainstream media outlets or followed political reporting in the major newspapers .
During this past week : McCain called the most important entitlement program in the U.S. a disgrace , his top economic adviser called the American people whiners , McCain released an economic plan that no one thought was serious , he flip flopped on Iraq , joked about the deaths of Iranian citizens , and denied making comments that he clearly made — TWICE .
All this and it is not even Friday !
Yet watching and reading the mainstream press you would think McCain was having a pretty decent political week , I mean at least Jesse Jackson did n’t say anything about him .
And that is n’t even all of it .
Here is Carly Fiorina caught dead to rights trying to lie about McCain ’s position on issues important to women , here is McCain flubbing a reporter ’s question about Fiorina ’s comments ( video of the tragic encounter found here ) , and as a Steeler fan , my personal favorite McCain moment :
And then McCain told a rather moving story about his time as a P.O.W .
“ When I was first interrogated and really had to give some information because of the pressures , physical pressures on me , I named the starting lineup , defensive line of the Pittsburgh Steelers as my squadron mates . ”
“ Did you really ? ” asked the reporter .
“ Yes , ” McCain said .
“ In your POW camp ? ” asked the reporter .
“ Yes , ” McCain said .
“ Could you do it today ? ” asked the reporter .
“ No , unfortunately , ” McCain said .
Here ’s one reason he likely could n’t do it today — the Steelers are n’t the team whose defensive line McCain named for his Vietnamese tormentors .
The Green Bay Packers are .
At least according to every previous time McCain has told this story .
And the McCain campaign just told ABC News that the senator made a mistake — it was , indeed , the Packers .
Liar .
What is most amazing about all this is that he keeps getting away with it , and the media refuses to hold him responsible for the things he says .
Imagine if Obama had done all these things this week - they would be doing post - mortems on the failed Obama candidacy on the Sunday shows .
Compare the reaction to the whiners comment and the Obama bitter remarks .
Those seats on the new Straight Talk Express must be really hard to earn .
Two quick side notes .
I do n’t want to be unfair , but it is my general impression that Carly Fiorina ’s crowning achievement in business is to destroy the reputation of Hewlett - Packard .
I would n’t even consider buying one , and have n’t for years .
Am I wrong about this impression ?
If not , why on earth is she considered such an asset for McCain ?
Second , I know I have turned fiercely partisan for the Democrats recently , but I honestly do not remember McCain being this bad .
I never much cared for him and , in fact , supported Bush over McCain in 2000 ( awesome judgment there , I might add ) , but I do n’t remember him being this bad .
Am I imagining things ?
Or is he far worse a candidate and aperson than he was ten years ago ?
Lehman executives gathered at the bank ’s Manhattan headquarters over the weekend , fueling speculation that the bank might try to raise capital from investors or even seek a buyer .
A Lehman spokeswoman declined to comment .
Lehman , which for months had assured investors that it was managing its risks well , said last week that the loss reflected $ 4.1 billion in write - downs of its investments .
Goldman Sachs is scheduled to report results on Tuesday , followed by Morgan Stanley on Wednesday .
Bank of America , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch release results in July .
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are expected to have fared better than Lehman did in the latest quarter .
They are more diversified than Lehman , which has traditionally focused on fixed income .
And the two banks ’ commodities traders may have profited handsomely in recent months as the prices for oil and foodstuffs have soared .
Even so , many investors are anxious to see whether Goldman , which made money last year even as many of its rivals lost big , has continued to dodge trouble .
The latest round of results is likely to draw special scrutiny because Wall Street firms are disclosing capital levels under new international banking standards known as Basel II .
And Merrill Lynch , Citigroup and UBS are also expected to suffer from the ratings downgrades recently issued for MBIA and Ambac , two bond reinsurers .
The more that banks take write - downs , the more they are , in a sense , shredding through the record profits they made when times were good .
Citigroup , for example , has written down its mortgage and other loan investments by $ 37.3 billion or a full half of the handsome profits the global giant pulled in during the boom years .
Merrill Lynch , much smaller in size , has taken write - downs of $ 32.6 billion  or a whopping 153 percent of its profits from 2004 through last summer .
Even if Merrill is given credit for the money it earned in the past year , the bank still had write - downs that translated into losses of $ 14 billion , and that is two - thirds of its profits in those three and a half years that ended with a pop last July .
These games will make you rip your own heart out as a sacrifice to the gaming gods .
Ninja Gaiden -
Many early games were difficult because their controls were about as functional as a typist who enjoys wearing boxing gloves to the office .
Ninja Gaiden had its share of control issues too - like the fact that trying to jump backwards moves you a whole half of a centimeter in that direction , or that you can't just climb straight up walls , but instead have to go through an annoying process of jumping back and forth as if Ryu 's childhood dream was to be the star of Pong .
What really makes Ninja Gaiden hard as hell are the re-spawning enemies who repeatedly show up in the same critical spots over and over .
What 's worse is that the game knows when you 're most likely to be in the air , like around items or ( my personal favorite ) on the other side of a chasm .
Now that 's asshole style .
And this game is the very reason that I now hate bats , because those little fuckers would reappear within 2 seconds of the previous one 's death ... and then proceed to fly straight into my face , knocking me backwards into a pit .
Dead .
Ahh , the joys of Ninja Gaiden .
Bart vs the Space Mutants - Now I was n't sure if this was the type of game that was hard just because I played it as a stupid little kid , or if it is legitimately a difficult game . , so I just tried my hand at it again , as an adult ( questionably ) .
Shit ... fuck this game .
Who the hell designs a game where the jump button is SAME BUTTON you need to hold down to run ?
What the fuck is that ?
Bart has two lives in this damn game , and two hits kills him .
If this was Super Mario Bros , I 'd say , " fine , no problem . "
But no , this is the maneuver - your - ass - around - all - kinds - of - shit - that - can - maim - you game ... and your controls feel like they just came out of a penguin 's ass .
I do n't even know what that means , but I assure you , that 's what it feels like .
You will die quickly in this game , believe me .
Battletoads -
It 's not so much that Battletoads was a hard game , but that it had one level - level 3 : the rat rocket level - that was FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE .
I have never even heard of someone finishing that course without cheating .
It starts out simple enough ; dodging walls with pleeenty of advanced notice .
That increases in intensity until Rare decided it'd be funny to start throwing these stupid little speeder bots at you , and then make you complete a series of jumps that would make Carl Lewis shit his pants .
After that , you are treated to the let 's - see - who - can - react - in - less - than - a - millisecond - about - twenty - times game , where wall after wall is slapped in your face , invariably smushing your stupid amphibious friend time after time after time .
In a strange display of mercy , they put a warp in front of ... oh , I dunno , the eighth wall or so ... knowing that eventually that one would 've smacked the shit out of you , too .
Thanks for that , Rare ... and for the five whole lives I already lost about ten minutes ago , before using the save and reload buttons on my emulator .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Resales of U.S. single - family homes and condos fell 2.6 % in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.86 million , the lowest level in 10 years , the National Association of Realtors reported Thursday .
Resales have sunk 15.5 % in the past year and are down about 33 % from the peak in 2005 .
The pace of sales has been relatively stable since last August at around a 5 million annual pace .
Read the full release .
Economists surveyed by MarketWatch expected sales to fall to 4.95 million .
See Economic Calendar .
The median sales price fell 6.l % in the past year to $ 215,100 .
The inventory of unsold homes on the market rose 0.2 % to 4.49 million , an 11.1 - month supply at the current sales pace , the second - highest inventory level since the mid-1980s .
In a separate report , the Census Bureau said about 6.1 million housing units are vacant and available either to rent or buy .
About 10 % of the homes built for sale in this decade are vacant , while more than 25 % of rental units built in this decade are vacant , the report said .
" We are faced with a considerable excess of housing units that is only likely to worsen over coming quarters , and for which there is no quick solution , " wrote Richard Moody , chief economist for Mission Residential .
In the Realtors report , sales of single - family homes fell 3.2 % to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.27 million , the lowest since January 1998 .
Sales of condos rose 1.7 % to an annual rate of 590,000 , the highest since November .
About a third of sales are distressed sales , either foreclosures or short sales , in which homeowners accept less than they owe on the house , with the lender taking the loss .
Many foreclosures are n't included in the data at all because they are not sold through the Realtors ' multiple - listing service .
On Wednesday , the House approved sweeping legislation designed to help the housing market , including back - stop support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , help for homeowners to refinance high - rate loans , and a $ 7,500 tax credit for first - time home buyers .
See full story .
The legislation could help the housing market to recover , said Lawrence Yun , chief economist for the real estate trade group .
About 3 million home buyers could take advantage of the tax credit for first - time home buyers before it expires next July , he said .
Resales fell 6.6 % in the Northeast , fell 3.4 % in the Midwest , fell 3.1 % in the South and rose 1 % in the West .
Sales are increasing in areas that have seen the largest declines in prices , Yun said , including Riverside and Sacramento , Calif. , Orlando , Fla. , and Phoenix , Ariz .
Sales are dropping in once - healthy areas , such as Atlanta , Ga. , Dallas , Texas , and Charlotte , N.C .
In a separate report , the Census Bureau said the homeownership rate rose in the second quarter to 68.1 % , not statistically different from the 67.8 % in the first quarter .
The vacancy rate for rental and owner - occupied units declined in the second quarter , but was not statistically different from the first quarter .
Of 40 million rental units , 10 % are vacant , down from 10.1 % in the first quarter and up from 9.5 % a year ago .
For the 78 million units typically occupied by owners , the vacancy rate fell from a record 2.9 % in the first quarter to 2.8 % in the second quarter .
Three years ago , the homeowner vacancy rate was 1.8 % .
About 2.2 million vacant homes are for sale , the government said .
While 2.1 million units were added to the housing stock since last year , 1.26 million more units are vacant , the government said .

Recent satellite observations have detected a thinning of parts of the Greenland ice sheet at lower elevations .
A partial melting of this ice sheet would cause a 1 - meter ( 3 - foot ) rise .
If melted completely , the Greenland ice sheet contains enough water to raise sea level by 5 - 7 meters ( 16 - 23 feet ) .
This visualization shows the effect on coastal regions for each meter of sea level rise , up to 6 meters ( 19.7 feet ) .
Land that would be covered in water is shaded red .

" the first actually intelligent , respectful discussion " Well , Steward may be funny , but this is absolutely week !
He gives Feith far too much leeway .
Did he drink cool aid before the broadcast or is he simply unprepared and only claims to have read the book ?
Now that it is too late , one suggestion :
Amazon search for " curveball " brings up three hits , one from the index , one from Back Matter ( very interesting ) and this : 1 . on Page 489 :
" ... an Iraqi defector code - named " Curveball " misled the CIA about Saddam 's biological weapons program .
CIA officials had relied heavily on this defector before the war , even ... "
SORRY , NO !!
The Cia was informed by the German secret service that " curveball " was n't trustworthy .
So , no , the CIA can't have been mislead .
Further the contents tells us that this only appears in lessons and debate , so we can assume that nothing interesting is in the actual Iraq chapters ?
Interestingly this is on the back .
2 . from Back Matter :
" ... War : Colin Powell presented the U.N. with details on mobile germ factories , which came from a now - discredited source known as ` Curveball , - Los Angeles Times , March 28 , 2004 , p. Al. 489 " not an explanation for his fabrications " : SSCI Report on the Chalabi ... "
How about the students paper ?
Niger , Yellow Cake ..
The myth about the CIA misjudged matters .
Seems I change my mind about Steward .
But it sure was better for his career .

Stewart missed a big opportunity when Feith said he had gathered the info from letters , correspondence from Rumsfeld , Rice , etc .
Since the White House says all of that shit is missing and or destroyed , then how did Feith get ahold of that stuff ?

Intelligent and respectful discussion ?
More like bush - co propaganda hour with Feith & Stewart .
I an at a loss to understand why Stewart would give Feith so much air time to spin his lies , or why he would even have the warmonger on the Daily Show at all .
Does Stewart also have dual US - Israeli citizenship , like Feith ?

Not to dis Stewart , he is a great comedian , but this is soooooo yesterday .
The NEWS is supposed to be what is NEW , not what is old stagnant discourse brad bloggers talked about years ago !
The MSM is the main propaganda arm of the neoFascist military oil complex .
Even that is old news information .
The NEWS is we are going to have a president who knows what is going on , and it is not McFeith McFeign McCain , nd it is going to be in less than a year .
YIPPIE !!
And from the looks of it , a greater majority in the House and Senate .
" Send the GOP pigs back to wallow in their mire " is the slogan of ' 08 !!!
Good riddance .

This is an example of NEWS :

As is her wont , Dana has refused to call on me .

Hey guys !
Come on !!
If you invite someone on to your show only to rip into him on - air , how many other guests do you think you 'd get to agree to be on your show whose opinions you do n't share ?
You'd be just like BillO .
Invite 'em on , and then yell at them and tell them to " shut up ! "
Understanding how Feith actually thinks provides valuable insight into at least one part of the whole run-up to the invasion .
Listen to his argument carefully .
Integrate his position into your own thinking .
And then use that insight to address future extremist right - wing fringe - types .
If we are ever to make a serious commitment to peace , it must start within each and every one of us .
There is a time to butt heads , and that is up front , before the shit hits the fan , not five years afterwards .
Attacking Feith will accomplish nothing , prevent nothing .
Except make progressives look like the other side of the coin of right - wing mouthpieces like BillO and Hannity and Coulter .
I have an area to suggest that genuinely needs some public clarification right now .
All those white , working - class guys who think Obama is an evildoer out to ruin America because his middle name is Hussein and he attended a madrassa in Indonesia while he was a child .
The campaign that Fox Pseudo - News took up to raise Obama 's " negatives " has had a great deal of success .
We need to undo that .
Or another area would be this Thor dude who 's traveling all over the country pushing for regulations that will prevent people from voting for Obama .
That is something that can still theoretically be stopped , or at least stalled , or lessened .
But Feith ?
He is pathetic .
He is a testament to what happens when someone who 's not very bright from our privileged class has access to an ivy - league education and then finds himself in a position of power and influence .
He 's not just not the sharpest knife in the drawer .
He 's so dull that everything he attempts to slice through gets squashed and ruined .
He will never again be in a position like he was .
Even his students at GWU say that they take his class out of curiosity , that they can hardly believe he thinks the things he does .

Thank Christ for Jon Stewart & The Daily Show .
His writers are consistently informed & irreverent & he is funny as hell .
But he can also , as here , be smooth & sly , using his considerable charm to put guests like Feith at ease & getting them to open up to him .
Who else can you name these days who 's able to do that ?
Colbert is great , but Stewart 's show allows him the room to take off the comedian's hat sometimes & sink his teeth into an issue .
Or a person , as the case may be .
He 's so good at it , too .
He can draw a little metaphorical blood before his victim / guest even knows they 've been bitten .
And it 's not just for the comedy , obviously .
In the guise of comedy sketches he & his crew have managed to poke their pointed little satiric fingers into plenty of sore spots that the rest of the msm have pretty much ignored .
Aww man , do n't say that Stewart drinks the kool - aid .
That would be soo fucking sad !
If he did , could he have gone on Crossfire and said what he did ?
Looking pretty uncomfortable towards the end , too , and ending with telling Tucker Carlson that he was " as big a dick on [ his ] own show as he is on every other show " ?
.......... Nah .
I went to youtube & watched that Stewart on Crossfire clip again .
I swear , if I met the man personally , I 'd shake his hand & thank him for having the guts .
I tried to add a link but I 've gotten rusty in my old age .
If you go to youtube , it 's there .
Definitely worth a look .

Linda and Joan , Like people in America do n't know that D. Feith of our Monsters fucked up BIG TIME 6 years ago and the MSM propaganda arm of the military oil complex has been scrubbing the hell out of their ass each time they change McFeith and crew 's diapers these daze ???
I know Jon and crew could be wonderful about the 100 years war ( a 100 years and more ago ) too , but is he not allowed to talk about NEWS ??
Why must it be about OLDS before we grab it ?
The future has millions and millions of deaths in it .
Even some whole nations are going to go down .
The death - humor thingy could have some skits that would wake people up .
HA HA HA I never thought about a nation being put to death .

Jesus , Dredd .
I agree that it 's time for war crimes trials ... long PAST time , if you ask me .
But you do n't think they 've done skits that might wake people up ?
Heartily disagree , my friend .
Unfortunately , there are plenty of people who still have never heard of Douglas Feith & his bloody little Office of Special Plans .
And without humor , Christ , we might as well all just take the cyanide pill .
I 'm not quite ready to do that .
Nothing would make me happier than to see these bastards in jail , despite the sad fact that ( oh , heaven forfend ) they might daily be subjected to the kinds of barbarities they 've inflicted on god knows how many people .
Until then , I ( tentatively ) admire people like Stewart & Olbermann who dare to use what means they have -- humor included -- to speak as much ' truth to power ' as they can .
' Tentatively ' because who the hell knows .
Both of them may be on the white house payroll as moles for all I know .
THAT would be fucking depressing , but after I escape to Canada I reserve the right to laugh , goddammit !

I just think that Dredd and the other bloggers in this thread who are angry at Jon for not skewering Feith 's stupid little ass are reflective of the frustration and anger those of us who actually know what 's going on are feeling .
We feel culpable , and those feelings of culpability have to go somewhere .
Keep writing , keep talking , keep voting , keep speaking out , and get on your representatives ' asses .
It 's THEIR DUTY to provide a check on the executive branch 's power and to represent the people , and not the corporations and their lobbyists .
If there 's anyone we should be PO 'ed at , it 's our Congress .

Dredd~ Great GEORGE BERNARD SHAW quote : " If you 're going to tell a man the truth , you better make it funny . "
I would also add that TDS and COLBERT REPORT are SYNDICATED WORLD WIDE ( even picked up on NEWS FEEDS in some remote regions ) ; I could argue that these " fake " comedy news shows are currently our nation 's most CRITICAL EXPORT ( not much to compare it to , I know ) -- but it sure beats BRITTANY and PARIS and FLAG LAPEL PIN DISCUSSIONS as prism insight of the caliber of discourse within a nation at ( illegal , immoral , criminal ) war ...
I believe we are LESS hated by those who would condemn the likes of YOU and ME at the hands of this TREASONOUS administration / perhaps the reason the citizens of countries we claim to be a threat to us can still distinguish between hating the US GOVERNMENT , and not the US , the PEOPLE ...

Feith led the controversial Office of Special Plans ( OSP ) at the Pentagon from September 2002 to June 2003 . [ 45 ]
This now defunct intelligence gathering unit has been accused of manipulating intelligence to bolster support for the 2003 US invasion of Iraq . [ 46 ]
According to The Guardian , " This rightwing intelligence network [ was ] set up in Washington to second - guess the CIA and deliver a justification for toppling Saddam Hussein by force . " [ 47 ]
According to Kwiatkowski , the Office of Special Plans was " a propaganda shop " and she personally " witnessed neoconservative agenda bearers within OSP usurp measured and carefully considered assessments , and through suppression and distortion of intelligence analysis promulgate what were in fact falsehoods to both Congress and the executive office of the president . " [ 48 ] [ 49 ]
Senator Carl Levin , in an official report on the Office of Special Plans , singles Feith out as providing to the White House a large amount of Iraq - Al Qaeda allegations which , post - invasion , turned out to be false . [ 50 ]
Disarmament expert George Perkovich of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace told National Public Radio in 2004 , " By all accounts , things in Iraq have gone very , very badly .
Doug Feith should have been fired a long time ago for incompetence . " [ 51 ]
Yet he still shows up ?
What the fuck is wrong with the tv networks ?

Douglas Feith should have been arrested on an international warrant and should face war crimes , period !

Never shake hands with a war criminal .

Feith has the blood of hundreds of thousands of dead Iraquis and millions more displaced .
Not to mention all those who will die because of the resources that were wasted in the Iraq war and not available for other endeavours .
He should be in prison for life or executed for war crimes , not on television looking and sounding like a " normal person " to those who have not read the history of " fixing the intelligence to the plan . "

I do n’t want to get into a whole song - and - dance about copyright and the merits of the “ fair use ” principle ( for that , you can see this post and related posts ) , but I thought it was interesting to read about the response by cartoonist Jim Davis — creator of the Garfield comic strip and the associated merchandising empire — to a site called Garfield Minus Garfield , where panels from the original strip are posted with the central character removed .
According to the New York Times story about the site , Davis thinks it is fascinating :
“ Davis , the cartoonist who created â€ œGarfield , â€ calls himself an occasional reader of the site , which he calls â€œfascinating .â€ 
He says he is flattered rather than peeved by the imitation .
â€ œSome of them really work , and some of them work better , â€  Mr. Davis said .
In fact , the Times goes on to say that the cartoonist , who has been drawing Garfield for about 30 years , found that the site ( which was created by Dan Walsh of Dublin ) prompted him to take a different look at his body of work .
In a Washington Post piece from a couple of months ago , Davis thanked Walsh for doing what he did .
Obviously , he has become a gazillionaire from Garfield and can afford to be magnanimous , but it ’s still a refreshing response in an age where artists like Prince are sending out C&D letters by the boat - load trying to lock down their content and prevent anyone from altering or using it .

Senator Robert Byrd ( D - WV ) , chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee , awaits the start of a committee meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington May 15 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Sen. Robert Byrd , the oldest member of the U.S. Senate and a fierce opponent of the Iraq war , was taken to a Washington - area hospital for observation on Monday after a caregiver noticed that he was lethargic , a spokesman for the West Virginia Democrat said .
Byrd , 90 , was at work in the Senate earlier in the day and had gone home where his caregiver grew concerned about his condition , spokesman Jesse Jacobs said .
“ She took his temperature and discovered that he had a fever .
It was significant enough that his doctor suggested he go into the hospital for observation , ” Jacobs said .
Byrd was expected to be kept overnight , the spokesman said .
As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee , Byrd has been one of several leading Democrats in Congress trying to bring the Iraq war to an end by tying troop withdrawals to war funds .
Unlike many of his fellow Democrats , Byrd opposed the 2003 U.S. attack on Iraq from the outset .
Byrd was last elected to a six - year term in 2006 .
Democrats hold a narrow majority in the Senate and will try to increase their numbers in November ’s election , when one - third of the 100 Senate seats will be up for grabs .
Byrd first won election to the Senate in 1958 .

Senator Joe Biden joined Keith Olbermann on Tuesday 's Countdown to talk about his foreign policy speech today , in which he knocks away John McCain 's ever - changing rationales for staying in Iraq and his embrace of the failed Iraq policies of George Bush .
Biden notes the ongoing Democratic primary battle between Obama and Clinton , but makes it very clear that Democrats are more than willing to engage him on in a debate about Iraq and national security .
Biden , Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , tells Keith that regardless of how Senator McCain meant his 100 years in Iraq statement , the American people are against it and it sends the wrong message to the people of the Middle East .
Americans do n't want permanent bases in Iraq and as Biden puts it , it feeds into the theory that we 're only there to control their oil :
Producer of O'Reilly Factor ambushes Moyers at conference
" The OReilly Factor " producer Porter Barry attempted to harshly question journalist Bill Moyers about why he refuses to appear on " The OReilly Factor " during this weekend 's National Conference on Media Reform .
In raw footage captured by The Uptake , Barry asks Moyers several times why he wo n't appear on the show and then tells Moyers what he thinks of his work .
" You like to beat up on producers instead of answering questions from tough journalists like Bill O'Reilly , " Barry said .
Moyers responded by questioning O'Reilly 's experience as a reporter and the validity of a news station owned by Rupert Murdoch .
" I want to ask Bill O'Reilly why he looked in the camera and said anybody who spoke against the invasion was a bad American , " Moyers said .

At a small airport in the northern Alberta town of Fort McMurray , a rickety , single - engine Cessna hurtles off the ground with a roar .
Dr. John O’Connor ignores the shuddering fuselage , the tail wiggle , the steep climb above the spruce trees at the end of the runway .
For O’Connor , a bush doctor who has tended to some of Canada ’s most remote Native American communities for more than a decade , this October morning is the start of a routine commute .
In his fleece vest and green fedora , the small , middle - aged Irishman looks simultaneously rugged and elfin .
A plastic tray of fruit salad vibrates beneath his seat , a gift for locals who are used to subsisting on moose , pickerel , and muskrat .
Outside , a carpet of boreal forest unfurls at the southern edge of town .
Our plane flies past suburban subdivisions , freshly paved culs - de-sac , and what O’Connor says is the largest trailer park in North America .
As we head north , tracking the steep banks of the Athabasca River , the forest returns .
And then the trees quickly vanish , along with everything else , into miles and miles of rolling hills of sand .
“ The sand blows around like you would n’t believe , ” O’Connor shouts over the propeller buzz .
“ Drive from Fort McMurray , and you will encounter what looks like a sandstorm . ”
Below , some 2 billion tons of soil and rock — ” overburden , ” as the oil industry politely calls it — have been stripped away to reveal deposits of hydrocarbon - laced sandstone known as tar sands .
Trucks that can carry up to 400 tons lumber across the subarctic expanse , hauling the oily muck out of terraced pits to “ crushers ” located in massive processing facilities .
The tar sands began forming 350 million years ago , when a prehistoric ocean deposited a layer of organic materials that was gradually cooked into a huge underground pool of light sweet crude beneath what became Alberta .
Erosion made way for microorganisms that invaded the oil , forming a thick tar sandwiched between the forest above and the groundwater and limestone beneath .
Along the banks of the Athabasca River , the black goop sometimes seeps through the sand as if Jed Clampett just made another lucky strike .
Underlying an area the size of Florida , Canada ’s tar sands ( also known as oil sands ) contain as much as 173 billion barrels of recoverable oil — more than the United Arab Emirates , Qatar , and Russia put together .
Only Saudi Arabia possesses larger oil reserves .
But removing oil from the sands , which involves injecting them with steam or digging them up and pumping in vast quantities of water to heat them , has always been astronomically expensive — until now .
As American politicians talk about weaning us from Middle Eastern crude and the price of oil has skyrocketed , the tar sands have become a viable source of foreign fossil fuel .
Canada is now the United States ’ top oil supplier , selling us more than the Saudis .
Not since Texas wildcatters hit black gold 80 years ago has North America seen such a frantic rush for oil .
Over the next five years , investment in the Alberta tar sands is expected to exceed $ 75 billion ; oil production is set to increase by 160 percent by 2015 .
Alberta ’s 59 tar sands sites now form the single largest industrial zone in the world .
If it is fully developed , the result could be up to 54,000 square miles of man-made wasteland .
Digging up the tar sands is a dirty , wasteful business .
Yet in their desperate scramble to cash in , the provincial government and the oil companies have downplayed the environmental risks .
The boom is a major reason Canada will likely miss its carbon targets under the Kyoto Protocol .
Converting tar sand into gasoline emits up to three times the greenhouse gases as drilling and refining conventional oil .
The extraction process consumes roughly twice the energy of producing conventional oil ( in total , enough energy to heat a tenth of Canadian homes ) .
And there are growing questions about the mines , which have transformed once - sleepy northern Alberta into an industrial frontier , and their health effects on wildlife and people .
O’Connor is under investigation for expressing his concerns , accused by the national health system of raising “ undue alarm . ”
As we cross the Athabasca River , I spot the belly of our plane reflected in a shimmering reservoir of oil waste — two gallons for each gallon of oil produced .
Scarecrows dressed in old mining uniforms bob on top of the gunk to discourage birds from landing and drowning in it .
The oil industry consumes some 15 percent of the Athabasca River ’s winter flow — enough to supply a city of 2 million .
Tailings ponds such as this one , owned by Suncor Energy , are required by Albertan law to keep waste out of groundwater .
Yet the law allows some 1.5 million gallons of slurry containing arsenic and mercury to leach daily from the reservoir into an underground aquifer ; some of it drains into the river .
Following the river ’s northward course , our plane threads the white steam coming from the smokestacks of Suncor ’s “ cracker , ” the smell of petroleum and sulfur permeating the cabin .
Below , the cracker is heating bitumen — the “ tar ” in tar sands — to 900 degrees Fahrenheit and turning it into synthetic crude oil before it will be piped to special refineries in the United States to be made into gasoline .
A patchwork of more pits unfurls for miles ahead .
We fly over Syncrude , partly owned by an ExxonMobil subsidiary , then Albian Sands , a division of Shell .
The giant mines give way to fresh clearings where Chevron Canadian Natural Resources Limited and Petro - Canada are just starting to dig .
ConocoPhillips and the Exxon subsidiary Imperial Oil have staked additional claims in the area .
Finally , the last tentacles of mining roads give way to pristine forest .
The river debouches into Lake Athabasca , and we descend toward Fort Chipewyan , a tiny trading outpost that clings to the rocky shore .
In summer , once the ice road melts into an impassable bog , the only way to reach the hamlet is by plane or boat .
O’Connor has been flying in for seven years , serving as the town ’s only doctor .
It ’s the kind of work that kept him in Canada after he came over from Ireland in 1984 for a three - month stint .
“ You see the same people over and over , and the whole community , ” he says .
“ You feel like part of a family . ”
The outside world largely ignores Fort Chip , O’Connor says .
But isolation has not protected the town ’s 1,200 residents —
Mikisew Cree , Athabasca Chipewyan , and the descendants of French trappers — from the effects of the oil frenzy 70 miles upstream .
In fact , O’Connor suspects that the tar sands may be slowly killing them .
At the height of the fur trade in the 1800s , Fort Chipewyan shipped off thousands of beaver pelts to Europe .
Founded in 1788 , Fort Chipewyan is the oldest continuously inhabited settlement in Alberta .
Located by three rivers feeding into one of the largest freshwater deltas in the world , it was a hub of commerce at a time when waterways were superhighways .
At the height of the fur trade in the 1800s , it shipped off thousands of beaver pelts to Europe .
After the beaver - fur hat lost its allure in the 1840s , Fort Chipewyan languished for decades , doing without electricity until 1959 and without an airstrip until a few years later .
After O’Connor was hired as the town ’s fly - in doctor in 2000 , he was struck by the number of people wandering the streets with serious ailments — more than he ’d seen in other native communities .
“ Going to Fort Chip , you hit the ground running , ” he says as we land .
“ You are working from the very start . ”
Sure enough , as O’Connor lugs his bags across the runway , he ’s hailed by a man who complains of being “ holed up in bed for days . ”
O’Connor also expresses concern about Stan , the airport baggage handler , who is due for an important medical test .
“ Do n’t miss it , ” O’Connor chides as he climbs into a minivan .
The man behind the wheel , thin and hunchbacked , confesses to skipping his own clinic appointment that morning .
But he feels healthy enough .
“ Boy , I hope it ’s a good day tomorrow , ” he says .
“ I want to go kill my moose . ”
We drive past mossy hillsides of birch and aspen to the lakefront , where we turn into a row of modest homes and trailers , passing oil drums fished from the river and repurposed as trash bins .
The minivan stops at the small wood - plank community center .
Inside , O’Connor adds his fruit tray to a spread that includes beef , pasta , and salad but little of the abundant wild meat and fish that many locals traditionally subsisted on .
John Michael , a trapper and fisherman with a red , leathery face , says he has a stack of caribou and walleye in his freezer but is afraid to dig into it too often .
Groceries are expensive , he says , “ but fuck , I do n’t eat food anyways .
I just buy my beer . ”
Ten years ago , as the tar sands boom was just getting under way , Michael and other commercial fishermen began to haul in unusual numbers of deformed fish from Lake Athabasca .
Walleye came in with humpbacks , crooked tails , pug faces , and bulging eyes .
In 2002 , an elder named Raymond Ladouceur , who ’d been fishing the lake longer than anyone , dropped off 200 pounds of freakish - looking walleye at the doorstep of the Fish and Wildlife Division in Fort McMurray .
Instead of testing them , officials left the fish outside to rot .
With no official word on what was wrong with the disfigured fish , fishermen who pulled in whitefish and northern pike with red scales and large lumps on their sides and emaciated , jug - headed trout simply tossed them back into the water .
Michael tells me , “ We do n’t like talking about ’em . ”
In the past few years , a tide of serious illnesses has passed through Fort Chip ’s tiny health clinic .
In a period of a few months , O’Connor treated half a dozen people with thyroid disorders .
He ’s diagnosed multiple cases of lung , colon , bladder , and prostate cancer — many more than he ’d seen in other First Nations communities in Alberta .
In 2003 he determined that a man with jaundiced skin and weight loss was suffering from cholangiocarcinoma , a rare and virulent bile - duct cancer that normally afflicts 1 person in every 100,000 .
O’Connor knew just how devastating this form of cancer could be because his father , an encyclopedia salesman in Limerick , Ireland , had been diagnosed with it 10 years earlier .
“ Six weeks later , ” O’Connor recalls , “ he was dead . ”
At first , O’Connor shared his budding concerns about Fort Chip ’s health with only a handful of friends and colleagues — until he learned of Shell ’s proposal to expand its mining operation near the banks of the Athabasca .
The oil company was n’t required to mitigate the $ 10 billion project ’s effects on the people and wildlife living in Fort Chip , because , officially , there were none .
O’Connor became the first medical doctor in Alberta to publicly suggest otherwise .
In late 2004 , O’Connor diagnosed a second case of cholangiocarcinoma in a 60 - year - old school bus driver who died a few weeks later .
Shell was deadlocked with the locals over how to study its project ’s impact , so O’Connor suggested to a friend who worked for the national health agency that it perform its own studies .
By then , a study by Suncor had found elevated levels of arsenic in some local moose meat .
The company ’s scientists also found that lifetime exposure to arsenic in the moose meat could result in as many as 453 additional cases of cancer for every 100,000 residents .
The anecdotal evidence that something was wrong was mounting : Fort Chipewyan ’s hunters complained that their duck and muskrat tasted watery and bland , that moose livers were enlarged and spotted white , and that when they boiled river water it left a viscous brown scum on the pot .
“ It ’s got so bloody many chemicals coming down in that water system today , ” says Ladouceur , who ’s stopped drinking straight from the river as he ’d done since childhood .
Many Fort Chip residents have even forsaken the town ’s purified tap water , struggling to afford the bottled kind , which sells for $ 8 a gallon .
The clinic often treats the elderly for dehydration .
As things got worse , O’Connor grew tired of waiting for the government to take action .
In March 2006 , he went on a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio program and announced that five people had died from bile - duct cancer in tiny Fort Chip — what one would expect to see in a metropolis more than 400 times its size .
In early 2006 , as George W. Bush declared his intention to “ make our dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thing of the past , ” Canadian officials met with the Department of Energy in Houston to discuss increasing tar sands oil production fivefold .
“ We certainly are very anxious that oil sands development be as swift as possible , ” Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman told visiting Canadian officials that March .
He followed up with a trip to Alberta , telling energy executives there that the United States was committed to reducing its oil imports from overseas and that “ no single thing can do more to help us reach that goal than realizing the potential of the oil sands in Alberta . ”
With several daily nonstop flights linking Calgary and Houston , and an ExxonMobil pipeline that had once pumped Texas oil to Illinois being retrofitted to send Canadian synthetic crude to the Gulf Coast , Alberta ’s envoy to Capitol Hill cheered , “ We are seamless with Houston . ”
The province has opened an office in the Canadian Embassy in Washington to promote its oil interests ( the only provincial office of its kind ) .
In the summer of 2006 , a giant tar sands dump truck was parked on the Mall for the Smithsonian ’s annual Folklife Festival , a symbol of “ the living traditions that make and sustain Alberta ’s unique culture . ”
In Fort Chipewyan , the tar sands hold both promise and peril .
Young people grumble about the oil companies ’ practice of “ consulting ” with elders , currying favor by handing out payments and “ door prizes ” such as propane lanterns and microwaves at public meetings .
Raymond Ladouceur wonders if fears of contamination could cause the market for the town ’s walleye — white - tablecloth restaurants in New York City and Boston — to dry up .
But more than that , he wonders who will keep fishing .
The town is aging , while the young — including his daughter , three sisters , and a brother — have set off to seek their fortunes in the tar sands .
“ We are going to destroy everything , we as human beings , ” he says .
“ Our greed is going to kill us .
And in the end , with all the money we are going to have , and nothing to eat , no water to drink , no air to breathe — what is the good of it ?
It ’s just a lousy piece of paper . ”
“ The way Raymond lives today , we would n’t be able to live like that , ” she tells me .
On a chilly autumn evening , Ida Stepanowich finishes a 12 - hour shift at the Suncor mine 15 miles north of Fort McMurray and stops to pick up her 15 - year - old son from his after - school job at a video store .
He climbs into the back of her extended - cab pickup clutching a copy of Night of the Living Dead .
Inside her home on the sprawling edge of town , she walks past a living room that resembles a page from an Ikea catalog and sits down in her pearl - white kitchen .
Stepanowich , Raymond Ladouceur ’s 48 - year - old sister , grew up with her 10 siblings in a cabin on the Athabasca River , splitting firewood , hauling water , and eating only what they could grow and catch .
“ The way Raymond lives today , we would n’t be able to live like that , ” she tells me in the soft tones of a yoga instructor .
“ My grandma used to say in Cree that money would mean a lot one day .
It would mean everything to the world .
And that ’s so true . ”
The influx of fortune seekers and roughnecks has transformed Fort McMurray into a place that longtime residents barely recognize .
Gone are the days when one might see caribou from the back yard .
The town has doubled in size over the past decade to more than 64,000 people .
With a median single - family home price of $ 550,000 , it ’s now among the highest - priced towns in Canada .
( The average two - story home price in Toronto is $ 485,000 . )
It sports a full - service casino , restaurants with names like Fuel , an Oil Sands Discovery Centre for tourists , and a new nickname : McMoney .
Inexperienced truck drivers can earn $ 100,000 a year in the tar sands , welders twice that .
On the only road leading into town , known as the “ Highway of Death , ” oversize rigs are passed on blind curves by workers flush with cash and booze .
Stepanowich moved to Fort McMurray in 2000 , seeking better schools for her two children .
For six years her husband has piloted a crane at the Syncrude mine and she ’s driven dozers , graders , haulers , and tankers .
Although she bought a home and banked a college fund , Stepanowich wonders if the jobs have been worth it .
“ When I work out there , ” she whispers , “ I always say , ‘ Grandmothers , forgive us for destroying your Earth . ’
I do n’t say that out loud to people I work with — they ’ll probably think that I ’m crazy .
But if I have tobacco , I ’ll sprinkle a little bit along the way someplace and ask for forgiveness . ”
Earlier that day , across the street from the Boomtown Casino , I eat breakfast with Georgette Adam , another tar sands worker from Fort Chip .
She ’s just finished a shift driving a 3,369 - horsepower Caterpillar 797B for Suncor .
The 400 - ton - capacity truck is the largest in the world , and Adam describes driving it as a bit like steering an apartment building .
Riding in the Godzilla of monster trucks has its risks , such as blowing a tire ( “ It can kill anybody beside it ” ) , leaking transmission fluid ( “ It ’s not like a little bucket ; it ’s huge ” ) , and breaking one of the cooling hoses ( “ That ’s it ; they blow up ” ) .
It can squash pickups like tin cans , she gushes .
Adam does not share Stepanowich ’s concerns about pollution , but she ’s familiar with the dark side of the boom .
In 1998 , she convinced her older sister Chipsy to get a job in the mines .
The two sisters lived together in a barracks - style camp that housed 40 men for every woman .
Eager suitors came to the sisters ’ rooms with gifts such as a boom box and a disco ball and swarmed them in the camp cafeteria .
“ Dudes hit on you every day , ” Chipsy later recalls .
She took up with a boyfriend who agreed to take her to the airport to meet his family .
There , the boyfriend was met in the terminal by a young woman with children .
“ Is that your sister ? ” Chipsy asked , but the look on the woman ’s face told her the answer ; she took a taxi home in tears .
Later , the boyfriend lamely claimed he ’d “ just wanted a fresh start . ”
Chipsy drowned her sorrows in the bars .
On “ Thirsty Thursday , ” mine workers cashed their paychecks at a strip club and hit the Oil Can or Diggers for beers .
Friends introduced Chipsy to cocaine , the camp ’s drug of choice because it ’s difficult to detect in random drug tests .
She guesses that three - quarters of tar sands workers use it regularly .
( Fort McMurray ’s rate of cocaine - related incidents is three times Toronto’s . )
People lost their jobs , she says , but “ then you just get a job with another mine . ”
The strain and temptation eventually convinced Chipsy to move back to Fort Chipewyan .
One day not long after her return , her brother ferried her to a bush camp , where elders invited her into a cabin of logs and moss and fed her warm fish , dried moose , and lard - fried bread called “ kill me quick . ”
A whole muskrat roasted in an oven .
This was what she ’d missed .
Those who stay in Fort McMurray often do n’t fare as well .
Prostitution is rampant .
The number of pages in the phone book devoted to escort services has reportedly gone from 1 to 10 in recent years .
After I say goodbye to Georgette Adam , I pass a portly man and a woman having sex on a picnic table in front of the mayor ’s office .
The town ’s homelessness rate , driven by the exorbitant housing costs , is the worst in Alberta .
In the last three winters , 12 people froze to death on the streets .
The boom has also hit the town ’s only hospital hard .
Even as the population swelled , the number of doctors working at the Northern Lights Regional Health Centre has declined .
Emergency room doctors may see upward of 150 patients a day .
John O’Connor says he often worked 80 - hour weeks , serving as head of family medicine , coroner , and designated physician for the Mounties .
“ I tell people who care to listen , ‘ If you get sick in Fort McMurray , leave , ' ” he says .
“ We are drowning in patients .
We ca n’t cope at all . ”
In a letter to a Nova Scotia newspaper in December 2006 , he discouraged newcomers from heading to the tar sands .
“ I can not count the number of nurses who express the sentiment that , having been recruited here , they feel they have been duped !
Quality of life here is extremely low . ”
He concluded , “ Despite our expressed concerns , we are ignored . ”
Eventually , people in high places started paying attention to O’Connor , but not in the way he ’d hoped .
Eventually , people in high places started paying attention to O’Connor , but not in the way he ’d hoped .
Last January , Canada ’s national health agency accused him of professional misconduct , claiming he had raised “ undue alarm ” about environmental health threats and “ engendered a sense of mistrust ” in government authorities .
When government doctors had finally examined medical records from Fort Chipewyan , as O’Connor had long requested , they said that its cancer rate was no higher than the rest of the province ’s .
They ’d discovered only one case of cholangiocarcinoma , not the five that O’Connor had cited .
At Health Canada ’s request , the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta is investigating O’Connor ; if the allegations are substantiated , he could lose his medical license .
O’Connor says that when he learned of the charges , he ran to the bathroom and retched .
However , the government ’s review of O’Connor ’s claims has been far from comprehensive .
Georg MacDonald , the former director of Fort Chipewyan ’s health clinic , told me she has records of two cases of bile - duct cancer .
Although O’Connor says he referred his bile - duct cancer patients to specialists in Edmonton and Fort McMurray , the government never examined those cities ’ cancer cases to see if they ’d originated in Fort Chip .
A spokeswoman for the Alberta Cancer Board admitted to me that “ those are the things we are looking at right now . ”
At press time , O’Connor was still waiting for the results of the investigation .
“ If it finds me really wrong , ” he says , “ then I will just give up medicine . ”
In the meantime , Fort Chipewyan ’s health board decided to look into the cancer cluster itself , hiring an ecology consultant to independently analyze local pollution data .
His report , released last November , found rising concentrations of mercury , arsenic , and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) in the lower Athabasca River .
Thirty to forty percent of walleye tested for mercury exceeded levels deemed safe in Canada for consumers ; all exceeded the U.S. epa ‘s standard for subsistence fishermen .
The consultant also found that a government study had lowballed the levels of arsenic in the food supply .
“ Their data are cooked , ” he proclaimed .
While dismissing this analysis as incomplete and misleading , the province ’s scientists could not fully explain the rise in concentrations of pah , a common hydrocarbon found in everything from crude oil to tobacco smoke to barbecued ribs .
Since the 1930s , pah has been known as a human carcinogen .
Tar sands mining has been linked to increased pah levels in fish ; the pah levels in the lower Athabasca are twice those known to cause cancer in fish .
Recent peer - reviewed studies have found that arsenic — also present in high concentrations in the Athabasca River — can interact with pah to increase the cancer risk to fish by a factor of 10 .
Studies of Ohio ’s Black River , the Chesapeake Bay , and the Puget Sound have linked pah exposure to rare bile - duct cancers in fish — the same type of cancer O’Connor saw in some residents of Fort Chipewyan .
This array of findings “ has added to our concern that there may be a human impact ” in Fort Chipewyan , says Jeff Short , an environmental chemist with the National Marine Fisheries Service in Alaska who studied the impacts of pah from the Exxon Valdez oil spill .
Short and a team of Canadian and American researchers are conducting additional environmental studies in Fort Chipewyan this year .
It ’s the kind of work that the provincial government should have done on its own long ago , says David Schindler , a water ecologist at the University of Alberta .
“ Nobody has done a comprehensive summary that would give me any comfort if I were a resident of Fort Chip , ” he says .
But the uncertainty surrounding O’Connor ’s cancer findings has provided some breathing room for the oil industry , which maintains that its operations are n’t the source of the pollution in the Athabasca River .
Government scientists point out that the river had high levels of mercury and pah long before its banks were lined with strip mines .
An industry - funded report concluded that the river was no dirtier today than if the tar sands had been left undisturbed .
Many in Fort Chipewyan are n’t buying it .
Last August the town saw its first anti-tar - sands rally .
A few months later more than a dozen major environmental organizations joined the Fort Chipewyan tribes and other First Nations groups in Alberta to call for an immediate moratorium on additional tar sands development .
Yet even as Fort Chipewyan ’s leaders have publicly called for an end to the mining , they are quietly thinking about bringing the boom to their own back yard .
Townspeople are speculating about plans to build a pipeline that would pump water from Lake Athabasca to the mines .
And Canadian and Chinese energy companies and a Dutch shipping firm have been discussing construction of a port on Lake Athabasca ’s undeveloped south shore , part of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation .
Barges loaded with refinery parts from Asia would sail from the Arctic Ocean to the new port , where they would be loaded onto trucks and rolled south to the mines on a new superhighway , bypassing the clogged Highway of Death .
For the first time in nearly 200 years , the people of Fort Chip would be at the crossroads of the largest industry in Canada , collecting shipping royalties and maybe even selling rights to the uranium deposits next to the new road .
“ Certainly there will be quite a debate between the generations about a port and a highway , ” says John Rigney , the ceo of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation .
“ The older generation is very worried about what the land can sustain , and the younger generation is excited about the opportunities it could bring — and the wealth .
The wealth could be immense .
These First Nations stand to become as rich as the Arabs if all this develops . ”
Fort Chipewyan ’s uncertain future weighs heavily on O’Connor .
He ’s grown tired of the grit of Fort McMurray , the long hours on call , and the burden of accusation .
“ It ’s constant ; it ’s consuming , ” he explains .
“ I ca n’t remember the last time I had a good night ’s sleep . ”
Last fall , he quit his job and said goodbye to Alberta ( although he still makes frequent visits ) .
He has been replaced by a new doctor who has kept a much lower profile .
“ I ’m not a whistleblower , ” O’Connor says .
“ I ’m just asking questions as a simple , humble family physician . ”
He now lives across the continent , in Nova Scotia , in a house overlooking blue rollers and a beach of pure , white sand .

The Atlanta Police Department joined with the music and movie industries last week to shred more than 1 million CDs and DVDs that had been seized from street vendors , sending the resulting ribbons of plastic to recycling facilities .
According to Brad Buckles , executive vice president of antipiracy for the Recording Industry Association of America , " individuals selling CDs for cheap on the streetcorner are not just small - time peddlers – they are fronts for largercriminal organizations that steal music by the millions of CDs . "
Buckles said neighborhood groups that deal in pirated CDs are often involved in narcotics and weapons , so removing these CDs from the black market improves the health and safety of those who live where illicitly copied CDs are sold .
He added that piracy " not only affects the creative industries ,
but takes away valuable revenue generated from legitimate purchasesfrom local retailers and city and state governments . "
The RIAA and Motion Picture Association of America estimate that these 1 million - plus CDs and DVDs represent more than $ 20 million in lost sales revenue , although the discs were almost certainly being sold for far less than $ 20 each .

INDIANAPOLIS  Until now , Shirley Morgan had always been the kind of voter the Republican Party thought it could count on .
She comes from a family of staunch Republicans , has a son in the military and has supported Republican presidential candidates ever since she cast her first ballot , for Richard M. Nixon in 1972 .
But this year Mrs. Morgan exemplifies a different breed : the Republican crossing over to vote in the Democratic primary .
Not only will she mark her ballot for Senator Barack Obama in the May 6 primary here , but she has also been canvassing for him in the heavily Republican suburbs of Hamilton County , just north of Indianapolis  the first time she has ever actively campaigned for a candidate .
“ I used to like John McCain , but he ’s aligning himself too closely with what Bush did , and that ’s just not what I want for this country , ” Mrs. Morgan , who is 56 , said when asked to explain her rejection of the presumptive Republican nominee .
Since the start of the primary and caucus season in January , Republican voters have been crossing over in increasing numbers to vote in Democratic contests  supplying up to 10 percent of the vote in states that allow such crossover voting  and they are expected to play a pivotal role in the fiercely contested primary here .
What is less clear , however , is the motivation for their behavior : are they genuinely attracted by the two Democratic candidates ?
Or are they mischief - making spoilers , looking to prolong a divisive Democratic fight or support a candidate Mr. McCain can beat in November ?
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on Wednesday eased capital requirements for the two biggest housing finance agencies , allowing them to pump up to $ 200 billion into the distressed U.S. mortgage market .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The regulator , the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight , said it was lowering to 20 percent from 30 percent the amount of extra capital the companies are required to hold .
It will also consider further reductions .
The 30 percent requirement had been imposed after the discovery of lax accounting and risk controls earlier this decade .
In addition , the companies will begin to raise “ significant capital , ” OFHEO said in a joint statement with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Last year , the companies sold nearly $ 14 billion in preferred stock .
The extra $ 200 billion would allow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase both existing mortgage - backed securities and new home loans originated by banks .
It could also enable them to increase their business of guaranteeing mortgages , a key to helping pull the U.S. housing market out of its funk .
“ It ’s good news , ” said Chris Rupkey , chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo / Mitsubishi in New York .
“ A lot of mortgage originators have left the business , so it ’s a good thing that mortgage money will be made more available . ”
The move is a shift for the Bush administration , which has long argued the combined $ 1.4 trillion portfolio of the companies represents more of a risk to the U.S. financial system than a help to homeowners .
The new policy comes as falling home prices and increasingly jittery financial markets have pushed the U.S. economy to the verge of recession .
After the announcement , shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac rose sharply for a second day .
Fannie Mae stock rose 10.5 percent to $ 31.17 , a five - week high , while Freddie Mac jumped 8.3 percent to $ 28.18 , the highest since February 20 .
FULL COMPLIANCE
The regulator said Fannie Mae was in “ full compliance ” with government restrictions placed on the company for accounting violations , while Freddie Mac had to clear one more hurdle relating to the separation of the roles of the chairman and chief executive .
Freddie Mac has already said it is splitting what had been a co-chief executive / chairman job and was currently searching for a new chief executive .
The regulator said it expects to remove special regulatory constraints placed on the companies after the book - keeping scandals , which came to light for Freddie Mac in mid-2003 and in 2004 for Fannie Mae .
Increased investment by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is expected to bolster confidence in a secondary mortgage market shaken by a wave of failing home loans .
Cratering prices and a sell - off of mortgage - related assets this year have fueled an escalating credit crunch that may have already tipped the U.S. economy into recession .
Mortgage - backed securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac rallied , pushing their yield spreads to government debt to their tightest since February -- indicating a perception of falling risk .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the biggest buyers in the $ 4.5 trillion “ agency ” mortgage - backed securities market .
The government - sponsored enterprises have been surprised by the magnitude of the housing slump , raising questions of how much risk they can take with the capital , analysts said .
Both companies boosted forecasts for credit - related losses through 2009 after reporting combined net losses of more than $ 6 billion for the fourth quarter .
By Damien McElroy | Mr Bolton said that striking Iran would represent a major step towards victory in Iraq .
While he acknowledged that the risk of a hostile Iranian response harming American ’s overseas interests existed , he said the damage inflicted by Tehran would be “ far higher ” if Washington took no action .
“ This is a case where the use of military force against a training camp to show the Iranians we ’re not going to tolerate this is really the most prudent thing to do , ” he said .
“ Then the ball would be in Iran ’s court to draw the appropriate lesson to stop harming our troops . ”
Mr Bolton , an influential former member of President George W Bush ’s inner circle , dismissed as “ dead wrong ” reported British intelligence conclusions that the US military had overstated the support that Iran was providing to Iraqi fighters .
A US military spokesman revealed last week that the elite Quds Force of Iran ’s Revolutionary Guards had drafted in personnel from Lebanon ’s Hizbollah to train fighters from Iraq ’s Shia militias .
Colonel Donald Bacon , a spokesman for the coalition in Baghdad , said captured fighters had told interrogators that thousands of Iraqi fighters were undergoing training in the Islamic Republic .
The main camp is located near the town of Jalil Azad , near Tehran , according to coalition officials .
The capture of Qais Khazali , a major figure in the Shia insurgency alongside Ali Mussa Daqduq , a senior Lebanese Hizbollah guerilla , last year yielded a treasure trove of information on Hizbollah ’s activities in Iraq .
“ Ali Mussa Daqduq confirmed Lebanese Hizbollah were providing training to Iraqi Special Group members in Iran and that his role was to assess the quality of training and make recommendations on how the training could be improved , ” said Col Bacon .
“ In this role , he travelled to Iraq on four occasions and was captured on his fourth trip . ”
Five Britons kidnapped in Iraq are believed to have been put under the control of Quds Force agents after failed attempts to barter the men for Khazali and Daqduq ’s freedom .
The importance of the Quds Force to stability in Iraq was demonstrated last week when a five - member Iraqi delegation was sent to Tehran to meet with its commander , General Ghassem Soleimani .
The delegation was despatched by the Iraqi government to plead for an end to Iranian meddling in its enfeebled neighbour .
In retrospect , Friedlich suspects she set impossibly high ideals for herself - and her ex-partners - positioning herself so that having children was never going to be a possibility .
" When I got to my late 30s it was either do or die : am I going to have children or am I not ?
It was a series of choices as life went on .
I could have become pregnant and if I 'd really wanted to , I would have .
But I honestly did n't want to .
The idea scared the hell out of me , " she says .
It 's interesting to hear Friedlich 's uncomplicated response to the topic .
She says it was n't something that weighed on her mind a great deal over the years , though she admits it was an issue for other people , including her ex-partner 's mother who would often ask her when she was going to have a baby .
So why does the subject of choosing not to have children attract debate - and sometimes judgement - from those who have chosen otherwise ?
One school of thought , be it spoken or implied , is that women who make this choice are selfish , self - centred or incapable of self - sacrifi ce .
" I do n't resent the implication that I 'm selfi sh , " Friedlich says .
" You could be seen as being selfi sh for having a large family .
A lot of women have children for themselves and for their own needs .
Perhaps it is a self - validation thing , ' This is what I 've created ' .
And there 's nothing wrong with that , but there is that divide and there always will be , " she says .
Carla Lipsig - Mumme is honorary professor of political and social inquiry at Monash University , and professor and director of labour studies at Canada 's York University .
Lipsig- Mumme believes that the labelling of women who are seen to be pursuing lifestyle over children is " very uniquely Australian " and says she has not encountered that attitude elsewhere in the world .
She suggests this is linked to the philosophy of our workforce .
" The Australian labour market is relatively more brutal to women and part of it is a social ideology which says that women are most fulfi lled in becoming mothers , while paid work is somehow a derogation of duty .
Sadly , you sometimes fi nd that catch - 22 put out by women themselves , " she says .
Lipsig - Mumme also believes that if women are made to feel defensive about not having children , then one has to ask why they are not having them .
" I would argue from what I know myself through my research that not having children in the Australian labour market is a bid to have a career , " she says .
" There is enormous pressure on women - and sometimes by women - for women to put their career second .
By which I mean , if you break your career , if you get out of the labour market for period of time , if you go on to job sharing and things like that , over time you fall behind those who do n't .
Not just in terms of money but in terms of mobility and challenge . "
For Juddie Boyd , 36 , who is married and studies full - time , having children has never been on her agenda .
She and her husband have together made the decision to stay childless .
Boyd says she fi nds it diffi cult to reconcile some of her values and views on certain issues with the idea of having children .
" I think my husband and I are both very loving and very caring , " says Boyd .
" I like our values .
We 're socially and environmentally aware and we consider issues external to our own little world .
" Take the world 's population and the pressure it causes on society and on the environment - the idea of bringing one more person into this mix to me does n't make sense .
I 'm not saying other people should n't , but for me it is hard to reconcile . "
Boyd recites some of the commentary she has received in relation to her and her husband 's decision and it ranges from envy , pity , presumption that she will change her mind and expressions of resentment .
" I think a lot of people do want to convey that they feel it 's very selfish .
My response is that there are a lot of things that I want to do with my my life , and having kids has n't been on that list , " she says .
" I think the decision to have children is also a selfi sh decision .
People do it because they want to have that in their life .
But people often imply that it's a negative thing if you choose not to have kids .
I try to explain that it 's not a criticism of other people .
It 's really just that it would n't be right to have kids for the wrong reasons , or because everyone expects you to . "
The schoolchildren Marni Baxter * teaches adore her as much as she adores them , although she is too diplomatic to take the compliment .
But she acknowledges that as a secondary - school teacher she is in her element .
Baxter , 26 , is also gay and says the idea of having her own children has always been an " abstract thing " .
" For someone in my situation having children does n't happen accidentally , " she says .
" The choice about having children requires a lot of thought and planning and processing .
There are a lot of ethical issues but also on a general scale I do n't feel any biological need to reproduce my genes .
" I 've pretty much always felt this way , but as girls we 're told we 're supposed to by the media and by society at large and it never really felt right with me .
I do n't mind the idea of being ' the aunty ' or ' the babysitter ' .
I love being a teacher .
I adore children , but I do n't necessarily see that I need to reproduce children to enjoy them .
There are other options for me beyond that . "
Familiar with the statement , " But you would make such a great mother " , Baxter finds herself replying to those who say it : " Yes , and I make a great teacher and I probably would make a great astronaut if I put my mind to it .
However , that does n't necessarily mean that that is my choice . "
" I can't imagine what it is to be a mother , " says Baxter .
" I have the utmost respect for parents , I think it would be the hardest job in the world .
But I think there are more things in life to pursue and there are different options .
It 's an individual choice . " * Name has been changed .

SYDNEY ( Reuters ) -
An Australian man convicted of his seventh drink - driving charge was spending about A$ 1,000 ( $ 972 ) a week on beer -- enough to buy more than 2,500 small bottles a month , a newspaper said Tuesday .
The heartbroken construction worker began drowning his sorrows after breaking up with his partner five years ago , the Northern Territory News said , quoting his defense lawyer as telling a court in Australia ’s remote , tropical north .
The magistrate declined to jail the father of four , Michael Leary , noting he had quit drinking since his latest arrest , but he banned Leary from buying or even holding a beer for 12 months .
The magistrate also poked fun at Leary ’s favorite beer , Melbourne Bitter , in a part of the country where drinkers can be as loyal to beer brands as they are to football teams .
‘ ’( That is ) poor judgment on two counts there -- drinking that much and drinking Melbourne Bitter , ’’ magistrate Vince Luppino was quoted as saying .

The high price of gasoline is about to get higher in B.C. once the provincial government ’s carbon tax is fully implemented .
Starting July 1 , the price of gas will increase 2.4 cents a litre , and by 2012 it will be 7.25 cents more .
And heating your home will also cost more with an extra 2.8 cents tax on both natural gas and furnace oil .
Finance Minister Carole Taylor officially introduced the Carbon Tax Act in the legislature on Monday , saying the tax will encourage families and businesses to lower their carbon footprint by using less fossil fuel .
The new tax is a hit with environmentalists and academics who filled the spectators gallery at the legislature to show their support .
Groups such as the Sierra Club and the David Suzuki Foundation have said taxing fossil fuels makes British Columbia a leader in the fight against climate change .
But the New Democrat Opposition says the carbon tax is unfair for northerners who will pay more for home heating oil , and unfair for rural residents who do n’t have public transit and have no choice but to drive .

Oh , Louisiana legislature … .
You may look more or less the same in your two - button blazers and your unattractive chambers , but you ’ve changed .
You ’ve changed , man .
You always said you were gonna buck the trend .
Sure , you caved in on some stuff — important stuff like integration and public smoking .
That kinda thing .
That was totally okay .
But you ’ve stuck to your guns on other matters , proud of our state ’s traditions and eager to force them on your children and their children ’s children .
But now ?
Now y’all have legislated yourselves right outta kickbacks , fer chrissakes !
You ’ve taken away cockfighting , and you ’ve tried your damnedest to pull up our sagging pants .
You are essentially dismantling the crazy quilt of Louisiana ’s cultural history and turning it into a double wedding ring of tasteful ecru damask and remnants of rose - colored satin .
Where is your fabled sense of whimsy ?
Where , dammit ?!
Then last week came the cruelest blow :
Louisiana legislators have approved a resolution calling for “ privacy dividers ” to be installed at urinals men ’s public bathrooms .
The resolution does not have the force of law .
It will now be up to state health officials to amend Louisiana ’s plumbing code to require the privacy partitions .
The resolution was sponsored by Democratic state Rep. Mickey Guillory of Eunice .
The reason , according to the resolution , is that “ sexual offenders , sexually violent predators , and child predators can easily violate the privacy of others using urinals …. ” — more at WAFB
[ YES , THERE IS VIDEO ! ]
Speaking on behalf of gay men and their bi-curious half - brethren everywhere : has n’t Louisiana suffered enough ?
Must you add insult to injury ?
I do n’t even know who you are anymore .
WASHINGTON -- Justice Department officials over the last six years illegally used “ political or ideological ” factors to hire new lawyers into an elite recruitment program , tapping law school graduates with conservative credentials over those with liberal - sounding resumes , a new report found Tuesday .
The blistering report , prepared by the Justice Department ’s inspector general , is the first in what will be a series of investigations growing out of last year ’s scandal over the firings of nine United States attorneys .
It appeared to confirm for the first time in an official examination many of the allegations from critics who charged that the Justice Department had become overly politicized during the Bush administration .
“ Many qualified candidates ” were rejected for the department ’s honors program because of what was perceived as a liberal bias , the report found .
Those practices , the report concluded , “ constituted misconduct and also violated the department ’s policies and civil service law that prohibit discrimination in hiring based on political or ideological affiliations . ”
The shift began in 2002 , when advisers to then - Attorney General John Ashcroft restructured the honors program in response to what some officials saw as a liberal tilt in recruiting young lawyers from elite law schools like Harvard and Yale .
While the recruitment was once controlled largely by career officials in each section who would review applications , political officials in the department began to assume more control , rejecting candidates with liberal or Democratic affiliations “ at a significantly higher rate ” than those with Republican or conservative credentials , the report said .
Opinion Fresh contenders have entered the UK wind power debate , as a turbines expert funded by the Renewable Energy Foundation publishes an investigation into a hotly - disputed subject - the variability in output to be expected of a large UK windfarm base .
In a just - released article for the journal Energy Policy , titled Will British weather provide reliable electricity ? , consulting engineer Jim Oswald and his co-authors model the output to be expected from a large , 25 + gigawatt UK windfarm collection of the type the government says it would like to see in service by 2020 .
Wind is generally seen as the renewable technology best suited to the UK climate , and so it forms the bulk of most renewables plans for Blighty .
One of the most frequent criticisms levelled at wind power is variability .
That is , when the wind drops ( or blows too hard ) the windmills stop spinning and you get no power .
To begin with , Oswald simulates the output rises and falls that might result from a lot of windfarms distributed around the UK by using Met Office archived data from different points up and down the land .
Many wind advocates have argued that with enough windfarms , widely enough distributed , you would get more reliable power output as some windmills would always have wind .
Oswald 's analysis says this is n't true , with calm conditions across pretty much all the UK being fairly regular events .
Analysis from 1996 to 2005 shows similar results : large , rapid , and frequent changes of power output being common occurrences ... any national power system has to manage under the worst case conditions likely to occur ...
These are not extreme cases , whose frequency is so low as to render the events negligible .
Rather , these are representative ...
If the government succeeds in building its mighty 25 gigawatts of wind base by 2020 , according to Oswald 's Met Office data - based model its output will dip to pretty much nothing fairly routinely .
The next line of defence for wind advocates is normally the idea of hooking up the UK 's grid with high - capacity links to those of other European nations , creating a " Supergrid " with wind so widely spread that output would be sure to even out .
But Oswald has bad news for that idea , too .
He compares his modelled UK big - wind output with that which has been produced in recent times by other European wind bases , particularly the substantial German / Danish one .
Ill winds blow nobody any good .
Not only does the large continental wind base exhibit nasty rollercoaster surges in aggregate output , these surges tend to match those to be expected in the UK .
When the wind is n't blowing across most of the UK , it is n't blowing in Germany , Denmark etc. either .
Worse still , this happens in the dead of winter when electricity demand is highest .
There is good agreement between the model and the [ real - world European wind power output ] data , which further supports the argument that wind output is controlled by the arrival and dispersal of large low - pressure systems moving over the coasts of Western Europe .
Being an engineer , Oswald examines the worst situations that occurred in his time frame - those that engineers would need to design the system to cope with .
The nastiest situation that could happen would be early - evening flat calms in winter .
The relationship between wind power and demand was analysed by considering the moments of peak electrical demand in each of the last 6 years and ... the wind output for these moments ... each of them occur on a winter ’s day between 5 pm and 6 pm , as this is the time when commercial and domestic demand combines into the day ’s peak .
As can be seen ... 16 January 2001 and 2 February 2006 were times of very little wind output ... and would likely fall into the category described as ‘ low wind cold snap ’ ... on 2 February 2006 the electricity demand in Britain reached its peak for 2006 .
The wind power model suggests that the output for the wind farms of Britain at that time would have been zero ... wind farm output for neighbouring countries has been determined for the same moment in time ... the measured output from NorthWest Germany , Ireland , and Spain was low ...
This passage in the report aroused particular ire from the British Wind Energy Association , speaking to the Sunday Telegraph on the matter at the weekend .
" When you look at the UK system as a whole , there is electricity coming from wind 100 per cent of the time , " expostulated a testy spokesperson .
" There is no moment in time when the output of the pool falls to zero . "
Oswald 's report partly agrees with this , saying that it is true that aggregate wind output is never exactly zero .
Sometimes it 's less than zero , though .
It was during the nasty calm of 2006 , for instance :
The [ output of the UK's real - world ] wind farms monitored by the National Grid [ from 5 - 6 pm on February 2nd 2006 ] is shown as negative as the consumption of electricity used by these wind farms ( to drive auxiliary loads ) exceeded the total output .
And a supergrid to Europe would n't have helped , as everyone else had calms and high midwinter early evening demand too .
That demand peak in 2006 was especially bad for wind power , but it was far from freakish .
Such " low wind cold snaps " are routine , caused by midwinter high - pressure systems lurking on top of northwest Europe .
Like all such high - pressure systems they can easily hang about for a few days - sometimes longer - and according to Oswald this means you are n't going to cope with them by using pumped - storage kit .
Such systems , typified by the Dinorwig installation in Scotland Wales , could lift water uphill using spare wind power on breezy mornings and let it flow down through hydropower turbines on calm evenings .
They are much fancied by wind power advocates .
But speaking to the Reg yesterday , Oswald said that a realistically feasible UK pumped - storage base would only cope with one or two days of low winds at best .
He said that there 's a five - day calm most winters ; and every twenty years or so you can expect a ten - dayer .
" I 'm quite rude about pumped storage , " he told us .
In his view , all this means that - certainly in a 2020 timeframe - the only feasible backup for the planned 25 - gig wind base will be good old gas turbines .
These would have to be built even if pumped storage existed , to deal with long - duration calms ; and the expense of a triplefold wind , gas and pumped storage solution would be ridiculous .
At present , gas turbine installations provide much of the grid 's ability to deal with demand changes through the day .
The trouble is , according to Oswald , that human demand variance is predictable and smooth compared to wind output variance .
Coping with the sudden ups and downs of wind is going to mean a lot more gas turbines - ones which will be thrashed especially hard as wind output surges up and down , and which will be fired up for less of the time .

Name : Ezzat H
Age at incident : 10
Date of incident : 11 June 2008
Location : Sanniriya , Qalqiliya
Accusation : None
A 10 - year - old boy was subjected to physical abuse amounting to torture for 2.5 hours by Israeli soldiers who stormed his family�s shop on 11 June , seeking information on the location of a handgun .
The boy was repeatedly beaten , slapped and punched in the head and stomach , forced to hold a stress position for half and hour , and threatened .
He was deeply shocked and lost two molar teeth as a result of the assault .
On Wednesday 11 June 2008 , at around 10:30 am , 10 - year - old Ezzat , his brother Makkawi ( 7 ) and sister Lara ( 8 ) were in their father�s shop selling animal feed and eggs in the village of Sanniriya , near the West Bank city of Qalqiliya .
The children were suddenly startled to see two Israeli soldiers storm in to the shop .
Interrogation and abuse in the shop
One soldier wearing a black T - shirt started shouting in a loud , menacing voice in Arabic , " your father sent us to you to collect his gun " .
A terrified Ezzat responded , " My father does not own a gun " .
The soldier responded by slapping Ezzat hard across the right cheek and his brother Makawi across his face .
The soldier then ordered Makkawi and Lara to leave the shop .
Once the younger children had left the soldier demanded once again that Ezzat hand over his father�s gun .
Although Ezzat repeated that his father did not own a gun the soldier ordered him to search for it in the sacks containing the animal feed .
Ezzat kept insisting that there was no gun in the shop so the soldier slapped him once again , this time across his left cheek .
One of Ezzat�s friends , realising that something was wrong , tried to enter the shop but was kicked by the soldier standing at the door and prevented from entering .
Soon a group of local people had gathered outside the shop .
Some of the people in the group also tried to enter the shop but were prevented from doing so by the soldier at the door .
The soldier in the black T - shirt asked him once again to produce the gun .
Ezzat answered , " We do not have anything " .
The soldier responded by punching him hard in the stomach causing Ezzat to fall over on to empty egg boxes .
Ezzat started screaming and crying out from pain and fear .
The soldier in the black T - shirt started making fun of Ezzat and imitated him crying .
Ezzat remained in the shop alone with the soldiers for a further 15 minutes when the soldier in black abruptly grabbed him by his T - shirt and dragged him out of the shop .
Ezzat asked the soldier if he could lock up his father�s shop but the soldier said he wanted it to remain open so that it could be robbed .
The soldier also threatened to put Ezzat in his jeep and take him away .
Once they were out of the shop , Ezzat was ordered to walk in front of the soldiers to his house , whilst a gun was pointed at his back .
The soldiers hit him several times on the nape along the way .
On approaching his house Ezzat saw many Israeli military officials surrounding the house and a number of green military vehicles parked outside .
One of the olive coloured jeeps had the word " police " written on it .
Interrogation and abuse in the home
After arriving at the family�s home the soldier in the black T - shirt stood Ezzat in the yard and ordered him to search the flower basin for the gun .
Before Ezzat had a chance to respond the soldier slapped him so violently that Ezzat fell down face first into the basin .
Without giving him the chance to stand up the soldier grabbed him by his T - shirt and lifted him up roughly .
He was then instructed in Arabic by another soldier to head to the guestroom .
On approaching the guestroom Ezzat could see his father standing by the door .
The soldier slapped him on the neck and Ezzat fell to the ground .
As Ezzat stood up the soldier slapped him a second time making him fall to the ground once again .
All this happened in front of his father .
He then grabbed Ezzat by his T - shirt and lifted him in to the air .
The soldier told Ezzat�s father that he was going to take his son to prison .
He also threatened to take Ezzat�s 19 - year - old sister to prison .
Ezzat was then pushed forcibly in to the guest room where his mother and four of his other siblings including his sisters Diana ( 19 ) , Raghda ( 18 ) , ( Aya ) 15 and brother Jihad ( 3 ) , were being held .
His mother was crying .
Ezzat was also crying and when asked by his mother why he was crying , he said it was because he had been hit by the soldiers .
His mother asked the soldiers to stop beating her son and to beat her instead .
After several minutes Ezzat was taken out of the guestroom and slapped several times by the soldier in black , once so hard that he fell to the ground .
After being moved to several locations in the house Ezzat was told to stay in the boys� bedroom .
The same soldier then left the room but would return every five minutes to slap Ezzat and also to punch him several times in the stomach .
Each time this took place Ezzat would shout and scream out in pain and burst in to tears .
The soldier would then imitate him and make fun of him .
The soldier hit him around six times .
Destruction of property and use of stress positions
A short time later , five soldiers entered the room and proceeded to destroy the family�s property using hammers .
In all , the soldiers destroyed wooden ventilation panels in the attic , a small refrigerator in the bedroom and it contents , damage to the kitchen , a fan and the fireplace .
Ezzat spent one hour in the bedroom alone with the soldiers .
In that hour he was ordered by the same soldier to stand on one foot for half an hour , with his back against the wall and with both his hands lifted up in the air ( see picture ) .
Ezzat was exhausted by this but was too scared to put his foot down on the ground .
Eventually he was told by one of the other soldiers that he could put his foot down .
He was then asked to sit down in a squat position .
He managed to remain in this position for two minutes and then had to stand up .
A female soldier then walked in to the room and asked him to sit on the refrigerator box .
Shortly after the soldier in the black T - shirt returned accompanied by Ezzat�s older sister Diana .
He proceeded to ask Ezzat whether he cared for his sister to which Ezzat responded , " Yes I do " .
The soldier then asked him to tell him where the gun was hidden and that if he told him where it was hidden that he would not tell Ezzat�s father .
The soldier left the room with Ezzat�s sister .
He then returned to the room on his own and hit Ezzat all over his body .
He left the room once again and after a while came back offering Ezzat 10 Shekels in return for telling him where the gun was .
Ezzat responded that he did not care about money .
This made the soldier extremely angry and he took off his helmet and started throwing it at Ezzat from two metres away .
Ezzat was in extreme pain .
The soldier continued to hit him with the helmet and then left the room once again returning to slap him across his face and on his stomach .
This continued for some time with the soldier leaving the room and returning to hit Ezzat and to question him over the gun .
Interrogation of family
Ezzat then witnessed the soldier in the black T - shirt and the female soldier leading his sisters and mother to one of the rooms close to the boys� bedroom .
They closed the door of the room but Ezzat could hear the soldiers shouting at them .
He overheard the soldier telling the female soldier to hit his mother because she was refusing to take her clothes off to be searched .
After the incident was over Ezzat�s sister informed him that they were all strip searched by the female soldier , while the male soldier waited outside .
Meanwhile , a soldier wearing black sunglasses entered the bedroom in which Ezzat was being held .
He walked in pointing a rifle , a few centimetres away from Ezzat�s head .
Ezzat was so terrified that he began to shiver .
The soldier laughed and made fun of him .
He asked Ezzat to tell him where the gun was and threatened to shoot him if he didn�t .
Ezzat continued to maintain that there was no weapon hidden away .
The soldier , getting agitated shouted at Ezzat , " for the last time , tell me where the gun is before I shoot you " .
Ezzat repeated that he did not have a gun .
Hearing this , the soldier lowered his rifle and left the room .
After about five minutes the soldier in the black T - shirt entered the room along with four other soldiers and said that they were leaving but would return .
The soldiers spent two and half hours in the house in total .
After the incident Ezzat spent the night at his uncle�s house because he was too scared to sleep in his home .
As a result of the physical assault Ezzat lost two of his molar teeth and is deeply shocked by the incident .
DCI / PS Statement
DCI / PS is appalled that Israeli authorities would subject a 10 - year - old child to beatings , position abuse and threats over the course of several hours .
The treatment of Ezzat falls within the definition of torture and other acts of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment as defined in the UN Convention Against Torture , to which Israel is a State Party .
The treatment of Ezzat also infringes numerous other international conventions to which Israel is bound1 , as well as Israeli military and domestic law2 .
DCI / PS again calls on Israel to immediately ensure its compliance with the UN Convention Against Torture and to thoroughly and impartially investigate the allegations of torture and abuse of Ezzat and bring those found responsible for such abuse to justice .
DCI / PS also calls on the EU to make the upgrade of EU - Israel bilateral relations conditional upon measurable and confirmed progress by Israel to uphold the EU human rights standards in the Occupied Palestinian Territory .

Obama ' 08 : Special True Christian™ Offer For African American Voters : Trade Us Your Voter 's Registration Card For Free Fried Chicken From Popeye's !
Freehold , Iowa - From June 4th to Election Day , anyone ( coloreds and unsaved white folks with liberal leanings included ) can hip - hop right up to the pearly gates of Landover Baptist Church and exchange their authorized 2008 voter 's registration card for a coupon good for one free 2 Piece Chicken Combo Meal ( dark meat only ) at any Popeye 's restaurant in America !
Everyone in America has the “ right ” to vote , but only you will have the right to FREE chicken !
This special offer is our way of sharing the love of Jesus Christ with so - called African Americans and helping them celebrate Barak Obama 's victory as the Democratic candidate in the 2008 election .
Landover Baptist Church is very excited to make this offer available to the few Negroes in the county who are n’t felons and therefore have -- so far -- still clung , with gritty determination , to their voting rights .
This is a wonderful opportunity to get your registration card into the hands of Bible believing Christians who will use them to further the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth by carefully utilizing the additional votes as Jesus commands in the upcoming election .
This is a chance for you to vote for even more change by putting your faith and trust in the hands of folks who actually can read a newspaper and know more about what Jesus wants for our Nation than you do .
The crawl up to the election has been great fun for everyone so far , and we 've all learned a great deal .
" I remember I was listening to Billy Sunday on the radio , sipping a glass of lemonade on my porch swing with my favorite rifle resting in my lap , watching an obedient family of young colored folks tilling my fields , " said Pastor Deacon Fred .
" I must have dozed off for a minute , because when I woke up , some high yellow fellow named Russ Mitchell is reading the news to me on CBS Television and a Negro whose name sounds like something between a sneeze ( Bar'aach ! ) and a cough ( Obamaak ) was on TV , telling me to help him find a seat the Oval Office ! "
" Well , its time we all calmed down a bit , " said Pastor .
" Coloreds have come a long way from the days where we used to dress them up in suits on Sunday and sit outside the church pointing and laughing at them .
It looks like they can dress themselves now .
Sort of .
I 'm not sure when all that happened but I think we get the picture .
But we do n't want any trouble - you see ?
There was a time when colored folks were even more proud .
A time when there were happy to be rescued from jumping around in trees trying to avoid shooting each other in the butts with bows and arrows .
They were saved by our Christian forefathers who brought them to America to learn to serve the Bible .
And if Christ can bring a mess of former slaves to believe a book that endorses slavery , we know that His magical powers are really working overtime .
But when people in the late 1960 's started ignoring good doctors ' sanitation advice about keeping separate bathrooms and not drinking from the same fountains , folks got carried away .
And now we find ourselves using the same voting booths , and the next thing we know we got us a Nigra half - way to the House that ai n’t called White by chance ! "
" Well , what the heck !
We hope you folks are happy , because we 're dead set on celebrating along side you with this wonderful offer .
We certainly hope you appreciate it because its costing us millions of taxpayer dollars , but we look at it as an investment .
An investment in the future of America !
We 'll keep your tummies full of chicken , and you keep the more important stuff about running the country to us !
Amen ?
And for those of you coloreds with allergies to chicken , we can supply the free ammo to help you commit that felony you were probably going to go ahead and commit anyway .
Why wait ? "

To limit labor costs , Hanesbrands is building a largely automated factory in Nanjing .
But the company is also building a factory in Vietnam , in addition to a factory it bought here , and two more in Thailand .
Gerald Evans , the president for global supply chain at Hanesbrands , said that compared with China , “ we found more ready availability of both land and labor in both Vietnam and Thailand . ”
Hanesbrands will be shifting some manufacturing from Mexico and Central America to Asia .
In China , where rural villages are running low on able - bodied young workers to send to factories , wages are rising more than 10 percent a year for many assembly - line workers .
And pay is rising even faster for skilled workers , like machinery repair technicians .
In coastal provinces with ready access to ports , even unskilled workers now earn $ 120 a month for a 40 - hour workweek , and often considerably more ; wages in inland provinces , where transport is costlier , are somewhat lower but also rising fast .
While Chinese wages are still less than $ 1 an hour , factory workers in Vietnam earn as little as $ 50 a month for a 48 - hour workweek , including Saturdays .
Texhong estimates that average labor costs for each textile worker in China will rise 16 percent this year , including increases in benefits costs  on top of a 12 percent increase last year .
New regulations are making it harder for companies to avoid paying for benefits , like pensions , further increasing labor costs .
When those increases are combined with a currency rising against the dollar at an annual pace of up to 10 percent , labor costs in China are now climbing at 25 percent a year or more .
Inflation in China  more than 8 percent in February , March and April and 7.7 percent in May  raises the prospect that labor costs will soar even faster soon .
That could push up prices for a wide range of goods exported to the United States .

[ Home ] [ Library ] [ Links ] [ Search ] [ Email ] CROATIAN NAZIS THE WORST MONSTERS THE WORLD HAD KNOWN
They outdid German Nazi and Italian fascists HERE ARE A FEW FACTS EASY TO CHECK : HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Serbs have more than valid historical reason NOT TO TRUST Croat or Muslim " democracy " .
What they were suffering during World War II is so gruesome and far beyond description .
The Western press carefully avoids to talk about recent history of the region .
It denies the Serbs of Croatia and Bosnia the REAL MOTIVE for their current fear and struggle .
This is because it clashes with the claim that , somehow , Serbs of these geographical regions were pushed by Belgrade autocrat Miloshevich to " rebel " against " newly born democracies " .
REFERENCE #1 : For decades Encyclopedia Britannica had the following sentence when talking about WWII in Yugoslavia
( Quote ) : " ... IN BOSNIA ... THE CROATIAN FASCISTS BEGAN A MASSACRE OF SERBS WHICH , IN THE WHOLE ANNALS OF WORLD WAR II , WAS SURPASSED FOR SAVAGERY ONLY BY THE MASS EXTERMINATION OF POLISH JEWS " !!!!!!!!
( End quote )
One can find the sentence in the versions of Britannica from 1971 to 1986 ( entry : Yugoslavia , World War II ) .
Probably at later editions too ...

Minority groups such as Jews and Gypsies were to be eliminated as were the Serbs : it was declared that one - third of the Serbian population would be deported , one - third converted to Roman Catholicism , and one third liquidated .
... Ustasha bands terrorized the countryside .
The partial [ sic ! ] collaboration of the Catholic clergy in these practices continues to be a component of Serb - Croat suspicion .

Quote : Slavko Kvaternik ( the second in command to the Croatian WWII fuehrer , Dr Ante Pavelic ) explained ( on the day of formation of the WWII " Independent State of Croatia " , on April 10 , 1941 ) HOW PURE CROATIA SHOULD BE BUILT - by forcing one third of the Serbs to leave Croatia , one third to convert to Catholicism , and one third to be EXTERMINATED .
Soon Ustasha bands initiated a BLOODY ORGY of mass murder of Serbs unfortunate enough not to have converted or left Croatia on time .
THE ENORMITY OF SUCH CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR SHOCKED EVEN THE CONSCIENCE OF GERMAN COMMANDERS , but Pavelic had Hitler 's personal support for such actions which resulted in the loss of the lives of hundreds of thousands of Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina .
In addition , the Ustasa regime organized extermination camps , the most notorious one at JASENOVAC where Serbs , Jews , Gypsies , and other opponents were massacred in large numbers .

It had population of 6.3 million , of whom 3.3 million were Catholic Croats , 1.9 million Serbs , 700,000 Muslim ... , 40,000 Jews , 30,000 Gypsies ... ...
Shortly after taking control , the Ustasha , WITH THE SUPPORT OF MANY CROATS , EMBARKED UPON WHAT IT CALLED " THE PURGE OF CROATIA FROM FOREIGN ELEMENTS , " which had as its main purpose the ELIMINATION OF THE SERB MINORITY .
In a BRUTAL TERROR CAMPAIGN , more than half a million Serbs were killed , a quater of million expelled , and 200,000 forced to convert to Catholicism .
THE USTASHA REGIME IN CROATIA , AND PARTICULARLY THIS DRIVE IN THE SUMMER OF 1941 TO EXTERMINATE AND DISPOSSESS THE SERBS , WAS ONE OF THE MOST HORRENDOUS EPISODES OF WORLD WAR II !!!!!!!!!!
THE MURDER METHODS APPLIED BY THE USTASHA WERE EXTRAORDINARILY PRIMITIVE AND SADISTIC : thousands were hurled from mountain tops , other were beaten to death or their throats cut , entire villages were burned down , WOMEN RAPED , people sent to death marches in the middle of winter , and still others starved to death .

These are the figures used by most foreign authors , especially Germans , who were in the best position to know ...

Yet the horrors committed by Pavelic 's Ustashi troops proved to be of such bestiality as to shock even them : a most crushing evidence that the Ustashi massacres had surpassed ANYTHING experienced even by the Germany of Hitler .
The magnitude of the butchery can best be gauged by the fact that within the first three months , from April to June , 1941 , 120,000 people perished thus .
Proportionately to its duration and the smallness of the territory , it had been the greatest massacre to take place ANYWHERE in the West prior to , during , or after that greatest of cataclysms , the Second World War .

A characteristic method was binding pairs of prisoners , back to back , and then throwing them into the Sava River .

He was known as " Father Devil " .
At different places in encyclopediae it is said how Croats participated EN MASSE in the slaughter .
Actually , per capita , Croatia produced more soldiers then Nazi Germany .
They tried , wery hard , to prove that CROATS ARE THE BEST NAZI OF THEM ALL !
They were the best carriers of Hitler 's New World Order .
CROATIA WAS THE FIRST NAZI STATE IN WORLD WAR II EUROPE TO DECLARE WAR ON THE U.S. While Nazi Germany did it in 1943 , Croats did it as early as December 15 , 1941 .
REFERENCE # 16 : And who joined Nazi Croats in slaughtering the Serbs ?
You 've guessed it : The Muslims !
Encyclopedia of the Holocaust , Edition 1990 , Volume 2 , Pages 706 and 707 , entry Husseini , Hajj Amin Al ; The main Hitler 's supporter among Palestinian Arabs ...
Quote :
It so happened that Husseini made his contribution to the Axis war effort in his capacity as a Muslim , rather than as an Arab leader , by recruiting and organizing in RECORD TIME , during the spring of 1943 , BOSNIAN MUSLIM BATTALIONS in Croatia comprising some TWENTY THOUSAND MEN , These MUSLIM VOLUNTEER units , called Hanjar ( Sword ) , were put in WAFFEN - SS fought Yugoslav partisans in Bosnia , and carried out police and security duties in Hungary .
THEY PARTICIPATED IN THE MASSACRE OF CIVILIANS IN BOSNIA and VOLUNTEERED TO JOIN IN THE HUNT FOR JEWS IN CROATIA ...
The Germans made a point of publicizing the fact that Husseini had flown from Berlin to Sarajevo for the sole purpose of giving his blessing to the Muslim army and inspecting its arms and training exercises .
( End quote ) .
A photograph , on page 704 , shows al - Husseini inspecting Muslim troops in Bosnia .
TWENTY THOUSAND ( 20,000 ) Muslim volunteers for the Nazi SS - out of total population of 700,000 - that 's a HUGE response .
HERE WE GO AGAIN !
Nazi Ustashe succeded in murdering more than third out of more than two million Serbs that got under thir hands in Croatia and Bosnia in WWII .
Some 200,000 Serbs were forcefully converted to Catholicism .
Yes , you say , but it was 50 years ago ...
What happened next is that Communist dictator Tito , supported ( and sometimes supplied with arms and ammunition ) by Britain and USA got to control Yugoslavia .
He served as a useful puppet in a buffer zone against the Soviet block .
Tito , himself a CROAT , butchered Yugoslavia into six ( so called ) " Federative Republics " .
He was sure to chop the largest nation , the Serbs , into four republics .
And Republic of Serbia , itself , was the only one to be further divided ( into three pieces : Vojvodina , Kosovo and " Serbia proper " ) .
Some 42 % of Serbs got to live outside " Serbia proper " .
And that is the CRUX of today 's problem .
( For the above numbers look at : Paul Shoup " Communism and the Yugoslav National Question " .
Columbia , 1968 ) .
Next , the Croatian Communist dictator ordered Croatian and Muslim genocide of the Serbs to be forgotten - and new " Brotherhood and Unity " ( under Communist dictatorship ) to begin .
The mountain pits where whole Serbian villages were hurled into - were cemented !!!
And surviving Serbs were ordered NOT to come to the mass graves and morn their dead .
Some Ustashe Croats and Muslims got ( usually small ) positions in the new government .
Their Nazi elite ( including the above mentioned Croatian fuhrer Pavelic ) ESCAPED through Vatican organized " rat channels " .
Croatian priesthood was instrumental in helping some 50,000 worst European Nazi escape justice .
The whole operation was done with full knowledge of British and American intelligence .
The fascist murderers were proclaimed new " freedom fighters " against the Red Flood .
Many got positions in State Department ( as special advisers ) and other government institutions .
( The files describing the operation were declasified resently .
To learn more read recently published book " Unholy Trinity " , by Mark Aarons and John Loftus .
( Mr Loftus worked in the U.S. Justice Department in its Nazi- hunting unit ) .
You can easily find the book in any bookstore ...
( ISBN 0-312-07111-6 )
And the Serbs stuck to their Christian tradition and did not seek revenge .
They thought that the bloody episode will never repeat .
But the Ustasha elite in South and North America , Australia , immediately started to organize dreaming of good old days ...
The Serbs in many cases intermarried and started a new life .
This is what the Western press calls today " the ideal multiethnicity and tolerance of ex-Communist Yugoslavia .
So WHO WAS THE TOLERANT ONE ?
The murderer or his next door surviving victim - the Serb ?
Then came collapse of the Yugoslav economy ( induced by the U.S. ) and the rats came back home .
Under THE SAME USTASHI FLAG ( and giving the same threat speaches to the remaining Serbs ) .
Dr. Franjo Tudjman , holocaust revisionist and apologizer for Hitler - won the first elections for new " democratic " Independent State of Croatia .
With good suport of money he got from the Ustasha emigration .
The hell broke loose !
Today , Muslims and Croats , are once again united .
They were united under Hitler .
They were ( forcefully ! ) united by Bill Clinton .
Hating each other with racist passion , their only common goal is ( once again ) to slaughter and expel the remaining Serbs .
This is done under supervision of " neutral " UN , EC , US , NATO , ... Under watchful " unbiased " CNN , ABC , BBC , ... American bombers can bomd Christian children as much as they want .
American media can claim whatever they damn please .
The Western " intellectuals " are absorbing all the Nazi propaganda without question .
What ever happened to : COGITO ERGO SUM !
( I * THINK * therefore I exist ) .
Is the term " Western intellectual " an oxymoron ?
Can you please check the above quotes ?
Can you see the obvious ?
But the last ETHNIC CLEANSING of the remaining Serbs in Croatia and one half of Bosnia - Herzegovina - was done by " democrat " BILL CLINTON with help of NATO force .
At the same time the Western media had audacity to blame the Serbs for " Ethnic clensing " and even " self - cleansing " !!!!!!
It proves , once again , that a copy can never be as good as the original .
ORIGINAL NAZIS WERE BETTER .
At least they were honest to say , the FIRST DAY , what they planed to do with Jews , Serbs , other Slavs .
Today 's Nazi are covering their act calling it " democracy " , " peace " ...
The replica of the USTASHA FLAG FREELY FLIES in front of the United Nations .
It flies freely IN JASENOVAC , ABOVE THE MASS GRAVE OF SOME 600,000 VICTIMS .
Do you see a better sarcasm !?
On May 1st , 1995 Croatian army , carring Ustasha symbols and flags , broke through the UN lines .
They did it at will .
They did it with the knowledge and support of Washington .
They flooded so called " United Nations Protected Zone - West " .
The Serbs were ordered by the " international community " , well in advance , to disarm and put their heavy weapons under UN supervision .
Just days before , under Croatian " pressure " , the zones were renamed to UNCRO = United Nations Confidence Restauration Operation .
What a sarcasm !!!
What a crime !
Ustasha tanks went over civillians .
Women and children were machinegunned .
A few thousand were murdered in cold blood .
The New York Times ( and alike Big Brother Trumpets ) praised " liberation " of part of Croatia ...
There was also a short note that Croatian police did not let newspapermen in for couple a days and that the whole area stunk of chlorine .
The roads were hozed but still pools of blood were visible ...
At least , that time , for some reason , the Serbs were not blamed for that particular genocide .
The front page of the New York Times carried a story of how ( aledgedly )
Serbs fired two rockets with cluster bombs to Zagreb .
The rockets killed two people , the story says .
The front page shows a body .
A lady lies on the main street , face down , in chrystal clear white coat .
A bus is in the background .
All window panes intact .
The Serbs have amazing rockets .
Cluster rockets at that .
And here is the sarcastic result of NATO - Croatian - Nazi genocide of the last year :
The leader of the Croatian Serbs is declaired a war criminal ....
And no Croat .
Today , Nazi Croatia is the MOST ETHNICALLY PURE COUNTRY OF EUROPE .
Hitler and Pavelic must be laughing in their graves .
There will be no justice in the Hague Kangaroo Court .
But would there be enough room for all the souls of the " democratic West " that were the architects of the Yugoslav tragedy ?
WE RECOMMEND : Pavelic papers !
The web site devoted to study of Ustashas and their leader Dr. Ante Pavelic RELATED TOPICS : Croat Furhrer of WWII
Modern history does not know of another such beast !
Croat Furhrer of recent wars
Creator of the newest " Independent State of Croatia " was not simply a racist , anti-Semite and revisionist of history , he was not only Ustasha sympathizer - he did his best so horrible Croat Nazi history repeats itself .
Who said " Never again ! " ?

It ’s all about perspective .
Some voters see Arizona U.S. Senator John McCain ’s torture in a Viet Cong prisoner - of - war camp as a badge of honor .
Others claim the years of agony made him lose his mind .
Still others , even in his home state , do n't even know he was a torture victim .
Regardless of your opinion ( or lack thereof ) you might enjoy reading this 34 - year old , 44 page military report , which describes Commander John S. McCain ’s treatment by the Viet Cong .
The report is available on the Department of Defense ’s Web site .
It was “ sanitized ” in August 2000 .
As a result , you ’ll see a few black - marker redactions , but they ’re fairly limited .
In related news , the Drudge Retort claims that McCain ’s Vietnamese jailer ( now 75 years old ) is saying McCain was “ very loyal to the U.S. military , to his beliefs and to his country .
In all of our debates , he never admitted that the war was a mistake . ”
According to the Retort ( dubbed a liberal version of the Druge Report ) , Tran Trong Duyet also said , " If I were an American voter , I would vote for Mr. John McCain . "
Quipped one Retort commenter , " Looks like McCain 's getting out the torture vote . "
I know who I am and I know that I know who I am .
In the language of psychology , this means I am a conscious being , someone who thinks rather than reacts .
Someone who takes in her surroundings and processes that information , milling it over in the mind , thinking about it .
It also means I am self - aware .
I know myself , know I exist and know I am a separate from others .
According to anthropologists , many animals have a kind of consciousness , but only humans and the great apes are self - conscious .
Apparently , the big and complex brains of humans and apes , which may have evolved for other tasks , blossomed with an added sense of self .
We know that humans are self - conscious because we can talk to our inner selves , but how do researchers know apes are also self - conscious ?
In a series of experiments , researchers placed a mirror into the cage of an adult chimpanzee .
They let the chimp spend some time looking at himself , which he did with great curiosity .
And then one afternoon , when the ape was snoozing , a researcher sneaked in and painted a large swatch of red paint on the animal ’s forehead .
When the chimp woke up , he looked in the mirror and immediately tried to wipe the red patch from his face .
Gorillas have also responded to the mirror test in the same way , which means both apes really know that the image in the mirror is them .
In contrast , macaque monkeys just leaped at the mirror and screamed at the image which they saw as another monkey , not themselves .
In an existential way , apes seem to be aware of their existence , like people .
Consciousness and self - awareness might be special gifts in apes and human , but people seem to have a hard time accepting these gifts .
In fact , we spend most of the day trying to get away from all that consciousness and self - awareness .
We cloud our minds with memories of the past or fantasies of the future .
We focus not on what is right in front of our faces , but fritter those thoughts away .
We daydream while making dinner .
We listen to the radio while stuck in traffic .
We drink , take drugs , read books and watch movies , all ways to push consciousness and self - awareness to the side .
Our species likes best to be dizzy , distracted , buzzed and totally out of our minds .
We know that we know , but I guess we ’d rather not know .

CPS : Texas polygamist sect teen who gave birth is adult Polygamist sect teen who gave birth is adult , Texas CPS says
Texas Child Protective Services conceded Tuesday that a pregnant teen taken from a polygamists ' ranch in West Texas was an adult when she gave birth in San Marcos last month , casting some doubt on the statistics released by the agency that more than 20 underage girls were pregnant or had given birth .
The teenager , 18 - year - old Pamela Jeffs , gave birth to a boy on April 29 .
CPS officials said she was one of 27 girls in a " disputed " minor category who once told CPS they were adults but later indicated they were under 18 .
All 27 girls were among 463 children taken from the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ' Yearning For Zion Ranch near Eldorado on April 4 and 5 after the state insisted all were either sexually or physically abused or at risk of abuse .
Three weeks later , the children were scattered to foster care facilities throughout the state .
And now some are claiming to be have been adults all along .
The revelation came at a hearing in San Angelo on Tuesday , when a CPS attorney said a new mother who was in protective custody as a minor was in fact an adult , CPS spokeswoman Marleigh Meisner said .
The CPS attorney told state District Judge Barbara Walther that the mother of a healthy boy born in San Marcos weeks after the removals was now considered to be at least 18 , and was free to go .
It was not clear if she had left her newborn , who is still in state custody .
" We had solid proof , including state - issued documents , " said Natalie Malonis , an attorney for the woman .
While some adult women were allowed to remain in foster care with children under the age of 1 year , other mothers were considered to be underage and therefore , foster children , as well as their own children .
But the San Angelo hearing of the Jeffs case , which was rescheduled to continue Friday , was the first time CPS has acknowledged officially that some females in their care may be women , not underage girls .
" We consider the woman an adult , " said Chris Van Deusen , a CPS spokesman in Austin .
CPS officials said they could not say whether there are any other " women " being held in foster care , as was the case with Pamela Jeffs .
Another dispute
Court challenges are coming fast and furious in this widely watched case , the largest child custody proceeding in history .
Two days ago , another disputed minor gave birth , this time in Austin .
Her husband , Dan Jessop , has insisted his wife is 22 and that both he and attorneys have tried to prove that to CPS .
But his wife remains in a foster home with their newborn , separated from their other children , who are in another facility .
CPS officials say that , while they are looking into that case , there has been no determination that the Austin FLDS mother is an adult .
Jessop and his attorneys filed for a temporary restraining order in Austin , just hours after his new son was born , to prevent CPS officials from keeping the newborn without his mother in foster care and keep the two in Travis County .
A judge will hear the case again on Thursday .
Daily visits allowed
Another legal victory for the Mormon breakaway sect came in San Antonio on Tuesday when a judge there ruled a FLDS couple can have daily visits with their three children .
In 10 days , there will be a hearing to decide their custody .
In that case , Rene Haas , attorney for FLDS member Joseph Jessop Sr. , met with CPS attorneys in District Judge Michael Peden 's chambers .
" It is the system run amok , " Haas said .
Joseph and Lori Jessop beamed after learning Peden had granted the order .
They said they did n't know where the state had sent their 4 - year - old daughter and 2 1/ 2 - year - old son , but as a nursing mother Lori Jessop has been allowed to care for her infant son , who is in a foster care facility in San Antonio , during the day .
Joseph Jessop is 27 , and Lori Jessop is 25 , according to court documents .
They 're not in a plural marriage and lived in a single - family unit at the Yearning For Zion Ranch .
Elizabeth Allen and Nancy Martinez in San Antonio contributed .

EMS Machine – what it is and how it works was in the limelight .
The machine uses a technique called electrostimulation , which mimics the process of the brain when it signals the muscles to contract and expand .
The muscles in the body are contracted when the brain sends a command in the form of electrical signals through the nerves .
Due to this signal , the muscles in the body contract or expand .
The machine developed by COM directly targets the motor nerves generating contraction and expansion using electrical impulses .
The simulation can occur in two forms – through motor nerves or sensory nerve fibers .

NEW YORK – With George W. Bush visiting Germany and other parts of Europe this week , German newspapers have been slamming the U.S. president in language stronger than most American dailies use .
The Der Spiegel publication compiled some of the comments , which are quoted below .
— Berliner Zeitung : “ Rarely has an American president been less popular in this country .
And rarely has one embodied the arrogance of power more convincingly than Bush .
“ It is unforgotten how he humiliated the United Nations , how he went to war against Iraq with a ‘ Coalition of the Willing , ’ how his closest aides portrayed France and Germany as wimps .
Bush discredited values which had brought United States worldwide respect .
Many have lost faith in America because of the false reasons given for the war , the unlawful imprisonment of terror suspects in Guantanamo , or the photos of Abu Ghraib . ”
— Handelsblatt : “ Bush junior was n’t up to the challenge following the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , because he let himself be pushed into an unwarranted war by listening to the wrong advisers , and thereby prevented a broad front against terrorism .
Constructive Middle East policy was made more difficult , and the regime in Iran was strengthened .
Bush did n’t just boycott the Kyoto Protocol , he persistently undermined it — and thereby helped polluters such as China .
With this unilateralism Bush damaged America ’s reputation and curtailed his room for maneuver . ”
— Suddeutsche Zeitung : “ In Germany , America is no longer seen as a country of individual liberty , as a reliable ally , and definitely not as a model .
There are a large number of justified accusations leveled at Bush ’s policies .
They include dangerous naivete , lies , and the sustained infringement of human rights .
“ Bush wo n’t care , but in the thoughts and feeling of many Germans he is leaving behind a mixture of antipathy , ridicule , anger , and skepticism towards U.S. policies and towards America in general .
Differentiating between the two has become more difficult with every year of his presidency .
The memory of Bush will darken America ’s image in the world for years to come . ”
— The conservative Die Welt went easier on Bush , though it did criticize him a little .
Its comments : “ George W. Bush and his government made mistakes .
The biggest was to think that democracy could be exported with a guarantee of success .
But those who see George W. Bush as having stepped outside the boundaries of Western constitutional values ignore two things :
Firstly , the United States really was attacked on Sept. 11 , 2001 , not Germany or France .
The U.S. has good reasons to respond decisively to that .
And secondly , it ’s not as though much - praised multilateralism would have made the world a much safer place .
Often it was merely an excuse for staying out of trouble and quietly relying on the U.S. to be there when things got serious .
“ It ’s not just George W. Bush who ’s unwelcome .
Ever since Reagan ’s Berlin visit in 1987 , American presidents have n’t been especially welcome whenever they embodied the uncomfortable aspect of the Atlantic alliance , which many regard as a burden that should be discarded soon .
But the Bush critics are overlooking one thing : Whether Obama or McCain , the coming president of the U.S. will be a difficult partner . ”

The Thirteen American Arguments : Enduring Debates That Define and Inspire Our Country
by Howard Fineman
Random House , 320 pp .
Americans love to argue .
In fact , we would not be Americans if we did n’t .
So says journalist Howard Fineman in his new book , The Thirteen American Arguments : Enduring Debates that Define and Inspire Our Country .
Arguing , Fineman says , is what we do and who we are .
“ We are the arguing country , born in and born to debate , ” he writes .
“ We are an endless argument . ”
Fineman is Newsweekâ€™s senior Washington correspondent and columnist , and heâ€™s a news analyst for NBC and MSNBC .
By his own description , he has covered every presidential campaign and major candidate since 1983 .
In The Thirteen American Arguments , Fineman taps into his decades of experience to find perspective on the American experiment .
He looks not at petty partisan bickering and political posturing but rather at the larger , fundamental questions Americans have wrestled over since the country ’s founding .
“ To understand our nature , and to sustain it , we need to appreciate the lucky mix of accident and intention that made us who we are , ”  he writes .
“ We have been debating our very identity from the first days of our existence .
Was this to be a Christian New Jerusalem , a Dutch speculation , or an English shire ? ”
Those competing views in many ways still jockey for dominance , he says , but the most important thing is the tug - of - war balance that has resulted .
In that same way , America has defined itself through thirteen ongoing arguments that , in various combinations , pit the State , Church , Tribe , Market , and Academy against one another — with individuals caught in the middle .
The tug - of - war balance that results from the arguments themselves “ define , inspire , and ultimately unite us by bestowing legitimacy on hard - fought deals , ” Fineman says .
“ Arguing keep us moving fitfully forward . ”
Fineman arranges his arguments into what he calls “ concentric circles ” that ripple out from the individual to the world itself and , finally , to the abstract ideal .
For instance , who is a person , who is an American , and what responsibilities do Americans have toward each other ?
What can Americans be told to believe in matters of faith ?
As a country , how do we define money and manage debt ?
How do we balance centralized versus decentralized government ?
What is the relative strength of the president “ in a federal scheme dedicated to find the midpoint between monarch and mob ? ”
What is our place in the world and what is out relationship with other countries ?
What role do trade , diplomacy , and war play in those relationships ?
Does the environment belong to the current generation to use and exploit or is the environment something we hold in trust for future generations ?
And what does it mean to have — and what do we have to do to achieve — that “ more perfect Union ”  our Founding Fathers envisioned ?
Do n’t expect to find the arguments articulated in a civics book .
As packaged neatly here in a convenient and catchy list of thirteen , they are Fineman ’s creations , but the debates themselves are certainly as old and as vital as Fineman suggests .
Fineman explores each question from historical as well as modern perspectives , taking great care to first ground each question by drawing on contemporary events .
As he explores “ Who is a person , ”  for instance , he starts on the steps of the Illinois state capital as Barack Obama launched his presidential bid .
Fineman draws parallels between Obama and Lincoln , “ the Great Emancipator , ” and from there examines a number of facets to the question of personhood .
He looks at the old debate over slavery ( were slaves people or property ) , the current debate over abortion ( when does a fetus qualify for “ personhood ”  ) and the not - too - distant questions that will arise in the future over genetic experimentation .
If Fineman had his way , Americans would argue more .
“ Rather than argue too much , which is the conventional wisdom ’s critique , we in fact do not argue enough about the fundamentals , ”  he says .
The Thirteen American Arguments , he hopes , is one more way to encourage continued dialogue — a dialogue in which everyone has a role .
“ If arguing is our saving grace , everyone must feel they have a voice and a chance to be heard , ”  he writes .
“ Do they ? ”
And the argument goes on .
AP Files 7 DMCA Takedowns Against Drudge Retort
I 'm currently engaged in a legal disagreement with the Associated Press , which claims that Drudge Retort users linking to its stories are violating its copyright and committing " ' hot news ' misappropriation under New York state law . "
An AP attorney filed six Digital Millenium Copyright
Act takedown requests this week demanding the removal of blog entries and another for a user comment .
The Retort is a community site comparable in function to Digg , Reddit and Mixx .
The 8,500 users of the site contribute blog entries of their own authorship and links to interesting news articles on the web , which appear immediately on the site .
None of the six entries challenged by AP , which include two that I posted myself , contains the full text of an AP story or anything close to it .
They reproduce short excerpts of the articles -- ranging in length from 33 to 79 words -- and five of the six have a user - created headline .
Here 's one of the six disputed blog entries :
Clinton Expects Race to End Next Week Hillary Rodham Clinton says she expects her marathon Democratic race against Barack Obama to be resolved next week , as superdelegates decide who is the stronger candidate in the fall .
" I think that after the final primaries , people are going to start making up their minds , " she said .
" I think that is the natural progression that one would expect . "
If you follow the link , you 'll see that the blog entry reproduces 18 words from the story and a 32 - word quote by Hillary Clinton under a user - written headline .
The blog entry drew 108 comments in the ensuing discussion .
I have all the expertise in intellectual property law of somebody who 's never been sued , so standard disclaimers apply .
But I have difficulty seeing how it violates copyright law for a blogger to link to a news story with a short snippet of the story in furtherance of public discussion .
AP feels otherwise .
In a June 3 letter , AP 's Intellectual Property Governance Coordinator Irene Keselman told me :
... you purport that the Drudge Retort 's users reproduce and display AP headlines and leads under a fair use defense .
Please note that contrary to your assertion , AP considers that the Drudge Retort users ' use of AP content does not fall within the parameters of fair use .
The use is not fair use simply because the work copied happened to be a news article and that the use is of the headline and the first few sentences only .
This is a misunderstanding of the doctrine of " fair use . "
AP considers taking the headline and lede of a story without a proper license to be an infringement of its copyrights , and additionally constitutes " hot news " misappropriation .
In another DMCA takedown , AP contends that the following user comment is a copyright violation :
Well , the oil execs just put another refinery in South Dakota .
Maybe they 're a bunch of retards .
www.foxnews.com
Hyperion has said the project , about 60 miles south of Sioux Falls , would create 1,800 permanent jobs and another 4,500 construction jobs over a four - year period .
Construction could begin in 2010 .
The Hyperion Energy Center would process 400,000 barrels of thick Canadian crude oil a day , which company executives say would help the U.S. reduce its dependence on overseas oil .
The company has said it will bring in the crude oil by pipeline but has announced no specific plans for that transportation link .
The user reproduced the last two paragraphs of his comment from the linked Fox News article , written by AP .
AP has filed copyright lawsuits against the VeriSign division Moreover last fall and another against the Florida company All Headline News this year .
I have no desire to be the third member of that club , but sharing links to news stories of interest has become an essential component of how millions of people read and evaluate the news today .
When linking to articles , bloggers commonly include excerpts of the article for the purposes of criticism or discussion .
Some AP member sites encourage this kind of reuse .
Yahoo
News , the source for two disputed stories , invites bloggers to use items from its RSS feeds .
USA Today , the source for two others , includes a browser widget alongside articles that facilitates their submission to Digg , Mixx and other sites .
Wade Duchene , the attorney who helped me win the domain name arbitration for Wargames .
Com , says that what we 're doing on the Retort is the " absolute definition of fair use . "
The DMCA requires that the six blog entries and comment immediately be taken down , regardless of whether I think they 're fair use , but users have the option to file counter - notices to AP asserting their own copyright .
Because the issue affects all bloggers , I 've invited Keselman to explain AP 's position at more length .
If she accepts I 'll post it in full here on Workbench and the Retort .
Assuming I have copyright permission , of course .

The ' man ' is bringing you down aye ?
Start hacking them until they capiulate .
AP 's being an idiot .
When Drudgies quote an article , we usually provide a link to the source , which encourages other Drudgies to check out whether we 're making stuff up , misquoting their hero , or generally slandering the other side .
This means more eyeballs and hits on their article or website which translates into more revenue .
Free advertising can't be such a bad thing , can it ?
Unless they really believe all us people are wandering onto their site by ourselves .
If that 's the case , Mr. AP , I 've got a server farm in Brooklyn I could give you a great deal on .
This is totally a bogus lawsuit and I hope that you will be able to prevail against Goliath .
This is a total infridgement of the first admendment .
You have the right to quote what a newspaper said as long as you do n't copy and paste the story .
This entire action is because the mainstream media just does n't have a clue how to compete on the web .
They hate free speech and they hate us all .
Our website ( racing related ) blows most of the others that are owned by large newspapers .
I guess their ploy is to scare all of us and shut us down , but Americans will not stand for it .
Keep the fight going , and I wish you the best .
I think many will come to your defense .
Ben Franklin said that we either " hang together , or we will hand separately ! "
Simply Amazing !
America is suffering from the politially correctness issue .
Being PC has changed the way folks are allowed to express themselves , and thus nobody does anything anymore .
And those who do get stiffled - it applies to this .
AP is being stupid for doing this to Drudge or anyone else .
Same thing with selling Portions and companies to countries , they own US propertys and can in one stroke detroy portions of hwat was once the USA .
Kick out foreign investors !!
WTF ?
They 're going after you but not drudgereport.com ?
Understand the liberal press has no use for you !
You are not a " one world " participant and probably will become par of the fairness doctrine !
Fuck it Rogers , it 's just a blip in the grand shceme of things ....... Smoke and bowl , drink a beer , and listen to some good tunes ...
It could always be worse .
Ballad of
Hahahahahah .... obviously I have been doing both .......
But hey , I got tomorrow off .... sallright
The world has indeed gone mad .
( Well , America , at least )
This could set a ridiculous precedent which would harm the news sites of the web , along with the blogs which point to them and quote them .
Nuts .
Kosso
We should be suing AP for diseminateng false info .
Their articles , especially their headlines , are so biased and misleading they almost meet the threshold of lies .
Rogers , have you posted anywhere your message to which the AP responded ?
With that it would be easier to evaluate the AP 's rebuttal .
The brief excerpt of the AP letter you published looks to me to be a carefully weasel worded and authoritative - sounding dramatic piece while staying carefully away from the actual principles of fair use .
Oddly enough in some small way the AP will be reducing their exposure .
Drudge Retort is the third site I go to everyday .
It is the first news site I look for .
The sites I look at otherwise , many of them staff their own writers .
Wonder why the AP is doing this ... what is the productive value or result ?
Snapped
Shot went through this recently as well .
He has some recommended links for someone in a similar situation .
Details are linked right below his logo ( " What happened to the pictures ? " ) .
Good luck .

Their claim that " this does not meet fair use " is correct , since they cited something unrelated when stating that .
Fair use would however still apply as a valid claim if you are properly and visibly attributing the quotes .
Frankly if you 're not , you deserve to get sued .
It 's not hard to give credit to the reporter and publication who put the work in , without which you'd be talking about cats .
Show a little appreciation .
Once you 've done that , or started , I 'd suggest then you can tell them to get stuffed and point them to the blogs .
google search results for their next notable story .
Note the following from the U.S. Copyright office definition of fair use ...
Copyright protects the particular way an author has expressed himself ; it does not extend to any ideas , systems , or factual information conveyed in the work .
Short version : simply stop quoting directly from AP articles .
Yes , it 's a standard blogger courtesy , but they obviously want to operate under a different standard .
The facts are all anyone cares about anyway , and they explicitly DO NOT own them .
Their purple prose is irrelevant .
Simply restate anything from an AP article in your own words , and I suppose link to the article if you really feel it 's necessary .
Quotations from individuals would seem to me to be factual information , but I suppose that is open to interpretation .
If they truly want to make themselves that much more irrelevant , more power to them .
There are other , better news sources out there , after all .
My two cents
People are commenting all over , but you 've only posted one paragraph of your communications Rogers .
You really need to post all of the communications .
By just taking the one quote , we do n't know for sure what the story is .
Perhaps a link to all communications , with email and phone numbers blocked out .
I 'm not a lawyer , but never let that stop me .
I could see where AP was coming from .
Your posters do n't add to the initial posting .
They do n't use the excerpt in a larger work , or provide commentary .
If the title and leading paragraphs summarize the story effectively , the site is actually impacting on AP 's earnings by exposing enough of the story that people are n't interested in clicking through , and therefore impacting on AP earnings .
Your site does solicit advertisers .
You do make money from the site .
It 's hard to say , though , as you 've cherry picked through the material you 've presented , and now you 're asking the court of weblogging opinion to rule .
Give us all the facts -- links to all the stories that have received the DCMA notices , and the communications .
Let us express opinions based on having access to all the material , not a self - selected representation .
Ouch , my deepest sympathies !
If you need any advice , I 'd be happy to point you to the people that helped me through my little troubles .
Feel free to drop me a line , any time !
Respectfully ,
Brian / snapped shot
Shelley : I 've included the communications that relate directly to the issue that 's in dispute -- whether bloggers are violating copyright when they excerpt a few sentences and quotes from a news story when linking to it .
The only stuff I have n't posted relates to how the Retort first heard from the AP in May , which was because of a few examples of users posting full text of articles in their blog entries .
I neither condone nor encourage that practice , so I honored the DMCA takedowns and posted these two announcements on the Retort :
Retort : Copyright Complaint
Retort : Copyright Complaint Followup
One of those takedowns was for a blogger who just linked a few sentences from an AP story .
After taking it down , I expressed my concern to AP 's lawyer that it was fair use , which is what she was replying to in the quote I used in my blog entry .
If this leads to litigation , I 'll post all of the documents .
But I 'm hoping that it 's possible to resolve it more easily than that .
" One of those takedowns was for a blogger who just linked a few sentences from an AP story . "
And the story was ?
And the sentences were ?
You know , if you were to post a three sentence review of a mystery story , but the three sentences you pick tell who dun it , that would most likely not fall under fair use .
Can you see what I 'm saying about having specifics being important ?
It 's not necessarily the amount , as much as the use , and exactly what material was copied and the economic impact on the publication that was copied .
If you copy the best bits and leave no reason for someone to click through , do you really consider that fair use ?
Especially when Drudge Retort profits from such copying ?
I 'm not a lawyer , but even I can see how this is n't a cut and dried issue of Big Bad AP going after poor little Drudge Retort .
Ha !
These incestuous Troglodyte nitwits all steal from one another .
But they will hang any peasant caught gleaning a little firewood in their forest !
Robin Hood time , baby !
The AP is going to go down in flames on this one .
Shame on them for trying to intimidate you .
AP is developing a bad reputation for trying to bully and litigate their declining business model .
Companies like Moreover and All Headline News and sites even like Drudge Retort a threats to the AP 's business model of owning the news .
This has nothing to do about fair use , AP is simply trying to bully people and companies ..
Shame on the Associated Pressd ..
They steal stuff all the time .
From Wikipedia :
" ... the fair use of a copyrighted work , including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section , for purposes such as criticism , comment , news reporting , teaching ( including multiple copies for classroom use ) , scholarship , or research , is not an infringement of copyright . "
Who owns the news ?
That most people can't properly quote and attribute sources is no secret .
This does n't invalidate their opinions .
Whether your readership discerns for itself the credibility of those opinions , should n't concern the AP .
After all , the moderately educated can discern credibility within the first few lines of any writing ; bringing to the fore the cruxt of AP 's problem :
You 're proving information gatekeepers , like itself , unnecessary .
Plus , the AP fails to comprehend that heckling mal - informed idiots is a quirky source of entertainment , the pleasure of which no readership should ever be deprived .
Just read the comments of some of the regulars on this site to know what I mean .
In my humble opinion , you 're providing a great service .
Keep up the good work !
Smoke and bowl , indeed .
This seems vaguely robotic on AP 's part , a reflex instead of malicious or defensive .
Even so , they suck blue whale dick and should be hung .
Never mind I got totally off topic .
I got autism .
I went back and read your article , again .
My point stands :
Most people can't properly quote or attribute sources .
Does that mean that only people with journalism degrees have the right to discuss what gatekeepers consider news worthy ?
AP is a dinosour faced with emminent extinction .
Everybody sing the so long goodbye song and wave .
Long live the internet !
Bourne
The facts of the news are fair use .. only the " expression " is protected ...
It 's pretty clear by looking at AP vs Moreover and AP vs All Headline News and now the Retort issue is that they want to claim ownership of the " facts " in the veil of their " Hot News " claim .
So What is next ??
AP is going to sue Wikipedia ?
Because the Wikipedians are publishing news stories based on the facts of world and national events ?
Why do n't you try doing the attribution thing ( not just a link , but the reporter and org ) and add some commentary on all future posts and see if that mollifies them .
If not , solicit contributions and / or free legal help and challenge them .
You might try EFF and follow their expert advice as well .
You 'll have plenty of extra rocks in your slingshot if Goliath comes calling again .
I respect the work of others and deserve the same respect for mine .
But Goliath seeks to intimidate concessions that might be unattainable in court .
Mr. Drudge is not qualified to comment on anything anyway .
But he makes money based on the cretins that listen to and read his words .
There is a reason this country is going to hell .
It 's full of idiots that listen to asses like this jerk .
( Excuse my mixed metaphor . )
Who cares if the AP is right or wrong in this .
If nobody paid any attention to this twit he would go away .
Counter sue for frivolous litigation , or what ever the correct lawyer term is .
It IS against the law to send legal notices to people when its pure bullshit .
If you can get a judge to decide that the AP 's claim under the DMCA is so far fetched that it could only have been malicious in nature you 'll have scored a major victory for fair use on the net .
Hhaha , the good - ol ' clueless " contributing news fucks " called AP - they have the * WORST * track record when it comes to news from Europe , I swear .
No wonder , they use all kind of BS submitted by contributing members - they are so fuckin ' clueless I remember once occasion they were talking about Middle Ages and countries like Romania , Slovakia etc ...
I guess the writer - probably some localized fuckup - never took any history class , forget checking out some maps .:D
... AP , the bunch fuckin ' snotty idiots with oh - so - much fuckin ' clue about anything ...
... well , I guess that 's what you get when you are a so - called " standard " ( I swear this is what these idiots have in their WIki page ! ) - and that 's why you end up firing your correspondent when it turns out he fabricated more than 40 stories ( see 2003 scandal . )
Take them to court , I bet EFF will be more than happy to do it on your behalf , a pro bono - hey , that 's why I pay my membership fee ! :)
Rogers , why you use it is most important .
Copyright was intended to encourage the creation of a public culture .
People in the East were circulating their work privately because somebody would head out West with one copy , republish it under a different cover and his own name .
If sued , he'd get a cousin to swear he saw the perp spend years writing it .
Copyright was to establish authorship ( primarily by sending the first copy to Washington ) and stop outright theft , not to prevent quoting , criticism and public discourse as ideas spread through the culture .
No matter how AP chooses to interpret fair use ( absurdly for a news organization , that seems to be , " We own these words and nobody had better dare quote us " ) , the citations on these blogs fall squarely into the criticism and comment exceptions cited below .
It 's probably not the news division that 's buffeting you -- you clearly seem to be on the right side of this law here :
TITLE 17 > CHAPTER 1 > 107
Prev |
Next
107 .
Limitations on exclusive rights : Fair use
Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A , the fair use of a copyrighted work , including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section , for purposes such as criticism , comment , news reporting , teaching ( including multiple copies for classroom use ) , scholarship , or research , is not an infringement of copyright .
In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include --
(1 ) the purpose and character of the use , including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes ;
( 2 ) the nature of the copyrighted work ;
(3 ) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole ; and
( 4 ) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work .
The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors .
" Mr. Drudge is not qualified to comment on anything anyway .
But he makes money based on the cretins that listen to and read his words . "
Wake up Doug. Drudge is Headlines and links .
Nothing more .
As for the AP , in good time it shall die .
Buh - bye .
See my I 'd say they 're morons , but that would n't be PC now , would it ? "
Roger ,
As most of the stories that have links go directly back to the original site , with the associated quoted material , I do not see how it would possibly fall under " misuse " .
For you to get the attention of AP should tell you a couple of things , 1 ) You must be doing pretty good 2 ) They must be hurting .
Most of the standard news orgs .
have seen a sever decline in readership ; NY Times , LA Times , Washington Post etc. and these are the ones that AP counts on for revenue .
I think they are now lashing out to find new sources of income .
They attribute the fall to these sorts of web sites , but in fact it is due to the number of times we now find them printing false or misleading articles .
They have lost the confidence of the public .
They will probably come to you for a " settlement " ( Black mail ) that they will drop the suits if you kick them xxxx everytime someone links to their web site .
Personally I would tell them to pound sand .
You may want to contact the other blog groups to see if they are getting the same issue with AP .
If they are you should take it back as a class action suit against AP for restraint of trade .
All the best .
Frank
Does this mean that , when the press publishes something false or misleading ( at the risk of being taken to court by AP , I wo n't cite specific examples of " news " that comes out of the White House that is more often than not " innaccurate " ) , I do n't have the right to point it out because it 's illegal to " compare and contrast " to illustrate the truth and prove my point ?
How does one tell AP that they got it wrong when you can't cite their errors ?
Realistically , though , how many of us could they actually put in jail , anyway ... oops , I almost forgot the Bush - approved , Halliburton - built U.S. camps for " terrorists " !
Never mind !
Ooooooooooo !
We do the same thing .
Dozens of articles linked every day .
Could the AP lawyers please sue us ?
We could use the publicity .
Pretty please ?
With sugar on it ?
This is a co-ordinated attack at the freedom of the internet .
It is planned by corporations to attack all the blog sites with rights of ownership and licencing suits .
They do n't want blogger links and traffic ?
Fine .
I say we oblige .
The AP can rely on newspapers to spread their influence and raise revenue .
After all , newspapers are the information source of the future , right ?
I quote news articles extensively in order to frame discussions , especially of politics and human rights issues .
Since I can't depend on the original source and URL being permanently available , I quote entire paragraphs , with attribution , as fair use .
I believe as well this gives readers important background for discussion , without requiring them to have the leisure time to go physically to a library and look up sources .
Thanks ,
Rogers , for keeping us all up to date !
I wrote about AP 's suit against Moreover in an earlier blog post on ContentBlogger .
I went through the AP suit against Moreover in detail and found shaky grounds at best for AP 's claims .
AP 's claims against you appear to be even more shaky in regards to the selections that you have displayed in this blog post .
You are showing just the headline and the lede sentence .
I understand AP 's position on this and I respect the people at AP greatly , but on this point they know that they are wrong .
They are wrong not only on the basis of Fair Use , but also on another more fundamental and important factor : you can not copyright facts .
In the examples that you provided in this weblog the information provided was not a substantially original work of authorship but simply short sentences and phrases capturing the facts of major public events .
To deny the free dissemination of such facts would seem to be contrary to the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution .
Do not citizens have the right to spread the news of events to fellow citizens ?
Did Paul Revere say after " The British are coming " the phrase " This news is copyrighted by Paul Revere , all rights reserved ? "
No , allowing the fact that major events have occurred with attribution of the source is a fundamental function of both freedom of the press and of American democracy .
I would be glad to support any company wishing to defend themselves against suits of this kind as an industry expert witness .
To my friends at AP , I can only say that you 're fighting the wrong battle - and I do hope that you lose it for your own sake and of the sake of free - speaking people everywhere .
Sincerely ,
John Blossom

I wonder what the law says about tool tips as a " preview " of the article .
So ... is this a test case for going after Digg ?
I 'm not sure this will actually help you in fighting back against the Associated Press ' hyper- sensitive reaction to unapproved ( =unpaid ) publication of mere extracts from their news reports , but it may be of some interest .
As everyone knows , it 's not only blogs that routinely quote news sources in the way your site does , but also forums , and the presence of a lively forum ( with useful quotes ) is typically helpful to the hosting site 's revenue .
So , have takedown notices ever been issued by the AP ( or others ) based on quotation by forum participants ?
Perhaps an attorney specialized in copyright has heard of such a case .
In the meantime , I draw the following example to the attention of readers :
www.healingwell.com
The same page contains two different posts by " Veteran Member " MitzMN .
The first appears to be a complete reproduction of an article from the Minneapolis newspaper Star - Tribune , complete with copyright notice .
But of course only the Star - Tribune can complain about that ( if they have the nerve , they would seem to have the legal right ) .
Further down on the same forum page is MitzMN 's second post , this time from the AP , accompanied by not only the AP 's copyright notice but also its standard warning , " This material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten or redistributed . "
You might want to point this " crime " out to the AP and see if they send a takedown notice to HealingWell.com too , which has apparently been " damaging " AP for approximately 10 months , during which time the AP legal division either knew about it but did n't care , or never bothered to perform a simple Google search on the article 's key phrases + the company 's own name .
This could be the intellectual property equivalent of " driving while black . "
( By the way , readers interested in the criminal - like behavior of America 's pharmaceutical industry should search the same page for " EneMan " -- the reason why I recently bookmarked it ) .
The URL in my comment just a minute ago was somehow shortened when posted .
I hope this conveys the correct reference :
healingwell.com /

I could not be any more with Shelley .
I 'm not a lawyer , but even I can see how this is n't a cut and dried issue of Big Bad AP going after poor little Drudge Retort .
I do n't think it 's cut and dried either , Shelley .
There are no bright lines in fair use that you can rely on to judge whether your reproduction is legal or not in a disagreement like this .
But what we 're talking about here are bloggers sharing links to news stories using excerpts of 400 characters or less ( around 80 words ) .
I 'm willing to explore user interface changes that encourage users to do more of their own writing , add supplementary links and the like .
But in the times they do n't , I think it should be considered fair use .
There are very few news stories where an 80 - word excerpt would replace the need to read the entire story .
As a blogger , it 's your responsibility to know what constitutes fair use on your blog in regards to online news content .
It is your responsibility to remove non-compliant posts ..

These pricks are getting free publicity off the whole thing themselves , the last thing we need is start regulating the Internet , it will then be the beginning of the end .
Another attack on Internet freedom .
I guess the net neutrality people were right - it wo n't be long until the Internet is just another Cable TV station .
I worked in publishing for many years and my understanding was that " fair use " was not x number of words but rather what percentage of the original was quoted ( 50 % of a short poem would be too much ) .
Also which part .
In a traditional news story , the lede includes the 5 Ws and the H - Who , What , When , Where , Why , and How .
That 's all you really need to know about any event .
Everything that follows is elaboration .
Heads are , or used to be , an art in themselves , written by someone other than the reporter , a person skilled in writing succinct , attention - getting one - liners that fit within the space requirements .
I 'd be inclined to protect the head and the lede .
Still , this sounds like AP desperately trying to hang onto a dying way of doing business , as are many individual newspapers across the country .
With a little creative thinking , they could turn this newfangled Internet culture to their advantage .
It 's a cinch they wo n't save themselves by suing a few small fry .
If you start some sort of legal defense fund , let me know .
Meantime , good luck .
Hopefully they will be reasonable .
They can't sue every blog on the Internet .
This looks like a clear case of misuse of the DMCA , and abuse of copyright .
I do n't know what the other 5 articles are , but the two examples in this clearly are within fair use .
The Hillary clip has only 20 odd words that could be replaced to make it " non-quoted " per APs argument .
Nearly half of those words are pronouns and conjunctive clauses and three others are pretty much needed to comply with English diction , so the AP is complaining in this one case about 8 possibly protected words : expects , marathon , race , against , resolved , decide , and stronger .
So I guess if anyone is going to be a blogger in APs twisted , distorted , world - view we 're all going to have to keep thesauruses handy to change a few words whenever we post .
This is clearly a case of AP abusing it 's copyright and the DMCA to bully , and they should be punished for this .
I 'm surprised they 've never gone after /.
Oh wait , /. has wads of cash to defend nasty $ %^! like this , and might give them a black eye .
Much better to go after some perceived small fry site .
I 'm just so sick of major American News companies .
So does Google News need to have a license agreement with every single news source it quotes ?
I fail to see how it's in AP 's interest to prevent people from clicking on links to their site !
It 's not clear to me that what the Drudge Report " published " in those seven examples was in quotes and properly attributed .
If it was not , I would not consider it fair use .
I strongly agree with those that made the point that the first ( and sometimes the first few ) sentences or paragraphs of an article are written to convey the most important points of the story , and thus , for some people , all that they need to know about the story .
There is a fair amount of skill involved in crafting those first few sentences or paragraphs of a story .
Since the OP really has n't ( afaict ) provided a link to exactly how those stories were used , I can't make a judgment .
I would use the criteria implied here ( proper attribution , a small portion of the article , and maybe not the whole story -- enough to make a point maybe , but also little enough that a significant fraction of interested people will follow the link to read the rest of the story ) to make that judgment .
The U.S.A. government has a nice " fair use " description ( See www.copyright.gov).
On that page , the US Government states , " Copyright protects the particular way an author has expressed himself ; it does not extend to any ideas , systems , or factual information conveyed in the work " and describes the 4 - prong test in Section 107 .
Namely , in determining " fair use , " the courts will look at :
1. the purpose and character of the use , including whether such use is of commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes ;
2. the nature of the copyrighted work ;
3. amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole ; and
4. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work .
If the AP was the only party that had heard a quote ( say in an interview called and held on AP property ) , then the AP might succeed here .
However , if there were 15 news agencies ( not all members of the AP ) present when the quote was stated , then the AP does not have the copyright on the quote .
Unless the AP is suing all of the other " news " agencies / companies , I doubt they can sue you for the quote .
So , it is the " other " material you need to consider .
The problem with the AP 's move here is as follows :
The AP will be driving bloggers to the source of the quote rather than to the news agency or agencies for the story .
The bloggers will be avoiding news agency comment and coverage and will , in effect , be covering the story on their own .
If Hillary says , " I am best suited to be the next U.S. President , " Is her statement a " fact ? " Does Hillary own the Copyright ?
Did the AP get a license to include that statement in their story ?
Of course , Hillary would , in effect , be giving the license away anyway ...
If the AP succeeds here , Bloggers will , in effect , become the news source rather than linking to the news agencies and their stories -- depriving them of revenue due to lack of web - traffic .
Is this what the AP wants ?
I 'd fly to the next political event to cover the news so that all of the bloggers would link back to my blog -- who would n't ?
Then the AP is " out " of the loop .
Instead of legal letters , I would have published a " suggested manner " in which bloggers could cite and quote from AP stories .
This sets a standard that may or not be followed .
However , I think the AP 's current action " makes " bloggers not want to follow their guidelines .
I would argue that the next time the AP covers a story that is ON a blog , they had better watch out ...
They would either be violating the Copyright or they would be setting president that their actions ( and that of bloggers ) is , indeed , " fair use . "
I simply do n't see the long - range planning by the AP in their current posturing .
Regarding the Fox News statement , I do not think the AP has any legs to stand on ...
Does the AP own the Copyright to all statements made by Fox News ?
Even if they do , " fair use " still applies .
Of course , it has to be " fair use . "
Just as you do n't want the AP to take all of your stories and " steal " your readers , the AP wants to protect their " bottom line " as well .
Copyright is good , as is " fair use . "
Well Rogers ...
Like someone else said over at High Street , I always thought it would be your red headed stepchildren that would get you sued .
Oh , have the world changes .

Honestly you have 2 routes to go .
Compliance or all out war .
If you do n't want to mess with lawyers I 'd comply .
Though if I were you I 'd ask their lawyers to thouroughly explain in excruciating detail their take on fair use .
Then also ask the lawyer to give you , in excruciating detail , how to not in the future violate their copyright .
Make sure you spend many many many hours with the lawyer explaining things to you .
take notes .
ask questions .
all that .
make sure you use up plenty of that expensive lawyers billable hours .
at 500 an hour or whatever lawyers charge these days that should teach the ap a lesson .
if they wanna waste your time .
you waste theirs right back .
Tape the conversation I want to hear it .
I believe AP 's fighting a losing war .
They may win a few legal battles temporarily , but the bottom line is that their story has not been reproduced beyond fair use in the examples shown and will certainly be read and discussed with excerpts and examples in the public forum .
There are some intellectual property and copyright protections , but ultimately on the internet once their story is out " in the wild " , anyone anywhere at any time on nearly any browser capable device can cut , paste , and link to AP - originated content at will .
My best recommendation to satisfy AP 's requirements is to not post any of their content on the internet or on any medium which could be transcribed onto the internet .
( In other words , the AP should keep confidential and secret any material it does not want to expose to public consumption and discussion . )
Don'r fret Rogers ,
If they take it all from you your red headed stepchildren will be willing to take you in and let you live in the basement .
But before it comes toi that I suggest you contact the EFF www.eff.org
They may be able to provide some guidance .
They have taken up many fair use DMCA cases .
Especially the ones where media companies try to expand the range of DMCA with test cases against the small potatos .
A pet project of theirs is to try and give some teeth to the provisions of the DMCA that make it illegal to file false DMCA claims .

Rogers ,

Roger ,
I 'm Brian McNeil from Wikinews .
Ca n't seem to find a link to contact you about this .
Can you drop me an email at brian [ dot]mcneil@wikinewsie.org , I 'm covering this on Wikinews ( which is also a potential target ) and would like to ask a few questions and know if you have contact details for emailing Irene Keselman .
Keep fighting the good fight .
Ask for donations for legal fees if you need to .
Someone has to stand up to the AP and demand rights for bloggers .
Thanks .

Hey rcade ,
Even Michelle Malkin is on your side and has taken up your case .
Bet that is the first and last time that will ever happen .
Check out her calculations for what the AP owes her using their own formula for charging any quote above 5 words .
Hey , Associated Press :
You owe me at least $ 132,125 !
So what 's next ?
The Screen Actors Guild will demand film reviewers who broadcast a snippet of the films they review will be asked to remove the snippets from their shows ?
Bullocks !
So should I file a suit against U S News and World Report ..
They linked two of my articles recently .
Maybe I am dense , I thought it was a good thing .
These people , Being AP , are insane if they think they have a case .
What an exercise in greed .
Consider requesting that your supporters file a " friend of the court " brief in your behalf .
I have no legal knowledge , that will have to come from others .
But , if you find out the procedures and post them , I am sure that this will have a positive effect in your defense .
Good Luck , m
I 'm currently engaged in a legal disagreement with the Associated Press , which claims that Drudge Retort users linking to its stories are violating its .
This one is the blog which I like most , I would like to thanks that master brain who make all this for the readers like me .
keep up writing good job .
One of the problems with the AP is that their whole business model is n't so different from providing an RSS feed these days .
Fair use here may be an interesting case , because blogging might well cut down on their ( obsolete ) business model and because there 's no limit to how little you can quote while being fair use .
In fact , because this would seem to impact upon their business , the fair use case may be harder to make .

Senator Barack Obama ’s presidential campaign has apologized for keeping Muslim women wearing headscarves out of a key shot at his Detroit event .
According to Politico ’s Ben Smith , campaign volunteers told at least two Muslim women that they could not join friends in special spots behind the candidate unless they removed their religious headwear .
Friends of Hebba Aref recounted to Mr. Smith what happened when they were invited to sit behind the stage at Monday rally :
The men said the volunteer , a twenty - something African American woman in a green shirt , asked if their friends looked and were dressed like the young men , who were all light - skinned and wearing suits .
Miller said yes , but mentioned that one of their friends was wearing a headscarf with her suit .
The volunteer “ explained to me that because of the political climate and what ’s going on in the world and what ’s going on with Muslim Americans it ’s not good for her to be seen on TV or associated with Obama , ” said Koussan , who is a law student at Wayne State University .
Both Koussan and Miller said they specifically recalled the volunteer citing the “ political climate ” in telling them they could n’t sit behind Obama .
A volunteer told Shimaa Abdelfadeel , according to Mr. Smith ’s report , that no headcoverings , be they baseball caps or religious pieces , were allowed to be worn behind the candidate .
The people standing behind the candidate – in full view of the camera – are almost never accidental , and candidates often speak a diverse , albeit clean - cut crowd .
And given that Michigan is a center of Arab - American culture , it is unlikely that potential turnout by this group did not occur to Mr. Obama ’s advance staff .
However , Bill Burton , the campaign spokesman , said in a statement that keeping Muslims out of the background “ is of course not the policy of the campaign .
It is offensive and counter to Obama ’s commitment to bring Americans together and simply not the kind of campaign we run .
We sincerely apologize for the behavior of these volunteers . ”
Mr. Burton was also quick to point out that Muslims have been in the shot at previous Obama events .
“ This is obviously an anomaly , but we have apologized and are going to indeed work to ensure that this situation does n’t happen again , ” he added in an e-mail message , without elaborating on what specific measures would be taken .
Both Ms. Aref and Ms. Abdelfadeel have yet to return calls requesting comment .
The news comes at an awkward time for the Obama campaign , which has worked to portray him as post-racial .
He has constantly had to deny rumors that he is Muslim ( but pointing to his now - former church , and his spiritual mentor , the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. , has not been particularly helpful either ) and fight an underground smear campaign suggesting he has ties to terrorists .
He has also been trying to assuage Jewish voters ’ concerns without alienating those who sympathize more strongly with Palestinians in the Middle Eastern conflict .
This advance snafu risks tipping the see - saw again .
There is so much about Wilford Brimley that you did n't know .
For instance , he was at one time a bodyguard for the one and only Howard Hughes .
How did he get his break in Hollywood ?
He used to shoe horses for movies and television shows before getting work as an extra and a stuntman .
He 's 19,000 years old .
He actively opposed the banning of cockfighting , guy loves cockfighting .
He 's also a supporter of John McCain .

And as you all know , he 's got diabetes .
Thus it took only a few seconds for someone to draw the connection in Thud 's post about the diabetes - tracking car .
Hats off to SundaySunday for making it funny :
That 's really a cool device .
However , I 'm imagining an additional module that brings Wilford Brimley 's voice booming into the car , bloviating for the driver to : " Buckle up and check your blood sugar and check it often .
And turn off your left turn signal , it 's been going for the past 3.6 miles . "

A Daughter 's True Love Alexis Goggins used her body as a shield to protect her mother .
April 14 , 2008  -- Seliethia Parker always saw her role as protector for her 7 - year - old daughter , Alexis Goggins .
But it was Alexis who ended up saving her mother 's life by using her little body to shield her mom from a fusillade of bullets .
Doctors told Parker that her heroic little daughter , who was shot six times , would never walk or talk again .
But Alexis has surprised people with her gritty toughness .
She 's not only walking and talking , she 's expected to have a full recovery .
" Everybody 's still kind of shocked .
This is progressing a little bit more than everybody expected , " Parker said on " Good Morning America " today .
" They said she should fully recover . "
Alexis was shot last December when she and her mother were about to get into a car driven by Parker 's female friend .
Parker 's former boyfriend , 29 - year - old Calvin Tillie , jumped out of nearby bushes and forced his way into the car .
They drove for several minutes before Parker 's friend was able to pull over to a gas station , under the pretense of needing fuel .
There she called Detroit police while Parker and Alexis remained in the car .
Parker pleaded desperately with Tillie not to harm her or her daughter , but to no avail .
" Me and Alexis was left in the car with him at gunpoint and he starting shooting , " Parker told GMA .
Fearing for her mother 's life , Alexis bolted into the car 's front seat , crying out , " Do n't hurt my mother . "
" Alexis jumped over the seat to try and save my life , " Parker said .
Using her tiny body as a shield , Alexis blocked six gunshots from hitting her mother .
The bullets pierced her right eye , chin , cheek , chest and jaw .
When police arrived to the scene , they found Alexis in a pool of blood , curled beneath the steering wheel .
Parker also had been shot in the side of the head and the arm .
Both Parker and her daughter survived , though Alexis endured two painful months in the hospital and underwent six surgeries .
Despite doctors ' prediction that Alexis may never walk or talk again , Alexis is thriving .
Alexis said she does n't consider herself a hero and said she was n't scared during the event .
" I saved my mom , " she said and added she loved her mother a lot and did n't want to see her get hurt .
Parker has endless gratitude for her selfless daughter .
" She 's my angel and I love her to death , " she said .
The man who allegedly attacked the pair is charged with two counts of assault with intent to commit murder .
Tillie , a former convict on parole , also was charged with other offenses .

NOTE : Update for watching the 2010 Winter Olympics online : Click here .
Is NBC going to botch the Beijing Games online ?
Looks that way .
The network is planning an unprecedented 2,200 hours of live coverage on the Web - - far more than the 1,400 hours on six NBC U - owned TV channels .
Good , right ?
One very big catch :
The network wo n't allow you watch anything it thinks it has mass appeal -- that is , anything it intends to air on its own broadcast -- until it has shown it on TV , the AP reports .
UPDATE : Contrary to the AP report , NBC says " some " events will be simulcast live on TV and NBCOlympics.com .
In addition , NBC U is banning the use of any Olympic video online by other news organizations covering the event .
Video from the Olympic trials , going on now , must come down on Aug. 7 , the day before the games begin .
NBC U paid $ 800 million for the U.S. rights to the Beijing Olympics alone , and $ 3.5 billion for five Olympic games through 2008 .
The Olympics are a vast money - losing operation for NBC , meant to provide a ratings halo for the network 's other shows and help promote the fall TV season .
NBC expects to lose even more money on the online broadcast , but nevertheless sees it as an opportunity to build an audience that will surely seek coverage elsewhere if NBC does n't provide it .
But by trying to embargo video online , NBC threatens to sabotage its own efforts , by giving pirate P2P and other illicit sites a de- facto monopoly on live online coverage of the games ' most popular events .
NBC U says it can stop this via enforcement .
The company says it is working with 100 of the biggest video sites on the Web to get them to take down ilicit video , and it is watermarking each second of video that comes out of the the International Olympic Committee 's feed , to make takedowns easier .
But that 's just going to make taped footage scarce on legitimate video sites .
It wo n't do anything to keep pirated TV feeds , or video shot by fans , from being uploaded to p2 p filesharing services .
( To see how this works , take a look at our coverage of Euro 2008 for an extensive list of illicit sources of live sports , as well as sources of ripped foreign feeds . )
NBC U actually has the opportunity to make piracy irrelevant .
Not by fruitless crackdown efforts , but by ditching the antiquated notion that online coverage of live sports hurts TV ratings .
One need look no farther than CBS 's March Madness , or NBC 's own online coverage of the U.S.
Open to see that 's not the case .
So :
If you want to watch fencing or kayaking live online in August , NBC has you covered .
If you want to watch gymnastics , swimming or any other marquee event on your browser , you 're going to have to move your eyeballs elsewhere .

The hunt for bin Laden has become an election issue , with John McCain promising to capture or kill the terrorist leader during his first term and Barack Obama pledging to attack him without consulting the Pakistanis if necessary .
That claim could mean that Mr Obama has received intelligence briefings on the arrangement with Pakistan .
At least for a while longer .
[ digg - me ] Welcome everyone from unsolicitedadviceforhillary.com …
Towards the end of January , I called on Ms. Clinton to withdraw from the presidential race .
At that point , she still had to be favored to win , but there were fundamental flaws in her candidacy , and it was clear that a Clinton victory in the primaries would hurt the Democratic party in the 2008 general election .
Today , while she still has a strong chance to win the Democratic nomination , Ms. Clinton is no longer the front - runner .
Her campaign has been horrendously managed , and she has been flat - out out - campaigned by Senator Barack Obama .
Her hopes are now pinned on winning the three remaining big states – Texas , Ohio , and Pennsylvania – by solid margins .
And even then , she will not be able to win the nomination easily .
Now , with increasing calls on Ms. Clinton to resign , my contrarian impulse is kicking in – and my sense that Ms. Clinton ’s presence in the race can provide an important opportunity .
I believe it is to the Democratic party ’s , and Mr. Obama ’s , benefit for Ms. Clinton to stay in the race .
Even more , I want a ‘ Hillary ’ who will unleash every possible line of attack against Mr. Obama – including “ the kitchen sink ” as today ’s New York Times reports .
I want Ms. Clinton to insinuate :
that Mr. Obama is “ a secret Muslim “ ;
that people will say he was a drug dealer ;
that his church is racist ;
that he ’s corrupt ;
that he ’s too liberal ;
that he ’s too centrist ;
that he cannot win as a black man in America ;
that ’s he ’s naive ;
that his supporters are insane ;
that he ’s not ready to be president ;
and anything else she can think of .
I want Ms. Clinton to make every one of these arguments her own in a desperate attempt to beat back the political tide that is washing her hopes of a return to the White House away .
I would even be happy to see Ms. Clinton fight all the way to the convention – railing on about Mr. Obama ’s scandals and inadequacy .
The more Ms. Clinton puts her name and weight behind these stories , the less inclined the media will be to respond to them in the general election and the easier it will be for Mr. Obama to shrug them off then .
If Ms. Clinton can air all the so - called “ dirty laundry ” before she is vanquished , it will leave Mr. Obama a stronger candidate .
Part of Mr. Obama ’s appeal is the belief that he can overcome the gutter politics that distract people from the real issues at stake without engaging in gutter politics himself .
As Glenn Greenwald wrote over at Salon :
[ T ]he question is n’t whether Obama will be relentlessly pelted by the sprawling appendages of the Right - wing edifice and its media allies with the most grotesque , bottom - feeding , substance - free , personality - based attacks .
Of course he will be – ones as ugly as , if not uglier than , anything we ’ve seen yet .
Up until now , Obama has received relatively sympathetic treatment from the two - headed right - wing / media monster because he ’s been the anti-Hillary , and hatred for her resulted in affection ( or at least restraint ) towards him .
Once he ’s no longer the anti-Hillary , but instead becomes the only thing standing between John McCain / GOP power and the White House , he ’s going to be the target of all of that bile and much , much more .
As the Right begins to believe that he very well might be the enemy this Fall , and they thus pressure the media to begin its attacks , this week one got a small glimpse – a tiny fraction – of what is to come .
So the question ca n’t be whether the Right and the media will behave differently .
They ca n’t and wo n’t .
The real question is whether Obama , as he did this week , will be able to render these attacks impotent , even cause them to backfire , because they and their propagators will appear to be so ugly and small and irrelevant in light of the type of candidate he is , the rhetoric he produces , the vision to which he aspires .
I have no idea whether Obama ’s transcendent charisma or the historically demonstrated efficacy of low - life right - wing attacks will be more potent – I think it ’s a much more difficult challenge than many Obama supporters ( by virtue of understandable desire , rather than objective assessment ) have convinced themselves it will be — but there probably are n’t very many priorities more important than cleansing our political process of this type of dirt and petty distraction .
There ’s a fine line between playing “ hard ” and playing “ dirty ” – but it is essential to stay on the fair side of that line .
Mr. Obama realizes that ; the Clintons forgot it long ago .
I do n’t mean to count Ms. Clinton out – she still has a chance to win the primary , and a slimmer chance to win the general election after that .
But the best service she can do to her party now is to play the villain – to refuse to exit the race with the grace and honor , but instead to fight dirty until the “ last dog dies . ”
I have no love for Ms. Clinton – but no abiding ill will either .
If Ms. Clinton wants to help her party win the White House this November , she can give Mr. Obama the “ vetting ” she claims he lacks , and with ever increasing histrionics , throw every smear , every false allegation , every innuendo at him .
She can make her name synonymous with the sleaze she throws at him ; she has proven that she is capable of a viciousness reminiscent of a Karl Rove .
And by playing the villain , she can discredit and de-fang the many attacks that are sure to come at Mr. Obama after he secures the nomination .
This will allow Mr. Obama to unite the Democratic party , to rally independents to his side , and to gain the grudging respect of the conservative Hillary - haters .
So , Ms. Clinton – please stay in the race .
At least until July .

Research In Motion ( RIM ) is reportedly close to resolving a several months - long network security dispute with India 's Union Home Ministry .
The issue first became public in early March , when the ministry threatened to ban BlackBerry service entirely , unless it was given unconditional access to any and all of the information passing across RIM 's network at any given time , for any given person .
RIM 's standard security procedures , however , make this impossible , as all device data is encrypted prior to transmission .
The ministry claimed it needs access to customer data in order to protect the country from terrorists operating in Kashmir , who may be using BlackBerrys to communicate with each other .
RIM , however , was understandably reluctant to give the government unrestricted access to its own network , and the two sides have been in talks ever since .
RIM and the ministry are now reportedly close to an agreement , but details on what that agreement might entail differ greatly .
A recent article from the Agence France - Presse ( AFP ) implies that RIM , while aware of and responsive to Indian security concerns , is unwilling to compromise the security of its network .
The company reaffirmed that e-mail transmitted using its service would be safe from " snoopers " and stated , " governments have a wide range of resources and methodologies to satisfy national security and law enforcement needs without compromising commercial security requirements . "
The story makes no mention of any specific agreements between RIM and Indian security officials , beyond stating that RIM is looking forward to positive results .
Indian sources , meanwhile , are singing a different tune .
According to The Indian Express , RIM has been informed that it will have to install servers and network equipment within India if it wishes to continue operating within the country .
If RIM acquiesces , any such build - out would be subject to Indian law , and traffic passing through the center could be monitored to whatever degree the Union Home Ministry deems necessary .
The Hindustani Times , meanwhile , may have another piece of the puzzle .
The paper claims that RIM has already agreed to hand over sensitive customer data to the government , provided that the government 's Department of Telecommunications ( DoT ) take responsibility if such information is ever lost or stolen .
The agreement reportedly covers financial liability as well , leaving RIM off the hook if the Indian government 's SpyBerry program is ever hacked .
It may be a month or two before Research In Motion announces the details of its agreement with the Union Home Ministry , but the information coming out of India is at least plausible .
RIM has yet to state , point - blank , that it will not allow the Indian government to access its network traffic in some form or another , and until that happens , all bets are off .

But I 'll ask you to forgive me because , as a Veteran , there is n't a day on the calendar that causes my hatred -- and I do indeed mean hatred -- of George W. Bush to bubble over the top more than Memorial Day .
" On Memorial Day , we honor the heroes who have laid down their lives in the cause of freedom , resolve that they will forever be remembered by a grateful Nation , and pray that our country may always prove worthy of the sacrifices they have made , " reads Bush 's official Memorial Day proclamation , issued by the White House on Thursday .
The Chickenhawk - in Chief says a lot of things that make this Vet 's blood boil but stuff like saying that he prays " ... that our country may always prove worthy of the sacrifices they have made " is almost vomit inducing .
This statement comes from the same man who himself began dishonoring the sacrifices of all Veterans in such huge ways in March of 2003 , when he invaded Iraq behind a veil of lies and deceit and started spilling barrels of military and civilian blood to start a war with a country that posed no threat whatsoever to our national security .
These stirring words of remembrance come from an administration that began with a stolen election in 2000 , which goes entirely against what I was taught way back when I was in the U.S. Navy , which was that part of the " way of life " we were protecting was symbolized by the ability of all of our citizens to have their votes counted .
" These courageous and selfless warriors have stepped forward to protect the Nation they love , fight for America 's highest ideals , and show millions that a future of liberty is possible , " continues Bush 's proclamation .
" Americans are grateful to all those who have put on our Nation 's uniform and to their families , and we will always remember their service and sacrifice for our freedoms . "
The words Bush puts forth are true -- it 's him being the one to say them that I find so sickening and personally offensive .
It is positively nauseating to have George W. Bush ever talk to us about " America 's highest ideals " when his administration has started a bloody war for no reason , imprisoned those suspected of being " terrorists " without trial or benefit of legal counsel , tortured prisoners in America 's name and done everything but grab the original U.S. Constitution from the National Archives and run it through a paper shredder .
A day after Senator Barack Obama launched a broad assault on the economic plan of presidential rival John McCain , McCain hit back yesterday by asserting that Obama 's tax proposals would ensnare millions of ordinary Americans and further weaken the economy .
McCain , speaking to small - business leaders in Washington , D.C. , said Obama 's plans to restore higher tax rates for upper - bracket taxpayers , increase the capital gains tax rate for the richest families , and possibly raise the cap on Social Security taxes would affect not just the wealthy , but also moderate - income voters and independent businesses .
" Under Senator Obama 's tax plan , Americans of every background would see their taxes rise - seniors , parents , small - business owners , and just about everyone who has even a modest investment in the market , " McCain said at a small - business summit sponsored by the National Federation of Independent Businesses and eBay .
In a general election that will turn largely on the economy , it 's clear this will be one of the major fault lines .
Obama and Democrats will advocate , in his words , " restoring fairness to our economy " by shifting more of the tax burden to the rich , while McCain and Republicans will argue that an Obama presidency would also saddle more middle - class families with higher taxes on stock dividends and other earnings .
" Will we go back to the policies of the '60s and ' 70s that failed or will we go forward ? "
McCain asked yesterday , seeking again to link Obama with Jimmy Carter , a Democrat whose presidential administration presided over a period of high inflation , rising gas prices , increasing unemployment , and growing budget and trade deficits .
Obama and the Democratic Party , seeking to capitalize on the public 's economic insecurity , said that those are precisely the afflictions of the current economy after nearly eight years under President Bush and that McCain will merely continue - or in some cases worsen - that legacy .
In a wide - ranging interview that aired yesterday on CNBC , Obama also pointed to the growing disparity in incomes between the highest and lowest earners , saying , " We 've had an economy that 's been out of balance for too long . "
" We know that over the last decade or so , that more than half of the economic growth has been captured by the top 1 percent of US citizens , " Obama said .
" That means the other 99 percent have seen their effective incomes go down .
That is not a recipe for long - term economic growth . "
While he contended in the interview that his specific prescriptions would depend on the economy he inherits , Obama also said he will institute a tax cut for 150 million middle - class workers - up to $ 500 per person , or $ 1,000 per family ; eliminate income taxes on seniors making less than $ 50,000 a year ; and provide a new mortgage - interest tax credit for low - and moderate - income homeowners .
McCain said yesterday that keeping taxes low - even on wealthy individuals and Fortune 500 corporations - is the key to generating economic growth .
He said he would double the tax exemptions for children and give millions of middle - class families a tax cut by phasing out the alternative minimum tax , a decades - old mechanism designed to make sure that affluent families pay at least some income taxes , but now affecting more and more taxpayers .
He also vowed to slash the corporate tax rate , and the Republican National Committee said yesterday that even though Obama has slammed that idea , the Illinois senator 's new economic policy director has advocated it .
The Arizona senator also told the small - business summit that he viewed the estate tax , paid on inheritances , as " one of the most unfair tax laws on the books . "
" After a lifetime building up a business , and paying taxes on every dollar that business earns , that asset should not be subjected to a confiscatory tax , " he said .
But McCain has defended the estate tax in the past , arguing against its repeal in 2002 by saying that doing so " would provide massive benefits solely to the wealthiest and highest - income taxpayers in the country . "
McCain 's campaign said his position on what critics call the " death tax " has not changed .
" He did n't indicate he supported a full repeal in this speech , " his campaign said in a statement .
Still , McCain 's characterization of the estate tax yesterday is a marked departure .
Democrats assailed McCain for asserting in yesterday 's speech that Obama would " enact the largest single tax increase since the Second World War " in part by not extending the Bush tax cuts .
FactCheck.org , a nonpartisan website run by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania , found last month that McCain 's contention is inaccurate , saying that by the most accurate measure , it would be the fifth largest since 1943 .

Numerous studies over the past four decades have established that pesticides , which are typically applied at the land surface , can move downward through the unsaturated zone to reach the water table at detectable concentrations .
The downward movement of pesticide degradation products , formed in situ , can also contribute to the contamination of ground water .
Once in ground water , pesticides and their degradation products can persist for years , depending upon the chemical structure of the compounds and the environmental conditions .
Scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) investigated the occurrence of selected pesticides and their degradation products in ground water during a study funded by the USGS National Water - Quality Assessment ( NAWQA ) Program .
Specifically , the authors examined several of the factors that can influence the likelihood with which pesticides and their degradation products are detected in shallow ground water — including oxidation - reduction ( redox ) conditions and ground - water residence times — at four study sites across the United States .
The study revealed that the pesticides and degradation products detected most frequently in shallow ground - water samples from all four areas were predominantly from two classes of herbicides — triazines and chloroacetanilides .
None of the insecticides or fungicides examined were detected in ground - water samples .
In most samples , the concentrations of the pesticide degradation products greatly exceeded those of their parent compounds .
Pesticides or their degradation products were detected most commonly in ground water that recharged between 1949 and 2004 , and in monitoring wells spanning the full depth range ( about 2 to 52 m ) examined — from the shallowest to the deepest wells — in all four study areas .
Comparisons of pesticide concentrations with a variety of environmental variables indicated that redox conditions , ground - water residence times , and the concentrations of dissolved oxygen and excess nitrogen gas from denitrification ( the breaking down of nitrogen compounds such as nitrate ) were all important factors affecting the concentrations of pesticides and their degradation products in all four ground - water systems .
The four sites selected for this study were located in agricultural landscapes in Maryland , Nebraska , California , and Washington .
They were also selected for variability in overall land use , crops grown , climate , agricultural practices , irrigation , geohydrologic settings , and redox conditions .
During the spring of 2004 , water samples were collected from a network of 59 shallow single or clustered monitoring wells and analyzed for the occurrence of 45 pesticides and 40 pesticide degradation products , including herbicide , insecticides , and fungicides .
Greg Steele , senior author for this study , stated “ Atrazine and its degradation product deethylatrazine both persisted in similar amounts at the Nebraska site , but in water samples from the other three study sites , there was little change with apparent age of water as the fraction as deethylatrazine generally exceeded 80 % of the sum of atrazine and deethylatrazine .
On the other hand , in three of the four areas studied ( Washington excluded because it did not have any detections of metolachlor or its degradation products ) , the proportion of metolachlor in ground water was far less than that for its degradation products . ”
60 Minutes : Pentagon 's raygun demonstrated on mock protesters David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday June 2 , 2008

Print This Email This The Pentagon has been developing a raygun which can harmlessly repel enemies by causing a burning sensation in the top layer of the skin .
However , according to CBS 's 60 Minutes , the military is unwilling to actually trust this weapon enough to deploy it in Iraq .
" We are now stepping into the Buck Rogers scenario , " explained Colonel Kirk Hymes , who is in charge of testing the " Active Denial System " at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia .
Hymes demonstrated the weapon by staging what CBS somewhat oddly called " a scenario soldiers might encounter in Iraq " -- a handful of military volunteers , dressed as civilian protesters , who carried signs saying " peace not war " and threw objects at a small group of soldiers .
A series of raygun blasts from half a mile away disrupted their chants and finally sent them running .
Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisiton Sue Payton calls the Active Denial System a " huge game - changer " which " would save huge numbers of lives . "
She told CBS , " It could be used to read someone 's mind , in effect .
...
If they continue to come at you , then you 're fairly sure ... they 're probably a terrorist or an adversary who wants to do you harm . "
The Active Denial System was developed in secret for ten years before being unveiled by the Pentagon in 2001 .
As of 2004 , it was being described as ready for use in Iraq within the next 12 months .
This has still not occurred , and according to Secretary Payton , use of the weapon in Iraq is now " not politically tenable " because after Abu Ghraib " you do n't ever , ever , ever want a system like this to be thought of as a torture weapon . "
However , the failure to deploy the weapon as planned has raised suspicions that the real intention is to use it for domestic crowd control .
In 2006 , Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne was quoted as saying that the device should be used first on Americans , because " if we 're not willing to use it here against our fellow citizens , then we should not be willing to use it in a wartime situation .
...
If I hit somebody with a nonlethal weapon and they claim that it injured them in a way that was not intended , I think that I would be vilified in the world press . "
Raytheon , which developed the system for the Pentagon , is currently selling a more limited - range civilian version of the system , under the name " Silent Guardian , " which it promotes as being suitable for " law enforcement , checkpoint security , facility protection , force protection and peacekeeping missions . "
Commander Charles " Sid " Heal of the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department , who advised Raytheon in developing the raygun , told CBS that the real reason the system has not been deployed in Iraq is " cowardice . "
Heal , a former Marine , took a variety of non-lethal weapons to Somalia in 1995 and was dismayed to find that his superiors felt their supposedly humanitarian mission was better accomplished by killing .
He would love to have the Pentagon 's raygun available for such purposes as controlling prison riots .
The Pentagon is spending just $ 13.1 million on the raygun this year .
Secretary Payton agrees this is " absolutely peanuts ... chump change , " but she explained to CBS that with only a $ 475 billion annual budget , " we do n't have enough money to do things that are the here and now . "
The raygun is seen as unproven because it has never been deployed in the field , and it has not been deployed in the field because it is unproven .
" Lethal weapons have an easier time getting into our system , " acknowledges Colonel Hymes .

Sunday morning , I clicked on David Broder ’s Washington Post op - ed , “ More Debates Would Bolster Political Dialogue ” and was pleasantly surprised by the content .
Nothing against Broder , who through the decades has seemed like a fairly reasonable fellow , but his good - government opinions are usually kind of dull .
A lot of substance , plenty of on - the - record quotes ( and humility that toxic partisans like The New York Times ’ Frank Rich might consider emulating ) but dull .
Nevertheless , the thrust of this particular Broder piece was on the money : while his colleagues were writing and re-writing Hillary Clinton speculation columns , lost in the shuffle was John McCain ’s challenge to Barack Obama that they hold 10 town - hall meetings across the country and talk to voters and each other .
Tim Russert , Sean Hannity and Chris Matthews would be invited only as spectators , and they ’d probably decline due to the lack of attention .
Obama ’s camp claims they ’re considering the proposal but it ’s doubtful they ’ll accede to McCain ’s wishes : the GOP nominee , lousy on camera in canned network - sanctioned debates , needs a curveball to alter the dynamics of the election , which clearly favor the Illinois senator .
On the other hand , if Obama bats down the idea , his aura as the “ candidate of change ” might take a dent .
The following is a pipedream , but what I think would really be radical in presidential politics is if the two of them met five times , before the national conventions , at different baseball stadiums in mutually - agreed upon cities .
No press allowed , no photo - ops , just Obama and McCain sitting in a skybox , and taking in games , gabbing about baseball or whatever else comes to mind .
Every four years editorialists natter on about the importance of a “ civil ” campaign , and this is one way to further that goal .
The two senators do n’t know each other well , but as any baseball fan can tell you , during the course of a game two acquaintances can , in an isolated setting , forge a friendship while discussing and debating America ’s favorite sport .
After these three - hour — remaining for all nine innings would be a condition — I find it hard to believe they ’d allow their strategists to embark on what could be the nastiest presidential race since , well , 2004 .
Say the two of them started off this week in Detroit ( possible swing - state of Michigan ) , watching the disappointing Tigers take on Ozzie Guillen ’s rejuvenated White Sox .
The current baseball topics would be endless : Chipper Jones ’ astounding batting average ( .420 as of Monday morning ) ; the wisdom of Joba Chamberlain joining the Yanks starting rotation instead of inheriting Mariano Rivera ’s role as a dominant closer ; the introduction of limited replays on disputed home run calls by umps ; how the Cubs are going to blow it again late in the season ; and the ramifications of amateur pugilist Coco Crisp setting off a brawl last Thursday night by charging the mound after the Rays ’ excellent starter James Shields plunked the Sox outfielder on the leg .
Baseball , as has not been observed by enough politicians and the journalists who cover them , is a cultural equalizer , a plain fact that both Obama and McCain ought to realize .
Shysterball ’s Craig Calcaterra made a good point in an email over the weekend that neither of the candidates appear to be even mild baseball fans ( unlike Rudy Giuliani and George Bush ) , and so they ’d drift off to non-sports conversations , not unlike businessmen clogging up the good seats via corporate season tickets .
But , at least by my reckoning , that ’d be okay too , as long as they spent time together without the pressure of “ gotcha ” media dogs hounding them .
Calcaterra wrote : “ The bigger question : Could Obama name all the guys in the White Sox ’s rotation , and could McCain name that of the D’Backs ?
I ’ll admit that I ’m leaning Obama , but if McCain knew who Micah Owings was , I ’d have to think hard . ”
That remark was made in jest , of course , but does address the very real tonic that a diversion like baseball ( or sports generally ) can have on friends who refrain from political debate because it just gets too incendiary .
Calcaterra added : “ In my own experience writing my blog , I ’ve found that I can say the most outlandish , mean - spirited things possible about a baseball player or team , but the reaction to that pales compared to even the most innocuous political thoughts I insert into a post .
Most folks I know would rather talk about baseball than politics , but in their heart they know one matters and one , ultimately , does not . ”
David Pinto , who mans the go - to blog Baseball Musings , agrees that “ people take politics more seriously than sports , ” and though he ’s got definite opinions about national affairs , he makes his forum a politics - free zone .
As do other blogs , such as Joy of Sox , Allan Wood 's blog with a message at the top of his page that reads “ Iraq War Resisters In Canada — Let Them Stay . ”
On the other side , there ’s Mr. Baseball Crank , a diehard conservative who writes a lot about politics but at the top his homepage gives readers the option to hit the “ Baseball - Only Content ” option .
On the left side of the site , there are three quotes , old chestnuts from Tug McGraw and Branch Rickey , sandwiched by a famous proclamation of Winston Churchill’s .
( A digression : I agree with a lot of people that the Yanks ’ de facto boss , Hank Steinbrenner , is a loudmouth borderline lunatic , but he had a great , and withering , response to Johnny Damon ’s complaint to the media that moving Joba to the starting rotation was a blunder worthy of his old man .
The New Boss said : “ I love Johnny Damon as a player and a person , and he ’s doing a really good job now .
But let ’s be honest here , he ’s not Branch Rickey .
Johnny is a player , and as players , they all need to let the brain trust do the thinking and talking .
They players just need to play and to worry about winning games . ”
Translated :
You might be a millionaire , but your brain is the size of a peanut , so shut the fuck up . ” )
When I attend a game with friends , politics is verboten , and I tell my McCain - backing 13 - year - old to shut his yap on that subject and stick to balls and strikes and the menacing glare of Jonathan Papelbon .
Last week , four of us went to Camden Yards to see the O’s and the Sox and the name Obama was n’t mentioned once ; instead two of the guys , confirmed Orioles partisans , looked forward to the day when the park would n’t be called “ Fenway Park South ” and Manny Ramirez might think twice before saying , as he did upon hitting his 500th homer there , that he was glad he could attain that feat “ in front of my fans . ”
Here ’s an example of why I think McCain and Obama ( and the electorate ) might profit from the five - games plan proposed above .
A buddy of mine in New York is close to Jonathan Tasini , the well - known union organizer in that state ( he ran against Hillary Clinton in the ’06 Democratic senate primary ) and though Tasini ’s a Yanks fan , we ’ve exchanged good - natured emails on baseball .
Jonathan wrote the other day about the value of sports in today ’s politically charged culture : “ I ’ve always been amazed at the reaction by too many people on the progressive / left side who have disdain for people like me who love sports as if it ’s a waste of time .
As a union member ( particularly UAW ) , I ’ve always thought that I can talk to just about anyone , anywhere , about sports .
It ’s an entry point and a bridge — not intentionally but naturally — no matter what people think about [ political ] issues . ”
I ca n’t let this opportunity slip to throw in a few words about the Sox - Rays brawl last Thursday night .
First , why Jon Lester was suspended for five games is beyond me : yes , he hit a couple of Rays but was n’t ejected from the game .
Two , Coco Crisp was spoiling for a fight and charging the mound after Shields intentionally hit him in the leg was overreaction ; what I do n’t understand is why Shields would retaliate against the Sox outfielder in the second inning , knowing he could be tossed .
It resulted in the Rays ’ bullpen being taxed and a loss in a game between the sudden rivals .
A more seasoned pitcher , say Josh Beckett or Mike Mussina , would wait until later in the game to exact revenge and stick up for his teammates .
New York ’s Daily News runs a terrific blog called Subway Squawkers , in which a Yanks fan ( Lisa Swan ) squares off against a Mets booster ( Jon Lewin ) in a good - natured back - and - forth .
I ca n’t stand the Yanks , but Swan is an interesting read : last year , she lobbied for Joe Torre ’s dismissal long before a lot of the beat writers , and in the past has defended Alex Rodriguez when no one else would .
Last weekend , she skipped the Crisp / Shields / Gomes / Crawford / Casey pile - up and instead commented on the very weird dugout scuffle between Ramirez and Kevin Youkilis that occurred a few innings after the main event of the evening .
Reportedly , Manny was pissed about Youkilis chucking stuff in the dugout after striking out on a disputed call and tempers flared .
Not a big deal in my book ; the Yankees of the late 70s hated each other ( that means you , Mr. October ) and were a lot more interesting than the bland team that dominated the last half of the 90s .
Swan wrote : “ [ W ] hat I find fascinating is that Ramirez , who so often draws attention to himself by posing at home plate after a homer , decided to be the self - appointed enforcer on Youkilis .
Mind you , I actually kind of like Manny [ a huge and honest admission from someone who follows every inning of every Yanks game ] , but still .
Why was a showboater like him the one to say something ?
Manny being the one to do it [ instead of the more sober Mike Lowell ] is like Paris Hilton telling Britney Spears to stop being a publicity hound . ”
See what just happened ?
After opening up about politics I ran aground when thinking over the dozens of baseball dramas played out in the past week , which is why someone like Jonathan Tasini and me would never be seen at the same political rally but would have a delightful time at Yankee Stadium or any other park .
And that ’s why I think McCain and Obama would be smart to flummox the media and not play by its rules during this long general election campaign .
Go to Coors Field , fellas , have a few drinks and get to know each other .
It ’s possible the country will be better off no matter who wins .
US 'lacks knowledge to launch land war '
By Ahmed Rashid in Lahore
( Filed : 19/09/2001 )
AMERICAN military action against Afghanistan is unlikely to begin for another four to five weeks because of Washington 's lack of knowledge and intelligence about the situation , Western sources said yesterday .
European diplomats with experience of the region are urging America to limit its military campaign and restrict the use of land forces to avoid getting them bogged down in Afghanistan .
" The US armed forces do not have a single soldier or officer who speaks Pushtu [ the principal language of the Taliban ] , " said a senior Western military official .
" They will have to first hire hundreds of Pushtu speakers .
That shows how much they lack on the ground for this upcoming battle in Afghanistan . "
Pushtu , or Pashto , is the language of the Pathans and of the Taliban , who come from southern Afghanistan .
Although the US army has people who speak Farsi , or Persian , is also extensively spoken in central and northern Afghanistan , bin Laden is hiding among Pushtu- speaking Afghans .
According to authoritative reports , before the current crisis the CIA had no agents on the ground inside Afghanistan , and the State Department has no high level contacts with the anti-Taliban forces in northern Afghanistan .
The lack of intelligence stems from Washington 's decision effectively to ignore developments in Afghanistan from 1989 after Moscow withdrew its forces .
Its only major intelligence source is satellite imagery , which cannot clearly differentiate between Taliban and Arab fighters nor between fighters and civilians .
America is expected therefore to rely on intelligence provided by Afghanistan 's neighbours and other allies such as Britain which will take time to collate and evaluate .
The key to obtaining intelligence on Taliban and bin Laden troop movements and their whereabouts is the degree to which Pakistan 's Inter - Services Intelligence , which has been the principal backer of the Taliban , will co-operate with the CIA .
President Pervaiz Musharraf of Pakistan has pledged full co-operation , but with the lack of trust between the ISI and the CIA , Pakistan may well limit what it passes over .
European governments closely allied to America are trying to influence decision - making in the Pentagon to make Washington aware of the dangers of sending large numbers of ground forces into Afghanistan .
" The danger is that Washington may be in an overkill mode , without realising the complexities of Afghanistan and the potential to destabilise the region , " said a European diplomat .
European defence experts and military attaches hope that America does not attempt an invasion of Afghanistan .
British and Soviet invasions were defeated by Afghan guerrilla fighters in the 19th and 20th centuries .
Instead America is hoping to establish military bases in Pakistan and Central Asia .
From there , special forces could attack specific targets inside Afghanistan , eliminate their opponents and then return to their bases after a few days .
US forces in Pakistan would be based along the border with Afghanistan in Baluchistan and the North - West Frontier Province , which is just 15 minutes ' flying time for troop - carrying helicopters to reach many of bin Laden 's bases .
US special forces rather than satellite imagery would be used inside Afghanistan to guide aerial and missile strikes , the main American weapon to break up Taliban and Arab groups .
The bulk of the war effort is expected to be directed at four provinces in southern Afghanistan - Kandahar , Helmand , Herat and Uruzgun - where the Taliban leadership and bin Laden will try to hide .
" There will be absolutely no point in bombing the cities because they will be evacuated by the time the war starts and the cities are pretty much devastated already , " said a European official .
" The US may also try to capture an airfield inside Afghanistan and use it as a bridgehead for attacks in the interior of the country .
But securing an airfield will mean committing some 20,000 troops just to guard the outer perimeter , which is high risk . "
At the same time America will have to enlist Afghans , and arm and fund them to go after the Taliban in the ravines and valleys of the mountainous and desert terrain .
In northern Afghanistan the anti-Taliban United Front has already pledged 15,000 fighters to the US - led alliance .
If it is given American air cover , its forces could quickly capture the major cities in the north .
However , its forces have little presence in the Pathan belt in the south and it is here that the main war will be fought .

Just days before his expected nomination at the Republican National Convention , John McCain will celebrate his birthday .
But do n't bet on seeing a prime - time bash during the GOP 's September get - together in Minneapolis : a presidential nominee blowing out 72 candles is not an image party bosses want to see on YouTube going into the fall battle .
Especially when that nominee visibly wears the toll of a long and , at times , extraordinarily difficult life .
One that has included surviving a bone - crushing ejection from his Navy jet , torture during 5 ½ years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam , major surgery to remove a dangerous skin cancer from his face , and the stiff and sometimes pained bearing shared by many of his contemporaries .
If elected , McCain would steal Ronald Reagan 's record as the oldest first - term president in the nation 's history .
While questions of age and health have shadowed McCain , they have largely remained under the radar .
His staffers respond to queries about his condition by pointing to the demanding campaign schedule he has maintained for many months .
But with his doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale , Ariz. , poised to release his current medical records before Memorial Day , and polls showing that a significant number of voters ( 32 percent in one survey ) say that McCain is too old to be president , those back - burner issues are about to move front and center .
Top McCain aide Charlie Black says that the candidate 's records will prove that he is in " good health . "
But their release is bound to reignite the debate over how much a candidate 's age and health history should or could factor into the November contest , including how they may influence McCain 's choice for vice president .
And it will very likely renew discussion about the public 's desire to know versus its right to know the full scope of nominees ' medical conditions .
The genie of disclosure will never be put back in the bottle , says Brian Balogh of the University of Virginia 's Miller Center .
When Thomas Eagleton 's history of depression and electroshock therapy forced him to step down as Democrat George McGovern 's running mate in 1972 , " everyone became pretty self - conscious about candidates ' past medical history , " Balogh says .
And post - Watergate , disclosure became de rigueur .
" This was what the press demanded and what the American public expected and wanted to know about their presidential candidates , " he says .
Presidential health .
It was n't always so .
In the pantheon of presidents beset by maladies , deadly conditions , and some truly off - the - wall medical histories ( Grover Cleveland had a cancerous lesion secretly removed from his jaw while in a chair lashed to the mast of a yacht plying the East River in New York ) , McCain 's health trials do n't look all that exceptional .
Take Andrew Jackson , who suffered a head wound at age 13 during the Revolutionary War , was shot at least twice in gun battles , and carried in him at least three bullet fragments — one near his heart .
It 's most likely that Jackson suffered from malaria , lead poisoning , parasites , chronic diarrhea , depression , and was " swimming in heavy metals , " notes H. W. Brands , a University of Texas historian , from the " cures " of mercury and a brew called " sugar of lead . "
( Family members , rather indiscreetly , also reported that as a youngster he " slobbered . " )
" In the early 19th to the early 20th century , people had a lot of things wrong with them , doctors did n't know how to fix them , and so they lived with them , " Brands says .
But Jackson lived to 78 — at the time , a " good long life . "
John Kennedy hid his diagnosis of debilitating Addison 's disease — while in Congress , he had once been given last rites — and Chester Arthur kept secret his struggle with an incurable kidney disease .
Dwight Eisenhower suffered a heart attack and stroke while in office — " the public was told about all of this , " presidential historian Henry Graff says — and Lyndon Johnson survived a massive heart attack before he became president and another while in the Oval Office .
He died of a third after leaving office .
But the history of presidential health is marked by bigger lies , subterfuge , and what historians characterize as flat - out medical malpractice .
The two most notorious , says Graff , involve the conspiracy between Woodrow Wilson 's wife and his doctor to keep the president 's strokes and in - office incapacitation a secret from Congress and the nation and a similar connivance to keep Franklin Roosevelt 's life - threatening high blood pressure under wraps while he ran for his fourth term during what would be the final months of World War II .
In both cases , Graff says , " the public was ill - served . "
Wilson , elected president in 1912 , had been suffering strokes since 1898 — before he was governor of New Jersey , says Graff , 86 .
As a young code breaker during WWII , Graff says he witnessed firsthand the international concern over Roosevelt 's failing health and attempts by his doctor , Ross McIntire , and aides to keep it hidden .
( In an interview with U.S. News six years after Roosevelt 's death in 1945 , the now discredited McIntire insisted the president 's health had been fine , that only a persistent cough and flu had depleted his reserves . )
" We read the codes of many nations who thought Roosevelt was too ill for another term , and they were concerned he would n't live out his term , " Graff says .
The president died three months after his inauguration ; the war ended four months later .
In 1999 , during his first run for president , McCain released 1,500 pages of medical and psychiatric records that detailed his POW experiences and found him in good physical and mental health .
But he now has a visible scar and puffiness on the left side of his face , evidence of surgery in 2000 to remove what doctors classified as a Stage IIA melanoma .
Stage IV is the most serious .
During the five - hour procedure , surgeons as a precaution removed lymph nodes near the cancer , and part of his saliva - producing parotid gland .
It was McCain 's fourth bout with skin cancer or lesions — the others , dating back to 1993 , were successfully removed from his left shoulder , arm , and nose .
Meenhard Herlyn , a researcher at the Wistar Institute at the University of Pennsylvania and member of the Melanoma Research Foundation 's scientific advisory committee , says that melanoma " continues to be a bad cancer — diagnosed in 60,000 new cases each year . "
The biggest factor in successful treatment is early diagnosis , before the cancer penetrates the deeper part of the skin where it could hit a lymph or blood vessel .
The cancer mass McCain had removed in 2000 was 2 centimeters in diameter and 2.2 millimeters deep .
" That 's relatively thick , " says Herlyn .
In estimating risk , he says , any primary tumor in the skin thicker than 1 millimeter is considered at an increased risk for " having dissociated , " or moved to other parts of the body .
McCain 's doctors reported that his cancer had n't penetrated his lymph system .
Though McCain is at greater risk for recurrence because of his age , gender , and multiple bouts with melanoma , he has been cancer free since 2002 .
There currently is no cure for melanoma once it spreads .
Age debate .
The issue of McCain 's age has been a touchy one — some who have raised it have been tagged as ageist .
Democratic Party Chairman Howard Dean has pledged not to make an issue of it ( insiders say they do n't have to — it 's already an issue ) , and Black , the campaign aide , has asserted that 70 just is n't what it used to be .
So , is 70 the new 50 ?
Karlene Ball says there 's some truth to what Black says .
" I 've been studying cognitive aging for 30 years , and it is definitely the case that the 70 - year - olds in our research now are cognitively younger than those we studied 20 years ago , " says Ball , who directs the University of Alabama - Birmingham 's Roybal Center for Research on Applied Gerontology .
Improved healthcare and knowledge about the benefits of nutrition and physical activity have contributed to that trend , she says .
But Bell adds this caution :
There is a downward slope in memory as a function of age , though there are enormous individual differences .
McCain likes to point to his 96 - year - old mother as proof of his with - it genes .
That may be stretching things a bit , says Ball .
" Saying that your parents are free of dementia does n't mean you wo n't get it , " she adds , " but , still , it 's good that they are because you do n't have that risk factor . "
( McCain 's father died of heart failure at 70 . )
Voters may need to be reminded , says Brands , that presidential candidates are human , a package of both good and bad — health histories included .
McCain can take inspiration from Jackson , he says , who though beset by illness and considered old for his time , " was clearheaded and forceful until the last day of his presidency . "
But there 's little doubt that what McCain 's new medical records reveal and whether youth will be a quality he seeks in a vice president will both prove crucial to the case he 'll make to the demanding American people about his own health and ability to serve .
A case that becomes even more critical with 46 - year - old Barack Obama as the Democratic front - runner .
JERUSALEM ( CNN ) --
An Israeli Cabinet member said the Jewish state " will attack " Iran if it does n't halt its efforts to develop nuclear weaponry , according to a newspaper report Friday .
Shaul Mofaz is Israel 's main liaison with the United States on strategic issues .
" If Iran continues its program to develop nuclear weapons , we will attack it , " Deputy Prime Minister Shaul Mofaz told Yediot Ahronot , Israel 's largest mass - circulation daily .
" The window of opportunity has closed .
The sanctions are not effective .
There will be no alternative but to attack Iran in order to stop the Iranian nuclear program . "
Mofaz 's threat is one of the most explicit made against the Islamic Republic of Iran by a member of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert 's Cabinet .
The threat is not without precedent .
In 1981 , Israeli warplanes destroyed an Iraqi nuclear reactor being built by Saddam Hussein 's regime .
Israel also is reported to have targeted a Syrian reactor in September .
It also has significant political resonance in Israel amid talk that Mofaz has begun jockeying to replace Olmert , who is embroiled in a corruption probe , as the ruling Kadima Party 's leader and prime minister .
At least one Cabinet member , Defense Minister Ehud Barak , has called for Olmert to step down .
Mofaz , Israel 's transport and road safety minister , is the main Israeli liaison with the United States on strategic issues , and his views on security have great import .
He was born in Iran in 1948 and is a former defense minister , former armed forces chief and a member of Israel 's Security Cabinet .
Mofaz was reiterating a prevailing view among Kadima officials and other Israeli politicians that international sanctions targeting Iran and its nuclear program are n't working .
The West believes Iran 's aim is to build nuclear weapons , while Iran says it is developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
Asked how he responds to the harsh statements of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Rome that Israel should be wiped off the map , Mofaz said : " He will disappear before Israel does . "
Yediot Ahronot on Friday published excerpts of an interview with Mofaz that is to appear in the paper 's Sunday holiday edition .
The Jewish holiday of Shavuot is ushered in that evening .
Mofaz 's remarks come a couple of days after Olmert said at a pro-Israeli conference in the United States that the " Iranian threat must be stopped by all possible means . "
" Israel and the United States have long understood the acute danger embodied in a nuclear Iran , and are working closely in a concerted , coordinated effort to prevent Iran from becoming nuclear .
Israel will not tolerate the possibility of a nuclear Iran , and neither should any other country in the free world , " Olmert said to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee convention .
In April , Israeli Infrastructure Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer said that " an Iranian attack will lead to a harsh retaliation by Israel , which will lead to the destruction of the Iranian nation . "
CNN 's Kevin Flower contributed to this report .

The Case - Shiller Index , which tracks same home sales over a period of time instead of aggregate median prices per month , has dropped nearly 10.7 percent on a year over year basis .
Most analyst favor the Case - Shiller Index because it looks at a single home and tracks it historically over time giving a better and more reliable indicator of the health of a home ’s value .
The drop is the largest drop ever experienced by the 20 city index since its inception in 2000 .
The index also tracks a 10 city index which dropped an astounding 11.4 percent which is a record drop since data started being tracked in 1987 .
Nearly all cities in the index reported losses .
Here is a brief list of some of the year over year drops :
Miami : 19.3 %
Las Vegas : 19.3 %
Phoenix : 18.2 %
Los Angeles : 16.5 %
San Diego : 16.7 %
Tampa : 15 %
The only area in the entire index that reported a gain was Charlotte North Carolina coming in at a positive 1.8 % .
Otherwise , across the board the housing decline is accelerating and picking up steam .
Keep in mind that we are still experiencing record mortgage resets and excess inventory .
It is looking more and more that we are going to hit analyst predictions of 20 to 30 percent national median price drops once the housing market bottoms out .
Let us look at the rate reset chart :
As you can see from the above chart , we still have many more subprime loans to reset which will only increase pressure on prices and also , the excess inventory by builders is again forcing them to cut and slash prices .
We ’ve never had a run up in real estate as we have witnessed and at the same time , we have not seen a correction take speed this quickly either .
No one really predicted housing would go up as quickly as it did so to assume analyst can predict and exact bottom is presumptuous at best .
We can very likely overshoot on the downside just like we went into price ranges never before seen .
Let us look at the graph for the 20 city index :
The peak was reached in July of 2006 and we are now off by 12.5 percent from the peak .
Yet the acceleration is picking up .
For example , with the current data we see for the last month we saw a 2.35 percent drop from the previous month .
Clearly at this rate , we are going to see a 20 to 30 percent drop by the end of this year which I really do n’t see .
I do see continued drops but at a more moderate pace reaching bottom in 2009 and 2010 nationally .

Noam Chomsky , the renowned US academic , author and political activist , speaks to Avi Lewis on Al Jazeera 's Inside USA .

In the world of academia Noam Chomsky is the most cited author alive .
He talks to Inside USA about politics in the United States and this Presidential election .
Inside USA - Noam Chomsky - 20 June 08 Part 1
Inside USA - Noam Chomsky - 20 June 08 Part 2
They discuss whether the US election this year will bring real change , the ongoing conflict in Iraq and why Americans should look to their Southern American counterparts for political inspiration .
Avi Lewis : I 'd like to start by talking about the US presidential campaign .
In writing about the last election in 2004 , you called America 's system a " fake democracy " in which the public is hardly more than an irrelevant onlooker , and you 've been arguing in your work in the last year or so that the candidates this time around are considerably to the right of public opinion on all major issues .
So , the question is , do Americans have any legitimate hope of change this time around ?
And what is the difference in dynamic between America 's presidential " cup " in 2008 compared to 2004 and 2000 ?
Noam Chomsky :
There 's some differences , and the differences are quite enlightening .
I should say , however , that I 'm expressing a very conventional thought – 80 per cent of the population thinks , if you read the words of the polls , that the government is run by a few big interests looking out for themselves not for the population [ and ] 95 per cent of the public thinks that the government ought to pay attention to public opinion but it does n't .
We thought that Rambus ' legal saga was finally winding down this year , with the cards largely having fallen in Rambus ' favor .
A jury in California determined that the company 's patenting of DDR technology was not done fraudulently , and the DC Court of Appeals has determined that the FTC did not provide sufficient evidentiary support for its intervention in the RAM market .
But instead of winding down , Rambus was apparently just warming up .
The IP - only memory company has decided to start looking beyond traditional RAM manufacturing companies for further licensing , and has set its sights on graphics giant NVIDIA .
The suit was filed yesterday in the US District Court for the Northern District of California , and alleges a variety of patent violations by NVIDIA .
The allegations focus on the memory controllers used in NVIDIA products , and specifically mention both its chipsets , which use SDR and DDR RAM , and its graphics chips , which use different forms of GDDR .
Rambus obviously wants damages from NVIDIA , but the suit also raises the threat of injunctive relief .
An injunction against shipping products is the sort of low - probability , high - consequence threat that 's typically used to hasten settlements .
Rambus claims that it has been trying to negotiate a royalty agreement for six years , but has gotten nowhere with it .
The company also suggest that settling now is a good idea , as things will only get worse .
" As NVIDIA advances its product portfolio , " general counsel Tom Lavelle said in a statement , " it infringes more and more of our patents . "
Now that Rambus has a number of IP litigation victories under its belt , the company has a firmer platform from which to launch further suits .
The clearest indication of how important the courts have become for the company may be the fact that its investor relations page has a link for litigation updates .
With memory controllers going onboard the CPUs of chips from both Intel and AMD , microprocessor manufacturers may well move into Rambus ' litigation crosshairs .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Gays and lesbians marrying in California are ditching traditional wedding gifts and asking friends to contribute money to fight a ballot measure that would make their unions illegal .

A month after California began legally marrying same - sex partners , thousands of dollars that might have been spent on toasters or dinnerware for newlyweds have been donated to the campaign against the November referendum that seeks to define marriage in the state as only between a man and a woman .
“ Most of the couples marrying have been together a very long time .
They have already moved in together and some of them have kids together , ” said John Duran , president of Equality California .
“ So the usual notion of a huge reception or acquiring your first microwave is not really happening .
A lot of these couples are directing their family and friends to the wedding registry on our site to help us keep these marriages in place . ”
California ’s Supreme Court struck down a ban on same - sex marriage in May , making the state the second after Massachusetts to allow gay weddings .
Opponents hope to override the court ’s ruling by winning the November ballot .
Duran said the Equality California wedding registry Web site ( www.eqca.org ) had raised tens of thousands of dollars in the last three weeks to fight the marriage - definition measure .
Dozens of hotels , photographers and caterers serving the gay community have pledged to donate 10 percent to 50 percent of their proceeds to the campaign when their wedding services are used .

‘ DEAR FRIENDS ...’
Actor George Takei , best known for playing Mr. Sulu on the TV series “ Star Trek , ” and his partner , Brad Altman , are among the couples promoting the idea .
“ Brad and I have been together for 21 years so we have our toasters and mixers .
What are we going to do with more things ? ” said Takei , 71 , who plans to marry Altman in September in Los Angeles .
Takei , the national Coming Out spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign , has suggested friends donate to that site 's wedding registry ( here ) in lieu of gifts .
Dee and Marianne , registered on the Equality for All site ( here ) , hope to raise $ 1,500 .
“ Dear Friends , in case you were puzzling what would be a nice wedding gift for us , might we suggest ... to click ‘ Donate ’ below to make a contribution ... to defend the fundamental freedom to marry in California , ” they wrote on the site ahead of their July 19 wedding .
Although most same - sex weddings so far have been low - key , comedian Ellen DeGeneres has said she is planning a “ dream wedding ” to her partner , Australian actress Portia de Rossi , and will broadcast some of it on her TV chat show .
Duran said he believed the marriage of DeGeneres , one of the most prominent lesbians in popular U.S. culture , would boost the same - sex marriage cause with voters .
“ A lot of the undecided voters in California are middle - aged women of both political parties and many of them watch Ellen on television and think very highly of her , ” Duran said .
“ So we think Ellen ’s wedding will be very helpful . ”

Hint :
It ’s not just upbringing and culture .
Back in 2005 James Wolcott wrote of torture : “ Women may take part — though I imagine it ’s rare , and under duress — but only men could devise the intricate and cruel tortures and torture devices that have been inflicted over the centuries . ”
This is one generalization about women that feminists let slide .
Lynndie England of Abu Ghraib fame was a blip on torture ’s radar screen and women would like to keep it that way .
But what infuses men with the urge to torture ?
For starters , never underestimate the impact of a hard - ass father .
Then there are the tyrannies under which many live where rule by force is the norm .
Meanwhile , for those men who live in a democracy like ours ( however putative ) , our cultural cup runneth over with blood from movies like the “ Saw ” and “ Hostel ” series and video games like Mortal Kombat and Gods of War .
Then , of course , there ’s “ 24 , ” which , in effect , gave license to embrace torture to a whole nation — including West Point cadets and Guantanamo personnel .
Philippe Sands reports in the May Vanity Fair : “ Jack Bauer had many friends at Guantanamo ” said an administration lawyer asked to sign off on enhanced interrogation techniques .
“ He gave people lots of ideas . ”
Wolcott adds : “ Only [ men ] would draw up the blueprints for machines and procedures to exact the maximum amount of pain and humiliation just shy of death . ”
At one time , diabolical machines were devised for torture : from the brank , the brazen bull , and the breaking wheel to the heretic ’s fork , the instep borer and the iron maiden .
Since then , other than the electronics of stun guns , torture implements have become more basic .
Today , a torturer is likely to equip himself with non-specialized , dual - use items like a baseball bats , cables , iron pipes , pliers , sticks , and maybe a hook on the ceiling for the strappado ( suspension by the wrists , tied behind the back ) .
In the US the torturer ’s arsenal is even more stripped down .
But its effects are maximized by techniques designed by psychologists using , among other things , sequence , duration , and humiliation , not to mention , of course , near - death drowning experiences .
In other words , men who once would have applied themselves to devising the hardware now concentrate on the software , as it were , of the process itself .
Men love this kind of brainstorming : Aside from designing software on the job , in their leisure time they play Rotisserie Baseball , Fantasy Football , and games like Dungeons and Dragons .
Speaking of dungeons , torture holds myriad other attractions to men .
For instance . . .
What man does n’t love basements ?
Actually , torture done in a basement is usually the province of a serial killer , the only form of life lower than a torturer .
State or terrorist torture is usually carried out in a basement - like environment such as an interrogation room in a prison .
Meanwhile , in some countries , like Pinochet ’s Chile , where people were tortured in National Stadium , a sports site is used .
Torture is actually like a sport .
In its cruelty it ’s comparable to dog or cock fighting .
Those are spectator sports , though , while torture is hands - on , though there ’s no danger to the participant like , say , in Mixed Martial Arts .
Yet you get your ultra-violence rocks off like in no other contact sport , even football .
But , in common with spectator sports .
. .
It calls for drinking .
In fact , only an ideologue , a religious fundamentalist , or a psychopath is likely to torture sober .
Though , outside of Abu Ghraib , it ’s hard to imagine Americans who torture drinking while on duty .
Troubling as that sounds , why should they ?
It ’s not torture , they ’re told — only enhanced interrogation techniques .
It lets you play with guns .
Not actually , since torture seldom incorporates shooting .
But hand - held electro - shock batons and stun guns are used in 20 countries .
Electricity is not all that electrifies .
Women are often raped , sometimes by a roomful of torturers .
Beyond that , the homo - erotic frisson is to die for .
Not just the psycho-sexual thrill of hurting other men , including assaults on their sexual organs .
But guys banding together to do work deemed invaluable .
In other words . . .
Male bonding to the nth degree .
Not just over the shared activity — they ’re complicit in double super - secret work verboten under normal conditions .
They ’re thus bound together in a secret society .
Why get all bent out of shape over torture when it ’s just guys being guys ?
A man has got to let off a little steam , does n’t he ?
Sure — as long as he understands that his superiors may offer him up as a sacrificial lamb or turn him into a scapegoat to escape prosecution themselves .

The work will take about five years to complete
The chocolate company Mars has announced that it is to decode the genetic structure of the cacao tree .
The research project , which is to be done in collaboration with the US Department of Agriculture and IT firm IBM , aims to improve cocoa production .
Scientists hope the Chocolate Genome Project can assist breeding programmes .
Understanding the tree 's DNA could make crop production more resistant to pests , diseases , and water shortages that may come from a warming climate .
Howard - Yana Shapiro , Mars ' global director of plant science , said African farmers stood to benefit the most as they accounted for nearly two - thirds of world cocoa production .
The research would " ultimately improve cacao trees , yield higher quality cocoa and increase income for farmers " , he told BBC News .
Dr Shapiro would not be drawn on whether the research might lead to genetically modified chocolate .
" Researchers worldwide will have access to our work , the cacao genome .
What they do with it , I can't control , " he explained .
It is likely to take approximately five years to sequence , assemble , annotate and analyse the cacao genome .
But information will be available before then , as it is gathered , through the Public Intellectual Property Resource for Agriculture ( PIPRA ) DNA sequence information will be publicly available for no charge and no information will be patented .
Dr Jane Rodgers , of the John Innes Centre in Norwich , UK , welcomed the fact that the research results would be put in a public database .
" This kind of approach is the norm , " she said .
" The results of the project will underpin all research in the field and stimulate its application to the greater benefit of all . "
Dr John Orchard , of the Natural Resources Institute in Kent , said that it was essential to develop hardier varieties regardless of climate change .
" The cocoa crop is particularly vulnerable to disease .
Sixty percent of the Brazilian harvest was wiped out by a disease called witches recently and this kind of impact is not uncommon , " he told BBC News .
The research is similar to the sequencing of the rice genome five years ago .
That project has already led to " huge strides " in the basic understanding of the food crop , according to Dr Hugh Jones of the Institute of Arable Crop Research in Harpenden in Hertfordshire .
" This study should lead to similar benefits , " he said .
Project workers at IBM's TJ Watson Research Centre in New York will use their experience of computational biology to create a detailed genetic map of cacao .

What are these ?
Listen to the author read this essay .
On June 9 , 2008 , a counterrevolution began on the floor of the House of Representatives against the gas and oil crooks who had seized control of the federal government .
This counterrevolution began in the exact place which had slumbered during the all - out assault on our liberties and the Constitution itself .
I wish to draw the attention of the blog world to Rep.
Dennis Kucinich ’s articles of impeachment presented to the House in order that two faithless public servants be removed from office for crimes against the American people .
As I listened to Rep. Kucinich invoke the great engine of impeachment — he listed some 35 crimes by these two faithless officials — we heard , like great bells tolling , the voice of the Constitution itself speak out ringingly against those who had tried to destroy it .
Although this is the most important motion made in Congress in the 21st century , it was also the most significant plea for a restoration of the republic , which had been swept to one side by the mad antics of a president bent on great crime .
And as I listened with awe to Kucinich , I realized that no newspaper in the U.S. , no broadcast or cable network , would pay much notice to the fact that a highly respected member of Congress was asking for the president and vice president to be tried for crimes which were carefully listed by Kucinich in his articles requesting impeachment .
But then I have known for a long time that the media of the U.S. and too many of its elected officials give not a flying fuck for the welfare of this republic , and so I turned , as I often do , to the foreign press for a clear report of what has been going on in Congress .
We all know how the self - described “ war hero , ” Mr. John McCain , likes to snigger at France , while the notion that he is a hero of any kind is what we should be sniggering at .
It is Le Monde , a French newspaper , that told a story the next day hardly touched by The New York Times or The Washington Post or The Wall Street Journal or , in fact , any other major American media outlet .
As for TV ?
Well , there was n’t much — you see , we dare not be divisive because it upsets our masters who know that this is a perfect country , and the fact that so many in it do n’t like it means that they have been terribly spoiled by the greatest health service on Earth , the greatest justice system , the greatest number of occupied prisons — two and a half million Americans are prisoners — what a great tribute to our penal passions !
Naturally , I do not want to sound hard , but let me point out that even a banana Republican would be distressed to discover how much of our nation ’s treasury has been siphoned off by our vice president in the interest of his Cosa Nostra company , Halliburton , the lawless gang of mercenaries set loose by this administration in the Middle East .
But there it was on the first page of Le Monde .
The House of Representatives , which was intended to be the democratic chamber , at last was alert to its function , and the bravest of its members set in motion the articles of impeachment of the most dangerous president in our history .
Rep Kucinich listed some 30 - odd articles describing impeachable offenses committed by the president and vice president , neither of whom had ever been the clear choice of our sleeping polity for any office .
Some months ago , Kucinich had made the case against Dick Cheney .
Now he had the principal malefactor in his view under the title “ Articles of Impeachment for President George W. Bush ” !
“ Resolved , that President George W. Bush be impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors , and that the following articles of impeachment be exhibited to the United States Senate . ”
The purpose of the resolve is that he be duly tried by the Senate , and if found guilty , be removed from office .
At this point , Rep. Kucinich presented his 35 articles detailing various high crimes and misdemeanors for which removal from office was demanded by the framers of the Constitution .
Update : On Wednesday , the House voted by 251 to 166 to send Rep.
Kucinich ’s articles of impeachment to a committee which probably wo n’t get to the matter before Bush leaves office , a strategy that is “ often used to kill legislation , ” as the Associated Press noted later that day .

I live in the real world .
It is a glorious natural world , a world of matter and energy .
It is void of magic , monsters , or gods , but none of this detracts from its beauty in the slightest way .
I regularly experience feelings of awe , interconnectedness , and transcendence in the real world .
These are feelings that some people prefer to label as " spirituality , " and while that is not the term I prefer , I usually do n't object .
Life in the real world involves balance .
This is a world filled with pleasure and joy but also with pain and sadness .
Living in this world involves freedom , but it also entails great responsibility .
There are no reset buttons or take - backs here .
Those of us who live in the real world experience great joy .
We fall in love and develop meaningful friendships .
Some raise children , and many contribute to society in countless ways that result in a sense of accomplishment .
Part of the intensity of the joy we experience comes from our recognition that our time is limited .
We strive to make our mark while we can because our time is short .
Indeed , there are many sources of pleasure associated with living in the real world .
In the real world , we recognize that things are not always as we want them to be .
Pain exists , nature can be cruel , and all sentient beings will someday die .
All of us will lose people we love .
We will not like these things , but we not deny their reality .
We have no use for delusions here , for we understand that suffering is part of existence .
That is not to say that we do not experience grief or that we never seek comfort .
We find consolation here in the real world through each other and our daily routines .
We are sometimes afraid in the real world .
We have frightening experiences we cannot immediately explain .
We seek reassurance and safety from others , and we find that most of our fears melt away with an improved understanding of our world .
When faced with fear or uncertainty , we use the light of science and reason illuminate our way .
We have no use for the many mythical creatures our ancestors created .
These gods , angels , and demons once served a purpose .
They were necessary when our ancestors had no viable alternatives for explaining their surroundings .
They are no longer necessary .
Life in the real world has improved immeasurably as science and reason have rendered mysticism and superstition obsolete .
We recognize that groveling before imaginary beings does not lead to understanding and is no substitute for action .
The temporary comfort it may provide is a false comfort .
To be sure , pockets of darkness remain where superstition and ignorance not only persist but are so widespread that they may seem like the norm .
Many people have yet to step into the real world and remain trapped in delusion .
Some cannot imagine any other existence , and others are misinformed or afraid .
They are not bad people , and we should be able to empathize with their plight .
After all , many of us were once in their shoes .
Many of us once believed in at least some of what they now believe .
Their presence should remind us of how fortunate we are to live in the real world , but it should also prompt us to extend a hand in friendship and invite them to join us in the real world .
There is plenty of room here .

It was revised and expanded in 2018 .
My niece is traveling to Mexico next week .
She will be visiting two towns , Cholula and Puebla , which I have always enjoyed for their photographic opportunities .
She had asked me if I had any " requests " and I had said no ; that she should shoot whatever catches her interest .
I know that she subscribes to this blog .
I wo n't make requests , but I will offer a couple of bits of advice .
Relax .
The first step in learning any skill is to relax .
If the photographer is uptight , he or she is focused on themselves .
A required first skill is observation , learning how to see simple , familiar things .
My garden has not only become a source of food , but is also an incredible collection of shapes , textures and colors .
I had never before seen the beauty and complexity of a head of lettuce .
Each day should be a new adventure .
The Discovery Channel is running a campaign this summer .
The theme is that " we live on a pretty amazing planet " .
We do , and the photographer 's day should be full of happy accidents .
Of course , Helen , if you do n't carry your camera , the accident is only a memory .
Or a tall tale .
Happy accidents .
On a trip to Australia I was feeling depressed as I wandered a beautiful stretch of the coast .
Nothing caught my eye .
About to turn back , I gave myself one more bend ; one more turn in the road .
I arrived at the one spot where a group of young men were practicing for the World Lifeguard Competition .
So Helen , relax and recognize the value of the familiar .
Carry your camera so that you can record those happy accidents .
Spend some quiet moments before you leave observing your collection of shoes , or the towel collection at the gym .
Learn to " see " .
If you cannot find beauty in your backyard , what will you see on the other side of the world ?
A child raised in a desert village will cry with delight when handed a bouquet of dandelions .
A flower in a tin can is one person 's garden .

In my not too distant past , if I were to see a street person , a bum , sleeping in a door front or on a park bench , I would have kept my distance and perhaps shrugged my shoulders . :

Using stem cells from umbilical cord blood and bone marrow , researchers have apparently cured a fatal genetic disease in a 2 - year - old Minneapolis boy , which could open the door for other stem cell treatments .
For the first time in his life , Nate Liao is wearing normal clothes , eating food that has not been pureed , and playing with his siblings .
“ Nate ’s quality of life is forever changed , ” said Dr. John Wagner of the University of Minnesota Medical School , who performed the treatment .
“ Maybe we can take one more disorder off the incurable list . ”
The team later treated Nate ’s 5 - year - old brother , Jacob , and is preparing to treat 9 - month - old Sarah Rose Mooreland of Folsom , Calif .
Hopes are high for them as well .

Nate suffers from recessive epidermolysis bullosa , which affects 1 in 100,000 children .
They lack a critical protein called collagen type VII that anchors the skin and lining of the gastrointestinal system to the body .
Their skin is extraordinarily fragile .
Tearing and blistering occur with minimal friction , leading to painful wounds and scarring .
Solid food produces erosion of the esophagus .
Death usually results from malnutrition , infections or aggressive skin cancer .
The only treatment previously has been to wrap the skin in bandages .
The idea of using circulating stem cells to treat the condition was developed by Dr. Angela M. Christiano of Columbia University Medical Center .
This is the first time that cells from bone marrow and cord blood have been used to treat a condition that does not involve blood .

Seven months after treatment , Nate ’s body is making collagen type VII , Wagner said at a news conference Tuesday .
His face has plumped up and he has fewer blisters .
“ I have watched Nate improve every day , ” said his mother , Theresa .
The results will be published in a future issue of the New England Journal of Medicine .

Who knew the Bush administration actually had a strategy in fighting Al Qaeda ?
Robert Grenier , who according to Joby Warrick of the Washington Post is “ a former top CIA counterterrorism official who is now managing director of Kroll , a risk consulting firm ” explained that we were now winning the fight against Al Qaeda after losing so many battles because :
One of the lessons we can draw from the past two years is that al - Qaeda is its own worst enemy .
Where they have succeeded initially , they very quickly discredit themselves .
And you did n’t think Bush had a strategy .
It ’s the old “ invade - two - countries - and - use - heavy - handed - tactics - to - rile - up - the - extremists - so - that - they - initially - have - public - support - but - then - pretend - to - have - an - incompetent - strategy - to - combat- the - extremists - so - that - they - succeed - which - will - then - lead - to - the- public - turning - on- them - because - they - are - evil - doers - after - all . ”
One of Sun Tzu ’s classic stratagems .
And apparently one which is having some success – as Peter Bergen and Paul Cruickshank suggest in their important piece in The New Republic , “ The Unraveling . ”
Bergen and Cruickshank attribute the ideological rifts within the Muslim extremist community to Al Qaeda ’s strategic blunders – but they do not give Bush enough credit for his secret plan to let Al Qaeda succeed so that their empty ideology could be exposed for what it is by fellow extremists .
Bush ’s secret plan to win the War on Terrorism bears a strong resemblance to Ronald Reagan ’s plan to defeat the Communist Soviet Union .
By convincing the public and most of his administration that the USSR had taken a significant lead in all sorts of military areas , he increased America ’s military spending exponentially .
As the Soviet Union tried to keep up , it eventually collapsed exposing it ’s system ’s hidden flaws .
Although the CIA was caught by surprise by this development during George H. W. Bush ’s first term , conservatives quickly confirmed that this was all part of Reagan ’s secret plan to end the destroy the Soviet Union by spending like a drunken sailor in America .
George W. Bush – whose wisdom , like Reagan ’s is often compared to that of the mythical hedgehog of Isaiah Berlin ’s famous essay – has been blessed with authentically evil enemies .
Even if he allows them to win , within their winning are the seeds of their destruction .
It is a cunning strategy .
Now we just have to make sure we do n’t choose a president who screws it all up by going after Al Qaeda in a competent fashion – a competence that might even distinguish between the Muslim extremist groups that are fighting with one another .
It might look like Al Qaeda ’s recent troubles happened despite , rather than because of , Bush ’s ingenious strategy .
But that ’s only because we did n’t give enough credit to Bush and John McCain for having this secret strategy .
Now that we know , it ’s important to support the right American candidate for this American presidency in this American election against all those anti-Americans out there .
Vote for the Bush - McCain Super - Secret Counterterrorism Strategy : Winning the War on Terrorism by Losing Every Battle and Letting Al Qaeda Defeat Itself !

Juan “ Willie ” Vasquez said he still wakes from nightmares , clawing at the air and crying out for protection from the police .
“ It ’s always me running from the cops , and there are lots of them , ” the 16 - year - old said in an interview Wednesday .
“ I ’m dreaming about it all the time . ”
An encounter with a Denver police officer , who has been charged with felony assault , left the teen with a kidney that no longer works and a pile of unpaid medical bills in excess of $ 100,000 .
A tube now drains waste from his body .
He aches all the time .
He sleeps most of the day .
“ I just want my life back , ” he said during his first public comments on the incident .
He was once a par golfer , accomplished enough to attract the eyes of those who run the Park Hill Golf Club .
Now he wonders whether the kidney will ever function again .
On April 18 , at 9:30 p.m. , Vasquez had a beer in his hand while with a group of friends on the front porch of a home near West 37th Avenue and Pecos Street when he was spotted by Officer Charles Porter and others from the Denver police gang unit .
Vasquez , who says he ’s not a gang member , says he ran because he ’s a 16 - year - old who knew he was caught with an unopened beer .
The district attorney ’s office has said that when Porter caught up to Vasquez , the 12 - year veteran officer subdued the 5 - foot - 6 , 130 - pound teen and jumped up and down on his back .
Vasquez said he had tripped near a fence after being hit with a flashlight by another officer and that he curled up on the ground before Porter started jumping on him .
“ I begged , ‘ Please , please stop . ’
The pain was unbearable , ” Vasquez said .
“ It could have been death if he had done it a couple more times .
It would have busted me right open . ”
Porter has been charged with felony assault .
Vasquez , who had to be rushed to the emergency room , was never cited for the beer , he said .
“ His worst crime was being a kid , ” said his adult cousin Veronica Gonzales , who , as his legal guardian , has raised him since his mother died when he was 9 .
Vasquez declined to discuss whether he had a juvenile record , though Gonzales acknowledged he is “ not an angel . ”
But she insisted any brushes he had with the law were minor .
A police report on the April 18 incident makes no mention of any warrant for Vasquez ’s arrest when Porter started chasing him .
The city has placed Porter on unpaid leave from the Police Department ’s gang unit pending the conclusion of the criminal charges .
Porter has declined to comment , and city officials also have declined to discuss specifics .
Gonzales said she had to leave her job to care for Vasquez , whom she considers a son .
She must clean his bandages daily and make sure the tube that takes waste from his body does n’t clog .
She said she must monitor the bag of waste he carries at his side and clear it when it becomes full .
She said there is no way to pay for the medical bills she keeps in a file folder .
The family has no insurance .
The bill for Vasquez ’s stay in the intensive - care unit came to nearly $ 60,000 .
Then there ’s the ambulance trip , the medication and the follow - up visits .
She said the doctors have told her they will no longer treat him for life - threatening injuries and will refer bills to a collections agency unless she starts making $ 350 monthly payments .
She said they also tell her she must come up with $ 155 for each additional visit .
After learning that the doctors would no longer provide treatment without payments , the family this week tried on their own to remove the waste tube to see whether Vasquez could function without it .
His temperature soared to 102 degrees , so they reattached the tube .
They are hoping the public will contribute to the Juan Vasquez Trust that they established at Chase bank to help them cope with the medical bills .
A bank officer confirmed that contributions can be made at a Chase bank branch or by mailing a check to the Chase bank at 2040 S. University Blvd. , Denver , CO 80210 .
Vasquez and Gonzales , who say they are Denver natives , plan to file for Medicaid coverage to see whether it will help pay the medical bills , but getting final approval could take as long as 90 days .
The family has filed a police - brutality lawsuit , hoping to recoup damages from the city .
But for now there is bill after bill — and no way to pay .
For now , Vasquez said , his bad dreams continue .
Gonzales said she hears him crying out in his basement bedroom .
She said that when she checks on him , he ’s flailing .
She said when he wakes , he screams : “ You ’re telling them I ’m here .
You ’re telling them I ’m here .
You ’re telling them I ’m down here . ”

Update : According to Amazon , the O’Reilly Kindle books can now be pre-ordered , but wo n’t be available for download until Friday .
The 12 titles listed below are now available in the Kindle store .
As promised last month , O’Reilly has released 30 titles as DRM - free downloadable ebook bundles .
The bundles include three ebook formats ( EPUB , PDF , and Kindle - compatible Mobipocket ) for a single price — at or below the book ’s cover price .
And for a bit more than the cover price , you can get the print version too along with the ebook bundles .
Since we began selling PDFs directly some time ago , we ’ve given those customers free updates to the PDFs to reflect published changes in the books ; the same will apply to the ebook bundle , which will replace the PDF option on those titles .
These files ( like all our PDFs currently for sale ) do not include any DRM , though we continue to experiment with custom watermarking options .
With these three formats , customers should be able to read the books with most current ebook software and devices , including Adobe Digital Editions , Kindle , Blackberries , and Sony Reader ( Sony announced in May that EPUB support is forthcoming in a firmware update for their Reader ) .
Twelve of those 30 titles will also be available through the Kindle store later today are now available .
Ebook Bundles Now Available
The titles now available as ebook bundles are :
Kindle Titles Available Later Today Now
These books should all be are now available from the Kindle store later today :
What ’s Missing on the Kindle
Of the 30 titles we ’ve released as part of this ebook pilot , only 12 will be available right away are now available on the Kindle store .
As we ’ve mentioned before , the Kindle does not currently support some of the elements that are pretty critical to many of our books , including tables and monospaced fonts .
Right now if you see a proper table in any Kindle book , it ’s actually just an image of the table — which means it ’s neither searchable nor resizable , two key features in an ebook .
Because the bundles available from oreilly .com include PDFs that mirror the printed book , we felt comfortable including Mobipocket files for Kindle users in all 30 , even though many include tables that will not properly display on the Kindle .
Since Kindle store customers wo n’t have the benefit of the PDF for reference , we ’re only including titles there that have had their tables converted to images — an unfortunately arduous process that may take a few weeks for the remaining 18 titles .
All 30 of the above titles will be available in the Kindle store within a few weeks ( and customers who bought the bundle will receive updated Mobipocket versions for free as they become available ) .
We did work with Amazon to experiment using an alternative for rendering our books on the Kindle so they ’d more closely match the printed layout ( including tables and monospaced text ) .
But that option involved Amazon converting our PDFs into their undocumented and opaque topaz file format — a process that also undermined the searchability of the content .
We look forward to seeing Amazon support real tables , monospaced fonts , and the EPUB format natively in the Kindle .
You can find more information about O’Reilly ebooks , including details on the different formats , at oreilly .com / ebooks .
We welcome your feedback on our ebooks , and encourage you to tell Amazon that you want tables , monospaced fonts , and native EPUB supported on your Kindle .
Gallup Daily : Obama Takes Lead Over McCain , 48 % to 42 %
Has consistently led McCain since Clinton decided to suspend campaign
PRINCETON , NJ -- Barack Obama is enjoying a modest bump in support following Hillary Clinton 's exit from the presidential race .
The latest Gallup Poll Daily tracking update finds Obama leading Republican John McCain , 48 % to 42 % , among registered voters nationwide .
Obama has consistently held a lead of five to seven percentage points each night since it was reported that Hillary Clinton intended to suspend her campaign .
These represent Obama 's strongest showing versus McCain to date in Gallup Poll Daily tracking of registered voters ' presidential election preferences .
For much of the time since Gallup began tracking general election preferences in mid-March , McCain and Obama have been in a statistical dead heat .
( To view the complete trend since March 7 , 2008 , click here . )
Today 's data are based on June 6 - 8 interviewing .
Gallup had been reporting a five - day rolling average for the general election to this point , but now that the major party candidates are known Gallup will move to reporting a three - day rolling average .
Obama would still hold a statistically significant lead ( matching his best to date ) in the five - day rolling average based on June 4 - 8 interviewing given his recent stronger performance .
Since Obama clinched the nomination , Gallup has also asked registered voters for their Obama - McCain preference if Clinton were Obama 's vice presidential running mate .
At this point , Clinton would seem to give a slight three - point boost to Obama 's margin over McCain , with the Obama - Clinton ticket leading McCain by an average of 51 % to 42 % over the past three days .
There is not an overwhelming consensus among Democrats that Obama choose Clinton as his No. 2 .
In the latest Gallup Poll Daily tracking update ( based on June 6 - 8 data ) , 53 % of Democrats say Obama should pick his former nomination rival for vice president , while 36 % say he should choose someone else .
-- Jeff Jones
Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The general - election results are based on combined data from June 6 - 8 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 2,389 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
For results based on the 1,516 Democrats and Democratic leaning - independents interviewed June 6 - 8 , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japan will consider imposing an environment tax as part of discussions this autumn on an overhaul of the tax system , the government ’s top advisory panel said on Tuesday , a move that could prompt opposition from businesses .

Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda , who heads the panel , has put climate change as the centerpiece of his policy in the lead - up to a G8 summit next month , where global warming is high on the agenda .
In a draft of the economic policy outline for 2008 , the panel also said the government will “ put its utmost efforts ” behind spending cuts , although Fukuda ’s faltering support rate is making it politically difficult to press on with fiscal reforms .
The annual report by the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy upheld a five - year plan to cut spending by 11.4 - 14.3 trillion yen ( $ 105.7-132.6 billion ) to achieve a target of balancing the budget , excluding debt issuance and servicing , by fiscal 20011/ 12 .
Fiscal belt - tightening efforts have been prompted by Japan ’s mounting public debt .
Outstanding public debt is estimated at 778 trillion yen , or roughly 148 percent of gross domestic product by the end of the fiscal year to next March , the worst among major industrial nations .
But pressure on the government from ruling party lawmakers to loosen the spending faucet are increasing as they fear further cuts in public spending would hurt voters ’ support .
Government sources have said a “ coalition ” of lawmakers from the both ruling and opposition parties has been pressing the government to increase spending on social security and education , the areas most likely to catch voters ’ attention .
The ruling lawmakers will have opportunities to scrutinize the panel ’s draft report at party committees before it is formally approved by the cabinet in late June .
“ It is still uncertain whether the government ’s belt - tightening efforts will succeed as the very foundation of the Fukuda administration is shaky and a snap election may be down the road , ” said Takehiro Sato , a senior economist at Morgan Stanley Japan .
Deteriorating economic conditions are also making it difficult to achieve the budget - balancing target , Sato said .
“ As the Japanese economy is barely avoiding a recession , smaller - than - expected tax revenues could undermine the government ’s tight budget policy , ” he said .
BUSINESSES CAUTIOUS ON ENVIRONMENT TAX
Recent polls show Fukuda ’s support rate hovering near 20 percent partly on doubts about his ability to push forward policy with a divided parliament .
The opposition controls parliament ’s upper house and has delayed legislation and blocked key appointments , including the government ’s first two choices for Bank of Japan governor .
Fukuda hopes for a turnaround by displaying leadership in hammering out steps forward a low carbon world at the Group of Eight leading nations ’ summit meeting on July 7 - 9 .
Fukuda announced last week a green policy including a trial system for carbon trade this year and a target to cut its emissions by 60 - 80 percent by 2050 .
Fukuda also proposed raising the proportion of Japan ’s energy from “ zero emission power ” sources such as nuclear , solar , wind and hydro power to more than 50 percent from the current 40 percent , and said an environment tax should be considered as part of overall tax reforms to be debated later this year .
But an environment tax has been controversial as businesses , mainly in the manufacturing sector , worry that such a tax would shackle their activities .
Japan ’s biggest business lobby , Keidanren , has expressed opposition to taxing carbon dioxide emissions .
A spokesman for the lobby said it may repeat its opposition in its annual requests on the tax system to be submitted to the government later this year .

It is dangerous to reveal the truth about the illegal and immoral things our government does with our money and in our name , and the war on journalists who dare reveal such truths is very much a bipartisan affair .

After Downing Street | Someone just pointed this out to me .
FBI claims to be continuing anthrax investigation .
They ’ve narrowed it to “ about four ” suspects and “ at least three ” of them are from Fort Detrick .
FBI Focusing on ‘ About Four ’ Suspects in 2001 Anthrax Attacks
By Catherine Herridge and Ian McCaleb , Fox News
Friday , March 28 , 2008
WASHINGTON – The FBI has narrowed its focus to “ about four ” suspects in the 6 1/2 - year investigation of the deadly anthrax attacks of 2001 , and at least three of those suspects are linked to the Army ’s bioweapons research facility at Fort Detrick in Maryland , FOX News has learned .
Among the pool of suspects are three scientists – a former deputy commander , a leading anthrax scientist and a microbiologist – linked to the research facility , known as USAMRIID .
The FBI has collected writing samples from the three scientists in an effort to match them to the writer of anthrax - laced letters that were mailed to two U.S. senators and at least two news outlets in the fall of 2001 , a law enforcement source confirmed .
The anthrax attacks began shortly after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , further alarming a nation already reeling from the deaths of 3,000 Americans .
Five people were killed and more than a dozen others were infected by the deadly spores in the fall of 2001 .
A leading theory is that the anthrax was stolen from Fort Detrick and then sealed inside the letters .
A law enforcement source said the FBI is essentially engaged in a process of elimination .
Much of the early public focus fell on a Fort Detrick scientist named Steven Hatfill , who is suing federal authorities for identifying him as a person of interest .
Now the FBI is focusing on other scientists at the facility .
“ Fort Detrick is run by the United States Army .
It ’s the most secure biological warfare research center in the United States , ” a bioterrorism expert told FOX News .
Asked to comment on the likelihood that the anthrax originated at the facility , the expert said :
“ It ’s not suprising , except that it would underscore that there was serious security deficiencies that existed at one time at Fort Detrick – the ability of researchers to smuggle out some type of very sophisticated anthrax weapon and in some quantity .
And , nevertheless , it was possible . ”
In December 2001 , an Army commander tried to dispel the possibility of a connection to Fort Detrick by taking the media on a rare tour of the base .
The commander said the Army used only liquid anthrax , not powder , for its experiments .
“ I would say that it does not come from our stocks , because we do not use that dry material , ” Maj. Gen. John Parker said .
The letters that were mailed to the media and Sens.
Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy all contained powdered anthrax .
But in an e-mail obtained by FOX News , scientists at Fort Detrick openly discussed how the anthrax powder they were asked to analyze after the attacks was nearly identical to that made by one of their colleagues .
“ Then he said he had to look at a lot of samples that the FBI had prepared … to duplicate the letter material , ” the e-mail reads .
“ Then the bombshell .
He said that the best duplication of the material was the stuff made by [ name redacted ] .
He said that it was almost exactly the same … his knees got shaky and he sputtered , ‘ But I told the General we did n’t make spore powder ! ' ”
Asked for comment , an Army spokeswoman referred all calls to the FBI .
The FBI would not comment about the pool of suspects , but a spokeswoman said the investigation clearly remains a priority .

A metajoke is a joke that references itself as a joke .
Here 's an example :
Or for all you scientists :
An engineer , a physicist and a mathematician find themselves in an
anecdote , indeed an anecdote quite similar to many that you have
no doubt already heard .
After some observations and rough calculations
the engineer realizes the situation and starts laughing .
A few
minutes later the physicist understands too and chuckles to himself
happily as he now has enough experimental evidence to publish a
paper .
This leaves the mathematician somewhat perplexed , as he
had observed right away that he was the subject of an anecdote ,
and deduced quite rapidly the presence of humour from similar
anecdotes , but considers this anecdote to be too trivial a corollary
to be significant , let alone funny .

It ’s 10:45 a.m. on a cloudy day , and the crew of Druk Air flight KB205 is preparing to land at their home airport of Paro , Bhutan .
Suddenly , ominous warnings start blaring , alerting them that their flight angle is all wrong and their rate of descent is far too fast .
They fly a series of unconventional right - and - left banks through a narrow channel of hillsides before centering the swaying jet and putting it on the tarmac .
An emergency situation ?
Not quite .
In fact , this is a completely normal — however nail - biting — landing at Paro Airport , set 7,300 feet above sea level .
Because of the airport ’s tightly cropped valley , surrounded by 16,000 - foot - high serrated Himalayan peaks , this drama replays itself on every flight .
There ’s a sobering saying among pilots : " Any landing you can walk away from is a good landing . "
And it ’s not until you fly into places like Paro , or Toncontìn Airport in Tegucigalpa , Honduras , that the adage starts to make sense .
Both are surrounded by mountains , and Toncontìn has one of the world ’s shortest international runways ; each requires a series of hard last - minute banks .
It ’s no wonder both give even the most seasoned pilots — not to mention their passengers — the sweats .
While Bhutan is the most extreme example — only eight pilots in the world are qualified to fly into Paro — a number of the world ’s airports , from St. Maarten in the Caribbean to Madeira Airport in Funchal , can present challenges for pilots .
" A lot of these airports require additional training and route familiarization because they ’re so crazy , " says one commercial pilot who flies international routes .
According to aviation experts , mitigating factors range from the truncated length of runways to unique atmospheric and meteorological conditions , dramatic geographical settings , heavy air traffic , or a combination thereof .
" Sometimes it ’s just the way the airport is laid out that makes it a pain , " says the pilot , referring to whether an airport is situated askew .
One such tricky spot : Reagan International Airport , in Washington , D.C.
That ’s not because of strange Potomac River winds or the pressure of being watched by statues of past presidents .
It ’s the excess of government buildings and restricted airspace that makes setting down here like threading a needle with a 200 - ton hunk of metal .
In fact , cities are often tough : for years ( 73 , to be exact ) , the honor of the world ’s most harrowing airport was reserved for Hong Kong ’s Kai Tak , whose single runway was jammed in between Victoria Harbor and densely populated Kowloon .
Pilots had to battle crosswinds and fly a complicated curved approach , all while dodging mountains and high - rises .
Kai Tak was shuttered in 1998 and replaced by a modern mega - port located on a reclaimed island out in the South China Sea .
But many locales do n’t have that luxury , and continue to operate with their existing facilities , many of which include palm sweat - inducing approaches and photo - worthy opportunities .
And it ’s not always the landing that ’s the stuff of lore .
Matekane Air Strip , in the tiny African kingdom of Lesotho , features a stunted 1,312 - foot - long runway perched at the edge of a couloir that sits at 7,550 feet .
According to celebrated bush pilot Tom Claytor , depending on the wind during takeoff , it ’s entirely possible for the aircraft not to be airborne by the end of the airstrip .
" Instead , " he says , " you shoot off the end of the airstrip , then drop down the 2,000 - foot cliff face until you start flying . "
It ’s enough to make you take the train .

As tomorrow 's FCC net neutrality vote looms ,
Ars has been sharing as much of our reporting on the topic as possible .
And this week , a longtime reader nudged us about this classic on the FCC's Carterfone decision from nearly 50 years ago .
" This story is extremely relevant to the current Net Neutrality debate in that it provides a historical precedent to debunk arguments about regulation stifling innovation , " the reader writes .
" It shows that this battle is not a recent development , but goes back decades .
Might you consider republishing it so that this story can get new exposure ? "
Ask nicely ( and offer a great suggestion ) , and you shall receive .
This story originally ran in June 2008 .
Below , it appears unchanged except for updates to the time frame ( the piece originally ran on the decision 's 40th anniversary ) .
Nearly 50 years ago , the Federal Communications Commission issued one of the most important Orders in its history , a ruling that went unnoticed by most news sources at the time .
It involved an application manufactured and distributed by one Mr. Thomas Carter of Texas .
The " Carterfone " allowed users to attach a two - way radio transmitter / receiver to their telephone , extending its reach across sprawling Texas oil fields where managers and supervisors needed to stay in touch .
Between 1955 and 1966 , Carter 's company sold about 3,500 of these apps around the United States and well beyond .
In the end , however , Carterfone 's significance extends far beyond the convenience that Thomas Carter 's machine provided its users over a decade .
It is no exaggeration to say that the world that Ars Technica writes about was created , in good part , by the legal battle between Carter , AT&T , and the FCC 's resolution of that fight — its Carterfone decision .
The Carterfone saga starts as the appealing tale of one developer 's willingness to stick to his guns .
But it is really about the victory of two indispensable values : creativity and sharing .
Neither just nor reasonable
The dominant telephone company in the United States fiercely opposed Carterfone .
AT&T and the last surviving independent telco , the southwest 's General Telephone , told their customers that they should not use the attachment because it was a " prohibited interconnecting device . "
To be fair , that was true , legally speaking .
Americans bought the vast majority of telephone equipment from AT&T's Western Electric company because they had to , specifically because of FCC Tariff Number 132 : " No equipment , apparatus , circuit or device not furnished by the telephone company shall be attached to or connected with the facilities furnished by the telephone company , whether physically , by induction or otherwise . "
Thomas Carter thought that this was bunk .
He took AT&T and General Telephone to federal court , arguing that their warnings to consumers represented a violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act .
In 1966 the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit agreed that they would decide the suit — but not before the FCC reconsidered Tariff Number 132 .
The agency then appointed an investigator to look into the matter .
AT&T may have thought it had an ally in the FCC circa 1966 , but that was no longer the case .
The Commission had been chastened by an earlier controversy over a device called the Hush - A - Phone .
This ridiculous proceeding involved AT&T 's objection to a small plastic receiver snap - on which allowed business phone talkers to chat more quietly .
The FCC took an astounding seven years to thoughtlessly back Ma Bell on the issue , only to see its decision slapped silly by an appellate court .
" To say that a telephone subscriber may produce the result in question by cupping his hand and speaking into it , but may not do so by using a device which leaves his hand free to write or do whatever else he wishes , is neither just nor reasonable , " the bemused judges observed in 1956 .
Now the best that AT&T's clever lawyers could do was convince the FCC to let them write a new policy with a codicil allowing for non-electric applications like Hush - A - Phone .
But the phone giant still insisted that Carterfone posed a danger .
It was June 26 , 1968 when the FCC acted on Carterfone .
Robert F. Kennedy had been buried two weeks earlier .
In Czechoslovakia , followers of the " Prague Spring " fought against Communist rule .
Students revolted against mindless bureaucracies at Columbia University , in Paris , in Seoul , in Mexico City .
In these stormy times almost no one noticed as the FCC's Commissioners quietly rebelled against the world 's biggest telco , unleashing the future .

The promised age of the paperless office has largely failed to eventuate , thanks in part to improvements in printers and photocopiers that have made it easier than ever to produce hard copies of documents , but primarily because many of us remain addicted to the tangibility , portability and sheer convenience of paper .
Now Xerox Corporation scientists have invented a way to make prints that last only a day before fading , meaning paper can be used again and again .
The technology , which is still in a preliminary state , blurs the line between paper documents and digital displays and could ultimately lead to a significant reduction in paper use .
The experimental printing technology , a collaboration between the Xerox Research Centre of Canada and PARC ( Palo Alto Research Center Inc. ) , could someday replace printed pages that are used for just a brief time before being discarded .
Xerox estimates that as many as two out of every five pages printed in the office are for what it calls " daily " use , like e-mails , Web pages and reference materials that have been printed for a single viewing .
Xerox has filed for patents on the technology , which it calls " erasable paper . "
It is currently part of a laboratory project that focuses on the concept of future dynamic documents .
To develop erasable paper , researchers needed to identify ways to create temporary images .
The " a - ha " moment came from developing compounds that change color when they absorb a certain wavelength of light but then will gradually disappear .
In its present version , the paper self - erases in about 16 - 24 hours and can be used multiple times .
While scientists at XRCC work on the chemistry of the technology , their counterparts at PARC - the birthplace of the laser printer - are investigating ways to build a device that could write the image onto the special paper .
PARC researchers developed a prototype " printer " that creates the image on the paper using a light bar that provides a specific wavelength of light as a writing source .
The written image fades naturally over time or can be immediately erased by exposing it to heat .
Temporary documents are part of Xerox 's ongoing investments in sustainable innovation - or " green products " - that deliver measurable benefits to the environment .
So while the paperless office looks set to remain a pipe - dream for the foreseeable future , erasable paper has the potential to significantly cut office paper use and reduce waste .

“ Mary had a little lamb / And when she saw it sicken /
She shipped it off to Packingtown /
And now it ’s labeled chicken . ”
That little ditty famously summarized the message of “ The Jungle , ” Upton Sinclair ’s 1906 exposé of conditions in America ’s meat - packing industry .
Sinclair ’s muckraking helped Theodore Roosevelt pass the Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection Act  and for most of the next century , Americans trusted government inspectors to keep their food safe .
Lately , however , there always seems to be at least one food - safety crisis in the headlines  tainted spinach , poisonous peanut butter and , currently , the attack of the killer tomatoes .
The declining credibility of U.S. food regulation has even led to a foreign - policy crisis : there have been mass demonstrations in South Korea protesting the pro-American prime minister ’s decision to allow imports of U.S. beef , banned after mad cow disease was detected in 2003 .
How did America find itself back in The Jungle ?
It started with ideology .
Hard - core American conservatives have long idealized the Gilded Age , regarding everything that followed  not just the New Deal , but even the Progressive Era  as a great diversion from the true path of capitalism .
Economists differ over how much outsourcing will change the American job market in the future , but there is little evidence that trade has been a major cause of job loss or even wage stagnation so far .
As Robert Z. Lawrence of the Peterson Institute for International Economics wrote in a recent study : “ The recent increase in U.S. inequality ... has little to do with global forces that might especially affect unskilled workers  namely , immigration and expanded trade with developing countries . ”
And yet all Democratic domestic policy discussions have to start with trade and , in 99.9 percent of the cases , end with trade .
And we have not even begun to plumb the insignificance of Obama ’s emphasis on Monday .
He was n’t even talking about trade in general .
He was talking about the Nafta - and Cafta - style trade agreements whose negative effects on the American economy are barely measurable .
And , to make matters even more inconsequential , he was n’t even taking a clear stand on such deals themselves .
Obama stuffed his speech with the textbook clichés that Democratic consultants tell their candidates to use when talking about trade  warnings about Chinese perfidy and lead paint in toys .
But instead of following those clichés into the realm of economic populism , he hedged .
He wound up in the no-man ’s land between Lou Dobbs - style populism and Bill Clinton - style free trade .
He made a series of on - the - one - hand / on - the - other - hand distinctions about which sort of trade deals he ’d support and which he would n’t .
It added up to a vague , watered - down version of economic light beer .
In the end , he suggested a few minor tweaks in the U.S. tax code that would have a microscopic effect on outsourcing , and a few health and safety provisions which might have teenie - weenie effects on investment decisions .
The ideas he sketched out in the speech are n’t dangerous .
They ’re just trivial .
We all know why Obama spoke the way he did on Monday .
The forces transforming the American economy are big and hard to control .
If you think your listeners are n’t sophisticated enough to grasp them , it ’s much easier to blame those perfidious foreigners for all economic woes .
It ’s much more heroic to pretend that , by opposing Nafta , you can improve the lives of middle - class voters .
Furthermore , these trade deals have become symbolic bogies for union activists .
Instead of concerning themselves with the tidal waves washing overhead , they ’ve decided to insist on bended - knee submission in the holy war against Colombia .
What I do n’t understand is why the political consultants prefer this kind of rhetoric .
Are n’t there windows in the vans they use to drive around the state ?
Do n’t they see that most middle - class voters are service workers in suburban office parks , not 1930s - style proletarians in the steel mills ?
American voters are n’t so stupid as to think their problems are caused by foreigners and malevolent lobbyists .
When Obama speaks down to his audiences , it makes me so bitter I want to cling to my laptop and my college degree .

ROME ( Reuters ) -
The global market is “ full of oil ” and rising crude prices are being artificially driven by forces trying to further their geopolitical aims , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Tuesday .
“ While the growth of consumption is lower than that of production and the market is full of oil , prices continue to rise and this situation is completely manipulated , ” Ahmadinejad said in his address to a U.N. food summit in Rome .
Without naming countries , the Iranian leader said “ hidden and unhidden hands are at work to control the prices mendaciously to pursue their political and economic aims . ”
He said the goal of “ powerful and international capitalists ” was to keep the price of oil and energy “ artificially high ” in part to justify new explorations in the North Pole and the deep seas .
In an apparent reference to the United States , he said the international community should have a mechanism to force “ the bullying powers to resort to peace and amity instead of occupation and warmongering .... ”

Giving
It the College Try
When it comes to protecting the planet , many schools have given it more than a college try .
In fact , America 's institutions of higher learning are some of the best incubators of sustainable solutions to myriad problems , and they are molding and inspiring the bright minds that will inherit the environment from the current generation of leaders .
Today 's cutting edge colleges and universities have gone way beyond simple recycling to starting organic gardens and farms , installing green roofs and solar panels , treating wastes with " living machines " and offsetting all emissions .
Some colleges are as large as small cities , while others only have a few students .
Some are household names with multi-billion dollar endowments , and others are newcomers with bootstrapped budgets .
To try and work toward rigorous criteria for assessing environmental impact , the Kentucky - based Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education has launched a pilot program .
In the meantime , here are some of the colleges that excite us with their strong commitment to going green .
Thankfully , the list is n't comprehensive .
Earlier this month , more than a hundred Israeli fighter pilots strutted their right stuff back and forth over the eastern Mediterranean .
“ There is no way , ” Helena Cobban reminds us at Just World News , that this exercise was n’t either condoned by the US or a “ US - supported or US - funded exercise , carried out by Israeli pilots in planes given to Israel by the US . ”
Meanwhile , an Israeli official had no qualms about designating it “ a dress rehearsal . ”
For what ?
A theatrical production of “ Apocalypse Now ” ?
But , said International Atomic Energy Agency chief Mohamad ElBaradei , “ If a military strike is carried out against Iran at this time .
. . it would make me unable to continue my work . ”
Talk about your hollow threats :
Should he follow through , the Bush administration and Israel would jump for joy .
Like Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar , ElBaradei is a Nobel Laureate who gets no respect ( though at least he ’s not under house arrest like she is ) .
His outburst , however , may just have been a spontaneous expression of frustration .
When it comes to Iran , the administration never seems to run out of tricks .
Like this one — even if it does read like something from the late Weekly World News — as posted by the esteemed Juan Cole at Informed Comment .
It seems that a conservative Iranian newspaper reported that , “ Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is alleging that the US had planned to abduct him when he visited Baghdad in March , but that the plan was foiled . ”
In response , a commenter tagged BF noted : “ The news in Persian further states that according to Mr Ahmadinejad , the US had intended to blackmail Iran for the release of him .
[ Thus illustrating ] the illusion that Mr Ahmadinejad must entertain ” about Iranians ’ love for him .
Still , as we all know , there are few depths to which Bush & Co. wo n’t stoop .
Besides , the task could have been delegated to Iraqi proxies .
Meanwhile , the US , Russia , Britain , France , and China ( the P5 + 1 — Germany ) offered economic incentives to persuade Tehran to halt uranium enrichment .
In response , Reuters reported Thursday , Ahmadinejad called the six nations “ the bullying powers . ”
Also Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki informed the US that since it ’s “ currently testing a fifth - generation nuclear bomb .
. . .
America is not in the position to be happy or unhappy with our peaceful nuclear activities . ”
Still , he notified the P5+1 countries of Iran ’s readiness to negotiate .
But what if the administration finally wears down the Pentagon and gets it to agree to attack Iran ?
No big deal .
Those who think it might kill untold numbers of Iranians , expose us to large - scale blowback , and disrupt the oil markets are just Chicken Littles .
At least that ’s what a recent report from the Washington Institute for Near East Policy would have us believe .
As David Isenberg explains at Asia Times Online , WINEP , founded by an AIPAC research director who later became ambassador to Israel , is regarded as integral to the pro-Israel lobby .
To be fair , Patrick Clawson and Michael Eisenstadt , the authors of the report , entitled “ The Last Resort : Consequences of Preventive Military Action against Iran , ” do n’t exactly advocate military action against Iran .
At least not yet : “ The time is not right .
. . diplomacy continues to offer at least a modest prospect of success . ”
But , they maintain , “ the time is right to assess the possible consequences ” of an attack .
First , though , especially because the administration has a credibility problem after invading Iraq under false pretenses , they insist on consensus .
Then , should push come to shove , Clawson and Eisenstadt have a novel idea .
The most effective strikes , “ may not necessarily be against nuclear facilities .
Iran is extraordinarily vulnerable to attacks on its oil export infrastructure . ”
Iran can get by without oil export revenues for a year , they explain .
But “ the political shock of losing the oil income could cause Iran to rethink its nuclear stance — in ways that attacks on its nuclear infrastructure might not . ”
But what about our economy ?
If “ the choice is between higher oil prices ” and a nuclear Iran , they lecture us , higher oil prices “ are not clearly the greater evil . ”
Clawson and Eisenstadt do warn that after a strike , Iran might conclude that its nuclear program “ should be pursued with greater urgency . ”
In the short term , though , they seem to think that retaliation on the part of Iran might pose but a minor inconvenience .
For example , regarding fears that Iran ’s navy could stop the shipment of oil through the Persian Gulf , they write : “ Large tankers are very difficult to sink .
. .
Mines can be swept .
. . sea lanes cleared . ”
Even more comforting , the “ Strait of Hormuz is sufficiently broad and deep to enable tankers to bypass the hulks of wrecked or sunken ships . ”
When it comes to a good cause , what ’s a lost ship or three and the bloated bodies of a few hundred US naval personnel bobbing on the surface of the Persian Gulf ?
Clawson and Eisenstadt also make a perfunctory nod to concerns about enemy casualties .
“ Anecdotal reporting from recent wars in the Balkans and Iraq featuring precision strikes [ sic ] indicates that after a few days of bombing , civilians realized that as long as they stayed away from military facilities or potential strategic targets , they could go about their business reasonably safely , even during air raids . ”
We ’re sure that , in the same situation , the authors ’ families would have just as little trouble adjusting .
Besides , Clawson and Eisenstadt write , a conflict would likely “ settle down after several weeks .
. . into a protracted , low - intensity conflict , involving terrorist attacks by Iranian agents or surrogates against U.S. interests around the world , and U.S. retaliatory actions . ”
You can see why Ms. Cobban called the report the “ Cakewalk paper . ”
Soft - pedaling the horror of a massive air attack after what we ’ve wrought in Iraq is bad enough .
But think tanks like WINEP and the neocon American Enterprise Institute leapfrog over exactly why they ’ve got it in for Iran .
In other words , they make no mention of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ’s fourth amendment , which provides signees to the pact with the right to nuclear energy .
As for nuclear weapons , think - tankers — most of Washington , in fact — and the US public seem incapable of seeing the issue from the viewpoint of the Persian and Arab street .
How come their countries can’t have nuclear weapons when their neighbor Israel has not only developed them , but , like North Korea and Pakistan , failed to even sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ?
Not to mention that the US flagrantly disregards its commitment to the NPT to disarm in a timely fashion .
“ We ’re all grown - ups here , ” Washington tells itself .
“ Sure , we ’re making ElBaradei ’s life miserable and giving little more than lip service to the NPT .
But , come on .
Iran is mad .
Its president is apoplectic , its religion apocalyptic . ”
The irony , of course , is that this applies at least as much to the US as Iran .
But Iran has an own irony of its own to contend with .
At Forbes.com , David Andelman reviewed a book published in France last year titled Iran , Le Choix des Armes by Francois Heisbourg , a former French government official .
Without a nuclear weapon , Andelman writes , Iran “ is well placed to claim leadership ” of the Middle East .
Yet “ if armed with a nuclear weapon , its advantage evaporates , as a nuclear arms race in the region would find a host of other neighboring states buying their way into the nuclear arms club . ”
Meanwhile , the American public is n’t putting up much in the way of obstacles before the administration .
We allowed it to attack Iraq because its reasons , however false , made sense to us .
Now we ’re allowing it to attack Iran because it makes no sense to us .
Perhaps because common sense enjoys the status of an eleventh commandment in America , we fail to appreciate the lack of it on the part of the administration , even after Iraq and Katrina .
Also , for better or worse , we ’re constitutionally incapable of summoning up sufficient cynicism to imagine the moral depravity required to start another war .
Maybe enough for a loaf of bread ?
WSJ
-- Robert Mugabe 's embattled regime in Zimbabwe relies on a steady supply of paper -- fortified with watermarks and other antiforgery features -- to print the bank notes that allow it to pay the soldiers and other loyalists who enable him to stay in power .
With an annual inflation rate estimated at well over 1 million percent , new notes with ever more zeros need to be printed every few weeks because the older ones lose their worth so quickly .
The Munich - based company that has supplied Zimbabwe with the special blank sheets to print its increasingly worthless dollar caved in to pressure on Tuesday from the German government for it to stop doing business with the African ruler .
Zimbabwe Inflation Facts :
A 10 million Zimbabwe dollar bank note is worth 0.0008 of a U.S. cent .
It would take 12.5 billion Zimbabwe dollars to equal one U.S. cent , and 1.25 trillion Zimbabwe dollars to equal $ 1 .
( Note that the total value of all U.S. currency in circulation is " only " $ 768 billion . )
Vending machines , which take coins , fell out of service in Zimbabwe years ago .
A single soda would require the deposit of billions of coins .
Imported from South Africa and in very short supply , a Coke sells on the black market for around 15 billion Zimbabwean dollars .
Civil servants mostly get paid through direct deposits into bank accounts , which limit withdrawals to 25 billion Zimbabwe dollars a day .
YET another big rate cut : until recently that is exactly what many investors were expecting of the Federal Reserve 's next policymaking get - together on April 29th and 30th .
After all , bold rate cuts have become the Fed 's hallmark .
Between late - January and mid-March , America 's central bank slashed short - term interest rates by two percentage points , to 2.25 % , as it staunchly sought to cushion America 's economy from the fallout of the credit crunch .
Earlier this month , Fed funds futures indicated that financial markets expected the trend to continue , with at least a quarter - point cut on April 30th and a 50 % chance of a half - point move .
No longer .
Expectations have shrivelled in recent days , and the price of Fed funds futures now imply that investors see no chance of a half - point cut and an almost 20 % likelihood of no cut at all .
The reassessment makes sense .
Depending on how you measure inflation , real short - term interest rates are already around zero or negative .
And although America 's economy is still heading downhill , the Fed 's calculus about the benefits and risks of even cheaper money is shifting fast .
First , the odds of financial disaster have receded .
Although important parts of the credit plumbing , notably the interbank market , are still surprisingly gummed up ( see article ) , spreads on riskier bonds have narrowed .
Steep rate cuts were partly meant as a ( blunt ) tool to forestall financial calamity .
More of that insurance now seems unnecessary .
Second , America 's economy is not deteriorating any faster than the central bankers had expected .
According to the minutes of the Fed 's last meeting , its staff and several governors believed output would contract in the first half of 2008 .
The latest statistics do not show an economy in freefall .
Industrial production rebounded in March after plunging in February .
The pace of existing home sales fell slightly in March , but was stable over the first quarter as a whole .
Thanks to the rate cuts so far , there is a lot of monetary stimulus in the pipeline .
And the economy is about to get a fiscal boost , as millions of Americans receive their tax - rebate cheques in the next few weeks .
Economists disagree on how much of this money cash - strapped and debt - laden consumers will spend , but it will doubtless provide some benefit .
If the case for more rate cuts is weakening , the risks of cutting further are becoming ever clearer .
Commodity prices continue to soar while the dollar plumbs new depths .
The oil price hit a new record of almost $ 120 a barrel on April 22nd .
The same day the dollar fell to a new low of $ 1.60 against the euro after members of the European Central Bank 's rate - setting council expressed concern that inflation in the euro zone might not fall sufficiently fast from its 16 - year high of 3.6 % .
America 's central bankers , too , are becoming more worried about inflation , Two members of the Fed 's rate - cutting committee , Richard Fisher of the Dallas Fed and Charles Plosser of the Philadelphia Fed , who voted against a big rate cut at the last meeting on March 18th , were already worrying that inflationary expectations could become “ unhinged ” .
Lately even some doves , such as Janet Yellen of the San Francisco Fed , have sounded concerned .
For the moment , America 's price picture is murky .
“ Core ” measures of inflation — which exclude food and fuel and which Fed officials tend to prefer — have improved of late , largely because rents are no longer rising as fast as before .
And some market measures of inflationary expectations , such as the gap between inflation - indexed Treasury bonds and others , have fallen in recent weeks .
But headline inflation remains high — at 4 % in the year to March .
And price pressures are building at the wholesale level .
Producer prices rose at an annual rate of 9 % in the first quarter of the year , while prices of intermediate goods were up by 15 % .
If the dollar weakens further and commodity prices continue to soar , that pressure will rise .
The central bankers ' balance of risks is clearly shifting .
Today , there are several major clouds : Google , Yahoo , Microsoft , Amazon and smaller players IBM and Sun .
Can there be more ?
Sure , but it would require a business model that could not only pay for it , but could rip it out every few years and modernize it .
Google 's $ 20 billion Web advertising business gives it the cash flow to do so .
Advantage Google .
Not only has n't the Internet yet matured , it 's becoming an ever - more high stakes game
There , search results can be calculated , companies ' payrolls processed , even the complex graphics for video games can be drawn .
But it 's not cheap .
These clouds are multibillion - dollar investments .
Google spent $ 842 million in the last three months on servers , data centers and fiber optics .
- The Cloud .
The desktop computer is n't going away .
But as bandwidth speeds increase , more and more computing can be done in the network of computers sitting in data centers – aka the " cloud . "
With the Microsoft / Yahoo deal breakdown , everyone assumes Google walks away with the prize .
Not so fast .
This contest is just starting .
For Microsoft or Google or anyone else to win , they need four key elements of an end - to - end strategy :
Ca n't Microsoft build something on its own ?
Why the rush to pay billions for Yahoo ?
The simple ( and wrong ) answer was that adding Yahoo's 20 %
Web search market share to Microsoft 's 10 % meant that it could compete against Google 's 60 % share .
Technology changes too fast for that to make sense except on paper .
Programs run anywhere these days – on your desktop computer , on servers in data centers , on your iPod , cellphone , GPS , video game console , digital camera and on and on .
It 's not just about beating Google at search , it 's about tying all these devices together in a new end - to - end computing framework .
Microsoft was smart to walk away ( for now ) from its $ 44 billion bid for Yahoo .
It 's never good to overpay .
But the software giant – whose stock has flatlined for eight years – was onto the right strategy in looking to the Web for growth .
- The Edge .
The cloud is nothing without devices , browsers and users to feed it .
Book buyers are basically paying for Amazon 's data centers .
Yahoo is a favorite for finance and sports enthusiasts , who pay for its data centers .
Google worked its way into the toolbars of Firefox , and even Microsoft 's browser .
And Microsoft ?
It was stripped of its ability to control Windows desktop real estate during the late '90s Netscape feud .
Accused of using its overwhelmingly popular Windows operating system to unfairly dominate other new markets , Microsoft settled the dispute with the Justice Department in 2001 .
Now Microsoft scrambles for other advantages .
One lies in smart mobile devices , which is the fastest - growing location to launch search requests .
Microsoft software runs on about 20 % of smart phones in the U.S .
Do n't underestimate the value of Microsoft 's other market stronghold , its X - Box video game platform .
Now you know why Google is scrambling to plant a flag in the cellphone business with its Android technology and bids for wireless spectrum .
So far , advantage Microsoft .
- Speed .
Once you build the cloud , it 's all about network operations .
Whoever can deliver search results faster , wins .
Users only realize this subconsciously , but it 's true : Google 's dominant share is as much about speed as it is for relevant results .
Compare it to Microsoft or Yahoo and you 'll see .
Google built data centers next to waterfalls so electricity could be cheap enough to help it win the speed war .
New cloud applications appear every day – backing up files , managing your money , editing photos , running the back end of multiplayer games like World of Warcraft .
Now corporate America is evaluating moving its accounting , scheduling , order management and the like into the cloud , and speed will be a top priority .
Advantage Google .
- Platform .
Yahoo's mistake was relying on expensive workers to update Web pages and sell ads , and especially to run Yahoo Finance , Sports , HotJobs and Travel .
Google hates using people for these tasks .
The company may love programmers and probably customers as well , but it tries to put absolutely no one in between them .
Google 's genius was to automate all its
Web page creation and to have a market set prices for ads .
But even though Google has more than 10,000 employees , the company does n't have a lock on brain power – especially since its stock is not climbing as fast as it once did , and with young coders setting their eyes on the next big startup .
Having a fast cloud is nothing if you keep it closed .
The trick is to open it up as a platform for every new business idea to run on , charging appropriate fees as necessary .
Microsoft knows this .
I sat through a keynote speech by Bill Gates maybe 15 years ago .
Asked why Microsoft makes all the money in the software business , he snapped :
We do n't make all the money .
Actually , we only make money because we are a platform for others to use our software to make money themselves .
Only by opening up system internals to thousands of hungry developers can anyone truly create an operating system in the cloud .
Google has made open announcements but is still quite closed .
Advantage Microsoft .
So with the failure of the Yahoo bid , where does that leave Microsoft ?
The answer is found in Microsoft 's mantra : embrace , extend and innovate .
Made famous in a 1994 Microsoft executive memo , this mantra has worked again and again : Windows dominated Apple for decades , the Excel spreadsheet bypassed Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 , and the Internet Explorer browser destroyed Netscape .
Of course , Microsoft could come back and bid again for Yahoo at $ 25 .
But there is a go - it - alone strategy : Embrace the Web search and advertising business .
Maybe even do what Craigslist did to newspaper want ads , devaluing search advertising by offering the same thing for free , or really cheap .
The trick is to then extend and innovate .
Run code that figures out what users are looking for , not just on servers , but on X - Boxes , Zune music devices and even Apple iPhones .
Some of the new markets are n't even twinkles in developers ' eyes .
At the moment , neither Google nor Microsoft , or anyone else , has nailed down cloud , edge , speed and platform .
All the loosely coupled electronic devices in our pockets need to work together seamlessly with Facebook applications in the cloud .
Who will do it ?
Unclear .
The continuing battle between Microsoft and Google will mean fierce competition – adding features , building data centers , cutting deals and spending money on speed and customer convenience .
That 's the way to move technology forward .
It 's great to see Microsoft with some fight left in it .
Not only has n't the Internet yet matured , it 's becoming an ever - more high stakes game .

Humans are pouring large quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year , which is changing the climate and the chemistry of the oceans .
Finding a better place to put all that carbon is a topic of great importance .
Although there is some debate over the efficacy of various carbon offset schemes , even motorsports are looking into carbon sequestration .
A recent article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science looks at the viability of storing all of that carbon in the ocean floor .
Most of the ocean floor is made up of basalt , an igneous rock that formed from lava extruded at mid-ocean ridges .
This basalt is overlain by a relatively thin layer of extremely fine sediment ; it forms an excellent reservoir for CO 2 for a variety of reasons .
To store significant amounts of CO 2 , you need two things : storage space , and a way to keep the CO 2 from escaping .
When lava is extruded directly into the ocean , it cools very rapidly , cracking in the process .
This creates lots of empty space within the newly formed rock for storage of CO 2 .
The ocean floor also has the CO 2 trapping problem solved .
The basalt , in combination with the sediments on top , provide three mechanisms to trap the CO 2 : a physical barrier , gravitational containment , and chemical conversion into carbonates .
First , the physical barrier is provided by the fine sediments on the top of the ocean floor .
These sediments have extremely low permeability , and thus prevent the CO 2 from escaping .
Second , gravity will trap CO 2 at water depths greater than 2700 m as , at this depth , the injected CO 2 will be denser than sea water .
Finally , CO 2 can combine with calcium and magnesium ions released by the basalt to form carbonate minerals , which are insoluble .
Basalts like this could store carbon at greater depths
The authors estimate that there is around 780 k m3 of available space to store CO 2 off the coast of northern California and Oregon .
This works out to the ability to store 200 - 250 Gt of carbon .
Considering that the entire US releases around 1.7Gt of carbon per year , that would provide over 100 years of carbon storage .
The authors propose extensive drilling experiments to better characterize this potential reservoir .
For example , it not known just how permeable the basalt is , or how rapidly the CO 2 will be converted to carbonates .
If pilot experiments are successful , maybe the environmentalists will be clamoring for their own style of offshore drilling .

Which One Will YOU Be In the Year 1984 ?
There wo n't be much choice , of course , if this book 's predictions turn out to be true .
But you 'll probably become one of the following four types :
Proletarian -- Considered inferior and kept in total ignorance , you 'll be fed lies from the Ministry of Truth , eliminated upon signs of promse of ability !
Police Guard -- Chosen for lack of intelligence but superior brawn , you 'll be suspicious of everyone and be ready to give your life for Big Brother , the leader you 've never even seen !
Party Member : Male -- Face - less , mind - less , a flesh - and - blood robot with a push - button brain , you 're denied love by law , taught hate by the flick of a switch !
Party Member : Female -- A member of the Anti-Sex League from birth , your duty will be to smother all human emotion , and your children might not be your husband's !
Unbelievable ?
You 'll feel differently after you 've read this best - selling book of forbidden love and terror in a world many of us may live to see !
Back in May , Colleen Mondor put out a modest proposal for bloggers to write about their favorite political books ( fiction or non -) during the month of August .
( I previously noted this here . )
I will happily be bloviating about George Orwell 's 1984 , as it happens to be one of my all - time favorite books ( and a huge influence on my own fiction , and very specifically on my n*vel - in - progress ) .
In the run-up to that post , when I have time , I 've been poking about teh internets for inspiration .
And quite by accident , the other day , I discovered the following front and back book covers foron Amazon , posted by David Rolfe of Pasadena , CA : They are from the 1954 Signet ( # S798 ) paperback edition , and are quite unlike the covers for any other editions that I 've seen for Orwell 's most well - known novel , which tend toward minimalism , with the numerical title almost always taking up the majority of the space .
Part of me loves the lurid pulpish nature of these covers , and I 'd love to see a modern revisioning of them , along the lines of what Night Shade and Jon Foster recently did for Jon Courtenay Grimwood 's 9Tail Fox ( although I still love the groovy new Penguin covers by Shepard Fairey ) .
( Wow , I said " love , " like , three times in the last sentence . ) ( David Rolfe , who originally posted the covers ( thanks , David ! ) writes : " Note the button on the girl 's shirt : ' AntiSex League . '
But does she practice what she preaches ? "
Indeed . )
In case you can't read the over - the - top text on the back cover ( which manages to not mention Winston Smith , Julia , O'Brien , Room 101 , Ingsoc , or Oceania ) , here 's what it says : England Prevails . :
Holy shit !
This entry got Boing - Boinged : Holy shit !
This entry also got Boortzed !
( Thanks ,
Ben ! ) :
Holy shit !
This entry also got Reddited !
( Thanks , anonymous stranger ! ) :
Due to the massive attention this entry has received , I am turning off anonymous commenting .
Too many people showing up without identifying themselves , and though it has for the most part been civil and on the topic , there have been a few trolls who have committed insults and ad - hominem attacks , for absolutely no reason ; these comments were deleted and IP addresses logged .
So , if you would like to comment , you 'll need a LJ account ( they 're free , after all ) , but those who continue to display acts of dickery will be banned .
This is my house , and I do n't take that kind of shit from anyone .
A quick snippet that I spotted within the up - and - coming Johnson project ( A Ruby / Spidermonkey hybridization . ) :
( function ( ) { this .__defineGetter__(" __FILE__ " , function ( ) { return ( new Error ) .stack.split ( "
" ) [ 2 ] .split ( " @ " ) [ 1] .split ( " : " ) .slice ( 0, -1 ) .join ( " : " ) ; } ) ; } ) ( ) ;
The above defines a global variable __FILE__ which , when called , returns the file name of the current JavaScript file .
It ’s defined using a getter in particular so that the proper file name will be determined no matter what file it ’s called in ( so you can safely include the above in a library file and it ’ll still report the correct , current , filename ) .
Currently the above will only work in Spidermonkey as only it supports the . stack stacktrace Error property .
If there are reasonable alternatives for WebKit or Opera ( which also support __defineGetter__ ) let me know .

Limbaugh : I want to know .
I look at Iowa , I look at Illinois --- I want to see the murders .
I want to see the looting .
I want to see all the stuff that happened in New Orleans .
I see devastation in Iowa and Illinois that dwarfs what happened in New Orleans .
I see people working together .
I see people trying to save their property ... I do n't see a bunch of people running around waving guns at helicopters , I do n't see a bunch of people running shooting cops .
I do n't see a bunch of people raping people on the street .
I do n't see a bunch of people doing everything they can ... whining and moaning --- where 's FEMA , where 's BUSH .
I see the heartland of America .
When I look at Iowa and when I look at Illinois , I see the backbone of America .
Thanks to a C&Ler that emailed me much of this post .
Limbaugh is an arrogant ideologue that loves Howard Kurtz and hates the black victims of NOLA .
Do n't you understand , it was all their fault for not escaping Hurricane Katrina !
Wake , up !
You drive by media fools .
They were lazy , lazy people that deserved their fate .
If only they were white and responsible .
Just listen to this horrific rant as Limbaugh is all ' agush ' with admiration over the way in which Iowa and the Midwest has responded to the flood disaster that befell the area last week .
But to just congratulate the residents in their determination and courage in fighting the disaster is n't enough for the AM talk blow hard .
Limbaugh could not pass up the opportunity to once again trot out his old , well known disdain for poor blacks in the south who were victims of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
To hear Limbaugh describe it , Iowa is more American , more honorable ... you know ... more white than Louisiana .

( The audio will work in just a few minutes )
It would seem that the images of floating bodies , and documented stories of elderly New Orleans residents drowning in their attics is cold hard facts surrounding humans that Rush Limbaugh thinks could have benefited by just pulling themselves up by their bootstraps a little more .
Nevermind that more than 1700 human beings lost their lives on live television as America watched in horror .
You do n't hear progressives saying that Iowa is any less devastating because the death toll in those floods was a total of 5 .
It is still a tragedy .
And progressives understand that full well .
But according to Rush the story of Iowa under water is n't a story about humans over coming adversity .
It 's a story about how much more patriotic the white bread basket is than the lazy south .
It did n't seem possible that politicians could think up a sillier energy proposal than Barack Obama 's windfall profits tax on oil companies , but Republican Sen. John Warner of Virginia has done just that .
Earlier this month , Mr. Warner suggested a return to the federal 55 - mile - per - hour speed limit on America 's highways , as a way to save on national gasoline consumption .
" I drive over 55 miles an hour , . . . sometimes 65 , " he said on the Senate floor .
" But I am willing to give up whatever advantage to me to drive at those speeds ...
I 've decided it 's time to stake my claim to the law that will ever be remembered and linked with my name .
If Moore can get a law named after him , or even Murphy , then so can I .
SIGFPE 's Law
This law is the prediction that the rate of growth of the number of bits on the best available quantum computers is going to grow linearly with time .
My reason for saying this is essentially the same as the reason that many people are sceptical of quantum computers - decoherence .
It seems obvious to me that even with the cleverest of error correction schemes we 're going to see the coherence of states decay exponentially fast .
I 'm bored of reading papers on quantum error correction and seeing that every one makes some assumption or other about the Hamiltonian that is not going to hold in practice .
And any little deviation from that assumption becomes the coefficient in an exponential describing that decay .
On the other hand people are ingenious .
As time goes by people will find ever more ingenious ways to fix the errors caused by decoherence .
But the difficulty is going to grow exponentially and the solutions wo n't scale .
So just as classical computing has seen an exponential growth in power I expect to see the logarithm of this and hence a linear growth .
Maybe , just maybe , there 'll be polynomial growth .
But definitely not exponential growth .
In fact , I expect it to be linear with a pretty shallow gradient , just a couple of qubits a year at most , and probably less .
Humans will , one day in the distant future , crack large RSA keys using quantum computers - but when that day is reached humans will be well beyond caring about such trivial matters .
I also have nothing to lose by saying this .
If I turn out to be wrong , and I sincerely hope I am , I can look forward to a world full of wonderful computing machines whose interest value will far outweigh the ignominy of being forever linked with an incorrect law .
BTW
When I say n-bit quantum computer I mean a computer whose total memory is n qubits , not a computer with the qubits addressable by an n-bit word .

CherryPal has released some tantalizing details of its forthcoming desktop box , which they claim will draw only two watts and be " the greenest and most affordable on the market . "
The otherwise modestly spec'd box has a few secret weapons : cloud computing and a tri-core Freescale processor with hardware video rendering capabilities .
Advertisement
The teensy device is pretty well stripped down , with a 400MHz processor , 256MB of RAM and 4GB of flash memory .
Aside from a few standard ports and integrated Wi - Fi , that 's about all you get .
CherryPal claims that the heavily optimized Debian Linux distro and multi-core capabilities will not only keep that PC from dragging too much ass , but will let it handle moderate multimedia work as well .
CherryPal has n't presented much in the way of supporting evidence for its claims , or mentioned whose " cloud " the box will connect to but with a release date set at August 4th , we 'll probably be finding out more info pretty soon .
Full specs are below , but no price yet .

As Eric Bakovic described here last year , Facebook uses they as a singular pronoun when the gender of the user is not known , leading to news feed items like : " Pat Jones added Prince to their favorite music . "
That 's never been the most elegant use of singular they , since readers of these items tend to know the gender of Pat Jones , even if s/he has n't told Facebook about it .
Even more awkwardly , Facebook also uses themself when a reflexive pronoun is needed , as in : " Pat Jones has tagged themself in a photo . "
Well , now after some cross-linguistic difficulties , Facebook is trying to stamp out singular they by being more demanding about gender specification .
Reuters reports that pronoun trouble arose after Facebook moved beyond English and added 15 new languages in recent months .
Singular they / their / themself might be inelegant or even ungrammatical in English , depending on your point of view , but it 's downright impossible in languages where gender marking on singular pronouns is obligatory .
As Facebook product manager Naomi Gleit explained on the company blog : " We 've gotten feedback from translators and users in other countries that translations wind up being too confusing when people have not specified a sex on their profiles . "
Confronting complaints of ungrammaticality from speakers of English and untranslatability from speakers of other languages , Facebook will now be more in - your - face about choosing a gender identity .
If you have n't filled the information out on your Facebook profile , you 'll now get a prompt asking if you want to be referred to as him or her .
But they 're not getting too insistent on sexual dimorphism , since users can still opt out of the gender choice , in response to what Gleit calls " pushback in the past from groups that find the male / female distinction too limiting . "
Stay tuned for further developments from the online front of the grammar - and - gender wars .

Advertisement Footage from a video camera handed out by an Israeli human rights group appears to show Jewish settlers beating up Palestinians in the West Bank .
An elderly shepherd , his wife and a nephew said they were attacked by four masked men for allowing their animals to graze near the settlement of Susia .
The rights group , B'Tselem , said the cameras were provided to enable Palestinians to get proof of attacks .
A spokesman for the Israeli police said that an investigation was under way .
So far , no - one has been arrested .
Baseball bats
For the past year , B'Tselem has handed out video cameras to Palestinians as part of its " Shooting Back " project .
The Palestinians said they were attacked after refusing to move
The BBC has been given exclusive access to the footage of this particular attack , which happened earlier this week .
The date and time on the camera footage shows that it is Sunday afternoon .
Over the brow of the hill walk four masked men holding baseball bats .
To the right of the screen , in the foreground , stands a 58 - year - old Palestinian woman .
Thamam al - Nawaja has been herding her goats close to the Jewish settlement of Susia , near Hebron in the southern West Bank .
Within a few seconds , she , along with her 70 - year - old husband and one of her nephews , will be beaten up .
As the first blows land , the woman filming - the daughter - in - law of the elderly couple - drops the camera and runs for help .
' Ten - minute warning '
Mrs Nawaja spent three days in hospital after the attack .
Returning to the small Palestinian encampment close to the red-roofed houses of Susia , she stepped slowly and unsteadily out of the minibus .
They do n't want us to stay on our land , but we wo n't leave - we 'll die here
Thamam al - Nawaja A dark stain showed through the white gauze covering her broken right arm .
Her veil was lifted gingerly away from her lined face .
A bloodshot eye and intersection of scars revealed a fractured left cheek .
" The settlers gave us a 10 - minute warning to clear off from the land , " she told me , her voice a tired , cracked whisper .
She and her husband had stood their ground .
It is at this point that her voice grows louder .
" They do n't want us to stay on our land .
But we wo n't leave .
We 'll die here .
It 's ours , " she added .
Indeed , the rest of the world regards Jewish settlements in the West Bank such as Susia , as illegal , built on occupied territory .
Those settlements have been a large part of the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis for the last 41 years .
The daily confrontation is not often caught on camera .
That , now , is beginning to change .
Video proof
The attack near Susia was filmed with one of 100 video cameras that B'Tselem has handed out to Palestinians in the region .
When they have the camera , they have proof that something happened - they now have something they can work with , to use as a weapon
Oren Yakobovich
B'Tselem
The thinking behind the project is that when trouble flares , rather than just giving a statement to the Israeli police or army , video carries much more weight .
" The difference is amazing , " says Oren Yakobovich , who leads the Shooting Back project .
" When they have the camera , they have proof that something happened .
They now have something they can work with , to use as a weapon . "
We asked a spokesman from the Susia settlement for a comment on Sunday 's incident .
He declined .
Inside one of the tents belonging to the Palestinians living near Susia , we watched the footage of the aftermath of the attack - the victims slumped by the roadside , bloodied , waiting for an ambulance .
The bright , wide eyes of the children shone with the light of the small television screen .
Violence against Jews as well as Palestinians has long scarred this place .
Video may now may be giving us a new and raw view .
But for most people here , the only answer - a political deal - remains out of sight .

What are these ?
Palestinians say settlements cut the West Bank from East Jerusalem
Israel annexed the area in 1967 and has continued settlement activity despite a recent freeze on settlements on other occupied territory in the West Bank .
The international community regards such building as illegal .
Palestinians want East Jerusalem as their capital .
Mr Boim said building continued within all Jerusalem 's municipal boundaries .
He added that what had been portrayed as delays in construction in East Jerusalem " are in fact final stages of coordination " with the municipal authorities .
Israel announced two months ago that it would build 350 new flats in the Har Homa settlement , a move that soured fresh efforts to reach an Israeli - Palestinian peace deal before the two sides had even met .
Mr Boim said there would be an additional 370 new residences in Har Homa , known as Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic , and that bids would be issued for 750 more in Pisgat Zeev .
" We condemn these Israeli declarations , and once again we ask the Israeli government to give peace a chance by stopping all settlement activity , " Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said .

As TPM Election Central first reported a week ago , Obama is on a purple Western state campaign swing this week , targeting New Mexico , Nevada , and Colorado .
TPM Reader BC makes an interesting point :
I think there ’s a bit more than meets the eye to Obama ’s swing through New Mexico , Colorado and Nevada this week .
Of course , he wants to start wooing swing states for the general election .
But I suspect he began with these three because he also wants to start shifting the media narrative about where he needs to win in November to capture a majority of electoral votes .
One of the subtle advantages Hillary has had in making her “ I do better in the swing states ” argument is that her potential path to electoral victory looks much more like the traditional Democratic map .
Above all it hinges on Ohio and Florida , which have been seared into traumatized Democrats ’ minds as ground zero for narrow defeats ( or stolen victories ) .
The press , always eager for a simple , dramatic narrative , has happily indulged Clinton ’s emphasis on these states , and will likely continue to do so when the focus shifts to Obama vs. McCain .
Obama ’s challenge is that he has an equally legitimate path to victory , but it runs through states that neither the media nor the Democratic base readily conceive of as pivotal .
Together , New Mexico , Colorado and Nevada offer 19 electoral votes — only one less than Ohio .
Add in Iowa , where Obama also shows unusual strength , and you get up to 26 — one less than Florida .
Obama can afford to lose one of those “ traditional ” swing states if he makes it up in these states where he seems to have unique appeal .
But if the campaign press corps decides to go spend the next six months camped out in Ohio and Florida filing hand - wringing stories about his struggles with “ white working class ” voters or elderly Jews , he never gets to make that case , the narrative about his campaign ’s chances will be much more dour , and some of that pessimism may sink in with the electorate .
Campaign tours like this one — not to mention last Tuesday ’s primary night victory speech in Iowa — are a subtle way to start putting these “ Obama swing states ” on reporters ’ radar screens and prime them to tell a different electoral story .
If BC is right , then the Obama camp is aiming its meta - message at people like me .
I look at the Obama electoral map and just scratch my head .
Can a Dem really win the White House while losing Pennsylvania , Missouri and Florida ?
Or winning only one of Ohio , Florida , and Pennsylvania ?
As SurveyUSA found in a state - by - state electoral college breakdown back in March , Obama could pull it off , at least in theory .
But it ’s not a tried and true path to the Presidency for a Democrat .
That does n’t mean it ca n’t happen .
But it is a high stakes gamble , the kind that looks brilliant if it works and , well , probably pretty idiotic if it does n’t .
Not that Bill or Hillary would ever say I told you so .
Late Update : Dissent , from readers .
TPM Reader JE :
You badly misrepresent the Obama electoral map strategy .
He ’s not visiting western purple states and ignoring Ohio , Pennsylvania , and Florida .
Before this western state trip he went to Florida and had what , by all accounts , was a enormously successful set of events , impressing several audiences he supposedly will have trouble impressing .
Obama is n’t gambling anything , and he will run hard in Florida and Pennsylvania and Ohio .
But he will not cede a number of other states that Democratic candidates have n’t taken seriously in recent elections .
His strategy is to increase the number of states that can reasonably be called competitive .
By labeling this a “ gamble , ” you miss the bigger point and play right into a silly MSM talking point .
TPM Reader SR :
David , I do n’t know why you ’re “ scratching your head . ”
The simple fact is that what you ’re calling “ the tried and true path to the presidency for a Democrat ” has never actually worked !
Ever !
Carter won in 76 by carrying the South .
Johnson won in 64 by carrying everywhere .
Kennedy ?
Well take at look at his map , it ’s like some alternate universe .
http://www.presidentelect.org/e1960.html
“ The only time your “ tried and true ” path more or less worked was in ’ 92 and ’ 96 and , in both case , it only worked because of Ross Perot , the most successful third party candidate in history .
Both times ,
Bill failed to win an electoral majority in many of the key states on the “ tried and true path ” by a wide margin .
Obama ’s electoral map is not about brilliant or stupid .
Its about how doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result is the definition of stupidity , not insanity .
( The definition of insanity is making up your own facts , or your own math , and insisting they ’re as good as anyone else ’s facts / math . )
Likewise , TPM Reader CN :
Stopbadware.org has released its May , 2008 report ( PDF ) on badware hosting and the geographical locations from which badware originates .
The organization drew its data from Google 's " Safe Browsing " initiative , which maintains a database of websites that attempt to phish personal information from users who visit .
As of May , Google had recorded some 213,575 individual websites , which StopBadware then mapped to IP addresses .
This data was then cross-referenced to determine the IP block 's country of origin .
One potential flaw in StopBadware 's analysis , however , is that it makes no attempt to differentiate between sites that have been infected by malware and those sites deliberately distributing it .
This makes a certain amount of sense — most antivirus software focuses on stopping attacks , not identifying their purpose — but it would 've been useful to see what percentage of the websites identified as hosting badware were active distributors .
Such information could be directly useful to anyone attempting to attack or block the source of such material .
StopBadware acknowledges further limitations in its own report — Google identifies sites based on common malware traits , and the list of sites itself is limited to sites Google has scanned , and is thus unlikely to be truly comprehensive .
Even given these limitations , Stopbadware.org 's study reveals that the data rather decisively points in one direction — East .
Stopbadware went a step further , and took a shot at calculating the number of badware sites per million Internet users .
The data set , in this case , is from 2006 , but the numbers should still point us in the right direction .
Once again , China tops the list with 689 badware sites per million .
Russia and the US are number two and number three , but follow at a distance .
Combined , the two countries would have a ratio of 519 per million users — still 25 percent less than China .
Badspyware further notes that China owns six of the top 10 network blocks used for hosting badware , including the top four infected blocks as detected by the survey .
StopBadware attempted to contact the ISPs who own the network blocks in question , but did not receive replies .
StopBadware makes no attempt to determine why China ranks as poorly as it does , but notes that there may be insufficient economic incentives to encourage the Chinese ISPs to clean up their acts ( and networks ) .
It 's possible for a network to shift position on the organization 's list in just one year .
After iPowerWeb was identified last year as the owner of the most - infected network block , the company worked closely with both Google and StopBadware to improve the situation .
As a result , it 's no longer listed among even the top 250 infected networks .
Any improvement to the situation will have to come from both international dialog and internal economic policies that encourage ISPs to handle their own policing .
The Chinese government has spent enormous amounts of money preparing the country to host the 2008 Olympic Games — it may be time to encourage the nation to clean its digital streets as well .

Fin whales ( Balaenoptera physalus ) are officially an endangered species
Icelandic and Norwegian companies have begun exporting whalemeat to Japan .
About 60 tonnes of meat from fin whales caught in the 2006 Icelandic hunt was reportedly sent with a much smaller amount of minke meat from Norway .
Industry sources told the BBC that the meat had already arrived in Japan , although a Japanese official said no request to import it had been received .
Conservation groups say the trade will damage attempts to bridge the gap between pro- and anti-whaling nations .
Iceland and Norway keep saying they need to hunt because there 's a demand in their own countries , but the trade shows it 's not true
Dr Sue Lieberman , WWF
The fin whale is listed as Endangered on the internationally recognised Red List of Threatened Species .
But Iceland maintains populations are high enough in the North Atlantic that a small annual kill , such as the seven caught in 2006 , is sustainable .
This is Iceland 's first whalemeat export to Japan in nearly 20 years .
Mutual benefit Commercial whaling has been banned globally under the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) since 1986 , but Iceland and Norway lodged formal objections to the ban and their governments issue commercial quotas unilaterally .
The global trade in whalemeat is also prohibited under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) , but again the three countries have exempted themselves by lodging formal " reservations " .
THE LEGALITIES OF WHALING Objection - A country formally objects to the IWC moratorium , declaring itself exempt .
Example : Norway Scientific - A nation issues unilateral ' scientific permits ' ; any IWC member can do this .
Example : Japan Aboriginal - IWC grants permits to indigenous groups for subsistence food .
Example : Alaskan Inupiat " This trade will be mutually beneficial for the three main whaling countries , " said Kristjan Loftsson , CEO of the Icelandic company Hvalur hf which catches fin whales .
" This trade is perfectly legal under the domestic legislation of the three countries as well as all relevant international law . "
Iceland 's Fisheries Ministry said it was not an issue that concerned the government .
" It 's been clear since 2006 that our position was that those who were engaged in [ the hunt ] could export the products , " said Stefan Asmundsson , a senior official in the ministry and Iceland 's commissioner to the IWC .
" Then it 's up to them to do that ; and as far as I know they have shipped some product to Japan , " he told BBC News .
An official in Norway 's Directorate of Nature Management confirmed that his government had issued export permits for minke meat totalling 5.3 tonnes to two companies .
A spokesman for one of the companies , Myklebust Trading , said the consignment - sent by air - had reached Japan .
However , an official in Japan 's Fisheries Agency told BBC
News that no request for permission to import the meat had been lodged with the government - and such a request was needed , he said .
Domestic issue ?
Sue Lieberman , director of the global species programme at the conservation charity WWF , agreed that the trade was legal , but said it went against the principles of these international treaties .
" It undermines the effectiveness of CITES if countries are trading under their reservations , and it also undermines the IWC , " she said .
" There 's supposed to be a ban on commercial whaling ; and Iceland and Norway keep saying they need to hunt because there 's a demand in their own countries , but the trade shows it 's not true .
" [ The Icelandic hunters ] killed the fins just because they could get more money for fin than minke meat in Japan . "
Fin whale is the most sought after species in Japan 's markets
The fin whale meat has been in cold storage since the 2006 season , and Mr Loftsson acknowlededges there is no domestic market .
For the last year , IWC chairman William Hogarth has been trying to set in train a mechanism that could heal the damaging breach betwen pro- and anti-whaling countries within the commission .
Japan and some anti-whaling countries such as The Netherlands and New Zealand are actively engaged with the initiative , though there is still deep suspicion between opposing camps .
" What this decision means is that Iceland , or at least Loftsson , is trying to strangle the effort to find a compromise , " said Arni Finnsson from the Iceland Nature Conservation Association ( Inca ) .
Mr Finnsson argues , as do other environmentalists , that the continuation of whaling and the decision not to interfere in the whalemeat exports may damage Iceland 's economy - already reeling from the international banking crisis - and its candidacy for a seat on the UN Security Council .
Following last month 's decision to issue a minke quota for 2008 , foreign minister Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir said Iceland was sacrificing its long - term interests for short - term gain , while the UK was one of the nations criticising the decision .

What are these ?
It will likely come as quite a surprise to the English - speaking world that the number one language of bloggers worldwide , in terms of number of posts , is not the “ language of international communication ” , as English is typically regarded .
Nor , before the Chinese chime in , is it the language of the most populous state on the globe .
According to the 2006 fourth quarter results of the State of the Live Web report issued quarterly by Technorati , a blog search engine which at last count tracks over 70 million weblogs , in terms of blog posts by language , English and Chinese in fact rank second and third , at 36 % and 8 % , respectively .
Edging out English for first place this quarter was Japanese , with over one - third of all blog posts — 37 % — written in this language .
This is not , in fact , the first time that Japanese has been rated as the number one blogging language by Technorati ; back in November 2005 , in an earlier State of the Live Web report , Japanese was also took top place with 31 % , although the total was much more evenly split with English and Chinese at that time .
Judging by the reaction of bloggers themselves , it would seem that the Japanese are as surprised as anyone else at the results of the report .
At What a wonderful world , Japanese blogger sgt_fire_fox writes :
3位に中国語が入っていたのはちょっと驚きです。とは言っても、世界最大の人口を持つ国家の主要言語ですから3位に滑り込んできたのは当然の事かもしれません。逆に日本でのみ使われる言語である日本語が1位になった事が奇跡と言えるのでしょうか。
I was a bit surprised when I read that Chinese came in third place .
That said , it is the main language of the world 's most populous country , so it 's natural that it would slip in at third place .
On the other hand , the fact that Japanese , a language used exclusively in Japan , came in first place — you could call that a miracle .
The same blogger gave some concrete reasons for why Japanese people blog in such great numbers :
日本語がブログ投稿数で1位というのには、どのような要因があるのでしょうか？
考えられる要因としては ・ブログサービスを提供している企業の多種多様化
・携帯電話からの更新が多いため（携帯電話の普及率は71.8%）
・ブログの一般化（2005年から2007年でブログ利用者は2倍以上に増加）
こんなところでしょうか。まだまだ他にあるような気もしますが…。
What kind of causes are there for Japanese coming in first place in terms of number of blog entries ?
Here are a few conceivable causes :
There are a wide variety of companies offering blog services
Many people update their blogs via mobile phone ( 71.8 % of all people have mobile phones )
The increasingly widespread use of blogs ( the number of people using blogs doubled between 2005 and 2007 ) These kinds of things .
I have a feeling there are many others as well , but …
Blogger Yumeututu points to the influence of Japanese celebrities such as Manabe Kaori and to the variety of ways in which blogs are used in Japan :
英語圏の絶対人口数より日本語圏の方が少ないのは周知の通りですが、その日本語がブログ投稿数で世界一位というのは驚きです。確かに初代ブログ女王と呼ばれた眞鍋かをりさんが芸能界で一躍有名になって以来、各著名人はほとんど公式サイトやブログを持つことが一般的になった気がします。また、各プロバイダも無料でブログスペースを提供してくれるし、最近では携帯からでもお手軽に投稿が可能になったからでしょうか。それにしても使い方は様々でビジネスとしている人、コミュニケーションの手段としている人、備忘録にしている人といろいろですね。何はともあれ、無料で動画がアップロードと閲覧できる「YouTube」というサイトも日本人利用者が多いのが事実ですし、技術の輸入と利用が器用だなと感じました。
While it is well - known that the actual number of people in the Japanese - speaking group is much smaller than the actual number in the English - speaking group , I was surprised to find out that Japanese was ranked first in terms of number of blog submissions .
Certainly since the time that Manabe Kaori , who has been called the first Blog Queen , sprang to fame in the world of entertainment , I have the feeling that it has become the norm for nearly every public figure to have an official website or blog .
Perhaps it is also because every Internet service provider now offers free blog spaces , and recently it has also become possible to easily post blog entries by mobile phone .
Even so , there are a variety of people using blogs and they are using them for a variety of different purposes : some people for business , some people as a means of communication , and some people as a notepad .
At any rate , it is a fact that in Japan there are many people who use YouTube , a site which allows you to freely upload and view videos , and I think Japanese are good at importing and making good use of technology .
Many Japanese bloggers also connect the recent rise in popularity of blogs in Japan to the country 's historical roots as a “ writing society ” .
Commenting in response to a blog entry on the Technorati report , blogger Ichiro explains :
日本は文の国ですからねー。大昔から日記書いたり随筆書いたり唄を詠んだり。あまり自己プレゼンをしない代わりに、文章を介すくらいの距離感のコミュニケーションがちょうどいいのかもですね。
戦時中も兵士が日記書いてたり。 そもそもブログやる前は日記サイトやテキストサイトが大流行で、「『だから』ブログは流行らない」って言われてたし。その意味ではブログによって何かが変わったわけではないのかも。
It 's because Japan is the country of writing .
Since ancient times , Japanese have been writing diaries , writing essays , and writing poems .
Rather than presenting themselves , people prefer to communicate at a distance by using text .
During wartime , soldiers also kept diaries .
Originally , before the time of blogs , diary websites and text sites were very popular , so people say : “ maybe that 's why blogs have caught on ” .
In this sense , maybe blogs have not really changed anything .
Blogger Helio Tatibana also comments on the history of writing in Japan , and on Japan 's relation to the “ West ” .
日本人は、飛び抜けてブログ好きなのですね。シャイで、はっきり物を云うことが苦手な日本人は、書くことによって自己表現をしようとしているのでしょうか。これから類推できることは、ブロガーの数に至っては、世界の国の中で、日本が断然トップを走っていることです。
ブログという仕組みを作り上げたのはアメリカですが、利用者は日本人が最も多いのですから、なにやら、欧米を真似て、取り付かれたように熱中した一時期のボーリング、ゴルフ、スキーなどに似ています。
Japanese people are extraordinarily fond of blogs .
Since they are shy and not very good at saying things directly , they seem to use writing as a means of self - expression .
I am predicting that , in terms of the number of bloggers , Japan will race ahead of the rest of the world .
America was the country that invented the blog , but Japanese people are the most numerous bloggers , so I guess it 's like bowling , golf and ski , numerous times in the past — Japanese imitate Westerners and go crazy over these kinds of things .
Not all Japanese bloggers were entirely convinced of the result .
One blogger noted that many Japanese blogs are in fact dead and not being updated regularly :
このほったらかしで更新されなくなったデッドブログを「石ころ」と呼ぶそうですが、検索する方からするとこの石ころが邪魔です。
クリックしてページを見ると何年も更新されていないブログ。
経験ある方も多いでしょう。 Technoratiの調査では、日本語で書かれたブログが全ブログの37％を占め、英語ブログを追い抜いたそうで世界一。
その分、日本語ブログの石ころも毎日たくさん生産！？されているようです。
邪魔だと思いながらも自分のブログもまったく更新していない人も多いはず。
話題になると飛びつきスグに忘れる日本人気質！？からすると石ころはドンドン増えそう・・・。
Those dead blogs that are not updated and neglected are called “ pebbles ” ( ishikoro ) .
Many of these dead blogs get picked up by search engines and it's annoying .
You click on links and you find blogs that have not been updated in years .
I am sure a lot of people have experienced this .
According to the research by Technorati , 37 % of all blogs are written in Japanese , outdoing English blogs to become number one .
Seems like Japanese “ pebble ” blogs are being produced by just that much .
There must be a lot of people who are annoyed by them but they themselves do n't update their own blogs .
Judging from the tendency of the Japanese who quickly flock to new things and get bored soon , I have a feeling there are going to be more of these dead blogs …
Another Japanese blogger was also somewhat skeptical about the result :
3 位が中国語らしいですね。というかつい最近まで英語がブログの首位を占めていたわけですか。英語を使う国はアメリカ、イギリス、オーストラリアにカナダなどなど、かなりありますね。それらを抑えて
1 位になったということは、相当な数のブログが日本語で書かれているということですよね。単一国家が複数の大国に、ブログの発表数で勝っているわけですよ。まー、多分それくらいしか勝てるところってないんだと思いますけどね。近年のブログブームとか見ていると、そんな感じです。次は、ブログの内容で外国と勝負する番ですね。
Apparently Chinese came in third place .
Up until recently English occupied first place in blogs .
Countries in which English is used are America , England , Australia , Canada , etc. , there are many of them .
And yet , taking the lead over these languages , the language that came in first was Japanese , which means that a substantial number of blogs are written in Japanese .
A single country , in terms of number of blog entries , beat out many large countries .
Well , I think maybe that 's the only area in which we are able to win .
This is the feeling that I have when I look at recent boom in the number of blogs .
Next round , Japan should compete with foreign countries over the content of blogs .
Not too long ago , there was a small furor in the local media about a major disaster at The State 's Technology Services Division .
The details were a bit sketchy – mostly because The State was “ unable to comment on an ongoing investigation ” – but what was reported was that , for two full days , employees of The State were unable to logon to their computers or access email , and that this caused business within The State to grind to a halt .
As the “ investigation ” carried on , the media lost interest in the story and moved on to more newsworthy stories like who Paris Hilton was partying with last weekend .
Fortunately for us , a certain employee of The State named J.N. works in the Technology Services Division and decided to share what really was behind those fateful days .
When employees of The State came in to work following a three day weekend , they found their workstations overloaded with " cannot logon " and " Exchange communication " error messages .
The Network Services folks had it even worse : the server room was a sweltering 109° Fahrenheit and filled with dead or dying servers .
At first , everyone had assumed that the Primary A/C , the Secondary A/C , and the Tertiary A/C had all managed to fail at once .
But after cycling the power , the A / Cs all fired up and brought the room back to a cool 64° .
At the time , the “ why ” was n’t so important : the network administrators had to figure out how to bring online the four Exchange Services , six Domain Controllers , a few Sun servers , and the entire State Tax Commission ’s server farm .
Out of all of the downed servers , those were the only ones that did not come back to life upon a restart .
They worked day and night to order new equipment , build new servers , and restore everything from back - up .
Countless overtime hours and nearly two hundred thousand dollars in equipment costs later , they managed to bring everything back online .
When the Exchange servers were finally restored , the following email finally made its way to everyone 's inbox , conveniently answering the “ why ”
From : -----
-----------
To : IT Department Re : A/C constantly running .
To whom it may concern , I came in today ( Monday ) to finish up a project I was working on before our big meeting with the State -----
Commission tomorrow , and I noticed that there were three or four large air conditioners running the entire time I was here .
Since it 's a three day weekend , no one is around , why do we need to have the A/C running 24/7 ?
With all the power that all those big computers in that room use , I doubt it is really eco-friendly to run those big units at the same time .
And all computers have cooling fans anyway , so why put the A/C for the building in that room ?
I got a keycard from [ the facility manager ’s ] desk and shut off the A/C units .
I 'm sure you guys can deal with it being warm for an hour or two when you come in tomorrow morning .
In the future , let 's try to be a little more conscientious of our energy usage !
Thanks ,

Are Axe / Lynx Adverts the sexiest and Most Sexist television commercials ever ?
( In different parts of the world the brand is called either Lynx or Axe which makes writing a post such as this a bit awkward )
Chatting with some friends about their favorite ads , it seems the guys all agree that there is humor there , and a lot of appreciation for , uh , the female form .
The ladies though are anything but amused .
In particular there is the implication that just a whiff of the stuff will send women to lose all self control .
We wish !
What do you think ?
Here is a small selection of “ evidence ” for the prosecution …

EventMachine is a framework for network and concurrent programming , based on the Reactor design pattern .
The Reactor pattern describes a service handler that receives events and dispatches them to registered event handlers .
The benefits of the reactor pattern are a clear separation between the event dispatching and the application logic that handles the events , without complicating the code with multithreading .
EventMachine provides a high - level interface to network sockets and tries to hide the lower level operations .
EventMachine 's goals are :
Extremely high scalability , performance and stability for the most demanding production environments ; and
An API that eliminates the complexities of high - performance threaded network programming , allowing engineers to concentrate on their application logic .
Let 's take a look at a small example ; a simple chat server :
require ' eventmachine '
module Chat
# Called after the connection with a client has been established
def post_init
# Add ourselves to the list of clients
( @@connections ||= [ ] ) << self
send_data
" Please enter your name : "
end
# Called on new incoming data from the client
def receive_data data
# The first message from the user is its name
@name ||= data.strip
@@connections.each do |client|
# Send the message from the client to all other clients
client.send_data " # {@name} says : #{data} "
end
end
end
# Start a server on localhost , using port 8081 and hosting our Chat application
EventMachine ::run do
EventMachine :: start_server " localhost " , 8081 , Chat
end
We talked to Francis Cianfrocca , the main developer of EventMachine ( EM ) .
We asked him about his motivations to develop EventMachine :
I originally started the project because I wanted to write a high - performance message - oriented middleware that could be programmed easily in scripting languages , including Ruby .
At this point , there have been a great many projects written in EM , but the middleware project still has n't been done !
I was looking for a way to create an access - policy enforcement solution that would be extremely scalable , for global enterprises .
And I wanted a communications framework that would be extremely fast but also have proper security built into it .
EventMachine is used by Thin ( A fast and very simple Ruby web server ) , Swiftiply ( a clustering proxy server for web applications ) , Evented Mongrel ( Mongrel that has its network traffic handled by EventMachine ) , Sparrow ( lightweight queue [..] that speaks memcache ) and Juggernaut ( plugin for Ruby on Rails [ that lets ] the server initiate a connection and push data to the client ) .
Francis also wrote his own web framework :
Mine is called Unicycle , and it's intended for RESTful applications that must contact other applications in order to fulfill Web requests .
That also is based on EM , using EM 's built - in HTTP server .
Version 0.12 of EventMachine has recently been released :
There are some performance enhancements and minor features on 0.12 , but the primary motivation was to release a binary gem for Windows that had all the features we 've added since 0.8 .
The core of the EventMachine , the Reactor , has originally been implemented in C++ and has bindings for other languages besides Ruby .
There 's also a pure Ruby implementation , and one of the next versions will see the release of a Java implementation to be used with JRuby :
The most important new feature to be released soon will be full support for JRuby .
This required a complete re-implementation of the reactor core in Java , which actually went quite well .
Charles Nutter and his team have done a tremendous job on JRuby , and I think it has a lot of potential .
I 'm also very intrigued by Rubinius .
The interesting thing about Rubinius is its support for fibers , which enables a more natural programming style for EM .
I 've already experimented with it in Ruby 1.9 , but I 'm hesitant to fork the API until more people are using the newer platforms .
One of the key design goals for EM always has been maximum compatibility .
We asked Francis to elaborate on the advantages of EventMachine :
The key technical reason to use EM is because it enables a programming model that avoids threads .
Threaded programming is of course a very well - known model , especially for network servers , but it has some very deep problems .
There is a relatively small class of problems which are a good match for the threaded model .
Network servers happen to be one of them , because it 's usually possible to construct a non-overlapping working set for each request .
But of course it 's very difficult to get a threaded program 100 % correct if it has any shared state between threads , or if it relies on operations to be properly sequenced across threads .
And in Ruby , there 's the additional problem that threading is very expensive .
The other reason to use EM is that we support a wide range of network protocols out of the box .
The goal is to provide programmers with a large set of mature , high - performance tools that are easy to drop into their applications .
This is what makes EM different from the many projects that are simply trying to implement the reactor model .
We also spoke of event driven programming , and why it is easier to work with , compared to a threaded model :
A lot has been written about the fact that event - driven programs are not theoretically any faster than threaded ones , and that is true .
But in practice , I think the event - driven model is easier to work with , if you want to get to extremely high scalability and performance while still ensuring maximum robustness .
I write programs that have to run for months or years without crashing , leaking memory , or exhibiting any kind of lumpy performance , so in practice , event - driven programming works better .
Now , here 's the problem with event - driven programming : you have to write " backwards . "
A threaded model stores your program state ( inefficiently ) in local variables on a runtime stack .
In EM you have to do that yourself , which is very unintuitive to programmers who are used to threads .
This is why I 'm interested in fibers , because it opens the possibility of writing what looks to the programmer like blocking I/O , but still is evented and uses no threads .
Let 's take a closer look at this , using an HTTP server as an example :
Think of an HTTP server .
With threads , you simply read the socket and block until all the data has been retrieved from the remote peer .
With events , you get the data as soon as it appears , with no waiting and no scheduling overhead —
But it may not be complete !
Your program has to detect that it has n't yet received enough data to interpret the request , and it needs to store the partial data .
But the next event that your program handles will possibly contain data for a different connection , so you have to keep all of this straight .
The threading abstraction is a very heavyweight way of keeping those working sets separate , so it makes the programming task arguably more intuitive .
But the evented model is not really so hard to learn .
Nevertheless , I think this is the biggest barrier to wider use of event - driven programming .
Luckily , this is where EventMachine comes into play :
Now one of the things that EM does is to wrap up the standard protocols so that all of this is largely hidden from the programmer .
Unlike low - level libraries like libev , which provide only a reactor core , EM seeks to provide robust implementations for all the standard network protocols , for example , email .
EM includes a well - written handler for both the client and server side of SMTP .
So an EM programmer only has to write code to handle events associated with complete email messages .
There 's no need to touch the underlying protocol .
But still you have all the other benefits of the evented model ( high speed , high scalability ) .
You can find more about EventMachine on the official Rubyforge website and on rubyeventmachine .com :
We recently opened up the community site rubyeventmachine .com which is a Trac implementation done by Jason Roelofs .
And there is also an EventMachine IRC channel .
Plenty of people , including Kirk Haines , James Tucker ( raggi ) and Aman Gupta ( tmm1 ) have contributed a lot to EM .
Also the people who do thin , Marc - André Cournoyer , have contributed a lot of ideas .
以前笹田さんに、procのソースが見たいとお願いしてみたことがあったのですが、 それをRubyコードレベルで実現するライブラリを見つけたので紹介します。
proc_sourc e.rb
I wrote this a while ago and it works by extracting a proc 's origin file name and line number from its .inspect string and using the source code ( which usually does not have to be read from disc ) -- it works with procs generated in IRB , eval ( ) calls and regular files .
It does not work from ruby -e and stuff like " foo " .
instance_ eval " lambda {} " . source probably does n't work either .
オリジナルはメールの添付ファイルとしてくっついているので、ソースを見たい場合は
こちらから見るといいかもしれません。
使い方はこんな感じです、
1 code = proc{puts " Hello World " } 2 puts code .

Barack Obama said of today ’s Supreme Court ruling that the detainees at GITMO have the right to challenge their detention in civilian court , “ The Court ’s decision is a rejection of the Bush Administration ’s attempt to create a legal black hole at Guantanamo – yet another failed policy supported by John McCain . ”
He called the decision an important step towards regaining our credibility as a nation committed to the rule of law , “ This is an important step toward reestablishing our credibility as a nation committed to the rule of law , and rejecting a false choice between fighting terrorism and respecting habeas corpus .
Our courts have employed habeas corpus with rigor and fairness for more than two centuries , and we must continue to do so as we defend the freedom that violent extremists seek to destroy . ”
Obama also pointed out that under the Bush administration ’s system , no one has been convicted of terrorism since 9/11 , “ The fact is , this Administration ’s position is not tough on terrorism , and it undermines the very values that we are fighting to defend .
Bringing these detainees to justice is too important for us to rely on a flawed system that has failed to convict anyone of a terrorist act since the 9 - 11 attacks , and compromised our core values . ”

The system that the Bush administration put into place goes against everything this nation was founded on .
The administration has no evidence against the vast majority of the people currently being detained .
This is why detainees were denied the right to challenge their detention .
It is also why the administration came up with the show trial like military tribunal system , where detainees were n’t allowed to see the evidence against them , and hearsay was admissible .
The detention program goes against everything America should be .
It is a disgrace , and ought to be the first thing removed once Barack Obama takes office .
The United States of America must never again behave this way .
George W. Bush has done more to lower our nation ’s standing in than any other president in history , and the detentions and torture will be a lasting part of his legacy .
Bush has shown America its dark side so , let ’s hopes that a new president can remind us of what makes our nation great .

Electricity supply is irregular and many Nigerians rely on generators Nigeria needs $ 85 bn ( £ 42.7bn ) of investment in its power infrastructure in order to produce electricity 24 hours a day , experts say .
The sum is 17 times the amount the government announced it would spend on the power sector , and four and a half times the country 's oil savings .
Most of Nigeria 's 140 m residents live without reliable power .
The sum was given by a panel of experts appointed by President Umaru Yar 'Adua after nine months research .
Their final report has not been released to the public .
NIGERIA ELECTRICITY FACTS
Currently generates 1,800MW
Nigeria wants to generate 6,000MW by 2009
In 12 years it wants to be able to generate 20,000MW
Would need 100,000MW to become an industrialised economy , according to the ex-president Six power stations begun under the last administration have not been completed $ 16bn ( £ 8 bn ) has so far been spent on the power sector since 1999
Nigeria power shortage to persist
But the panel 's chairman Rilwanu Lukman told journalists the power generation in the country had dropped to 1,800 megawatts ( MW ) , from a capacity of 3,500 MW .
He also said even if the country 's power stations were working at full capacity , the transmission grid was broken down and neglected .
" The grid is very weak much of the equipment is currently responsible for causing the power cuts across the country , " he said .
The country 's short - term goal of 6,000MW by 2009 would cost $ 3bn ( £ 1.5bn ) , Mr Lukman said .
The government announced last week it would spend $ 5 bn ( £ 2.5 bn ) from the nation 's oil windfall on the power sector .
Subsidies Mr Lukman said there were not enough engineers in the country to work in power stations or maintain the electricity grid .
Nigeria wants to become one of the world 's top 20 economies by 2020 .
But in May the president said the continual power cuts were preventing investment in the country .
The government is working on plans to attract private investors by subsidising their electricity bills , the finance ministry said this month .
Before his election last year Mr Yar 'Adua said he would declare a " state of emergency " on power .
Correspondents say revamping the power sector remains one of his greatest challenges .

What are these ?
If Ravi Shankar has one abiding memory of the Monterey pop festival - which took place in the heady summer of 1967 , at the height of his notoriety as the sitar - playing guru to the stars - it is of unfortunate scheduling .
Slated to appear before him were Jefferson Airplane , a band whose blues - inflected barrage of pulsating sound could n't have clashed more with his own karmic composure .
And right after him was one Jimi Hendrix , then still a relative unknown , but with a growing reputation for ferocious , turbo - charged guitar solos .
" I thought he was fantastic , but so very loud , " Shankar says now , shaking his head .
" And then he would do that thing with his instrument when he would open up a can of gasoline and burn his guitar .
People went gaga for it ; they loved it .
But for me , the burning of the guitar was the greatest sacrilege possible .
I just ran out of there .
I told them that even if I had to pay some kind of compensation to get out of playing the festival , I just could n't do it . "
The organisers ' solution was to give Shankar his own stage for an altogether more civilised afternoon performance of assorted ragas , during which Hendrix sat quietly in the front row .
This predicament highlights what has to be one of the most extraordinary and often bizarre career trajectories of any living musician .
Now a venerable 88 , Shankar is finally saying farewell to Europe with a tour that culminates at the Barbican in London tonight , where he will perform a selection of specially chosen ragas with his daughter , Anoushka , also a sitar player .
Much of the tour had to be cancelled due to a stomach virus - but Shankar has now been declared fit and ready to play .
" My mind , musically ... in every sense I feel much better than ever before , " he says .
" But it is the body that sometimes lets me down . "
Meeting Shankar , it 's difficult to believe that this diminutive , deferential man has been such a counterculture luminary .
His greeting comes in the form of a namaskar , a gracious supplicant bow , and his speech is pitched just above a gentle whisper .
" I really hope I can make a little sense for you , " he says , pleading jetlag brought on by the long journey from his adoptive home in southern California .
" I do n't adjust quite the way I used to . "
It is 50 years since Shankar , already celebrated in his native India , first travelled to Europe and the US , just as a mania for eastern philosophy was taking hold .
John Cage was serving up Zen silence to bemused concert - goers , and hippie pioneer Timothy Leary was defending drug use by claiming membership of an obscure Hindu sect .
Shankar found himself embraced by everyone from John Coltrane , who named a son after him , to the violinist Yehudi Menuhin ; many of his disciples saw him as a sort of spiritual beacon .
Most famously , Shankar became the guru who turned George Harrison - and , by extension , the Beatles - on to Indian music , culture and philosophy .
When he met Harrison , in 1966 , Shankar knew very little of the Beatles ' music : he had n't heard Norwegian Wood , Harrison 's first attempt at composition on the sitar .
But the two hit it off .
" I loved George as a person , " Shankar says .
" I gave him his first copy of Autobiography of a Yogi and that was where his interest in Vedic culture and Indian - ness began .
To me , he was something like a son . "
At first , Shankar revelled in the attention that their association brought .
" I was admired by all these hippies , " he says , " and it was wonderful playing at Monterey and Woodstock , performing for half a million people . "
But he soon became disillusioned .
" I was extremely unhappy about the superficiality of it all , especially the wrong information that Dr Timothy Leary and others were propagating - that everyone in India takes drugs .
It was a hodgepodge of Kama Sutra , Tantra , yoga , hash and LSD , while the true spiritual quality of our music was almost completely lost . "
The focus on Shankar 's celebrity friends and admirers , the flower - power years , has too often obscured the hard - nosed musicianship of the man .
As is still evident in his performances , he is a sitar player of stunning virtuosity , whose silky , delicate style often explodes into improvisational rushes more dynamic than those of any rock guitarist .
His collaborations with Menuhin - duets that feel a little like an east / west variation of Duelling Banjos - rank as some of the most poignant cultural fusions ever written .
In India , his compositions have entered into one of the most forbidding musical canons on earth .
He has been a major force for innovation in Indian music .
" He has given a new shape and definition to this instrument over the course of the 20th century , " says his daughter Anoushka .
" He added the bass string that is quite common now .
He created the modern notation system for Indian music .
The tabla player was never really an important factor until my father made percussion a central part .
A lot of what people now consider Indian music can be traced back to him . "
Given the improvisational nature of Indian music , Shankar can't nail down exactly what the audience at his final London concert can expect .
" Unlike western music , we do n't have written compositions or any fixed things , " he says .
" So , even I do n't really know what it will be .
That is the greatest thrill for me , as well as the listener , because it is like cooking fresh food and serving it hot . "
Indian music is also tyrannically precise , with extremely complex mathematical guidelines for how ragas are played .
" There are thousands of ragas , " Shankar explains , " and they are all connected with different times of the day , like sunrise or night or sunset .
It is all based on 72 of what we call mela or scales .
And we have principally nine moods , ranging from peacefulness to praying , or the feeling of emptiness you get by sitting by the ocean . "
Born in 1920 in the holy city of Benares on the Ganges , Shankar began his career at the age of 10 , touring the world with his brother Uday 's dance troupe - the first to take traditional Indian dance to the west .
Shankar might have ended up a dancer were it not for the master instrumentalist Ustad Allauddin Khan , who played with the group .
" He used to scold me , saying : ' You will be nothing .
You will be jack of all and master of none . '
And that shocked me . "
When the war halted touring , Shankar spent seven years studying sitar with Khan in a remote north Indian village , before emerging in the late 1940s and 50s to become one of India 's most celebrated musicians .
He established himself in the west by hitting the road .
Starting out in tiny venues in the USSR , Czechoslovakia and Poland , he was soon packing out the Albert and Carnegie halls .
Coltrane approached him to ask for lessons , and began to incorporate Indian instruments into his jazz .
" He was getting ready to come to me for six weeks of study when he died [ in 1967 ] , " says Shankar .
In the mid-70s , Shankar began to distance himself from the hippy movement - though he seems to have been reluctant to let go of one main principle : free love .
During this period , his tangled transatlantic personal life produced two daughters : Norah in 1979 , with the American concert producer Sue Jones , and Anoushka in 1981 to his current wife , Sukanya Rajan , whom he pursued while with yet another long - term partner .
This all became newsworthy when Norah ( Jones ) hit the big time in 2002 , with her debut album Come Away With Me , and failed to thank her father in her Grammy acceptance speech .
" I guess I am not the only person in this position , " Shankar says contritely .
" It happens to a lot of musicians , actors , writers who become well known and who travel a lot .
You are in different countries and you are lonely . "
After years of estrangement , he is now reconciled with Norah , and Anoushka has become his greatest disciple and hope for the future .
At 88 , he admits that he finds it difficult not to think of his legacy .
" Yes , I have considered it , " he says .
" I sit with Anoushka and give her new things , information that I did n't give her before .
That is what happens with our music - it goes on growing , because it is not written down or set in a book . "
Though this tour is called A Farewell to Europe , Shankar is curiously noncommittal about whether this will be the last time we see him perform .
" I 've had quite a few ' farewell tours ' over the past few years , " he smiles .
" It sounds like a publicity stunt , but it is n't really .
I love to play for people .
But travelling has become a hazard - taking off your shoes in airports , and all that sort of thing .
So let 's hope that this is my last , though in my heart I hope that it is not " .

Following the national syndication of an article about Brattleboro , Vermont ’s petition making President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney subject to arrest for crimes against the Constitution , the local newspaper received responses from around the country .
The following email was sent by a friend of IfP :
Emails are coming into Brattleboro from all over .
Some [ positive ] , some [ negative ] .
Here ’s a sample from our local citizen journalism site , iBrattleboro :
[…]
“ I live in Delaware and read about your town ’s move to arrest Bush and Cheney .
I have sat here and wondered for 5 years wondering why we have n’t made moves to impeach them .
Even with a Democratic majority it has n’t happened .
So I salute and wholly support your efforts .
Where do I sign up ?!!
Newark , De ”
…
“ You guys make me proud .
My wife and I travel a lot internationally and actions like yours re Bush & Cheney are ones we like to talk about . ”
– Edwards , CO
…
“ I am overwhelmed with admiration for your town because you dared to say aloud what so many of us , all patriots , all Americans , feel to be true .
I have never visited Vermont , but I shall make it a point to do so , and to come to your town , this summer .
Keep up the good work ! ” – Saint Paul , Minnesota
…
“ I for one plan to spend my vacation in Brattleboro this year ( are n’t they the ones who have all the public nudity ?
Or is that Montpelier ? ) ”
…
“ The people of Brattleboro should be celebrated as true patriots .
The negative , threatening emails from Americans should only show proof at how morally corrupt segments of our society have become .
Sad , really … . ”
…
“ Bravo , you are indeed brave citizens , who have the guts to demand the arrest of Bush & Cheney .
An excellent way for the rest of us who are sickened by the actions of this administration to really voice our displeasure with the king ( Cheney ) and his jester ( Bush ) . ” – Studio City
…
“ Thank you so much for having the nerve to raise a stink , cause a stir , make people mad , look screwy , take abuse , and generally stand up for your principles .
Evil is rampant in Washington , DC .
Bush and Company are just the top of the heap and all of them are worthy of little less then impeachment , trial and . . . well I do n’t know what punishments they would deserve by law on the charges you endorse but whatever they are , they are not harsh enough .
I write to voice my appreciation of your courage .
Thank you for speaking out and saying what millions would really like to say .
The naysayers are all Right wing loons and do n’t really count .
It is the rest of the nation that believes your right in your efforts .
You do have many supporters out here in the REAL WORLD .

“ Greetings from South Bend , IN .
Just read story on your referendum to indict the Booby Twins , Bush and Cheney .
MORE POWER TO YOU !!!
After stealing 2 elections , and twice taking an oath to “ uphold and defend the Conststution of the U.S. ”
I believe you are right on in your display of disappointment in our present leadership .
I find it somewhat hypocritical of those who disagree , to threaten you with terroist acts and then say that you ’re not grateful to be protected from terroism by our idiot president and his henchman .
The first act of terrorism on American soil was The Boston Tea Party .
George Washington was called a terrorist by the English .
Lincoln would have been hung by the Confederacy for Treason .
It ’s all a matter of linguistics .
Liberals
Think !
Conservatives follow .
May God Bless You ! ”
…
“ I just read today your town ’s petition to arrest Bush and Cheney for crimes against the Constitution .
Thank you .
He has taken things too far , created a war based on fear alone .
I may have to look into moving into your town . ”
…
“ When true blue Americans smell a rat in Washington , one who disregards the Constitution , the rights of the citizens and plunges the nation into debt , they need to stand up and make a statement .
Your wonderful little town ( I ’ve never been there , do n’t know if it is small or large , but I do know it is filled with wonderful people with brains ) …….. made a statement and one that is logical .
Do n’t let those small minded people who think a president who refuses to read the world ’s newspapers , or pay attention to the condition of this country and its financial health , but focuses on a war that we do n’t need or want and ca n’t afford is a president we need to blindly support .
He has to go !
One more year may spell the end of the United States .
How many young people have to come back ( if they are lucky enough to make it back ) with arms and legs missing ?
This war is for his ego or to show his daddy that he has risen above his drug and alcohol days and is doing more than his father was able to do .
How did this fool get to be President ?????
If we fall , it will more than likely be due to the air heads in Washington who are only interested in feathering their own nests , and protecting their health benefits and their retirement funds .
The rest of us are going to Hell in a hand basket thanks to a president who lied and cheated his way into office … not once but twice !!
How the heck did that happen ?
I am proud of your town and I salute you for being good American citizens and taking a stand that we all should be taking .
God Bless Brattleboro !
I have never responded to any story I have ever read on the Internet , but I feel , after reading some of the Bubba comments from fools , that you need to know that not everyone supports those idiots .
Is there someone from your town who feels qualified to run for President ?
I ’d vote for them !
Sincerely ,
Chico CA

“ Dear Fellow Americans of Battledore ,
I admire your intelligence , your courage and you willingness to take action against an administration that has lied to it ’s citizen and has acted illegally and unconstitutionally on several occasions .
I wish more Americans would realize that it is not only our right under the constitution to question and challenge our leaders when they act improperly but it is our obligation .
You are all better Americans than the angry fools who wish you harm .
They are ignorant and no better than the terrorists they claim to despise .
I support your actions and wish you well .
God bless ,

I had just about given up hope , for the sanity of this nation .

According to reports , authorities in Belgium have seized documents , financial records and computer equipment from the local branch of the Church of Scientology ( Church ) and then sealed off the building .
Scientology 's European headquarters in the political heart of Brussels
The reports state that the Church in Belgium is being investigated for extortion and fraud for allegedly posting false job openings in newspapers and then attempting to get those who applied to join the Church .
Several ex-members of the Church have also reportedly approached authorities with accusations of intimidation and extortion .
Police in Belgium have been investigating the Church for nearly ten years which resulted in the raid on Thursday .
In a statement to the press , the Church says that the police " violated their fundamental rights " as a religious organization and accused the police of " malicious justice operations . "
The Church plans to contest any charges filed against it .
They also state that the postings were requests for volunteers and not employees .
So far no arrests have been made , but some employees of the Church were detained and questioned by police .
The building remains closed as of publication .

The World from Berlin The Bush Administration 's ' Outrageous Impertinence '
For the third time in a row , the US Supreme Court has rapped the Bush administration on the knuckles for its treatment of Guantanamo inmates .
Perhaps it is time to impeach President Bush , says one German paper .
There are two popular approaches to positioning with CSS : float and absolute positioning .
Both approaches have their pros and cons .
My teammates and I have developed a new positioning approach that gives us the best of both worlds .
After quite a bit of experimenting and testing , it ’s time to share the technique with the rest of the world and see how we can work together to improve it .
I ’m calling it “ faux absolute positioning ” after the faux columns technique that simulates the presence of a column .
Article Continues Below
Why do we need another CSS layout technique ?
#section2
Many website designs are based on a columnar layout with a header and footer .
With absolutely positioned layouts , it is almost impossible to position the footer if the columns can grow vertically .
With floated layouts , unexpected content changes can cause entire columns to wrap ( “ float drop ” ) , as described by Shaun Inman in Clearance .
This is undesirable and hard to control in Internet Explorer because of IE ’s problematic treatment of width .
Our use case was even more complex : my team was developing a web - based WYSIWYG form generator that allows the user to drag items to arbitrary locations on a canvas .
We needed to let our users create beautiful forms that did n’t use overly static layouts and to let them align columns as needed .
For example , let ’s assume we want a form that puts the postal code and city fields on the same line because they are semantically connected .
To accomplish this , we tried using floated positioning inspired by the Holy Grail technique .
Using this method , we needed to adjust the width , borders , margins , and / or padding of the postal code field to pin the city field to a fixed horizontal position .
That was a problem because if the width of the postal code field needed adjusting , or if we wanted to adjust the amount of whitespace between fields , the city field would need to move as well .
The more elements on a page — the more cells in your grid — the more tedious this kind of adjustment becomes .
Additionally , the positioning is sensitive to the slightest change in a number of parameters , which makes it nigh impossible to control in case of dynamic form items .
Next , we tried using absolute positioning .
This gave us much more control over the positioning of the items and is robust .
But absolutely positioned elements have no height , and that caused the containing element ( the canvas ) to collapse .
This made it hard to position content without making everything absolutely positioned — which is impossible to achieve with dynamic content .
A different approach #section3
Finally , we tried a solution based on finding a way to calculate the left offset from a fixed position , as opposed to calculating it from the right edge of the preceding element .
We managed to do this using a combination of position : relative , left : 100 % and a negative margin - left .
Our method starts by building a grid of lines and items .
We can place any number of items on a line and any number of lines in the containing element :
< div id =" canvas " > < div class = " line " > < div class = " item " id =" item1 " > < div class= " sap- content " > content here</div > </div> </div> </div >
… and so on .
Every item has an extra sap - content div with several purposes :
it prevents the redraw bug in IE6 ,
, it gives us extra flexibility to add padding ( example below ) , and
it lets us play with position : overflow ( without breaking the grid ! ) .
The generic CSS applied to these elements is as follows :
. line { float : left ; width : 100 % ; display : block ; position : relative ; }.item { position : relative ; float : left ; left : 100 % ; }
To position a particular item , all we need to do is give it a negative margin - left and a width .
For example :
#item1 { margin - left : - 100 % ; width : 30 % ; }
With some extra styling , for demonstration purposes , it looks like this :
Example of Faux Absolute Positioning in action .
The generic CSS positions every item at the right side of the canvas , with each item ’s width based on its content and all items floated in their HTML source order .
The margin - left is now offset from the right side of the canvas instead of from the element to its left .
With faux absolute positioning , we can align every item to a predefined position on the grid ( as with absolute positioning ) but items still affect the normal flow and — thanks to clear — have many of the same advantages as normal - flow elements .
Every row in the grid will always have height dependent on the content or as defined in CSS , and will always take up 100 % of the width , no matter how many columns are defined in the row .
Furthermore , we can avoid using cumbersome margins or padding to adjust the amount of whitespace between elements — which is a plus , since those techniques almost always require us to use IE6 - specific hacks to compensate for the browser ’s box model .
Another advantage of the technique is that it mitigates much of the fragility of floats .
When the content of a floated box is wider than the box itself , it pushes the next box to the right ( and by consequence , the box often drops down ) .
With faux absolute positioning , the box to the right stays in place , no matter what .
The content of the boxes may overlap ( depending on other variables such as overflow : hidden ) but that ’s all — and in our view , it ’s better to risk overlap than risk breaking the whole layout .
Honestly , I was a bit surprised that the technique worked so well .
It uses valid HTML 4.01 and CSS 2.1 , and negative left margins are widely implemented in browsers .
And there ’s more good news : it works with fixed and liquid designs , it can be combined with equal height columns ( though the issues with this solution remain ) , and there is the possibility of combining fixed - width and flexible - width columns ( see the example below ) .
It is even possible to use faux absolute positioning recursively , e.g. , use a positioned item as the container for new lines and items .
Faux absolute positioning is very much inspired by and intended for grid - based design and is more rewarding with more complex layouts .
If you have a two - column fixed - width design , this may not be your technique of choice .
Additionally , faux absolute positioning will not work for every situation .
If you want to align elements on the left , you cannot use a unit that is different from the unit in which the width of the canvas is defined , because you cannot calculate the offset .
For example , if you have a canvas width : 800 px and want a left offset of 2em for your item you cannot calculate the margin - left because you never know how many ems fit in 800 pixels .
And since it is a new technique that has n’t been tested by thousands of users , it should still be considered experimental , as you may see unexpected results in your actual combination of markup , CSS , and browser .
One remaining issue : when an element larger than the canvas precedes other elements in the HTML source , the trailing elements on the same line will be pushed to the right by an amount equal to the difference in width between the the first element and the canvas .
The first example is a three - column liquid layout with fixed side columns , like the Holy Grail .
I have implemented this layout as a template for Drupal , a popular open source CMS .
There are a few things to note :
The left and right columns have widths in pixels .
Therefore , we cannot calculate margin - left for the main content , because we do n’t know the width of the canvas or the width of the left column as a percentage of the canvas .
The solution is similar to the Holy Grail : position the main content with margin - left : - 100 % and width : 100 % and add padding to provide the necessary space for the columns .
Left , main , and right columns are rendered at the same hierarchical level , so we may need something like z - index : 100 on the columns .
Padding for the left and right columns is added to the extra div.sap - content ; this keeps our math simple while affording us a great deal of flexibility .
The second example is a five - column liquid design in which canvas , lines , and items are all sized in percentages .
The addition of images , borders and paddings have no effect on the overall positioning , even for images that are larger than the containing element , as is demonstrated with the old map of Maastricht in the example .
No hacks required !
#section7
Our approach requires no hacks and it works with all modern browsers ( Safari , Opera , Firefox , IE7 ) as well as IE6 and even IE5.5 / Win .
It does not work in IE5 / Mac , but since this product has been discontinued , it is not on our priority list .
The approach is also very stable , since elements grow vertically if necessary , and the layout does not break when an image is wider than the element , for example .
The positioning of items is independent from the source order in HTML .
I am quite enthusiastic about this approach and see many opportunities for it .

The soaring cost of oil has led to the slowing of vehicles of almost every type in Britain , from planes to trains , ferries , merchant vessels , buses and private cars .
Pilots and ships ' captains have been ordered to go slow , train drivers have been asked to switch off engines and coast downhill and bus companies are training staff to drive more smoothly in order to cut costs .
As the oil price hit a record high of $ 142 a barrel ( £ 71.14 ) yesterday , two big British airlines , easyJet and BMI , confirmed they had asked their pilots to fly more slowly .
EasyJet , Europe 's second biggest budget airline , said it had cut flying speeds on some routes by up to 2 % to conserve cash .
" It 's like travelling in a car .
If you take your foot off the gas slightly , you use less fuel , " said an easyJet spokesman .
BMI , Heathrow airport 's second biggest carrier , said it had dropped its average flight speed by around 3mph .
The rail industry is also taking measures to reduce the energy consumed by trains , amid high diesel and electricity costs .
FirstGroup , one of the biggest rail businesses whose four franchises include First Great Western , is retraining drivers to drive more smoothly between stops instead of wasting fuel by accelerating and braking sharply .
Drivers on its TransPennine Express service are being encouraged to let trains coast down steep gradients , while some trains are running on two out of three engines .
TPE passengers also have to be quicker on their feet , with automatic doors on new TPE trains being programmed to close quickly in order to conserve cool air from air conditioning units .
An executive at a UK rail franchise said : " There 's a hell of a lot going on .
Life has changed , we 're all working very hard - we 've got to . "
The Association of Train Operating Companies is leading industry - wide efforts to reduce fuel consumption .
A spokesman said : " We are helping ensure that best practice is spread across the industry and that includes driving more efficiently . "
The bus industry , another major consumer of fuel , is also implementing initiatives to encourage smoother driving .
The oil price is also affecting car travel , according to the AA .
Drivers are either driving more slowly or staying off the roads altogether .
Adam Ashmore , an AA patrolman in Manchester , said the slowdown was evident on all roads .
" It 's not just motorways , you can see it in town as well .
People are definitely driving more slowly . "
Petrol prices of nearly 120 p a litre are also deterring drivers in the south , the AA said , with one patrol member describing Guildford last weekend as a " ghost town " due to the lack of cars .
This is not the first time speeds have been reduced in response to high fuel costs .
The 1973 oil crisis prompted the US government to impose a national speed limit of 55 mph , cutting state limits which had been as high as 75 mph .
Airlines and train operators said their planes were taking off and landing on time , despite the slowdown .
" Though this adjustment in speed makes our fuel burn more economically , it does not jeopardise flight punctuality , " said a BMI spokesman .
Ferry journeys are taking longer : one of Britain 's busiest ferry routes is adding 20 minutes to its journey time in a bid to save fuel .
From July , Stena Line will be dropping ships ' cruising speeds on two high speed routes : Holyhead to Dún Laoghaire , near Dublin , and Belfast to Stranraer .
The crossing from Holyhead to Stranraer currently takes 99 minutes and the change will increase journey time by 20 minutes .
The journey time on the Belfast route will increase by 14 minutes .
Nigel Tilson , Stena Line 's UK communications manager , said : " We 're going to save several thousand tonnes of fuel across the year .
We would n't be doing this if we were n't going to be saving a considerable amount of money . "
Nigel Esdale , managing director of P&O Cruises , said reducing engine speed was one of the ways the company was looking to save money .
" Careful itinerary planning , whilst maximising time in the most popular ports and reducing engine speed are just some of the ways we control our fuel consumption , " he said .
Maersk Line , another big shipping company , has cut speeds on its Asia - Europe route , with some cargo ships travelling at 20 knots instead of 24 knots , slashing fuel consumption by 40 % .
" We did do it in response to rising fuel costs but for us it's a win - win situation between being economical and environment concerns , " said a Maersk spokesman .
EasyJet and BMI have been joined by carriers across the globe in slashing speeds , with Air New Zealand , Air Canada , Brussels Airlines and Southwest and JetBlue in the US all announcing similar moves recently .
BA and Ryanair said they are not reducing aircraft speeds , but have warned passengers that fares will rise above inflation this year in order to cover rising fuel costs .
You could drink the exhaust of the Honda FCX Clarity .
The four - door sedan — the first hydrogen fuel - cell car available to the general public — emits only water .
Powered by the electricity generated when hydrogen and oxygen combine to form H 2 O and with upholstery fabric made of fermented corn , the Clarity sure sounds green .
But is it the “ zero- emission sedan of the future , ” as Honda claims ?
Not yet .
Most hydrogen fuel is derived from natural gas in a process that releases plenty of carbon dioxide , so the car and its 134 - horsepower electric motor fall short of being footprint - free .
Still , fueling a vehicle like the Clarity emits less than half the CO 2 released by its gas - guzzling counterparts for a given distance , says John Turner of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden , Colorado .
The Clarity ’s fuel efficiency equivalent of 68 miles per gallon clobbers even the feel - good 48 mpg of the Toyota Prius , and the car can go 270 miles on a $ 20 tank .
Just do n’t plan on taking it cross-country anytime soon .
Honda begins leasing the Clarity this summer ( $ 600 a month , with limited availability ) in Santa Monica , Irvine , and Torrance , three Southern California communities with rare access to hydrogen fueling stations .
The company is working toward a greener , more abundant hydrogen supply line ; a research station at its R&D headquarters turns water into fuel using solar power .
The downside ?
It refuels only one Clarity a day .

However , # let is limited to just one variable : Expanding # let to multiple variables with its existing syntax just does n’t scale properly :
Thus , the #lets syntax uses a hash so that the variable names are close to the expressions denoting their values .
That ’s all .
If you are interested in why anyone would need #lets , read on …Recently there has been a lot of interest in exploring the extremes of OO style .
One of the tenets of such a style is to work with small classes and short methods .
Why do you suppose we want to do that ?
Well , the underlying principle is to chunk things into small , workable pieces with clear purposes .
This principle abounds everywhere : posts just like this are broken up into sections with headings and the prose is subdivided into paragraphs .
So I quite agree with the principle behind small classes and short methods .
__________.
You just knew that a word like “ However ” would follow a paragraph like that , did n’t you ?
The principle of subdivision is terrific .
But are classes and methods the only mechanisms we have for subdividing code ?
In some languages , that may be true .
In other languages , that is not true .
For example , since version 1.1 Java has permitted classes to be nested inside of other classes , calling them “ inner classes . ”
This is a very powerful technique of organizing code :
If class A is the only class that ever uses class B , why should class B live in its own file , visible to every other class ?
Placing class B inside of class A is a big win : it is immediately clear that A is the only user of B , and when looking at the code in your IDE you do not see class B promoted to equal standing with A : it is clearly subordinate to A.
Of course , placing class B inside of class A makes A a bigger class .
Is that wrong ?
Perhaps it is at some times , but it ’s a big win at others .
Remember we said B is subordinate to A ?
An inner class can be made private , explicitly telling the compiler and other programmers that it is limited in scope .
Limiting scope is a very powerful organizing technique in code .
We can debate how important it is that the compiler enforce scope , however given the importance of writing code for humans to read and understand , I ’m personally in favour of any technique that sends a strong signal to your fellow programmers explaining the intended structure and organization of the code .
There are techniques for organizing methods into classes or modules , and techniques for organizing classes and modules into larger classes and modules .
But what about individual lines of code ?
Are methods really the only mechanism we have for organization at the lowest level ?
I think not .
Even within methods , there are certain practices that logically chunk your code into small , workable pieces with clear purposes .
For example , Algol , Pascal , Modula , and many other languages support nested functions or procedures :
It is clear that #next is used solely by #print .
Since most OO languages do not permit nested procedures , the programmer is left to choose between making #nest a private method or carving # print out and making it a strategy class .
Making # next a private method does keep it from prying eyes outside of the class , however it implies that all methods of the class may want to use it , which is clearly not the case .
If we are allowed to nest objects , we can fake nested procedures with objects .
Ruby ’s Proc class makes it easy : ( There is a fairly major difference in what these two snippets of code do thanks to the difference between call - by - value and call - by - reference , but let ’s wave our hands furiously and stick to the point about nesting functions . )
In imperative languages , one of our biggest headaches is managing mutable local variables .
If you only need one in one particular place , it is helpful to have a way of nesting the variable definition .
In Java : And in Perl ( thanks Chromatic ) :
The variables i and j are limited in scope to the body of the for loop .
This called block scoping , and I personally love it .
Block scoping permits us to make small , self - contained blocks of code and use them inline .
If we need to move them or change them , we know which things are limited in scope to the block and which reach outside of the block and thus might be affected by our changes .
In Javascript we can fake block scoping using procedures , but it ’s syntactically noisy .
Can we do the same thing in Ruby ?
Yes , and that ’s exactly what #lets does :
This is a block with three block - local variables in it , just like you might find in Java .
It breaks a complicated expression up into smaller pieces ( “ How to find the person , ” “ How to find the place , ” “ What kind of thing we have , ” and finally “ How to describe it all as a string ” ) .
And those pieces are all grouped together so you know they are not used elsewhere .
Unlike the other elements of Ick , #lets actually rewrites your ruby code .
The code example above is actually rewritten as : The rewritten code is then evaluated .
At the moment , this happens every time you call #lets , so it is expensive .
Even by Ruby standards .
Hopefully , there will be a future version of Ick :: Syntax that only rewrites by need or perhaps just once when the code is first read .
So , #lets takes the syntactic noise of using procs to create block structure and hides it from us .
How ?
Well , my first cut at it used Ruby2 Ruby and regular expressions .
Then I was inspired by Aanand Prasad ’s Haskell - style monad do - notation for Ruby to work directly with s-expressions .
Although the code is technically longer , it ’s actually much , much better .
For meta- syntactic programming , you need to work with the abstract syntax tree .
And with ParseTree and Ruby2 Ruby , you have all the tools you need to write code that writes code , with the teeny - weeny proviso that what you want to do is translate your Ruby into Lisp , manipulate the Lisp , and then translate it back into Ruby : sudo gem install ick Cheers , and thanks very much to Ryan Davis Matt Mower , and Aanand Prasad

Enlarge By Steve Marcus for USA TODAY Larry and Anne Marie Watson 's home on Rolling Hills Drive was sold in a complicated deal requiring the Watsons to pay $ 43,000 to a company called Pro Design .
They never met the buyer .
MANY CASES MANY CASES
Top 10 states for reported fraud in single - family home loans in 2007 , and their rank in 2006 : 2007 2006 Florida 1 1 Nevada 2 6 Michigan 3 3 California 4 2 Utah 5 11 Georgia 6 4 Virginia 7 14 Illinois 8 8 New York 9 9 Minnesota 10 5 Source : Mortgage Asset Research Institute LAS VEGAS 
In the shadow of Sunrise Mountain , where Rolling Hills Drive turns into Gold Mine Drive , a plain two - story home sits unoccupied , like thousands of other houses here in southern Nevada .
Some of these empty homes have " for sale " signs .
Others bear signs saying " foreclosure . "
Authorities say hundreds of them , including this one on Rolling Hills Drive , should have a different sign out front , one that reads " fraud . "
Prosecutors contend this house was sold last year to a straw buyer as part of a sprawling mortgage fraud perpetrated by a husband - and - wife team involving 277 properties in greater Las Vegas .
Prosecutors have charged Eve Mazzarella , 30 , and Steven Grimm , 45 , with bank fraud , alleging the two caused banks to make more than $ 107 million in dubious loans and netted a profit of at least $ 15 million .
Both defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges .
A trial has been scheduled for October .
To the untrained eye , the size , scope and sophistication of the alleged scheme is noteworthy .
But to the FBI in Las Vegas , the problem is the opposite :
In recent years , there have been so many mortgage fraud cases , the bureau and local prosecutors have had to establish a special task force to combat the problem .
Scott Hunter , the FBI 's supervisory special agent here , describes the region as " mortgage fraud ground zero . "
The problem is so widespread that everyone seems to know someone affected by it .
Even one of the FBI 's Las Vegas agents has a connection : Special Agent Henry Schlumpf 's wife was the real estate broker who sold the Rolling Hills Drive house last year to a straw buyer representing Mazzarella and Grimm .
The problem is hardly confined to Nevada .
On a national level , mortgage fraud is a pandemic that stretches from California to Rhode Island , and from Alaska to Florida .
The FBI currently has 1,380 active investigations into mortgage fraud , compared with 818 for fiscal 2006 .
According to the website MortgageDaily.com , reported cases of fraudulent mortgage loans amounted to more than $ 4 billion in 2007 , up from $ 1.6 billion in 2006 .
But the $ 4 billion number does n't come close to describing the losses generated by mortgage fraud .
Neighboring homeowners take a financial hit .
Nowhere is that more apparent than in Las Vegas , where housing prices appreciated by a staggering 40 % in 2004 alone .
The surge in values drew investors , speculators and first - time buyers into the market like gamblers to a craps table .
" We 've got people who walked into neighborhoods who paid $ 200,000 to $ 400,000 more than they ever should have paid , " says the FBI 's Hunter .
" That story is going on all over Las Vegas .
Everybody thought the market was hot , but a lot of that was being manipulated . "
Many of those who overpaid are stuck with mortgages larger than what their homes are worth .
Those who took out home - equity lines of credit based on inflated valuations of their homes are now caught in a financial squeeze .
Las Vegas had one of the nation 's highest foreclosure rates last year , with 4.2 % of its homes being repossessed by banks , up 169 % from 2006 .
" There 's a close correlation between states with foreclosure problems and states with mortgage fraud problems , " says Sam Garcia of MortgageDaily.com .
" There 's a good portion of foreclosures that probably resulted from some form of mortgage fraud . "
Profit or possession Mortgage fraud comes in two flavors : " fraud for housing " and " fraud for profit . "
Fraud for housing occurs when would - be home buyers overstate their income or misrepresent their credit history to secure a mortgage to buy a more expensive house than they can reasonably afford .
In most cases , people who commit fraud for housing intend to live in their homes and pay their mortgages .
Fraud for profit is considered the more serious crime , since the goal is to rip off banks .
In one common version of these schemes , a fraudster buys a home , gets an inflated appraisal , then resells the home at the artificially high price to a straw buyer who has no intention of living in the house or paying off the mortgage .
Mortgage fraud perpetrators can't act on their own ; they need accomplices to trick a bank into underwriting a loan that 's larger than a property is worth .
To pull this off , mortgage fraudsters often work in league with corrupt appraisers , who inflate the value of target properties , says Jenny Brawley , head of mortgage fraud investigations at Freddie Mac .
The fraudster also needs someone to play the role of the buyer .
In a true sale , a buyer would never willingly overpay for a home , but mortgage fraud schemes do n't work unless a straw buyer shows up and puts in a sky - high offer for a property .
Straw buyers fall into two categories : willing accomplices who hope to share in the profits ; or dupes who are told they can make a quick $ 5,000 or $ 10,000 by joining a " real estate investment partnership . "
Once a mortgage fraud perpetrator has his team in place , he needs to figure out how to cover his tracks .
Fraudsters know they can't close a bogus real estate transaction one day , then disappear the next without raising suspicion .
To keep the banks at bay , sophisticated con artists pay the mortgage bills for six months or even a year after a sale , creating the illusion of a legitimate real estate transaction .
Until 2006 , when the real estate market began to cool in earnest , a fraudster could often resell a property , essentially covering his tracks .
" A lot of these schemes were masked because of an appreciating market , " says Freddie Mac 's Brawley .
" The orchestrator of a fraud could flip 50 or 100 houses and do pretty well . "
Case studies
In the past few years , regulators have filed hundreds of cases against mortgage brokers , appraisers and straw buyers .
Although the details of each case are unique , they often share similar characteristics : • Eye- popping price appreciation .
How hot were real estate values in Texas in the winter of 2003 ?
So hot that Carlos Paul Gonzalez arranged to buy a home in The Woodlands , a Houston suburb , for $ 376,850 on Jan. 29 , then sell it for $ 515,795 on Feb.
12 .
That sounded too good to be true to federal prosecutors there , who filed an indictment charging Gonzalez and a partner , Ken Russell Browder , with recruiting straw buyers to overbid for a series of properties , including the home in The Woodlands .
The two men have pleaded not guilty in the matter , but in April , a title agent named in the indictment , Jannice Bonner , pleaded guilty to participating in the mortgage fraud scheme .
• Straw buyers .
Last December , federal prosecutors in Utah charged five men and one woman with defrauding two lenders out of $ 13 million in mortgage loans .
Prosecutors allege the defendants inflated the values of homes , buying and selling them through straw buyers and a pair of shell companies , Home Owners Group ( H.O.G. ) and Paragon Investment Group ( P.I.G. ) .
• Professional involvement .
In recent years , the FBI has estimated that 80 % of mortgage fraud cases involve real estate professionals who could n't resist the temptations of easy money .
Other cases involve people with criminal backgrounds migrating toward the mortgage business .
The epidemic of mortgage fraud is a reminder that wherever easy money is made , criminal activity soon follows .
" Mortgage fraud has always been here , " says Hunter , " but the level of complexity has gone up .
It 's not just white - collar criminals .
There are elements inside the real estate industry .
You do n't just show up one day and do this .
You learn to perfect the craft of mortgage fraud . "
A 40 % rise in one year
In terms of mortgage fraud , Las Vegas was bound to become a hotbed .
When property values there soared 40 % in 2004 , speculators saw they could get rich quick without having to visit the city 's casinos .
For Larry Watson and his wife , Anne Marie , their home at the corner of Rolling Hills Drive and Gold Mine Drive had soared in value since they bought it in 1999 for $ 139,000 .
For years , they rented out the property , but they say continuing problems with tenants had resulted in tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees .
In February of 2007 , the Watsons say , they just wanted out , and listed the home for sale at $ 310,000 with a local real estate agent , Erin Schlumpf .
But by then , the real estate market in Las Vegas had cooled , and for two months , the Watsons got no offers .
In May , Schlumpf stunned them , saying a young man named Jonathan Carter was willing to buy their property for $ 340,000 .
But there was a catch :
After the closing , the Watsons would have to make a $ 43,000 payment to a company called Pro Design , effectively reducing the sale price to $ 297,000 .
In June , the Watsons say they got worse news :
An appraiser determined that the value of their home was only $ 290,000 , and therefore , the bank would n't approve the $ 340,000 mortgage application .
Schlumpf then said Carter would be willing to buy the house for $ 295,000 , but the catch remained : The Watsons would still have to pay $ 43,000 to Pro Design .
" I did n't understand where the $ 43,000 was going , " says Larry Watson , who works in the information - technology department of Clark County , Nev. " I was advised that Pro Design is a corporation that holds money to be used in the repair of a property .
I really got suspicious . "
Nevertheless , exhausted by the process and concerned about the weakening market , the Watsons accepted the deal .
At closing , a payment of $ 43,000 was made to Pro Design , a company controlled by Steven Grimm , according to Nevada state records , as well as the federal indictment .
According to the documents signed at closing , Grimm 's wife , Eve Mazzarella , received a commission as broker and agent for the buyer , and Schlumpf and her boss split a commission for representing the Watsons .
The Watsons never met Carter , the buyer , since he did n't show up at the closing .
But Schlumpf urged them to sell quickly in June because Carter was in a hurry to move into the house , Watson says .
Carter says now he never intended to live in the house .
Instead , he told USA TODAY , he was led to believe he'd make money on a real estate investment brokered by Grimm , just as several of his friends had .
All he had to do was allow the home to be purchased in his name , and Grimm would handle the mortgage payments .
Shortly after the sale of 1729 Rolling Hills Drive last year , Carter began receiving notices from Amtrust Bank saying that he was behind on his monthly payments .
Carter says he called Grimm to complain .
" He was like , ' Oh , it 's getting taken care of , ' " says Carter .
But Grimm made only one mortgage payment after his call , Carter says , and the bank has been dunning him since .
Carter 's attorney , Kirk Kennedy , says the bank has begun foreclosure proceedings .
Schlumpf , wife of an FBI agent , says she can't comment on the matter , as it's under investigation .
The FBI would n't comment , either .
And there is no evidence to suggest that anyone connected to the deal other than Grimm and Mazzarella is under investigation .
Of the 277 properties that Mazzarella and Grimm are accused of using to defraud banks , this is the box score from 1729 Rolling Hills Drive : The Watsons lost $ 43,000 from the profit they might have earned on their property ; Carter 's credit rating is ruined ; and Mazzarella and Grimm could end up in jail .
The property was no gold mine after all .

Breasts can move several inches during exercise Women who wear the wrong kind of bra could be damaging their breasts , researchers have warned .
The breast biomechanics team at the University of Portsmouth said poor support could lead to fragile ligaments in the breast being stretched .
They said that during exercise , breasts move up to 21 cm ( 8.26inches ) , up and down , in and out and side to side - but most bras just limit vertical movement .
And they warned crop - top sports bras did not give enough support .
Many women do n't want to be seen as too small or too big
Wendy Hedger , University of Portsmouth
The research team has tested about 50 bra designs on hundreds of women during the past three years .
Wendy Hedger , one of the scientists who carried out the work , said : " Many women have strong preferences for certain styles of bra and wo n't buy anything else .
" They wo n't even look at anything that does n't look like the sort of bra they are used to wearing .
" In sports bras , for example , many women wo n't buy a bra that resembles their everyday bra and does up at the back - they think if it can't be pulled over their heads like a crop top , then it 's not a real sports bra .
" But this is not true and many sports bras do up at the back in the same way as a traditional bra and do a very good job of supporting women . "
' Social stigma '
She added that habit also affects the bras women choose for everyday wear , with the wrong choices potentially causing breast pain or discomfort .
Ms Hedger added : " There 's a social stigma about certain sizes .
Many women do n't want to be seen as too small or too big and buy a bra that does n't fit well in order to be what they consider to be a normal size .
" And many other women are unaware that they are wearing a badly - fitting bra or unknowingly wear the wrong bra size because they are routinely being sold ill - fitting bras .
" Some women forget that their shape and size change and they might have to go through several changes in bra size over their lifetime , especially after breastfeeding and the menopause . "

Yes , I swore and I 'm so ******* sorry : Joan Rivers shows no remorse for her four - letter outburst on TV's Loose Women
American comedian Joan Rivers showed little remorse for her controversial four letter tirade during live daytime television .
" Yes , I swore and I 'm so f****** sorry , " the 75 - year - old told Mail Online exclusively today .
The star , who is famed for her controversial outbursts , launched an extraordinary series of expletives on the ITV chat show Loose Women yesterday .
Foul - mouthed : At one point during Joan Rivers ' tirades today she said : ' Get ready to **** this ... but sadly , there was no bleeper
Perhaps taking inspiration from the title of the show , she let herself go , describing the actor Russell Crowe as a ‘ piece of f****** s***’.
As her fellow panellists giggled nervously , an unabashed Miss Rivers explained she
thought her expletives would be ‘ bleeped out ’ .
Instead , ITV executives bleeped out Miss Rivers herself , hauling her off the show when it went to a commercial break .
Shock : Jackie Brambles ( left ) , Jane McDonald ( right ) are flabbergasted at Joan Rivers ' language
Rivers continued to Mail Online : ' No - one told me the TV show Loose Women was a reality show that I would be voted off ... Yes I swore and I 'm so f****** sorry .
I wrote to the ladies , ' Dear Ladies of Loose Women ' :
I am so sorry if I upset your show .
Please accept my apologies ... Love Joan Rivers ... P.S. I went back and looked at the footage of Russell Crowe and guess what ?
He 's still an a*****.'
Yesterday , Miss Rivers , who was appearing on Loose Women to promote her theatre
show Joan Rivers : A Work In Progress in London , said she was ‘ thrilled ’ to have been hauled off during a commercial break .
‘ They whipped me off .
It ’s the first time in 40 years , ’ she said .
‘ I ’m thrilled – everyone
keeps saying to me , “ What more is there in your career ?
You ’ve got every award there is ” .
Tirade : The Loose Women ladies look on helplessly as Joan lets loose live on air
‘ I ’m certainly not mellowing with age .
Viewers , people have heard the word f***.
' People have heard it in Sex And The City , it ’s such a common word . ’
Miss Rivers made her comments when telling the other panelists about how she
interviews celebrities at the Oscars ceremony each year .
‘ I enjoy it when they ’re nice , and you know what I ’m saying .
You get someone like Russell Crowe , and you want to say to the camera he is a piece of – get ready to bleep this – f****** s***!’
Responding to gasps from the shocked presenters and audience , Miss Rivers added : ‘ I did say get ready to bleep ! ’
Presenter Jackie Brambles replied : ‘ But we have n’t got a bleeper – we ’re live ! ’
An ITV spokesman said : ‘ We would like to apologise to Loose Women viewers for the inappropriate language used by Joan Rivers on today ’s show .
' Loose Women guests are always briefed that it is a live daytime show and as such are reminded not to swear or use inappropriate language . '
Renters may be the big winners in the housing slump , especially in places like Southern California , Las Vegas and Florida , which have thousands of vacant for - sale and foreclosed homes and condominiums on the market .
Apartment vacancies are edging up in many areas of the country as frustrated sellers instead try to rent out their homes and condos .
And that is making it harder for landlords to raise rents .
In the toughest markets , apartment owners are even offering lease incentives to snag renters .
This “ shadow market ” of investor - owned homes and condos accounts for almost half of the rental stock and attracts displaced homeowners more often than your typical apartment renter .

“ What ’s different now is the degree of excess homes and condos being put on the rental market , ” said Hessam Nadji , managing director at Encino - based Marcus & Millichap Real Estate Investment Services , which analyzed the data .
“ The sheer volume is creating more competition for traditional rental markets . ”
Areas that experienced explosive condo development and conversions of apartments into condos for sale are finding those units unloaded onto the rental market because developers can’t sell them .
In San Diego , homes being placed on the rental market are hurting luxury apartment communities , said Rick Snyder , president of the California Apartment Assn .
“ People realize they ’re getting substantially more value than what they ’re spending on that rental , ” said Snyder , who is also president of apartment manager R.A. Snyder Properties Inc. in San Diego .

But there could be some unseen risks behind these bargain shadow rentals .
Renters who got homes or condos on the cheap may find a sheriff knocking at the door with an eviction notice if their landlord fails to pay the mortgage .
“ Some investors will take any dollar amount to have any cash flow , ” Nadji said , noting that the rent often covers only a portion of the mortgage payment .
“ We ’re seeing a lot of tenants being displaced when landlords get foreclosed upon . ”
Meanwhile , renters in some of the costliest cities are n’t getting any relief , to their dismay .
Rents in pricey San Francisco surged 11.5 % last year , while New York rents shot up 9 % , and rents in San Jose climbed 8.7 % , Marcus & Millichap reported .

But if job losses continue to mount , rents even in the most robust markets could shrink while vacancies rise , Nadji said .
“ Employment has the closest correlation to rental absorption , ” he said .
“ Demand for studios and one - bedrooms is weak , while we ’re starting to see more demand for multi-bedroom , multi- bathroom units because people are doubling or tripling up to save money . ”

BRITONS have long been fairly sanguine about traditional forms of globalisation such as trade and international investment .
But the outsourcing of work formerly done in Britain to foreign countries has aroused fears , not least because it opens up the protected underbelly of services to international competition .
Until now hard evidence of its overall impact on the British economy has been elusive .
New research * should dispel most of the anxiety for those who prefer crunchy facts to scary myths .
Economists at Nottingham University 's Globalisation and Economic Policy Centre delved into the accounts of over 66,000 firms in order to trace the effects of offshoring .
Big companies with overseas affiliates are the most assiduous offshorers .
Accordingly , the study paid particular attention to 2,850 British multinationals with foreign subsidiaries .
The economists looked at the decade following the mid-1990s , a period in which offshoring increased by 35 % in manufacturing and 48 % in services .
Even after this impressive growth , it still accounted for less than 5 % of GDP in 2004 .
And despite the popular association of offshoring with Indian call - centres , only 4.5 % of the service - sector multinationals and 8 % of the manufacturers had subsidiaries in India or China .
Most international outsourcing is carried out in other developed economies , especially those within the European Union .
One of the main worries about offshoring is its effect on employment .
Some domestic jobs have certainly been discarded as a result : in 2005 offshoring accounted for 3.5 % of job losses .
But companies have also been able to produce more because offshoring has made them more competitive , and the resulting job gains have more than made up for the losses .
The authors reckon the surge in offshoring since the mid-1990s has created 100,000 extra jobs .
Another worry about offshoring , and globalisation more generally , is that it bears down on wages in developed economies .
The report finds no such impact in manufacturing but in the services sector offshoring has lowered average wages a bit .
This seems to reflect the fact that service employers are dispatching more skilled and well - paid work to foreign locations .
It is precisely this worry that has caused the flap about offshoring .
But wages have been shaved rather than shorn .
If offshoring were to continue growing at the same rate over the next ten years , the average wage paid in the services sector would fall by 2 % as a direct consequence .
This effect would be small compared with other factors affecting wages over the next decade , points out David Greenaway , one of the report 's authors .
Offshoring does create losers , most obviously those whose jobs disappear when business operations are shunted abroad .
But on balance it is good for the economy , making domestic firms more productive and generating jobs at home as well as abroad .
Just as trade delivers overall gains to developed economies by allowing them to specialise in activities in which they have a comparative advantage , so does offshoring .

" In the current conditions , with no one wanting war in Europe and with all of us having the experience of the 20th century , such an accord would have all the chances of success , " Mr Medvedev said .
MPs are calling for an investigation into allegations that British intelligence has " outsourced " the torture of British citizens to Pakistani security agencies after hearing accounts of people being abducted and subjected to mistreatment and , in some cases , released without charge .
John McDonnell , the Labour member for Hayes and Harlington , and Andrew Tyrie , Conservative member for Chichester , say the allegations should be examined by the Intelligence and Security Committee ( ISC ) , the Westminster body that oversees the Security Service , MI5 , and the Intelligence Service , MI6 .
In a statement to the Guardian , released via the Home Office , the Security Service insisted it did " not participate in , solicit , encourage or condone the use of torture " .
However , details of three new cases have raised concerns among MPs .
McDonnell says he wants to know whether British officials colluded in the abuse of one of his constituents .
The man , a medical student , said he was abducted at gunpoint in August 2005 and held for two months at the offices of Pakistan 's Intelligence Bureau opposite the British Deputy High Commission in Karachi .
The student , who has not spoken out before , has described how he was whipped , beaten , deprived of sleep , threatened with execution and witnessed other inmates being tortured .
He was questioned about the suicide attacks on London 's transport network in July of that year , and says that after being tortured by Pakistani agents he was questioned by British intelligence officers .
He was released to his father , who says he received a personal apology from the director of the Intelligence Bureau .
The student returned to his London teaching hospital , qualified last year , and is now working in a hospital in the south - east of England .
He remains terrified of both Pakistani and British intelligence agencies , however , and has asked not to be identified .
A second Briton , Tariq Mahmood , 35 , a taxi driver from Sparkhill , Birmingham , has said he was abducted in Rawalpindi in October 2003 and released without charge about five months later .
He is thought to have been held in a prison run by a different agency , Inter - Service Intelligence , where a number of other Britons have also been held and allegedly tortured before being flown to the UK to stand trial .
Mahmood 's family say he was tortured , and that MI5 officers and American intelligence officers had a hand in his mistreatment .
They have declined to issue any detailed allegation , however , apparently fearing for the safety of relatives in Pakistan .
A third Briton , Tahir Shah , 41 , an author from London , was held for 16 days in 2005 .
He says he was interrogated about the July 7 bombings in what he describes as " a fully - equipped torture chamber " , with mangles , whips and electrical equipment .
He says he was hooded and shackled for long periods and deprived of sleep .
He does not allege that British officials were involved , but believes it is unlikely they would not have been informed .
He was eventually bundled aboard a scheduled flight to Heathrow , where his passport was returned by an unnamed official whom he believes to have been from MI5 .
Allegations of collusion in torture could be examined by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal , established eight years ago with a remit to investigate complaints against MI5 and MI6 .
Another possibility is that the ISC could look into the claims .
McDonnell said of his constituent : " I believe that there is now sufficient evidence from this and other cases to demonstrate that British officials outsourced the torture of British nationals to a Pakistani intelligence agency .
" This warrants the fullest investigation by the ISC , which is best placed initially to undertake such an inquiry .
I would expect the government to cooperate fully with such an investigation and eventually for the prime minister to make a statement to parliament on how this practice has been allowed to develop and what action is to be taken . "
Tyrie , chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Extraordinary Rendition , added : " Any torture of British nationals by Pakistani authorities would be utterly unacceptable .
If credible allegations implicating British officials in such mistreatment have been made then they require investigation .
The ISC appears to be the most suitable body to examine these issues . "
Asked about the allegations , MI5 asked the Home Office to issue a statement which said : " The government unreservedly condemns the use of torture as a matter of fundamental principle and works hard with its international partners to eradicate this abhorrent practice worldwide .
" The Security and Intelligence Agencies do not participate in , solicit , encourage or condone the use of torture or inhumane or degrading treatment .
For reasons both ethical and legal , their policy is not to carry out any action which they know would result in torture or inhumane or degrading treatment .
" The ISC gave the Security Service a clean bill of health in its 2005 report on torture .
When Security Service personnel had come across instances when poor treatment of detainees was suspected , the report commended that MI5 officers notified the detaining authorities immediately and this was followed up with an official complaint from London .
" All Security Service staff have an awareness of the Human Rights Act 1998 , and are fully committed to complying with the requirements of the law when working in the UK and overseas . "
Earlier this year representatives of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch told another Commons body , the Foreign Affairs Committee , they believed British intelligence officers were colluding in torture .
Tom Porteous , London director of Human Rights Watch , told MPs : " It is pretty clear the US and the UK are relying rather heavily on the well - known abusive Pakistani intelligence agency , Inter - Services Intelligence , in the counter - terrorism operations .
It is one of the most brutal intelligence agencies in the world . "
He added that British interrogations of people being held by this agency " seem to amount to complicity and collusion in the mistreatment " .
In April the Guardian reported that four other British men , who had been detained in Pakistan during British - led counter - terrorism operations and held illegally for several months without access to a lawyer or court , had each alleged that British officials colluded in their torture .
Under the Criminal Justice
Act 1988 it is an offence for British officials to instigate or consent to the inflicting of " severe pain or suffering " on any person , anywhere in the world , or even to acquiesce in such treatment .
Any such offence could be punished by life imprisonment .
One of the four , Salahuddin Amin , 33 , a university graduate from Luton , later told the Old Bailey that he was interviewed by two MI5 officers several times in 10 months , in between being whipped , beaten with sticks , suspended from his wrists and threatened with an electric drill .
MI5 was permitted to give its response to the allegations in camera , with the media and the public excluded .
Allegations of collusion were raised at Amin 's appeal against conviction for terrorism offences last month , which was also heard largely in camera .
They are to be raised again later this year at the trial of a British man whose lawyers said he had three fingernails extracted while a prisoner of a Pakistani intelligence agency .
They say their client was then questioned by British intelligence officers .

Haskell has one primitive construct for enforcing strictness , .
The idea is that the first argument is evaluated to weak - head normal form ( WHNF ) , then the second argument is evaluated to WHNF and returned .
WHNF is reduction until the outermost bit is available - either a function value , or an outer constructor .
You can model the behaviour by introducing anfunction , in a lower - level language , and showing how to perform reduction :
Thefunction must return an evaluated argument , and it wants to returnwhich is not already evaluated , so it must make a recursive call .
Thefunction for , which simply returns its argument , is : Notice that even thoughdoes " nothing " , it still has to evaluate its argument .
Of course , is the same as , soperforms no additional work .
Haskell is lazy , so if an expression has already been evaluated , then thecall will be incredibly cheap , and just return the previous result .
So let 's consider the result of callingwith the same argument twice .
This time the second evaluation ofis skipped , asis already evaluated .
We can easily see that evaluation ofis exactly equivalent to .
This means that any code which writesis .
There is plenty of this code around , and one example ( which prompted me to write this ) is on slide 15 of this talk The other classicrelated mistake is .
Theoperator is for strict application , and is defined : For the particular instance of , we obtain .
Of course , all thatdoes is evaluate , so again there is no change from just writing
There are valid uses of , but any time you see either of the following constructs , you the programmer got it wrong :
While Ryan , James , and Mark have been pursing a minimalist design from a presentation perspective , I ’ve been quietly pursuing a minimalist design from a markup perspective .
I ’m not sure when it changed , but Firefox 3.0 , Safari 3.1.1 , and Opera 9.5 now all support units of em in SVG dimensions .
This means that my front page ( under development ) can be valid HTML5 and yet have absolutely no div or span elements , no inline style or class attributes , and no table or img elements used purely for layout purposes .
I have more work to do on individual post pages and on the archives .
The archives will continue to employ a table for the calendar .
What the Website Development Process Actually Looks Like in Practice
Did you know that there are more than 1.7 billion websites on the internet ?
So now , more than ever , it ’s crucial that your website is developed properly .
But for many people , developing a website is a daunting process .
But broken into steps , it ’s really not that complicated .
Keep reading to learn what the website development process looks like step by step .
Start with Identifying Goals
Before you design anything , you should identify the goals of your website .
What do you want it to do ?
What are the key performance indicators you ’ll use to judge its success ?
Also think about these questions :
Who is the main audience of this site ?
What information are they looking for ?
Is the goal to sell , generate leads , or educate ?
What competitors exist in the marketplace and how can you both differentiate and learn from them ?
Create the Sitemap and Wireframe
Next , it ’s time to get started on the details of your site .
Now that we know the goal , we can go deeper .
What pages do you want on your site ?
Common pages include a home page , about us page , product or service pages , and a contact us page .
But that ’s just the beginning .
Depending on your goals , you could have all kinds of other pages .
Then it ’s time to develop a wireframe .
This will help you know how the pages will interact with each other .
Develop the Content
It ’s common for people to now jump into the design of your website .
But do n’t forget that the copy is also just as important .
You should now work on creating the content .
Make sure you write the website ’s copy with search engine optimization ( SEO ) in mind .
This will ensure that your pages rank well on Google .
And remember that web users scan .
They do n’t want long paragraphs filled with intense vocabulary .
Keep things easy to read and quickly digest .
Work on the Visuals
We ’ve made it to the visuals .
What will your color scheme be ?
What fonts do you want to use ?
What overall vibe do you want ?
Minimalistic , modern , or experienced are just a few design inspirations you could go off of .
Think about what types of photography and illustrations you want as well .
These play a big part in communicating your message .
Time to Code
Now that you have the visual identity solidified , it ’s time to get to the last part of the website development process : coding .
You ’ll want to use HTML and CSS to get your pages exactly how you want them .
Also make sure you use responsive coding techniques so that your site will automatically resize to fit any size screen .
Want some development help ?
Check out a website development agency .
Soon you ’ll be ready to launch your website .
Finish the Website Development Process
Now that you ’ve read through the entire website development process , it ’s time to get started on your project .
Assess your current situation and then make a plan to improve .

Canadian Immigration Blinks on Use of FBI Database for US Peace Activists
by Ann Wright
On June 1 , U.S. peace activist Medea Benjamin , co-founder of Codepink women for Peace and Global Exchange , Diane Wilson , an environmental , jail reform and peace activist and I , a retired US Army Reserves Colonel and diplomat who resigned in March , 2003 in opposition to the Iraq war , attempted to enter Canada to attend a conference in Vancouver , Canada on women war resisters .
Diane Wilson , mother of five and grandmother of five , author of “ An Unreasonable Woman , ” which tells about her fight against the petro-chemical companies of the South Texas coast that polluted the bay where she was a shrimper , had not been to Canada since 1970 when she went AWOL from the US Army in opposition to the Vietnam war .
She stayed in Toronto , Canada for three months before returning to the United States and turning herself into the Army .
She had been an Army medic and had seen the horrors of war while working at an Army hospital in Texas and decided she could not work in any way to support the Vietnam War .
For her act of conscience , Diane received an undesirable discharge .
Diane has been arrested numerous times for environmental issues and for anti-war actions .
I had been denied entry to Canada twice in 2007 and Medea had been denied once in 2007 .
Canadian immigration told us that we were ineligible to enter Canada because of our arrests ( not convictions , just arrests ) for peaceful , non-violent protest Washington , DC in front of the White House and the US Congress , in New York at the US mission to the United Nations and the United Nations itself , in Crawford , Texas and San Francisco , California .
We were protesting President Bush ’s policies of the war in Iraq ( a war that successive Canadian governments have refused to join ) , extraordinary rendition and torture ( Canadian citizen Maher Arar was kidnapped by US government officials from JFK airport and flown to Syria where he was tortured for 9 months and to whom Canada paid $ 10 million for Canadian complicity in his kidnapping ) , illegal prisons and illegal eavesdropping , among many other crimes .
These arrests now appear on the FBI ’s National Crime Information Database , a data base that was created for recording serious felonies , parole violations , gang related crimes , sex offenders .
Misdemeanor violations for protest political policies are not listed as offenses to be recorded on the NCIC .
Canadian immigration has been using the NCIC data base to determine eligibility to enter Canada and has denied a number of anti-war activists entry to Canada from information contained on the data base .
Many Canadian parliamentarians have been very concerned about their immigration service using the FBI ’s politically tainted data base and invited Medea and myself in October , 2007 to attend a parliamentary conference to discuss the database .
Canadian Immigration at the Ottawa International Airport refused me entry to Canada despite the letter of invitation from the parliamentarians and despite their presence outside the arrivals hall at the airport .
( Medea had been arrested the previous day in the US Congress and was unable to go on the trip . )
On June 1 , Canadian parliamentarian Libby Davies , drove to the US side of the border and rode in the same van as Medea and I .
Diane went ahead in a different car and was not stopped by immigration despite her numerous arrests .
Parliamentarian Davies told the immigration officers that she had knowledge of our peaceful , non-violent protests of Bush administration policies and vouched for our character .
During three hours at the border , immigration officers made phone calls to various offices .
At the end of the process , Medea was given a 24 hour visitors permit and I received an exception to my earlier exclusion order , apparently from a high official in the Ministry of Immigration .
The next day , June 2 , Veterans for Peace ( VFP ) national president Elliot Adams and VFP member Will Cover , drove from New York to Ottawa to observe the vote of the Canadian parliament on the non-binding resolution that would allow US war resisters to stay in Canada .
After being asked at the border crossing if either had ever been arrested , they both acknowledged that they had been arrested for protesting Bush policies on the war in Iraq .
They were further questioned in secondary screening about the character of the protests and arrests , and after two hours , were allowed to continue into Canada .
They drove on to Ottawa and attended the 137to 110 Parliamentary non-binding vote to permit US war resisters to remain in Canada .
The border crossing by two groups of high profile anti-war activists with arrest records in a two day period , both dealing with the issue of US war resisters in Canada , may indicate a change in the position of the Canadian immigration service on misdemeanor arrests for political protest in the United States .
We hope so , as we pose no threat to Canadian security and indeed our actions in the United States for which we were arrested seem to reflect the views of most Canadians that the war in Iraq should end and that US war resisters should be able to stay in their country .
The Ottawa - based International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group ( CLMG ) has set up an action - research clearinghouse on border controls and watch lists to investigate and document cases related to the creation of no - fly lists and other watch lists that impact on civil liberties , right to privacy and mobility rights for all travelers , including peace activists .
CLMG would like to hear from anyone who has had trouble entering Canada because of arrests for political protests in the United States .
Their website , http://www.travelwatchlist.ca, will be active on June 18 , 2008 and will have a toll - free number .
Please contact CLMG if you have had travel problems into Canada based on political activism .

Any mother can tell you the benefits of breastfeeding , but scientists recently discovered stem cells in human breast milk .
Stem cell research and treatments using embryonic stem cells , which are more versatile than adult stem cells , is controversial .
An embryonic stem cell can produce cells for almost any tissue in the body , whereas adult stem cells are more specific to blood and skin types .
The discovery of stem cells in breast milk may alleviate the controversy of using embryonic stem cells , if breast milk stem cells behave in the same versatile manner .
Stem cell research shows they are promising at treating spinal injuries , diabetes and Parkinson ’s disease .
Perth scientist Dr Mark Cregan made the world ’s first discovery of breast milk stem cells .
He believes this is just the tip of the iceberg in discovering the benefits and potency of baby ’s first food .
It is setting the baby up for the perfect development .
We already know that babies who are breast fed have an IQ advantage and that there ’s a raft of other health benefits .
Researchers also believe that the protective effects of being breast fed continue well into adult life .
The point is that many mothers see milks as identical – formula milk and breast milk look the same so they must be the same .
But we know now that they are quite different and a lot of the effects of breast milk versus formula do n’t become apparent for decades .
Formula companies have focussed on matching breast milk ’s nutritional qualities but formula can never provide the developmental guidance .
After testing cultured breast milk cells , Dr. Cregan discovered the stem cell marker nestin .
Early indication is that these cells can be reprogrammed to form many types of human tissue , and breast milk stem cells have all of the physical properties of embryonic stem cells , without the ethical issues of harvesting .
Breast milk really is the perfect food for infants , and it may even prove to cure many illnesses and diseases plaguing the human race .

He has people read his emails and filter through ones that have merit .
So , I can bet he gets a briefing on the ones that are worthy of his attention and I can more then bet he will get the message from this .
This move is bad .
So what if it affects only 1 % .
No need making the other 99 feeling like they are getting less now .
So , there 's nothing stopping them from leaving a company who has the perception of having the worst CS , no longer best bank for the buck .
But those of us who use Sprint are too blame .
We have " expected " them to be the cheapest and they are .
Now , they should raise prices to match all of VZW 's , take that extra money and fix the rest of CS and let the chips fall where they may .
Sadly , this will more then likely lead to more churn and more layoffs and less money for the network .
Before long , Sprint will be Spent .
End of story .

Gee PNH says something meaningful .
( Takes print screen ) .
I guess this would , as you said , be a change and allow customers to breach their contracts .
That is the LAST THING Sprint needs .
I mean this was their ONE POSITIVE marketing tool .
Unlike the other guys , we have no caps .
Now , they are just one in the same competing .
Way to go numbskulls .
You 've successfully killed off the reason why I actually liked you guys .
If they keep this , I WILL look for another provider after being with you for 10 years .

A legal VALID way of terminating yer contract !
So , what is this really saying ???
A ) Sprint wants the " leechers " off to " normalize the network " , or
B ) Sprint 's network is not up to snuff , and thus , killing " leechers " is the " easy way out " ????
What 's up with this ?
Sprint ( fill in yer own co_____ ) says " We will charge you $ xx.xx per month for a certain speed cap , with UNLIMITED use ....
Yet now we get popped for using what we pay for ???!!?
I love the " easy way out " of a contract ... just suck it all for it 's worth !
Oh BTW , make sure ya look at the " early termination " clause !!!!!!!
" OK , Mr. Smith , you have violated our ( new ) TOS ....
As a result , we are terminating your contract , and furthermore , since your contract was terminated prior to your agreed upon term , we we 'll charge you a sweet exit fee ..... "
Do companies like this really desire customer retention ??
Or are they going to alienate 50 % to rid themselves of the 5 % of the customers who actually USE the BW they pay for ???
Unfortunately , they KNOW that the other 45 % just surf and Email and unfortunately , perhaps unknowingly , are paying $ $$ for BW they COULD be using , but do n't .
While the people who pay the $ $$ for the BW and USE it , are fugged !!!

Credit card machines ?
Then I assume your clients are businesses .
Then they should get a business account with an SLA and the 5 GB limit should not be a problem .
Credit card machines hardly need broadband .
They work fine on 300 bps dialup links .
Just get an n-way line - sharing device and a POTS line or two .
No need for uselss SLAs .

The service is called Sprint Mobile Broadband Connection .
Not Sprint Rural Home Broadband Connection .
These rural folks using this as a home connection probably had a hand in killing this off .

They do n't care about 2 or 3 people hogging a tower out in the boondocks .
However , i'm sure they do care about 15 + people eating up a tower in a city such as Chicago , which is where they need to control bandwidth , as most of those towers only have 2 T1 's worth of backhaul at most .
There are plenty of people who use this as both their home and mobile connection in urban areas , my boss being one .
Either case , 5 GB is ridiculous , they 're just becoming followers .
At least be a little different and try 10 ?
Now it 's REALLY becoming a ripoff at 59.99 / month ( or 61 + after tax ) .

Wait , what makes you think they only have a few T1's ?
I only ask because most of the ones I have seen either have a microwave repeater on them for backhaul , or are hooked up to the PSTN directly at the tower via a CO / Switch , or remote switch , and those are fed by fiber in most cases , or again by microwave ...
What phone company were you talking about ?
I want to know so I do n't make the mistake of buying their service one day ...

Why bash the ' rural folks ' ?
We have just as much right to have broadband as the next guy .
If they advertise the service as a " broadband connection " , how is it not able to be used at your home for the main connection to the internet ?
I use Alltel as my main connection , and as the only connection I 'll most likely ever see out here .
We 're not all as privileged as you are in the cities .
Hell , many city folks do n't have that many options either .

when i checked this out in the store the salesman told me that sprint has no problem with it being used as a home dedicated connection .
They market it as a dsl / cable alternative in the local sprint store .
So this is not just a rural killed it thing .
But thank god for a good wisp opening up in our area or we would have had nothing now that sprint is going this route .

Exactly the same .
In fact , I bet if you dig deep , the same people set on the boards that make up these decisions ..
This is it , landline buildout must be mandatory and 200gig cap acceptable cap for todays technology , but reviewable for future requirements due to higher richer media content ..
New definition of rural , and non profitable areas is if you can't get cell service your rural , and if you can drive for more than one exact minute at 35 miles an hour without seeing another house then your rural .
Everyone else needs build out service .

I have no use for EVDO or for most of what Sprint or any other Cell Phone carrier / service " offers " because
1 . The service is just too little for too much
2 . Is NOT what they advertise - always fall short of their claims
3. Restrictions - CAPS - Always in favor of the provider .
Tired of the " Thou shalt not " terms resulting in ETF penalty .
They can keep their texting service , internet cruising GPS MP3 et al .
Just provide decent clear stable voice service - a readily accessible voicemail service , accurate billing for service rendered .
Cut out the BS with the surcharges non regulatory fees .
Spell them out upfront instead of deceitfully hiding them via their outlandish TOS .
In short : Offer a good product . , price it fairly and be honest .
I know too much to ask for an American corporation .

No caps , only reason I use it I have Sprint as my voice and data carrier because they did not have data caps .
Generally , I 'm happy with the data service .
But this is a good reason to cancel .
After several quarters of bleeding customers , Sprint should avoid a move like this .
The upside for imposing caps has got to be minimal .
If it 's really just 1 % of their users who are getting a free ride , who cares ?
You 'll definitely lose more customers from this move .
This announcement is another nail in their coffin .

@xo.net davisjr Anon
We will have to wait and see Since we are all just assuming what Sprint 's final policy may be let 's not get our undies in a bind just yet .
Depending on how the caps are implemented they may actually be a good thing .
If the caps are added to voice plans , like the Simply Everything plan then that could leave the network available to people that pay way more for the Broadband Access Cards for their laptops .
For example the EvDO add - on for voice plans is only $ 15 / month , but people with PDA 's can tether their phones to their laptops ( at least I can with my HTC Touch ) and if people do that and use up loads of bandwidth then Sprint is losing money .
This policy could just force those people to actually pay for what they are going to use .

I will just add the BroadBand Access to my Verizon account and be done with it -- 1 company , reliability and the same ol ' rules to be done .
After all , I will have a 30 - day worry free guarantee ... so if it does n't work out , I will just cancel the service .
Edit :
It does make me wonder if they can actually impose these new restrictions on existing contractual customers .
After all , they would have to send out a notice , and give them 30 - 60 days to respond to either accept or deny the new contractual terms .
Personally , if it were me , I would not accept it , and terminate service .
Too many people do this , and perhaps the new CEO would say " Maybe this was n't such a good idea ... let 's try upping the cap , or keep it removed all together . "
Customers are # 1 Priority -- not when it comes to investors and the falling rate of the American Dollar .

Red Cross says Bush and others may be guilty of war crimes
Lately a few different trains of thought have been converging to English .
Anglophone Orientalists
As the backlog makes clear , I ’ve been thinking about what kind of scholar or professional I could be ; it ’s a decision that I was glad to postpone , but sorosoro I think it ’s about time to start narrowing .
Then it suddently struck me what kind of Orientalist I ’ll become : an English - speaking Orientalist .
So far my academic modus operandi have been like this : I ’m asked to write an essay on $ topic ;
I search for $ topic on JSTOR , MUSE , google books , amazon , local libraries ( all primarily English material ) ;
I read everything that seems interesting ;
I plagiarize copy jumble together analyse the literature and synthetize a well - researched scholarly essay .
Now you might be thinking this is dans l’ordre des choses for 21st - century academics worldwide , and I agree ; but not here , no .
Not all teachers can read English effortlessly and not all research from such material ; and the percentage drops even further among classmates .
No one ever teaches the students about JSTOR or scholar .
google ; I arrived at such tools naturally due to being an English - speaking dude on the Internet .
Consequently , the ideas I steal bring to class are often surprising and fresh to the audience .
True , my teachers have access to even more ( and , arguably , better ) material directly from Japanese .
But reading English , a purely accidental skill , has given me an edge over many of my peers in research efforts .
( I ca n’t write it very well , and I ’m even worse at live conversation ; but oh yes I can read English .
I know my Chomskian friends will find this claim absurd ( not to mention the Sausurreans ) , but I ’d go as far as saying I can read English better than Portuguese — at the very least , I ’m certain that translations to English are easier and more fluid for me than the equivalent translations to Portuguese , even when the source language is very close to Portuguese ( like French or Italian ) ) .
What I then realized is that , if your intellectual growth is shaped by your sources , then it must be shaped , at a higher level , by the languages you know .
I ’ve talked before of my affair with the French semiotics of Greimas ( a completely different beast than the English semiotics of Peirce and Eco ) , and of how surprised I was to find little to no impact of it on the English - speaking academia .
Now the only reason I know about Greimas is another accident of history ; when my college was established French was still the prestige language for humanities , and the first teachers were brought in from France , and they had a profound influence that has lasted to this day .
Now just like ( some of ) my lit teacher ’s ideas on literary criticism were built on top of — in several important ways , were consequences of — their skill in navigating French - language waters , my own ideas as a Japanese studies guy result mainly from my familiar , abundant , easily accessible English sources , and there ’s no going around it .
Such is our life in the perifery ; we often talk of the autonomy of simulacra , but when you ’re a simulacrum it makes a lot of difference what you ’re a simulacrum of .
What ’s more , the desire for relevance and authenticity , the desire to move closer to the center is irresistible .
I ’d like to be part of the English - speaking circle of Orientalists more than the local circle , if I can get away with it .
Surely it would be much more rewarding to be published in Monumenta than in Estudos Japoneses .
English : a handicap , a paradigm I ’ve been musing ( again ) on the disappointing pace of my progress with Japanese .
I decided to be analytic about it :
What am I doing that improves my Japanese , and can I do more of it ?
What am I doing that does n’t , and can I stop doing it ?
That line of thinking made me realize that the single most significant obstacle to my Japanese learning is my knowledge of English .
We often make fun of native monolingual English speakers and their difficulty in acquiring even the basics of new languages ( “ What do you call someone who speakings two languages ?
Bilingual .
Many languages ?
Polyglot .
One language ?
Anglophone . ” )
The reason , of course , is not that English somehow impairs the mind for language acquisition , but that they can get away with it , and mental inertia is a powerful force .
Everyone speaks English ; everything is published in English — or , rather , for any topic you can think of , there ’s enough English material to keep one busy for a lifetime .
Today it ’s perfectly doable to be , say , a scholar of Japan without knowing Japanese .
I ’m not saying it ’s a good way of going about it , but I think it ’s possible ; you could read literally hundreds of books on Japanese society , culture , literature , religion &c. without ever leaving the safety of the lingua franca , and surely after that one must have one or two interesting things to say about it .
I do n’t like this idea , though ; you ’d be caught in cultural framing , not only from the translations themselves but from the very choice of what gets to be translated .
And , unless I consciously do something about it , I ’m headed straight into that trap .
In other words : okay , so if English is your L1 , you have less incentive to acquire and practice your L2…LN .
But , for the same reasons , if English is your L2 , you have less incentive to acquire L3 … LN .
And English is the L2 of like everyone in the world .
Those anglophone jokes are a global problem .
But , but .
There ’s another angle of approach to the same object .
“ What am I doing that does improve my Japanese ” — of all the competing theories of language learning , what has been tried and true to work for me specifically ?
And I happen to have a case study at hand .
How did I came to learn English in the first place ?
Can I reproduce the same methods with the L3 ?
Off the top of my head :
There were no flashcards .
Also no grammar study , no institutions , no classes , ever .
There were huge amounts of reading .
And the reading was graded ; first videogames and comics , then light fiction , then academic textbooks .
I recall not playing Might & Magic for the Mega Drive because the text was way over my head ; I recall Fairy Tale was just right in the same time period .
On the other hand , I could always produce an acoustic image from a written English word ( even though it was often wrong ) .
English text is easier to get a handle of than kanji .
Also , I ’m now an adult , and as such I have a lot less interest on videogames and anime and a lot more on adult texts , which are harder to crack .
( side note : could this be part of the “ critical period ” mystique ? )
Most of the time it felt like goofing off .
It just so happened that the sites I wanted to procrastinate in were written in English .
I ’m conflicted about dictionaries .
I recall carrying them around and consulting every single word ; I recall being called a “ dictionary kid ” , and Mom bragging to people that I learned English from dictionaries .
But I also recall chosing not to use dictionaries , wanting only to enjoy the game or story ; I recall not understanding everything & not caring about it .
Perhaps there was a dictionary period , and a just - play period .
Perhaps they alternated .
to use dictionaries , wanting only to enjoy the game or story ; I recall not understanding everything & not caring about it .

English was the quirky lady who appears out of thin air one night & invites you to her place & becomes the fuck - buddy you adore & before you can even think “ what the hell was that all about ” you ’re watching Dr. Who reruns late at night on her sofa .
Which is to say , it crashed ( or krashend ( har har ) ) in my life like a meteor , & I ’m profoundly grateful for it .
We currently think of skills as a result of volition ; we become doctors because we wanted very hard to be doctors , and so on .
But I think that notion would be weird for past societies .
Most people knew how to do stuff that they had no know ; it was n’t a matter of choice ( even my grandma never quite grokked the concept of doing something because you like doing it ) .
Is it possible to have the best of the two worlds ; to consciously create a kind of life where you have no choice but to acquire the skill you wanted ?
The gods granted me English as a gift ; can I manipulate or please them into giving more ?
( Mental remark : read more Tim Ingold on skills . )
Currently I ’ve stopped with flashcards in favor of such things as grappling with classical texts and annotated anthologies ; it ’s been pleasant so far , but let ’s see whether it sticks .
SAN FRANCISCO 
The federal Fish and Wildlife Service this week underscored the imminent threat of extinction facing the delta smelt , a two - inch - long fish native to the Sacramento River delta , when it announced it was considering whether to declare the fish endangered .
California is in a quandary because two - thirds of its residents get water through the pumps that have been killing large numbers of smelt .
This year , for the first time , a federal judge ’s order kept state and federal water agencies from collecting their usual part of the river water flowing from melting snow from the Sierra Nevada .
Water users from the Bay Area to San Diego were affected by the resulting reductions of 20 percent to 30 percent .
This is taking place after a spring that has been one of the driest on record , leaving even less water for the fiercely competitive interests fighting for a share of a dear commodity .
“ A comprehensive approach to conserving this fish is going to require onerous restrictions in pumping , ” said Timothy Quinn , director of the Association of California Water Agencies .

GMA asks Cindy McCain : Would you feel ' safe ' with President Obama ?
David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday June 19 , 2008
|
Print This Email This A Good Morning America interview with Cindy McCain Thursday featured questions that could have been hand - crafted by the Republican National Committee .
Interviewer Kate Snow seemed determined to undercut Barack Obama 's national security credentials and his wife 's patriotism .
" Would you feel safe with Barack Obama as your president ? "
Snow asked .
Now , it 's difficult to imagine Michelle Obama facing the same question about the Republican presidential nominee , despite the fact that it 's John McCain who has joked about bombing another country and is callous about the prospect of occupying Iraq indefinitely .
To her credit , Cindy McCain did n't unleash the kind of partisan vitriol that might have come from another of her husband 's surrogates ( Giuliani perhaps ) .
At the same time though , she stayed off the high road and did n't outright answer in the affirmative .
" I would feel safe with my husband as president , " she said .
" I think Barack Obama is a fine man .
I think Michelle Obama is a fine woman .
This is about who would better , and I think my husband would be better . "
Moving on , Snow revisited the right - wing 's all - time favorite Michelle Obama gaffe .
" Were you insulted when Michelle Obama said she 's proud of her country for the first time ? "
Snow asked , replaying video from the infamous Wisconsin appearance , without noting that the quote was from February nor any of Michelle Obama 's subsequent explanations of what she meant .
While even first lady Laura Bush was willing to acknowledge that Obama probably just misspoke , here Cindy McCain was less gracious .
As she did four months ago , McCain again went after her Democratic counterpart .
" Everyone has their own experience ; I do n't know why she said what she said , " McCain told Snow .
" All I know is that I 've always been proud of my country . "
The Good Morning America interview was recorded Wednesday , a day after Obama said he was disappointed in John McCain 's refusal to condemn attacks on his spouse .
Instead of declaring the candidates ' wives off limits , the McCain campaign falsely accused the Democratic party of attacking Cindy , then sent Cindy out to attack Michelle .
( In damage - control mode , Cindy insisted to CNN that her Good Morning America interview was not a planned political attack . )
Of course , if the media keep rehashing the same four - month - old quote all the way to November , the McCain campaign wo n't need much help making Michelle Obama look bad .

The Home Affairs Committee has called on the government to follow a " minimum data , held for the minumum time " approach to British citizens ' personal information in its long - awaited report into surveillance .
The Committee has decided , after a year long investigation , that the UK is not becoming a surveillance society but warns that function creep still poses a danger .
That said , it did not look at ID cards but warned that function creep could again raise concerns of increased surveillance of citizens .
After recent government data losses it demanded the Home Office show more detailed plans for how it will make the National Identity Register secure .
It expressed particular concerns that increasing use of databases to store information on children could be used for predictive profiling , with the state singling out children deemed by computers to be likely future criminals .
On Home Office use of databases and sharing data the committee said there were three questions to be answered : " Where should the balance between protecting the public and preserving individual freedom lie ?
How should this balance shift according to the seriousness of the crime ?
What impact will this have on the individual and on our society as a whole ? "
The politicians also suggested a broader role for the Information Commissioner 's Office .
The ICO should provide Parliament with an annual report on UK surveillance .
It should provide resources to work with the government 's chief information officer to improve privacy protection .
The committee supported the ICO 's demand for better inspection and audit powers .
The ICO could also have a role in carrying out " Privacy Impact Assessments " to be carried out before the Home Office starts a new information gathering project or extends an existing project .
PIAs would look at risks and would aim to put in place some protection while the project was being designed .
The committee noted that procedures around who can access such information were as important as technology in keeping data safe .
On CCTV use the committee asked the Home Office to carry out more research to show whether or not its use has any impact on reducing crime .
It called for a debate before any expansion of the national DNA database and primary legislation to regulate its use .
The committee said it was concerned about the HMP Woodhill case - where conversations between an MP and his constituent were recorded in breach of the Wilson doctrine .
The talking shop also looked at the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act .
It wants the Home Office to raise public awareness of how and when communications data could be collected and used .
It said it had serious concerns about the use of the Act for minor crimes .
The Home Office should make a public statement when a new organisation gets RIPA authorisation , it said .
Such suggestions are moot because the Government is expected to introduce legislation to replace RIPA in the next session of Parliament .
We 'll have to wait and see whether Gordon Brown and Jacqui Smith accept any of the other suggestions . ®
ナノ素材として期待がかかるカーボンナノチューブだが、ある種のチューブを吸引した場合、アスベスト（石綿）と同様に作用し、悪性中皮腫を引き起こす可能性がある――英・米の研究者らが5月20日、このような研究結果を発表した。
長繊維状のカーボンナノチューブは、構造がアスベストファイバーの構造と似ているだけでなく、その作用も酷似しているという結果が出たという。
英エディンバラ大学のケネス・ドナルドソン教授らは、長繊維状と短繊維状のカーボンナノチューブ、長繊維状と短繊維状のアスベストファイバーを、それぞれマウスの腹腔に注入した。その結果、長繊維状のカーボンナノチューブは、長繊維状のアスベストファイバーと同様の作用を示した。長繊維状のアスベストファイバーは肺に深く浸透し、長さがあるために肺の自浄作用で除去することができず、肺がんや悪性中皮腫を引き起こしてしまう。
ただし、大気中のカーボンナノチューブが吸入可能かどうか、吸入された場合肺まで届くかどうかなどは分かっていない。また短繊維状のチューブや湾曲したチューブにはアスベストのような働きは確認できなかった。研究者らは、カーボンナノチューブの安全性について、今後さらに研究が必要だとしている。
約20年前に発見されたカーボンナノチューブは、プラスチックのように軽量で鋼鉄のように強靭なことから、新薬や電池、エレクトロニクスなどさまざまな分野で活用されている。しかし発見当初から、ナノチューブの安全性を懸念する声があった。Chemical & Engineering Newsによると、カーボンナノチューブ市場は向こう4〜7年で、20億ドル規模に達する見通しという。

In evidence to a court in Equatorial Guinea yesterday , the British mercenary Simon Mann said Mark Thatcher , the son of the former prime minister , was a committed member of the group that organised the attempted coup in the oil - rich west African state in 2004 .
Giving his first detailed account , he said Thatcher " was not just an investor , he came completely on board and became a part of the management team " .
Thatcher had provided $ 350,000 ( £ 178,000 ) .
Mann also claimed that Spain and South Africa , including President Thabo Mbeki , had supported the plot .
By January 2004 , two months before the action , he said " it was like an official operation .
The governments of Spain and South Africa were giving the green light : ' You 've got to do it ' . "
Spain , he said , was prepared to recognise the new government the day after the coup and send in lots of military police .
Outside the court the Spanish ambassador , Javier Sangro , said he had no comment .
Senior members of the Equatorial Guinea army , police and cabinet were also implicated , said Mann .
Tacit approval for regime change came from the Pentagon , the CIA and the big US oil companies .
Their message , conveyed by a colleague who discreetly tested the waters in Washington , was that " the political situation in Equatorial Guinea was very unsatisfactory and very dangerous and that a well - conducted change of government would be welcomed " , he said .
At the end of a four - hour examination , Mann made a plea for clemency after the prosecution recommended on Tuesday that he serve a prison sentence of 32 years .
" I am very sorry for what I did in 2003 and 2004 .
I am also very happy that we failed , that it did n't work , especially now that I am here and I 've met you all . "
Referring to his incarceration in Zimbabwe after being arrested with a plane load of mercenaries en route to Malabo , the capital of Equatorial Guinea , he said : " I 've been in prison for four years and I 'm not the same man that I was . "
Although he delivered his story with humour , emphatic gestures and some relish , he was clearly suffering from his hernia problem , gripping his lower abdomen .
After two hours he was allowed to sit .
The name of Lady Thatcher 's son cropped up when Mann was asked about planning meetings in South Africa , where Mann and Thatcher lived at the time .
Thatcher , who now lives in southern Spain , accepted a plea bargain from the South African authorities in 2005 after he admitted helping to finance a helicopter which he suspected " might be used for mercenary activities " .
He was fined $ 450,000 and given a four - year suspended sentence .
He has refused to elaborate on his role .
The Equatorial Guinea government has tried to get an international warrant for his arrest .
In the months before the coup , Mann said Thatcher attended many meetings " because at this stage he came on board " .
He took Thatcher to the Chelsea home of Ely Calil , the Lebanese businessman who is alleged to have been the main financier .
He named the management board as Calil , himself , a London property developer , Thatcher and a Lebanese colleague of Calil , who lives in Beirut .
Calil has always denied involvement .
Thatcher 's money was eventually used to buy a small plane to transport the provisional president , Severo Moto , from his exile in Spain to Malabo .
Mann said Calil had initially asked him in May 2003 to assassinate President Obiang and launch a guerrilla war or a coup .
He accepted he was doing the job for money - said to be $ 15 m - but he claimed he was told that the oil money was not reaching the people .
" I believed it was right . "
He said Calil had wanted to meet him because of his experience in Angola and Sierra Leone , where he had worked with both governments against rebels during the 1990s with a South African - based mercenary outfit , Executive Outcomes .
" Calil said to me you do n't need 80 men , you can do it with eight . "
Calil , he said , was getting intelligence from people very close to President Obiang .
Calil only had to pick up the phone to find out the president 's movements .
Plan A , he said , was to contact Calil after his mercenary force had left Harare , where they would pick up their weapons .
" It would allow Calil to initiate a palace coup and that when we arrived we would be not shooting but shaking hands . "
Plan B involved arresting the president and securing strategic points in the capital , which he admitted could have meant people would be killed .
The hearing continues .
Do you want the kind of body that burns fat even in your sleep ?
There is a simple solution to this – just rev up your metabolism .
If you already know that , then it ’s okay .
But are you following the mandatory things to make sure your internal fat burning furnace stays on for 24 hours ?
Nutrition tips to rev up your metabolism :
1 . Have three full meals a day and also include 2 - 3 snacks .
Balance is the key .
Consume enough proteins , lots of fruits and vegetables and a small amount of fat .
If your balance is out of whack , you are going to be out of whack too .
With proper practice , you will achieve the right balance [ Boost metabolism naturally ] .
2. Purchase foods that can remember where they came from .
Avoid consuming processed junk or convenience foods .
3 . Prepare nutritious meals that can be stored for few days .
Keep enough food in your refrigerator or cooler at your work and also at home .
Purchase a box of nutrition bars or power bars to eat when you are extra busy .
Store them in your gym bag , desk drawer and coat pockets .
4 . Have a regular check up of your blood sugar and avoid sugar cravings by making absolutely sure that you are having enough proteins [ Protein diet ] .
5 . Always remember that your body is only as good as the things you give it .
6. Read all the labels before you purchase the products .
Keep sugar levels low , about 10 % of the carbohydrate grams .
For instance , if you purchase 20 grams of carbohydrates then there should be only 2 grams of sugar .
7. Consuming enough vitamins and minerals help you use the food you eat more efficiently .
They help in the process of digestion and assimilation of your food and you can also get an added nutritional boost that your diet is lacking .
8. Scrap diet sodas and caffeine .
In order to fight fatigue , you need to drink enough water .
Drinking more and more water helps you lose weight , enhance fat burning , control appetite and clean your system [ Water diet ] .
9 . If you go out to eat , eat only half of what you get .
Most of the restaurants offer you twice as much as you need .
Instead of a salad , choose dressing on the side .
10 .
Prepare your menu that can help in changing your energy needs depending on the activity level .
That means there ’s no need to count the calories , instead of this you need to naturally pay attention to what your body needs from day - to - day .
11 . Follow step 1 in order to keep your energy and metabolism humming .
Work out tips to rev up your metabolism :
12 . Try aerobic training workouts .
Switch activities every couple of weeks , so your body has to work at re-learning another activity , which burns some more calories [ Effective ways to increase metabolic rate ] .
For instance , swap cycling for the Stairmaster one month .
13 . Come out of the “ maintain ” frame of mind .
Finally this causes trouble for most people .
If you think that once you ’ve reached a certain level of conditioning you can back off , then you ’re in for a rude awakening .
Your body will love it and will begin to start shutting down .
This finally results in a slow gradual loss of muscle and metabolism and a slow gradual increase of body fat .
14 . Consuming enough iron is first and foremost important .
Iron causes the built up of most metabolically active tissues .
15 .
The quick route for muscular development is testing and pushing your muscles to the max .
When you assume that you have finished and you want to do more then you can do it .
No wimps are allowed .
16 . Muscles are not built at the gym , they can be built only when they are given time to rest and recuperate .
But they cannot do that if you are getting 4 - 5 hours of sleep a night and stressing out on a daily basis .
You must follow a sound nutritional plan to help you recover faster between the workouts .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Today 's economic condition could likely be seen as " the most wrenching since the end of the second world war , " wrote former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan in the Financial Times on Monday .
The U.S. financial crisis wo n't end until housing prices stabilize , but that wo n't happen for months , wrote Greenspan .
The models used by the finance industry to determine risk and measure economic strength are too simple to fully account for human responses , he said .
" We cannot hope to anticipate the specifics of future crises with any degree of confidence , " he wrote .
However , Greenspan said that he hoped the fallout would not take away the finance industry 's ability to regulate itself .
Market flexibility and free competition are the most reliable safeguards against economic trouble , he said ; the system which is supposed to guard against unanticipated losses will need to be overhauled .
Whoever it was probably lived a few thousand years ago , somewhere in East Asia – Taiwan , Malaysia and Siberia all are likely locations .
He or she did nothing more remarkable than be born , live , have children and die .
Yet this was the ancestor of every person now living on Earth – the last person in history whose family tree branches out to touch all 6.5 billion people on the planet today .
That means everybody on Earth descends from somebody who was around as recently as the reign of Tutankhamen , maybe even during the Golden Age of ancient Greece .
There 's even a chance that our last shared ancestor lived at the time of Christ .
" It 's a mathematical certainty that that person existed , " said Steve Olson , whose 2002 book Mapping Human History traces the history of the species since its origins in Africa more than 100,000 years ago .
It is human nature to wonder about our ancestors – who they were , where they lived , what they were like .
People trace their genealogy , collect antiques and visit historical sites hoping to capture just a glimpse of those who came before , to locate themselves in the sweep of history and position themselves in the web of human existence .
But few people realize just how intricately that web connects them not just to people living on the planet today , but to everyone who ever lived .
With the help of a statistician , a computer scientist and a supercomputer , Olson has calculated just how interconnected the human family tree is .
You would have to go back in time only 2,000 to 5,000 years – and probably on the low side of that range – to find somebody who could count every person alive today as a descendant .
Furthermore , Olson and his colleagues have found that if you go back a little farther – about 5,000 to 7,000 years ago – everybody living today has exactly the same set of ancestors .
In other words , every person who was alive at that time is either an ancestor to all 6 billion people living today , or their line died out and they have no remaining descendants .
That revelation is " especially startling , " statistician Jotun Hein of England 's Oxford University wrote in a commentary on the research published by the journal Nature .
" Had you entered any village on Earth in around 3,000 B.C. , the first person you would have met would probably be your ancestor , " Hein marveled .
It also means that all of us have ancestors of every color and creed .
Every Palestinian suicide bomber has Jews in his past .
Every Sunni Muslim in Iraq is descended from at least one Shiite .
And every Klansman 's family has African roots .
How can this be ?
It 's simple math .
Every person has two parents , four grandparents and eight great - grandparents .
Keep doubling back through the generations – 16 , 32 , 64 , 128 – and within a few hundred years you have thousands of ancestors .
It 's nothing more than exponential growth combined with the facts of life .
By the 15th century you 've got a million ancestors .
By the 13th you 've got a billion .
Sometime around the 9th century – just 40 generations ago – the number tops a trillion .
But wait .
How could anybody – much less everybody – alive today have had a trillion ancestors living during the 9th century ?
The answer is , they did n't .
Imagine there was a man living 1,200 years ago whose daughter was your mother 's 36th great - grandmother , and whose son was your father 's 36th great - grandfather .
That would put him on two branches on your family tree , one on your mother 's side and one on your father's .
In fact , most of the people who lived 1,200 years ago appear not twice , but thousands of times on our family trees , because there were only 200 million people on Earth back then .
Simple division – a trillion divided by 200 million – shows that on average each person back then would appear 5,000 times on the family tree of every single individual living today .
But things are never average .
Many of the people who were alive in the year 800 never had children ; they do n't appear on anybody 's family tree .
Meanwhile , more prolific members of society would show up many more than 5,000 times on a lot of people 's trees .
Keep going back in time , and there are fewer and fewer people available to put on more and more branches of the 6.5 billion family trees of people living today .
It is mathematically inevitable that at some point , there will be a person who appears at least once on everybody 's tree .
But do n't stop there ; keep going back .
As the number of potential ancestors dwindles and the number of branches explodes there comes a time when every single person on Earth is an ancestor to all of us , except the ones who never had children or whose lines eventually died out .
And it was n't all that long ago .
When you walk through an exhibit of Ancient Egyptian art from the time of the pyramids , everything there was very likely created by one of your ancestors – every statue , every hieroglyph , every gold necklace .
If there is a mummy lying in the center of the room , that person was almost certainly your ancestor , too .
It means when Muslims , Jews or Christians claim to be children of Abraham , they are all bound to be right .
" No matter the languages we speak or the color of our skin , we share ancestors who planted rice on the banks of the Yangtze , who first domesticated horses on the steppes of the Ukraine , who hunted giant sloths in the forests of North and South America , and who labored to build the Great Pyramid of Khufu , " Olson and his colleagues wrote in the journal Nature .
How can they be so sure ?
Seven years ago one of Olson 's colleagues , a Yale University statistician named Joseph Chang , started thinking about how to estimate when the last common ancestor of everybody on Earth today lived .
In a paper published by the journal Advances in Applied Probability , Chang showed that there is a mathematical relationship between the size of a population and the number of generations back to a common ancestor .
Plugging the planet 's current population into his equation , he came up with just over 32 generations , or about 900 years .
Chang knew that answer was wrong because it relied on some common , but inaccurate , assumptions that population geneticists often use to simplify difficult mathematical problems .
For example , his analysis pretended that Earth 's population has always been what it is today .
It also assumed that individuals choose their mates randomly .
And each generation had to reproduce all at once .
Chang 's calculations essentially treated the world like one big meet market where any given guy was equally likely to pair up with any woman , whether she lived in the next village or halfway around the world .
Chang was fully aware of the inaccuracy – people have to select their partners from the pool of individuals they have actually met , unless they are entering into an arranged marriage .
But even then , they are much more likely to mate with partners who live nearby .
And that means that geography can't be ignored if you are going to determine the relatedness of the world 's population .
A few years later Chang was contacted by Olson , who had started thinking about the world 's interrelatedness while writing his book .
They started corresponding by e-mail , and soon included in their deliberations Douglas Rohde , a Massachusetts Institute of Technology neuroscientist and computer expert who now works for Google .
The researchers knew they would have to account for geography to get a better picture of how the family tree converges as it reaches deeper into the past .
They decided to build a massive computer simulation that would essentially re-enact the history of humanity as people were born , moved from one place to another , reproduced and died .
Rohde created a program that put an initial population on a map of the world at some date in the past , ranging from 7,000 to 20,000 years ago .
Then the program allowed those initial inhabitants to go about their business .
He allowed them to expand in number according to accepted estimates of past population growth , but had to cap the expansion at 55 million people due to computing limitations .
Although unrealistic in some respects – 55 million is a lot less than the 6.5 billion people who actually live on Earth today – he found through trial and error that the limitation did not significantly change the outcome with regard to common ancestry .
The model also had to allow for migration based on what historians , anthropologists and archaeologists know about how frequently past populations moved both within and between continents .
Rohde , Chang and Olson chose a range of migration rates , from a low level where almost nobody left their native home to a much higher one where up to 20 percent of the population reproduced in a town other than the one where they were born , and one person in 400 moved to a foreign country .
Allowing very little migration , Rohde 's simulation produced a date of about 5,000 B.C. for humanity 's most recent common ancestor .
Assuming a higher , but still realistic , migration rate produced a shockingly recent date of around 1 A.D .
Some people even suspect that the most recent common ancestor could have lived later than that .
" A number of people have written to me making the argument that the simulations were too conservative , " Rohde said .
Migration is the key .
When a people have offspring far from their birthplaces , they essentially introduce their entire family lines into their adopted populations , giving their immediate offspring and all who come after them a set of ancestors from far away .
People tend to think of preindustrial societies as places where this sort of thing rarely happened , where virtually everyone lived and died within a few miles of the place where they were born .
But history is full of examples that belie that notion .
Take Alexander the Great , who conquered every country between Greece and northern India , siring two sons along the way by Persian mothers .
Consider Prince Abd Al - Rahman , son of a Syrian father and a Berber mother , who escaped Damascus after the overthrow of his family 's dynasty and started a new one in Spain .
The Vikings , the Mongols , and the Huns all traveled thousands of miles to burn , pillage and – most pertinent to genealogical considerations – rape more settled populations .
More peaceful people moved around as well .
During the Middle Ages , the Gypsies traveled in stages from northern India to Europe .
In the New World , the Navaho moved from western Canada to their current home in the American Southwest .
People from East Asia fanned out into the South Pacific Islands , and Eskimos frequently traveled back and forth across the Bering Sea from Siberia to Alaska .
" These genealogical networks , as they start spreading out they really have the ability to get virtually everywhere , " Olson said .
Though people like to think of culture , language and religion as barriers between groups , history is full of religious conversions , intermarriages , illegitimate births and adoptions across those lines .
Some historical times and places were especially active melting pots – medieval Spain , ancient Rome and the Egypt of the pharaohs , for example .
" And the thing is , you only need one , " said Mark Humphrys , an amateur anthropologist and professor of computer science at Dublin City University .
One ancestral link to another cultural group among your millions of forbears , and you share ancestors with everyone in that group .
So everyone who reproduced with somebody who was born far from their own natal home – every sailor blown off course , every young man who set off to seek his fortune , every woman who left home with a trader from a foreign land – as long as they had children , they helped weave the tight web of brotherhood we all share .
Like a team of laboratory gearheads , Arizona State University ( A.S.U. ) researchers have found a way to soup up microscopic " nanomachines " that may someday be used to deliver lifesaving medications or test the quality of drinking water in remote regions of the world .
In place of turbochargers and high - octane gas , the scientists tweaked their engine design and used an additive to speed the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide into fuel to create nanomachines 350 times more powerful than any previously built .
A nanomachine is a tiny device of less than a micron ( one millionth of a meter , or about four one - hundred - thousandths of an inch ) in size that scientists hope will soon be able to carry out a variety of medical and research functions , such as the targeted delivery of anticancer drugs , more efficiently and quickly than is possible today .
Over the past few years , scientists have built hydrogen peroxide–fueled nanomachines from gold , platinum and nickel .
The problem is that none of them were powerful or fast enough to perform practical scientific applications , because they could move no faster than 10 microns per second .
But Joseph Wang , director of the A.S.U. Biodesign Institute 's Center for Bioelectronics and Biosensors , graduate teaching assistant Rawiwan Laocharoensuk and lab associate Jared Burdick report in the journal ACS Nano that they succeeded in ramping up the nanomechanisms ' average speed to 60 microns per second ( which is nearly as fast as the systems that propel microorganisms ) by inserting carbon nanotubes into the platinum .
They cranked them up even more — to 200 microns per second ( equivalent to 100 of the nanomachine 's body lengths ) — by also adding hydrazine , an ammonia - derived chemical compound that accelerates hydrogen peroxide oxidation .
" For the first time , we took synthetic nanomotors and made them more powerful , " Wang says .
" Previous nanomachines were too weak to carry heavy cargo . "
A.S.U.'s work builds on various researchers ' nanomotor tinkering over the past few years .
The National Institutes of Health two years ago awarded a Purdue University research team $ 7 million over five years to study the potential use of a nanomotor , a microscopic biological machine , in diagnosing and treating diseases such as cancer , AIDS , hepatitis B and influenza .
Researchers at Pennsylvania State University and the University of Toronto have likewise studied the development of nanomotors , but have not experimented with the enhancements Wang and his team introduced .
Nanomachines are modeled after microorganisms found in the body .
Proteins called kinesins , for example , are natural nanomotors that support cellular functions such as mitosis ( the chromosomal process that creates two nuclei from one parent nucleus ) and meiosis ( when the number of chromosomes per cell is reduced by one half ) .
Some environmentalists and consumer advocates have raised concerns about the potential safety risks of nanotechnology , noting that few studies have been done to assess possible dangers of such puny and hard to detect particles on the human body .
But Wang dismisses these concerns , noting that he uses nontoxic building materials .
" Platinum and gold are not harmful to the body in these small quantities , " he says , adding that his team 's work paves the way for creating nanomotor - based sensing systems for monitoring chemicals — including glucose — in the body , although a practical application is still years away .
" We expect that these studies will lead to even more energy - efficient nanomotors and will open up new opportunities for nanoscale vehicle systems " that could transport and release loads of medication throughout the body , the researchers write in ACS Nano .
The carbon nanotube–infused contrivances that Wang and his team created were able to move even when hauling cargo 10 times larger in diameter than them .
Needless to say , the human body does not produce hydrogen peroxide needed to fuel nanomotors , so Wang and his colleagues are working on ways to synthesize it from glucose .
The use of nanomotored substances to deliver drugs is several years away .
( They would have to go through numerous clinical trials and get U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval before anyone could use them , for example , to carry insulin for diabetics or deliver drugs that could open clogged arteries . )
But Wang says that such minimotors could be used within the next two years as part of sensors that could detect impurities ( metals or microbes ) in drinking water — and , eventually , to remove them .
OPIUM production increased to nearly 9,000 tonnes in 2007 , the highest level for years , according to a United Nations annual “ World Drug Report ” published on Thursday June 26th .
Opiates remain the main problem drug in terms of treatment .
But while there is cause for concern , comfort may be had in knowing things are not nearly as bad as they used to be .
In 1909 , international concern over the ravages of the then legal and freely traded drug culminated in a meeting of the International Opium Commission in Shanghai .
And from UN estimates using Commission documents , it is plain to see why .
Some 16.4 % of the population were puffing on opium in Singapore , and over 8 % in Hong Kong and Macau .
The only country to use more than it did a century ago is America .

It ’s Google , of course , that has developed the musculature to step forward and lay claim to being Microsoft ’s successor as industry leader in the Internet era .
If there had been any way Microsoft could have prepared for this day , it had ample time to do so .
In 1993 , fully five years before Google ’s founding and two years before Mr. Gates ’s memo , Nathan P. Myhrvold , then Microsoft ’s chief technology officer , wrote his own memo , “ Road Kill on the Information Highway . ”
It spelled out in prescient detail how each of many industries would be flattened by the build - out of digital networks , and it said that the PC software business would be no exception .
It ’s no secret that Microsoft ’s online businesses have failed to gain leading market positions .
But what is not widely appreciated , perhaps , is that the company ’s online initiatives have lately been doing worse than ever .
The last year when Microsoft made a profit in its online services business was the fiscal year that ended on June 30 , 2005 .
Its MSN unit used to do a nicely profitable business providing dial - up Internet access to subscribers .
When its users began to switch to broadband services provided by others , however , the earnings disappeared .
Microsoft ’s
Web sites brought in a trickle of advertising revenue , which did not grow fast enough to offset the disappearance of the narrowband access business .
AOL suffered in similar fashion .
In the 2006 fiscal year , Microsoft ’s online services produced a $ 74 million loss after the previous year ’s profit of $ 402 million .
Since then , the numbers have become uglier , as Microsoft ’s online segment has added employees and absorbed growing sales and marketing expenses .
In the 2007 fiscal year , the online businesses lost $ 732 million .
In the next nine months , through March 31 this year , they recorded a loss of $ 745 million , almost double the amount in the period a year earlier .
With $ 2.39 billion in revenue for the nine months , the online segment represents only 5 percent of the company ’s total revenue .
The numbers at Google , which is nothing but an online services business , have moved in the opposite direction .
For rough comparison , profits in its 2005 fiscal year , ended on Dec. 31 , were $ 1.5 billion .
The earnings grew to $ 3 billion in 2006 and $ 4.2 billion in 2007 .
According to Hitwise , an Internet research firm , Google ’s share of searches in the United States has increased to almost 67.9 percent in March 2008 from 58.3 percent in March 2006 .
During the same period , Microsoft ’s share has dropped to 6.3 percent from 13.1 percent .
Mr. Ballmer has always been a ham on stage .
His comically demonic chants and dances in recent years have been preserved on YouTube .
But even way back in the day , he had the gift .
At the company ’s annual meeting in 1994 , when he was overseeing sales and Microsoft was enjoying its moment of triumph over competitors , he shouted at top volume : “ It ’s market share  market share !
market share !
market share !
 that counts ! ”
He continued : “ Because if you have share , you basically leave the competitors ”  here he grabbed his own throat for emphasis  “ just gasping for oxygen to live in . ”
His mock asphyxiation of competitors was later stripped out of its jokey context by government antitrust lawyers .
But the imagery is no less apt now than it was then , except that the roles have reversed .
As Google continues to gather market share and the Single - Era Conjecture dictates Microsoft ’s eclipse , it is Mr. Ballmer ’s own online services that now are gasping for oxygen .
GOP reps .
advised to avoid party brand
A new playbook for House Republicans urges them to run essentially as independents , showing empathy for voters , emphasizing local issues and ignoring many traditional party campaign practices .
The advice for House candidates is part of an effort to minimize Republican losses in a year when voters are exasperated by the economy , the Iraq war and President Bush :

“ Encourage Republican candidates to establish themselves in a personal manner , emphasizing local issues whenever possible . ”
“ Candidates have to have a positive alternative vis-à - vis their Democratic opponents . ”
“ Work to develop an issues matrix that is different than in years past and also shows a deep empathy towards the voters . ”
The advice , from consultants to the National Republican Congressional Committee , was presented this week to House leaders , including NRCC Chairman Tom Cole ( R - Okla . ) .
The assessment is contained in a 15 - point PowerPoint presentation provided to Politico and first reported by David Espo of The Associated Press .
The review was an effort to distill lessons learned from unexpectedly deep Republican losses in special elections in Illinois , Louisiana and Mississippi .
The assessment was provided by the NRCC Audit Committee , formed at the behest of House Republican leader John A. Boehner of Ohio .
The review found that the losing Republicans failed to successfully establish “ themselves and their local brand in contrast to the negative perception of the national GOP . ”
“ Traditional Republican messages essentially did not work in these campaigns , ” the analysis says .
“ Nationalizing these elections as a choice between a traditional Republican and a traditional Democrat did not work in this political environment .
“ Democrats ran candidates that were a reflection of their districts . ”
Bush lectured the world from his privileged perch in the United Arab Emirates Sunday , in the middle of his self - orchestrated victory lap around a transformed Middle East which has been disrupted , and its alliances distorted , by the lame - duck imperialist 's own meddling militarism .
Schooling the Arab leaders who gathered at the luxurious Emirates Palace hotel about democracy , Bush cast himself as a crusader for liberty and freedom in his invasion , overthrow , and occupation of Iraq ; and in his installation of the propped - up Iraqi regime behind the intimidation and force our military .
" A great new era is unfolding before us , " Bush told the crowd .
" This new era is founded on the equality of all people before God .
This new era is being built with the understanding that power is a trust that must be exercised with the consent of the governed , " he declared .
The " great new era " Bush spoke of , was , undoubtedly , a pat on his own back for successfully erecting a Potemkin government behind his military aggression in Iraq , which he 's been able to point to as a fledgling democracy .
Yet , the great crusader was seemingly oblivious to the fact that he was speaking from a country , an emirate , which is ruled by a royal family which has no use or desire for democratic reforms which would allow its subjects to directly challenge the autocracy 's ultimate authority to enact those reforms .
In the Emirates , foreigners are allowed in the country to work , but are not allowed citizenship or any of the rights and protections which would go with the denied privilege .
The tiny group of ' voters ' who were chosen by the regime to decide the makeup of a new government advisory panel in 2006 hardly indicate a leap forward for democracy in the UAE , but Bush , nonetheless , praised their tepid moves as an " advance of freedom . "
It really made little difference to the royalty and the autocrats gathered that the nation Bush is attempting to ' build ' in Iraq is the product of a bloody , military takeover .
Indeed , their own power was assumed after their own violent upheavals and maintained by their iron - handed dictatorships which crush any dissent that could be the impetus for democratic change .
It is this very U.S. administration which has followed a long line of presidencies who have tolerated , encouraged , and sponsored these anti-democratic elements into assumed authority as the lesser - of - ( decidedly more ) evil influences they oppose .
The new Iraq has all of the requisites for the type of autocratic rule these Arab autocrats have grown accustomed to dealing with as they work to maintain their own heavy - handed regimes .
There are the sectarian divides which keep the ruling power in a constant campaign for alliances which Iraq 's neighbors will advantage themselves of .
And , there are many opportunities to undermine the central authority in Iraq by supporting insurgent elements bent on armed , destabilizing resistance .
And , with the refusal of the Shiite - dominated regime to enact those levers of real democracy , which the country 's new constitution promised Iraq 's Sunni minority communities would bring balance to the lopsided rule , there is no functioning democratic government which would offer any example or blueprint for others in the region .
" We know from experience that democracy is the only system of government that yields lasting peace and stability , '' Bush told his Arab hosts .
It 's a wonder though , in the face of all of the rhetoric about democracy from Bush , why his administration is set to , once again , feather the military arsenal of one of the most firm dictatorships in the region .
The lame - duck militarist is heading to Saudi Arabia , Monday , with a $ 20 billion gift basket of advanced weaponry for the anti-democratic , royal regime .
That 's how much this administration cares about democracy .
It makes no difference at all to Bush whether nations adhere to his fine words about ' freedom ' and ' liberty ' , so long as they 're " with us " and not " against us " in his contrived terror war .
In the new " axis of evil " Bush identified Iran , al - Qaeda , and Hamas as " threats " he intends for countries to mobilize against .
More to the point , these elements he 's identified are to be scapegoats for the inevitable and ( many times ) understandable , violent consequences of his military expansionism .
They 're also intended to serve as justification for each and every autocratic military maneuver and meddling Bush can manage in the year he has left in office .
Bush has signaled he 's not quite ready to give up his Iraq prize .
He said last week that , the " U.S. could ' easily ' be in Iraq for 10 years . "
But , he 's also declared that he 'll bring " peace " to the region in the 12 months he has left .
He can't have both , no matter how he casts his imperialism .
It should n't have escaped the notice of Arab leaders that it 's Bush , himself , with his tortured constructions , who is best positioned to protect and preserve their dictatorships , and help them sell their facades of democracy to the gullible among us .
All tyrants , hail the master of faux - democracy .
What a perfectly apt place to celebrate his fraud .

The campaign of presidential hopeful Senator Barack Obama has launched a website to debunk what it claims are false accusations against the candidate and his wife , at the same time critics are slamming the Fox News Channel over controversial references to her .
The website , titled Fight the Smears , was launched Thursday to counter claims that a tape exists of Michelle Obama using the word " Whitey " from the pulpit of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago .
" No such tape exists .
Michelle Obama has not spoken from the pulpit at Trinity and has not used that word , " the website states .
Critics have also complained over references
Fox News has made about Michelle Obama in past weeks — the most recent being a graphic that appeared on Wednesday labelling her as " Obama 's baby mama . "
During an interview on Fox with conservative columnist Michelle Malkin about whether Barack Obama 's wife has been the target of unfair criticism , a graphic appeared on the screen that read : " Outraged liberals : Stop picking on Obama 's baby mama . "
Fox anchor E.D.
Hill also had to apologize after she referred to an affectionate onstage fist bump shared by the couple as a " terrorist fist jab . "
Hill later said the comment was picked up from something she had read online .
She said some people " thought I had personally characterized it inappropriately .
I regret that .
It was not my intention and I certainly did not mean to associate the word ' terrorist ' in any way with Senator Obama and his wife . "
Fox cancelled Hill 's weekday afternoon program as part of a larger reorganization .
She remains on staff .
But Michelle Obama sparked controversy over a speech she made in February .
Talking about her husband 's campaign , she said that " for the first time in my adult lifetime I 'm really proud of my country . "
Meanwhile , while Fox has come under fire , MSNBC has also sparked anger for comments by some commentators about Hillary Clinton .
The network 's Chris Matthews has been accused by some of being pro-Obama , and was ridiculed after saying that he felt a " thrill going up my leg " after watching an Obama speech .
He later had to apologize for his remarks about Clinton after he said " the reason she 's a U.S. senator , the reason she 's a candidate for president , the reason she may be a front - runner is her husband messed around . "
MSNBC reporter David Shuster was also suspended for two weeks for saying Clinton 's campaign had " pimped out " daughter Chelsea by having her make political phone calls .
Researchers from the Physikalisches Institut of the University of Stuttgart have create entangled quantum states in diamond , which means there is finally a diamond men care about - namely the one that might some day be inside a quantum computer working at room temperature , a feat so far considered impossible for other materials .
While physicists have long described the world of atoms by quantum mechanics , one of its strangest characteristics , and the one that defies easy description , allows the linking of two objects without any noticeable interaction over a distance .
Einstein called this a ' spooky interaction . '
One of the most spectacular experiments based on this unusual entanglement characteristic is quantum teleportation , where the properties of one quantum object are transferred to another one at a remote location .
One percent of the carbon atoms in the diamond lattice possess a magnetic moment , presented as a green arrow .
These would be the quantum - bits in a hypothetical diamond - based quantum computer .
( picture : Universität Stuttgart )
But this effect is very sensitive to any perturbations so physicists have to work under extreme conditions like temperatures close to absolute zero to entangle quantum objects .
Apparently this is not necessary in diamond , say the scientists from Stuttgart .
In their experiments they shot nitrogen atoms into the diamond lattice at high speed .
These impurities are detectable by their fluorescence and they change the diamond color to pink .
Because of its unmatched stiffness the diamond lattice is shielding the Nitrogen atoms and thus allows detecting quantum effects such as entanglement under ambient conditions .
This gave the researchers from Stuttgart the opportunity to create suitable quantum states among the building blocks of the diamond lattice , namely the carbon atoms .
One percent of those carbon atoms possess a magnetic moment what allows them to interact with an implanted nitrogen atom in close vicinity .
This interaction was used to individually address the carbon atoms which have been entangled in the end .
Ultrafast quantum computers using spooky action still have some distance to travel but this could end up being a major milestone .

In advertising these days , the brass ring goes to those who can measure everything  how many people see a particular advertisement , when they see it , who they are .
All of that is easy on the Internet , and getting easier in television and print .
Billboards are a different story .
For the most part , they are still a relic of old - world media , and the best guesses about viewership numbers come from foot traffic counts or highway reports , neither of which guarantees that the people passing by were really looking at the billboard , or that they were the ones sought out .
Now , some entrepreneurs have introduced technology to solve that problem .
They are equipping billboards with tiny cameras that gather details about passers - by  their gender , approximate age and how long they looked at the billboard .
These details are transmitted to a central database .
Behind the technology are small start - ups that say they are not storing actual images of the passers - by , so privacy should not be a concern .
The cameras , they say , use software to determine that a person is standing in front of a billboard , then analyze facial features ( like cheekbone height and the distance between the nose and the chin ) to judge the person ’s gender and age .
So far the companies are not using race as a parameter , but they say that they can and will soon .
Dozens of fun-seekers have been injured after a theme park ride collapsed in the city of Gothenburg , in western Sweden .
Officials said around 20 people were seriously hurt in the accident , which happened at the Liseberg theme park .
Several people were thrown out of the swinging Rainbow ride in Tuesday evening 's accident , police said .
The ride is composed of a spinning arm with a compartment at one end which carries passengers .
The Rainbow was full , with 36 predominantly Scandinavian passengers , at the time of the accident , in which it fell about 10 feet ( three metres ) to the ground , police said .
The cause of the incident is under investigation .
A popular Swedish tourist destination , Liseberg is the country 's biggest theme park , with more than 30 different rides .
None of the injuries are said to be life - threatening , emergency services officials told the Associated Press news agency .
Everyone knows that smoking can kill , but until now no one really understood how cigarette smoke causes healthy lung cells to become cancerous .
Smoking accounts for the vast majority of lung cancer deaths , causing 90 percent of all lung cancer deaths in men and about 80 percent in women .
Now , after a series of experiments using human tissue , researchers from the University of California , Davis , believe that the cancer causing chemical is hydrogen peroxide .
The researchers hope that the finding will help the tobacco industry develop “ safer ” cigarettes by eliminating such substances in the smoke .
“ With the five - year survival rate for people with lung cancer at a dismally low 15.5 percent , we hope this study will provide better insight into the identification of new therapeutic targets , ” said Tzipora Goldkorn , lead author of the report .
Writing in , Goldkorn describes how his team exposed different sets of human lung airway cells ( in the laboratory ) to cigarette smoke and hydrogen peroxide .
After exposure , these cells were then incubated for one to two days .
Then they , along with unexposed airway cells , were assessed for signs of cancer development .
The cells exposed to cigarettes smoke and the cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide showed the same molecular signatures of cancer development , while the unexposed cells did not .
“ These experiments not only pin-point new molecular targets for cancer treatment , but also identify culprits in cigarette smoke that eventually will do the smoker in , ” noted Gerald Weissmann , MD , Editor - in - Chief of The FASEB Journal .

Ex -Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie says he is likely to take on David Davis in a by - election in Haltemprice and Howden if Labour does not stand .
He says he is 90 % certain to stand on a national security platform , arguing in favour of 42 - day terror detention .
But he is not likely to endear himself to voters in nearby Hull after saying : " It 's an absolute shocker . "
The light - hearted comments were caught on tape earlier as he was talking to a BBC producer .
When asked to clarify his remarks , Mr MacKenzie said he had been joking and he had never actually been to Hull .
On Thursday , Mr Davis stunned Westminster by quitting as an MP and shadow home secretary to force a by - election on the issue of civil liberties and 42 day detention of terror suspects .
So far no party has said they will contest it , meaning Mr Davis could be returned without a vote .
But Mr MacKenzie , who backs Labour on 42 days , said he wanted to stand against Mr Davis on behalf of the Sun and had the backing of the newspaper 's proprietor Rupert Murdoch , after discussing it with him at party on Thursday night .
He told the BBC : " I have been associated with The Sun for 30 years .
The Sun is very , very hostile to David Davis because of his 28 day stance and The Sun has always been very up for 42 days and perhaps even 420 days . "
National debate
He went on : " I will 90 % stand if Labour do n't put a candidate up " adding : " I 've got to get my ducks in a row , the people of what would be my new constituency would like me to have thought this thing through .
" Democracy has to be about two and not about one . "
In May , Mr MacKenzie stood unsuccessfully in a borough council election in Weybridge on the issue of parking charges .
Mr Davis believes the government 's plans to extend detention without charge are an assault on traditional British freedoms .
But Prime Minister Gordon Brown has described his move as a " stunt that has become a farce " , although he has not confirmed that a Labour candidate will not be standing .
Mr Davis has said that if Labour does not take him on it will be an " extraordinary act of cowardice " by Mr Brown .
' Perfectly happy '
But he said his main concern was to provoke a national debate on civil liberties and the government 's anti-terror legislation .
" I would be perfectly happy to have a fight with the Murdoch newspapers - but there will be a debate , " he told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
The Lib Dems have said they will not be fielding a candidate as they agree with Mr Davis on 42 days .
The smaller parties also seem unlikely to stand , with the BNP , which finished fourth in the seat in 2005 , saying it would not be fielding a candidate .
When he made his announcement on Thursday , he said he wanted to take a stand on a range civil liberties issues including ID cards , CCTV , the growth of the " database state " and the erosion of jury trials .
But Mr MacKenzie said it was " rubbish " that " we are living in a controlled state " .
" Personally I 'm very grateful that there is CCTV around everywhere and I 'd like more of it , " he said .
" Most of us are not bad guys , we have nothing to fear . "
He also told the BBC he would be campaigning on three issues - hostility to the " sense that our country is somehow in the grip of some kind of security vice " , demanding that there be " the referendum for Europe " , and on more populist issues - like seeking changes to government spending on " things I do n't think we care about " .
" At the end of the day I am really standing on behalf of those people who do n't want to vote for David Davis . "
He said he would wait to see what Labour did , but said that if they did not field a candidate " my instinct is I will probably end up standing " .

What are these ?

STRASBOURG , France ( Reuters ) - Europe ’s top rights court ruled against the government on Tuesday for intercepting telephone calls between British and Irish rights groups and their clients , violating their right to privacy .
Rights group Liberty and its Irish counterparts British Irish Rights Watch and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties said Britain set up an eavesdropping facility in northwestern England that intercepted much of the telephone , fax and e-mail traffic between Britain and Ireland in the 1990s .
The Defence Ministry site in Capenhurst , Cheshire , intercepted all public telecommunications carried by microwave radio between two British Telecom radio stations between 1990 and 1997 , the rights groups said .
Much of their communications would have passed through those radio stations and would therefore have been picked up by the Capenhurst Electronic Test Facility , which was designed to intercept 10,000 simultaneous telephone channels , they said .
For security reasons , Britain neither confirmed nor denied the statements made about its surveillance activities , but it agreed that the court could presume some of the civil liberties ’ groups communications were intercepted .
“ The court recalled that it had previously found that the mere existence of legislation which allowed communications to be monitored secretly had entailed a surveillance threat for all those to whom the legislation might be applied , ” the court said in a statement .
“ In the applicants ’ case , the Court therefore found that there had been an interference with their rights as guaranteed by Article 8 , ” the court said referring to the article in the European Charter of Human Rights on the right to privacy .
The 1985 Interception of Communications Act gave British authorities “ extremely broad discretion ” to intercept communications between Britain and another country , it added .
“ The Court considered that the domestic law at the relevant time had not indicated with sufficient clarity , so as to provide adequate protection against abuse of power , ” it added .
An array of human rights groups has strongly criticized the United States government , saying it withheld money meant to provide clean drinking water to Haiti as leverage for political change in the country .
The activists , in a report released Monday , called the delay of $ 54 million in international loans to the Haitian government “ one of the most egregious examples of malfeasance by the United States in recent years . ”
The loans from the Inter - American Development Bank were intended to revamp the water and sanitation systems in Les Cayes and Port - de - Paix , two Haitian towns in dire need of the money to improve their infrastructure .
Nearly 70 percent of Haitians lack regular and direct access to potable water , experts say .
The lack of clean water contributes to intestinal parasites and amoebic dysentery .
The development bank , over which the United States Treasury Department holds significant influence , approved the loans in 1998 .
Although payments began to be made several years later , the water projects have yet to be started , the report said , “ largely the result of aggressive attempts by the U.S. government to block the disbursement of these loans . ”
In Hardy County , Democrats outnumber Republicans more than 2 to 1 .
But there is little enthusiasm for Barack Obama in this mountainside enclave , a portent of trouble for the Illinois senator in next week ’s West Virginia primary and the general election beyond .
Nearly 97 % white , the county is as conflicted as any rural and working - class Democratic bastion as it struggles to adjust to the likely prospect of the party nominating its first African American presidential candidate .
Obama may have emerged from his double - digit victory over Hillary Rodham Clinton in North Carolina and his razor - thin loss in Indiana on Tuesday with a virtual lock on the Democratic nomination .
But his performance did little to reassure political leaders here concerned by his sagging numbers among once - loyal white Democrats , who have steadily abandoned their party over the last several presidential elections .
“ I ’m not yet convinced that Barack Obama is more substance than fluff , ” said Clyde M. See Jr. , a former Democratic speaker of the West Virginia House of Delegates and two - time gubernatorial candidate who heads a small law practice in Moorefield , the county seat .
“ He ’s a fine speaker , mind you , but I ’m still not sure he ’s got the right stuff to win the general election . ”

The concerns of party members who live amid this rolling landscape of soybean fields , poultry plants and retirement cabins mirror those of many white Democrats nationwide :
Some fear voters will be turned off by Obama ’s black heritage .
Others , they say , will find reason to doubt his patriotism or will perceive him to be an elitist .
It remains unclear how racial unease will factor into election - day decisions come November .
Those hidden impulses are elusively difficult to capture in polling .
But seasoned Democratic players here reckon that some racially tinged voting will inevitably occur far beyond Hardy County ’s cresting hills .
“ There ’s a lot of bigotry in the country , not just West Virginia , ” See said .
Fearful that the GOP will exploit Obama ’s “ otherness , ” many still insist that Clinton ’s ebbing campaign offers the Democrats a better shot come November .
Even those who say they would support Obama worry about his electability , convinced that many of their neighbors will defect to the presumed Republican nominee , John McCain .

“ My worry is there ’s just too many people in this country who are n’t ready to elect a black president , ” said Charles L. Silliman , a retired Air Force officer who is Hardy County ’s Democratic Party co-chairman .
“ There ’s a lot to like about him .
But I ’m just afraid that too many people will vote against him based on their fears and prejudice . ”
Silliman and his wife , Carmen , are Clinton supporters , drawn by her healthcare plan and her endurance on the campaign trail .
Still , the couple repeatedly have found themselves defending Obama , correcting acquaintances who relay baseless rumors about his name and religion .
Carmen Silliman has collected a sheaf of poisonous e-mails that have flowed into her in - box .
“ We do not need a Muslim to lead the good ole USA , ” reads one .
Obama is , in fact , a Christian .
Neil Gillies , an Obama supporter who runs a local environmental nonprofit group , glumly recounted the gibes that his wife , a schoolteacher , hears regularly from her students .
“ They ’re convinced [ Obama ] is a Muslim , a terrorist , a guy who ’s coming to take away their guns , ” Gillies said .
“ It ’s just sad . ”

Slung along the bottom of West Virginia ’s eastern panhandle , Hardy County was once rock - solid Democratic .
Senior citizens fondly recall the day Eleanor Roosevelt arrived to dedicate the opening of Moorefield High School in 1941 .
But socially conservative church groups and gun-rights supporters here have helped tilt the vote Republican in recent presidential elections .
In 2004 , Hardy County lined up for George W. Bush by a 3 - 1 ratio .
“ It ’s just not going to be easy for Obama to woo crossover Democrats back into the fold , ” said P. Merle Black , a professor of politics and government at Emory University and a longtime analyst of Southern voting patterns .
“ In addition to the race factor , you ’ve got huge cultural differences between them and Obama on guns and religion and many of the issues that would make those voters think he does n’t represent their interests . ”
Obama has made an effort to highlight his religious beliefs and his support for hunters ’ rights .
But his former pastor ’s racially charged sermons -- and the candidate ’s own comments about small - town Americans who have lost their jobs and “ cling to guns or religion ” -- have not helped his cause .

“ I ’ve got 50 - some guns , and I was n’t crazy about Obama ’s talk about small towns , ” said Sam Vetter , 64 , a farmer and lifelong Democrat who regrets voting for Bush in 2000 .
“ Besides , ” he added , “ Obama just does n’t sound right for an American president . ”
Despite a well - financed television campaign and endorsements from Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV and Rep. Nick J. Rahall II , Obama is expected to finish well behind Clinton in West Virginia ’s primary , which will award 28 pledged delegates .
“ We ’ve got our work cut out for us , ” acknowledged Tom Bowen , a spokesman for Obama ’s West Virginia effort .
Democratic registration statewide is up by more than 16,000 voters since 2006 , compared with an increase of 4,000 for the GOP .
But that reflects “ as much interest in the local races as there is in the national , ” said Greg Ely , Hardy County clerk .

Hand - lettered campaign signs promoting Democrats running for family - court judge and assessor cluster along Hardy County ’s winding roads .
There are only a few signs for either Obama or Clinton , but in one yard , a placard with a red slash on it mocks , “ Osama , Obama and Chelsea ’s Mama . ”
The sign belongs to Eric Hardy , 38 , a former Democrat who works at a woodworking plant .
Now a die - hard Republican and president of the West Virginia Coon Hunters Assn. , Hardy opposes any Democrat “ who wants to go after my guns . ”
Obama “ takes the cake , ” he said , “ because of , you know , who he is . ”
He suspects Obama for his “ Muslim name , ” and comments by his former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. , rankle him .
“ He ’s just a mistake any way you look at him , ” Hardy said .
Obama ’s support among white male voters , the most tightly contested bloc over the primary season , has slipped .
He did well early on in states such as Virginia , where he took 52 % of the white male vote to Clinton ’s 47 % .
But this week , Obama lost , 58 % to 42 % , among white men in Indiana and 55 % to 42 % in North Carolina .
He has won majorities of white male voters in 10 states since January , but Clinton bested him in 13 others , including the critical northern battlegrounds of Ohio and Pennsylvania .

“ This is the single biggest problem he faces , ” said William A. Galston , a former senior Clinton administration domestic policy advisor who considers Obama the apparent nominee after this week ’s results .
“ This is a party problem , not just his alone .
But [ Obama ] has to be particularly sensitive to addressing these voters . ”
Galston credits Obama with trying to win over suspicious white voters by tailoring his North Carolina victory speech to talk more about his hardscrabble upbringing and his love of country .
“ He needs to keep talking in comforting terms about the issues on people ’s minds and how his own story fits in with their concerns , ” Galston said .
Other analysts counter that Obama needs to mirror Clinton ’s populist economic pitch .
Advertisement
“ The best way for Obama to make inroads with white voters in blue - collar , leaning - red states is to push economic issues to the front and continue to depict the war as a money pit , ” said Thomas F. Schaller , an associate professor of political science at the University of Maryland , Baltimore County .
For many of Hardy County ’s Democrats , though , there seems to be no appeal that will overcome who Obama is and what he represents .
“ When we lost all those Democrats who voted for Bush in 2000 and 2004 , I felt we just had to have a better bundle of goods to sell , ” See said .
“ Problem is , I ’m not sure we have those goods this time around . ”

Most bizarre print ads – Indian version Analytics , India , wonder why - 2 comments
Time for another look at print ads , this time for the most bizarre of them all .
Mind you , these are not awful or plain lousy ads , for any column - centimeter worth its area has a fair share of lousy ads , these are simply bizarre ads , the kind that will make you go – WTF ?
The first one is from Lenevo slim monitors , they are so slim that you can cut a head off with them , who comes up with this stuff anyway ?
This is even more bizarre , kanika digital printers that can print almost life like – really tasteless
Now comes itch guard , subtle and yucky
This classic wtfness displayed by Sahara global , I think they mean that you can visit the place , but .. why create such visually revolting ad for that ?
I had post another lenevo ad for it displays intense lack of common sense on the ad designers part

UNITED NATIONS ( CNN ) -- Sudanese President Omar Hassan al - Bashir may be charged with genocide by the International Criminal Court .
The U.N. estimates 2.5 million have been forced from their homes in Darfur .
Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno - Ocampo has scheduled a news conference Monday , just after he is expected to filed the warrant with the court .
The Sudanese ambassador to the United Nations told CNN said Friday that the ICC has indicated to Sudanese officials that al - Bashir may be charged over the five - year campaign of violence in the country 's Darfur region .
" We have been hearing that this prosecutor is going to announce some names , possibly the leadership of the country , that will be indicted , " said Adbalmahmood Abdalhaleem Mohamad .
" It is a criminal move that should be resisted by all . "
Such an indictment , Mohamad said , would be a destabilizing move that would " take us back to square one . "
Sudan , he said , is " condemning it in the strongest possible terms " and urged the international community to do likewise .
" We will resist it by all possible legal means , " he said .
Watch actress and Darfur activist Mia Farrow speak on the issue »
If the warrant is issued by Moreno - Ocampo it would make al - Bashir the first sitting president to be indicted by the ICC for genocide .
The prosecutor said in a progress report last month to the Security Council that Sudan 's " whole state apparatus " has been mobilized " to plan , commit , and cover up crimes " in Darfur .
Watch how some are concerned by the move »
" For the last five years , the whole Darfur area has been a crime scene , " Moreno - Ocampo said last month .
The Darfur conflict began in 2003 when Darfurians rebelled against the central government over its alleged favoritism to Arabs over Africans .
The government in Khartoum fought back allegedly unleashing the janjaweed militia to quell the uprising -- a claim the government denies .
The authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur , killing , torturing and raping residents there , according to the United Nations , western governments and human rights organizations .
Militias targeted civilian members of the tribes from which the African rebels draw strength .
Human rights groups blame the janjaweed for most atrocities , including the use of rape as a weapon of war .
Meanwhile , the chief U.N. humanitarian coordinator said aid workers are preparing for the effects of an indictment .
" We are taking precautions to make sure that people are aware of the risks and what we need to maintain our operations at the same time , " said John Holmes .
" We 're taking sensible precautions hoping nothing will happen , because humanitarian aid should continue whatever the political situation , whatever the political arguments . "
The United Nations estimates that some 300,000 people have died in the conflict and more than 2.5 million have been forced from their homes since 2003 .
Sudanese officials say only 10,000 have died in the fighting and have rejected claims from the U.S. and others that genocide is taking place .
Witnesses who spoke to CNN Correspondent Nic Robertson in May said that just four months ago , government airplanes and helicopters attacked defenseless civilians in their Darfur villages .
They said the government struck in coordination with militiamen riding horses and camels -- a classic pattern that has unfolded around Darfur .
More than 115 people were killed in that attack , they said , and nearly 58,000 people fled .
In 2005 , the Security Council cleared the way for possible Darfur war crime prosecutions by the ICC , a permanent tribunal set up to handle cases related to genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes .
The court is based on a treaty signed by 106 nations -- excluding Sudan .
Once the court indicts someone , authorities in that person 's native country -- or the country in which the indicted person is located -- have the power to detain the indicted person for trial at the Hague .
The ICC has already indicted two men for Darfur crimes -- one a government official and the other a militia leader .
The cases are against Ali Kushayb , a militia leader , and Ahmad Harun , former minister of state for the interior in Sudan , who is now in charge of humanitarian affairs for the Sudanese government .
Both face charges accusing them of murder , rape , forced displacement and other offenses in Darfur .
An arrest warrant for Harun charges that he was involved in the murder , rape , torture and forced displacement of civilians .
The court also says he encouraged such illegal acts in public speeches during his tenure as minister of state for the interior .
The criminal court says Kushayb led several thousand militia members and personally participated in attacks against civilians .
An arrest warrant outlines numerous cases of murder , rape and inhumane acts .
Senior Sudanese government leaders have previously told CNN that reports of atrocities in Darfur are exaggerated .
" Yes , there has been a war and some people have died , but it 's not like what has been reflected in the media , " Interior Minister Ibrahim Mahmoud Hamid said last month .
The United States has accused an adviser to President al - Bashir , Musa Halil , of leading a militia responsible for atrocities , and the U.N. Security Council has frozen his assets .
Halil denies any wrongdoing .
" There is no genocide , " he told CNN .
" Most people came to the refugee camps because of the pressure and were used there for political marketing . "

Be well , stay safe and look out for each other .
If you ’ve ever spent time on State Street , you ’ve probably seen some of the unusual people that hang around down there .
But there ’s something even more unusual , and considerably more meaningful , than your run of the mill beggars , tourists , and street entertainers .
It involves interspecies cooperation , and is known by those who have seen the popular youtube video about it simply as the man with the dog , the cat , and the rat .
In reality , this astounding street act is more than just an act , it ’s an authentic portrayal of love and acceptance across all boundaries .
Meet Gregory Pike and his furry entourage : Booger , Kitty , and Mousey .
Every day he walks around State street with Booger , the dog , on a leash .
On top of Booger sits Kitty , who holds on to the harness around Booger like a saddle .
On top of Kitty sits Mousey ( who is really a rat ) , wrapped closely around Kitty ’s neck .
Its obvious the bond between these animals is deep â€ “ they all accept one another as members of the same family , regardless of their species .
Greg has been spreading this message of peace , respect , and tolerance for eight years , and has become an integral member of Santa Barbara society , known and loved by our community .
Hailing from a small town in Colorado , Gregory Pike has been studying animal habitats and psychology for about 30 years .
He has worked with animal rescues and rehabilitation centers for mountain animals , and has a diverse background in animal training .
â€ œI ’m a legend in my own mind , â€  he jokes , as he explains how his interspecies group came about , â€ œIf it ai n’t been done before , I ’m gonna do it .
As long as it ’s humane .â€ 
It all started about nine years ago , when â€ œSomeone said it could n’t be doneâ€ â€ “ no one believed a dog , cat , and a rat could all become best friends .
Greg simply had to prove them wrong .
â€ œThe dog raised the cat — I used her gestatation period to raise the cat like a puppy .
She chose Kitty from the litter , so she thinks it ’s her baby .â€ 
The cat was then raised around all sorts of small animals , and treats the rat as if it were its own sibling .
With the rat , â€œit ’s all about food .
â€ Rats , it turns out , are very open to interspecies pairing , as long as they are n’t threatened and are properly taken care of .
While it seems odd for the cat and rat to be stacked on top of the dog , Pike explains that it is the animals â€œsafety zoneâ€ :
It is where the cat and rat feel most at home and protected by their surrogate mother .
Of course , it also helps Pike and his pals walk around a little faster , as well as avoid possible rat or cat tripping incidents .
â€ œI understand animals and why they do things .
I understand some of the barks , and the meows , and what the different ways they do it mean .
I ’m not a Doctor Doolittle , but I know what they ’re asking for.â€ 
Not surprisingly , Greg also has some insights into what makes people tick as well , and with his act hopes to be able to catch the attention of people to pass on his messages of peace and humanity to the human species .
â€ œAnimals are simple , people are complicated .
People wanna see something different , something unusual , something cool .
But there ’s gotta be a message behind it.â€ 
Pike ’s message comes from the simple reality of what he and his animals have accomplished together .
It proves that all animals , regardless of their most vicious tendencies towards each other , can be kind and caring toward one another .
Obviously these animals are able to do something we humans simply have not completely managed to do .
â€ œPeace can happen anywhere — if they can do it why ca n’t people ?
You know , they ’re just â€˜dumbâ€™ animals , but now , who ’re really the stupid ones ?â€ 
While currently residing in Santa Barbara , he hopes to someday soon open up and run a free pet adoption and rescue center .
This is one of the main reasons why he keeps a can out for money .
Eventually , the money will be going to help wild animals and pets , as well as bring animal shelter issues to the attention of more people in America .
In his hometown of Telluride , Colorado , the non-euthanasia , regulated adoption policies have worked so well there are never any strays left in their shelter for long periods of time .
â€ œIn Bakersfield thousands of animals a month are put down .
A thousand animals a month , that ;s ridiculous , â€ 
Pike says noting that it costs cities thousands of dollars a month to pay for euthanasia of animals , when they could be making money for shelters through adoption and more effective advertising of animals in shelters .
But even with such extraordinary goals , he refuses to accept money if it seems burdensome upon others , stressing that its more important to spread the thought of a friendlier , more tolerant world than to make money .
â€ œI do survive on what I get , but I do n’t want it to be about the money .
When I see people digging for money , I tell them , if its that much work , I do n’t want it .
I do n’t want you to work for me ; I just want you to come up and take a picture and enjoy this .
The message is always more important.â€ 
With the help of friends , Greg is planning a website ( coming soon at www.thedogcatrat.com) which will become the main source of income for his free animal rescue , shelter , and training center .
He is also currently looking into hosting a radio show on local Santa Barbara radio station KTYD ( 99.9 FM ) to go further with his plans .
He hopes to start the program in his home state of Colorado , and through his successes spread the ideas of more humane treatment and non-kill shelters for animals into other states , as well as to give kids a chance to visit with him and learn more about the love possible between all species .
But for the moment , Greg will continue his daily trips down State Street , bringing his amazing animal trio with him and letting people stare dumbfounded at what he has accomplished .
When it comes down to it , it is the simple pleasure of bringing something different and meaningful to people that keeps him going , regardless of how much money gets thrown in his cup by the end of the day .
Clearly , this man is no longer just a legend in his own mind .

Just three or four years ago , a person could have successfully managed separate online and offline lives ( and yes , separate reputations ) .
There was general anonymity to what you did on the internet .
You could do the things you would n’t normally do in the real world on message boards and internet communities .
Not anymore .
I do n’t care whether you ’re a 40 year old business executive , a hot - shot entrepreneur , or a 16 year old power user on Digg ; you need to control what ’s being said about you on the internet or it will bite you in the ass .
You do n’t need a high priced firm to help you do this .
Hell , you can do a better job enhancing your image and putting out great content because , well , nobody else is you .
Without further ado , six ways to control and enhance your image on the Internet :
1 ) Search ( and research ) your name
It ’s time to do your homework .
You think you know everything about yourself , but you ’re wrong .
There are millions of people on the internet who have an opportunity to write about you , defame you , or even write about a person with the same name but could inadvertently damage your image .
It ’s time to do some searching .
The first thing you must do is search yourself on Google .
You ’ve probably done it before out of curiosity , but now do it intelligently .
Search your name , variations on your name , and all nicknames .
For me , that would be “ Ben Parr ” , “ Benjamin Parr ” , and “ Benjamin E. Parr ” .
When searching for your name , make sure you use quotation marks ( ” “ ) to make sure you are n’t getting results with only your first or your last name .
Now that you ’re searching , take note of anything relating to you .
Are there any news articles that pop up ?
Any blog posts ?
Are they about you , or are you just being quoted ?
Does anyone who shares your name come up ?
Could people searching for you confuse that person with you ?
Generally , only the first page of search results matter , but I would look at the first twenty to thirty results to get a full picture of your image on Google .
Repeat this every couple of weeks to track changes in search results .
Second is to search for your name on Social Media Firehose .
Social Media Firehose , built and hosted on Yahoo !
pipes , searches specifically through social and networking websites .
Kingsley Joseph ’s tool will look through Twitter , Flickr , Digg , Technorati , and other social media websites for mentions of you .
You can limit searches to exclude specific websites ( I suggest removing Twitter if you ’re a power Twitter user ) .
As you can see from the image on the right ( click to see full size ) , results range from Twitters replies to Technorati results .
Great way to know what ’s being said about you .
And about others with your name .
Three of those results are for other “ Ben Parrs ” , one of them being a male supermodel who once played a stripper on T.V .
This is not only very interesting ( and strange ) to know , but could be the key to explaining anything odd a future employer may find about you on Google .
Now , what if your name is a common name ?
That ’s a little tougher .
I suggest using a variation on your name that is not as common for your emails and internet interaction .
For example , add in your middle initial , use Freddie instead of Fred , or use a nickname .
You WANT to be easily searchable .
Friends , employers , and potential customers all will search for you , and that ’s an incredible opportunity to give them a good “ first ” impression .
More on that in step 5 .
2 ) Register your name as an internet domain
Shel Israel is a respected tech entrepreneur figure in Silicon Valley .
But you would n’t know that if you visit shelisrael.com .
Loren Feldman registered the domain and uses it now as a parody of Israel ’s interviewing techniques , causing headaches that could have been prevented .
Lesson ?
Register your name as a domain as soon as possible !
If you have a less common name , there ’s a great chance the domain it is still available .
You do n’t have to do anything with it ( though I recommend it : see # 6 on this list ) .
You just need to own and control it so , at the very least , nobody else does .
You want to have the option to use it later in life or the ability .
Otherwise , you could be mocked by puppets .
And nobody wants that .
Just use GoDaddy or Dreamhost if you do n’t have a preferred service .
Do n’t let this happen to you !
What if my name is taken ?
If your name is common , or if luck just was n’t on your side , do n’t fret .
If you use any variations on your name , register those .
Otherwise , keep tabs on the website .
Who owns it ?
Is it good content , or could it reflect poorly on you ?
Does someone you know own it ?
I suggest using the ShowIP Firefox extension to check .
You can see who owns it , and for how long their registration will last .
If there ’s nothing substantive on the domain , you can always see if you can buy it off the person .
Use domaintools , whois.sc , or a similar service if you do n’t have Firefox .
3 ) Set up a Google Alert for your name
Google Alerts are a lesser known but incredibly useful tool of Google .
PR personnel regularly use Google Alerts to keep tabs on candidates and to watch for mentions of the management of their company .
You , though , should use it to keep tabs on what ’s being said about you .
Type in your name ( do n’t forget to use quotation marks ) , select comprehensive and once - a- day , put in your email , and you ’re good to go .
Every day , Google will send you an email with any mentions of your name on the internet , whether they be blogs , news reports , or just junk web pages from abandoned family tree websites .
Knowing if a news report has quoted you without permission could be the difference between a pay raise and being fired .
Once again , if you have a more common name , I suggest using a variation of your name or a nickname once again , if you have decided to adopt it .
4 ) Clean up , and then improve , all of your social networking and internet profiles
I cannot link you to enough stories about how Facebook and MySpace profiles have landed students and businesspeople alike into hot water .
What the ridiculous amount of links in that last sentence should tell you is that now is the time to go through your social networking and all other internet profiles and make sure they are clean .
This includes Digg , Twitter , and even your damn account at somethingawful .
That means untagging any photos that are morally questionable or display that you have bad judgment .
It does not matter how you set your privacy settings : smart companies always can get around the features .
Otherwise , you could be like Kevin on the right and get fired from your banking job .
Minus the fairy outfit .
Suggestions for cleaning up your profiles :
Remove or untag incriminating or very unprofessional pictures .
It ’s find to have fun , even drinking , just not stupid drinking .
Unless you ’re underage .
Then you ’re just playing with the law .
.
It ’s find to have fun , even drinking , just not stupid drinking .

Then you ’re just playing with the law .
Take out the clutter from your profiles .
Incoherent lines of crap turn employers , customers , and even friends off .
Getting to the point ’s always a good thing .
Make it the same for your profile .

Getting to the point ’s always a good thing .

Update the info in your profiles .
If you are no longer a goth rocker , change your MySpace to reflect that .
Include any new jobs , internships , or projects you have been up to .
If you are no longer a goth rocker , change your MySpace to reflect that .
Include any new jobs , internships , or projects you have been up to .
Have plenty of contact info .
Probably not a phone number , but an email and a website so people can learn more if they want .
By the way , do n’t be fearful of your internet profiles because they could be bad for your future .
Quite the opposite : Facebook and other social networks could help you land a job or find a long lost friend years down the road .
5 ) Generate positive and meaningful content associated with your name
I ’ve talked enough about protecting your image .
Now it ’s time to do some enhancing .
Like I said before , you WANT your name to be easily Googled .
It ’d be nice to have your employer find nice , or at least interesting , things about you when they look you up .
So how do you do that ?
Put something on your domain .
This is the best way to “ talk ” to others on the internet .
Put up a blog if you think you have something interesting to say .
Just talk about what you love and what you are good at .
Tell your friends .
You ’d be surprised how many people will subscribe and how fast it ’ll rise in the search rankings .

If you have your name attached to your Digg , LinkedIn , Twitter , or FriendFeed account , it ’ll eventually appear on search results .
Use them and generate content .
Having conversations on Twitter or promoting your public profile on Linked In will boost its search result .

Not only are you adding to the discussion , but they ’ll come up in search results sometimes .
Most of all , follow Step # 6 below .
You ’ll see what I mean .
6 ) Take risks and be true to yourself
You may get yourself into a sticky situation if you do n’t clean up your internet image , but you ’re never going to make an impact or change the world if you do n’t speak your mind and stay true to yourself .
Do you think Michael Arrington of Techcrunch got to the pinnacle of blogging by playing it safe ?
Gary Vaynerchuk of Wine Library TV is well liked and well respected because he is engaging and “ disarmingly honest . ”
And there are a slew of others who write brilliant content without shooting themselves in the foot ( too often ) .
Gary Vaynerchuk .
Really , just use common sense .
Remember the internet is just as real as any part of your life and that it ’s important to write about and promote your passions .
The internet ’s amazing for that sort of thing .
Just keep these tips in mind so you do n’t get burned .

“ It was an interesting day . ” — President Bush , recalling 9/11 [ White House , 1/5/02 ]
At approximately 8:48 a.m. on the morning of September 11 , 2001 , the first pictures of the burning World Trade Center were broadcast on live television .
The news anchors , reporters , and viewers had little idea what had happened in lower Manhattan , but there were some people who did know .
By that time , the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) , the North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) , the National Military Command Center , the Pentagon , the White House , the Secret Service , and Canada 's Strategic Command all knew that three commercial airplanes had been hijacked .
They knew that one plane had been flown deliberately into the World Trade Center 's North Tower ; a second plane was wildly off course and also heading toward Manhattan ; and a third plane had abruptly turned around over Ohio and was flying back toward Washington , DC .
So why , at 9:03 a.m.— fifteen minutes after it was clear the United States was under terrorist attack — did President Bush sit down with a classroom of second - graders and begin a 20 - minute pre-planned photo op ?
No one knows the answer to that question .
In fact , no one has even asked Bush about it .
Bush 's actions on September 11 have been the subject of lively debate , mostly on the internet .
Details reported that day and in the week after the attacks — both the media reports and accounts given by Bush himself — have changed radically over the past 18 months .
Culling hundreds of reports from newspapers , magazines , and the internet has only made finding the “ truth ” of what happened and when it happened more confusing .
In the changed political climate after 9/11 , few have dared raise challenging questions about Bush 's actions .
A journalist who said Bush was “ flying around the country like a scared child , seeking refuge in his mother 's bed after having a nightmare ” and another who said Bush “ skedaddled ” were fired .
[ Washington Post , 9/29/01 ( B ) ]
We should have a concise record of where President Bush was throughout the day the US was attacked , but we do not .
What follows is an attempt to give the most complete account of Bush 's actions — from Florida to Louisiana to Nebraska to Washington , DC .
Preparations
Bush 's appearance at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota , Florida , on September 11 , 2001 had been in the planning stages since August [ Booker web site ] , but was only publicly announced on the morning of September 7 . [ White House , 9/7/01 ]
Later that same day , 9/11 hijackers Mohamed Atta and Marwan Alshehhi traveled to Sarasota and enjoyed drinks and dinner at a Holiday Inn only two miles down the sandy beach from where Bush was scheduled to stay during his Sarasota visit .
[ Longboat Observer , 11/21/01 , Washington Post , 1/27/02 ]
On the night of September 10th , Bush stayed at the Colony Beach Resort — “ an upscale and relatively pristine tropical island enclave located directly on the Gulf of Mexico , a spindly coral island ... off Sarasota , Florida . ” [ AP , 07/29/01 ]
Zainlabdeen
Omer , a Sudanese native living in Sarasota , told the local police that night that someone he knew who had made violent threats against Bush was in town and Omer was worried about Bush 's safety .
The man was identified only as “ Ghandi . ”
A police report states the Secret Service was informed immediately .
[ Hopsicker , 7/22/02 ]
After a private dinner with various Florida politicians ( including his brother Jeb ) and Republican donors , Bush went to bed around 10:00 p.m. [ Sarasota Magazine , 11/01 , Washington Post , 1/27/02 ]
Surface - to - air missiles were placed on the roof of the resort [ Sarasota Herald - Tribune , 9/10/02 ] , and an Airborne Warning and Control System ( AWACS ) plane circled high overhead .
[ Fighting Back : The War on Terrorism — From Inside the Bush White House , by Bill Sammon , 10 /02 , p. 25 ]
It 's not clear if this type of protection was standard for the president or whether security was increased because of possible threats .
An Assassination Attempt ?
Bush awoke a little before 6:00 a.m. on September 11 , pulled on shorts and an old T - shirt and laced up his running shoes .
[ CBS , 11/1/02 ]
At 6:30 a.m. , Bush , a reporter friend , and his Secret Service crew took a four - mile jog in the half - light of dawn around a nearby golf course .
[ Washington Post , 1/27/02 , Washington Post ,
09/11/01 ]
At about the same time Bush was getting ready for his jog , a van carrying several Middle Eastern men pulled up to the Colony 's guard station .
The men said they were a television news crew with a scheduled “ poolside ” interview with the president .
They asked for a certain Secret Service agent by name .
The message was relayed to a Secret Service agent inside the resort , who had n't heard of the agent mentioned or of plans for an interview .
He told the men to contact the president 's public relations office in Washington , DC , and had the van turned away .
[ Longboat Observer , 9/26/01 ]
The Secret Service may have foiled an assassination attempt .
Two days earlier , Ahmed Shah Massoud , leader of Afghanistan 's Northern Alliance , had been murdered by a similar ruse .
Two North African men , posing as journalists from “ Arabic News International , ” had been requesting an interview with Massoud since late August .
Ahmad Jamsheed , Massoud 's secretary , said that by the night of September 8 , “ they were so worried and excitable , they were begging us . ”
An interview was arranged for the following day .
As it began , a bomb hidden in the video camera exploded , killing the two journalists .
Massoud was rushed by helicopter to a hospital in Tajikistan , but was pronounced dead on arrival ( although his death was not acknowledged until September 15 ) .
[ International Policy Institute for Counter - Terrorism , 10/30/01 , Newsday , 10/26/01 ]
The assassination is widely believed to have been timed to remove the Taliban 's most popular and respected opponent in anticipation of the backlash that would occur after the 9/11 attacks .
[ BBC , 9/10/01 , BBC , 9/10/01 ( B ) , Time , 8/4/02 , St. Petersburg Times , 9/9/02 ]
The Northern Alliance blamed al - Qaeda and the ISI , Pakistan 's secret service , for the attacks .
[ Radio Free Europe , 9/10/01 , Newsday , 9/15/01 , Reuters , 10/4/01 ]
Nearly three hours after the incident at the Colony , another Longboat Key resident reported a run-in with possibly the same men .
At about 8:50 ( when reports of the first World Trade Center crash were first broadcast ) , while standing on the Sarasota bay front waiting for the presidential motorcade to pass by , this man saw two Middle Eastern men in a dilapidated van “ screaming out the windows  Down with Bush  and raising their fists in the air . ”
The FBI questioned the man , but it's not known if this was the same van that had visited the Colony .
[ Longboat Observer , 9/26/01 ]
Later on the morning of September 11 , the Secret Service searched a Sarasota apartment looking for further corroboration of Zainlabdeen Omer 's report of an assassination threat .
Three Sudanese men were questioned for about ten hours .
The Secret Service also raided a beauty supply store in Sarasota , whose owner , identified as “ Hakim , ” told the agents that “ Ghandi ” was a member of the Sudanese People 's Liberation Army , a group fighting against the fundamentalist Muslim government in Sudan .
[ Hopsicker , 7/22/02 ]
Monica Yadav of Sarasota 's ABC News 40 reported that a few days after the Secret Service visit , the beauty supply store was closed up and Hakim was long gone .
Yadav also learned that Zainlabdeen Omer had suddenly quit his jobs and vacated his apartment .
“ All I know is he can't leave town , ” a friend of Omer 's told Yadav .
“ Omer got in a lot of trouble with the law . ”
The Special Agent in charge of the Presidential detail in Sarasota told Yadav that Bush was never in any danger and the various warnings and possible terrorist connections were all “ just a coincidence . ”
[ Hopsicker , 7/22/02 ]
Yet , as we will see below , there are more details of a threat against Bush before he left Sarasota .
Bush Is Briefed as the Hijackings Begin
After his jog , Bush showered , then sat down for his daily intelligence briefing around 8 a.m .
“ The President 's briefing appears to have included some reference to the heightened terrorist risk reported throughout the summer , but contained nothing specific , severe or imminent enough to necessitate a call to [ National Security Advisor ] Condoleezza Rice . ”
[ Telegraph , 12/16/01 ]
While Bush was being briefed , the planes that would be hijacked began taking off .
American Airlines Flight 11 was first , leaving Boston 's Logan Airport at 7:59 a.m .
The others soon followed , except for United Flight 93 , scheduled to leave at 8:01 , but which was delayed on the runway for about 40 minutes .
[ Boston Globe , 11/23/01 ]
( For more information on the four flights , see Flight 11 , Flight 175 , Flight 77 , Flight 93 . )
At approximately 8:13 , Flight 11 was instructed by air traffic controllers at the FAA 's Boston Center , in Nashua , New Hampshire , to climb to 35,000 feet .
The plane did not obey the order and its transponder was turned off .
Air traffic control manager Glenn Michael said , “ we considered it at that time to be a possible hijacking . ” [ AP , 8/12/02 , emphasis added ]
According to FAA regulations , that was the correct decision : “ Consider that an aircraft emergency exists ... when ... there is unexpected loss of radar contact and radio communications with any ... aircraft . ”
[ FAA Air Traffic Control Regulations , Chapter 10 , Section 2 - 5 ]
If air traffic controllers believed Flight 11 had been hijacked at 8:13 , NORAD should have been informed immediately , so military planes could be scrambled to investigate .
However , NORAD and the FAA both claimed NORAD was not informed until 8:40 — 27 minutes later .
[ NORAD , 9/18/01 , AP ,
8/12/02 , AP , 8/19/02 , Newsday , 9/10/02 ; one NORAD employee said it took place at 8:31 , ABC News , 9/11/02 ]
Indeed , before contacting NORAD , Boston air traffic controllers watched Flight 11 make an unexpected 100 - degree turn and head south toward New York City [ Christian Science Monitor , 9/13/01 ] , told other controllers of the hijacking at 8:25 [ Guardian , 10/17/01 ] , continued to hear highly suspicious dialogue from the cockpit ( such as , “ Nobody move , please , we are going back to the airport .
Do n't try to make any stupid moves ” )
[ Guardian , 10/17/01 , New York Times , 10/16/01 ] , and even asked the pilots of Flight 175 to scan the skies for the errant plane .
[ Guardian , 10/17/01 , Boston Globe , 11/23/01 ]
Is NORAD 's claim credible ?
If so , the air traffic controllers ( including Mr. Michael ) should have been fired and subject to possible criminal charges for their inaction .
To date , however , there has been no word of any person being disciplined at any institution at any level for what happened on 9/11 .
If NORAD 's claim is false , and it was indeed informed within the time frame outlined in FAA regulations that Flight 11 may have been hijacked , that would mean NORAD did absolutely nothing for almost thirty minutes while a hijacked commercial airliner flew off course through some of the most congested airspace in the world .
Presumably , that would warrant some very serious charges .
Again , no one associated with NORAD or the FAA has been punished .
According to phone calls made by fight attendants Betty Ong and Amy Sweeney , the hijackers had stabbed and killed at least one passenger and two flight attendants by about 8:21 .
[ ABC News , 7/18/02 , Boston Globe ,
11/23/01 , AP , 10/5/01 , Los Angeles Times , 9/20/01 ]
( One hijacker may have been riding in the cockpit and begun the hijacking earlier . )
After 8:21 , both women apparently remained on the phone with American Airlines ' headquarters for 25 minutes , until their plane crashed into the World Trade Center 's North Tower .
[ ABC News , 7/18/02 , AP , 10/5/01 ]
These calls make NORAD 's supposed ignorance of a crisis even more dubious .
Bush Leaves for Booker Elementary
Around the same time the Flight 11 hijackers were stabbing passenger Daniel Lewin — at 8:20 a.m. — Bush 's briefing ended and he said good - bye to the Colony 's general manager .
[ Telegraph , 12/16/01 , Sarasota Magazine , 11/01 ]
The first event on Bush 's schedule was what is known as a “ soft event ” – a photo - op with children at Emma Booker Elementary School — promoting his proposed education bill .
[ Sarasota Herald - Tribune , 9/11/01 ]
After spending about 20 minutes with the children , Bush was scheduled to give a short press conference at about 9:30 .
[ White House , 9/7/01 , Federal News Service , 9/10/01 ]
Accounts of when Bush 's motorcade left for the school vary from 8:30 to 8:39 . [ 8:30 , Washington Post , 1/27/02 , 8:35 , Sarasota Magazine , 9/19/01 , 8:39 , Washington Times , 10/7/02 ]
One account has the Bush party leave the Colony suite at 8:30 and drive away at 8:39 .
Whenever he left , the motorcade traveled quickly : “ The police shut down traffic in both directions , leaving roads utterly deserted for Bush 's long motorcade , which barreled along at 40 mph , running red lights with impunity . ”
[ Fighting Back : The War on Terrorism — From Inside the Bush White House , by Bill Sammon , 10/02 , pp. 37 - 38 ]
At 40 mph , it would take about 14 minutes to travel the nine - mile distance to the school .
Several accounts say the journey took about 20 minutes [ New York Times , 9/16/01 ( B ) , St. Petersburg Times , 9/8/02 ( B ) , MSNBC , 10/29/02 ] , which means that Bush arrived shortly before 9:00 . [ 8:46 , ABC News ,
9/11/02 , 8:55 , Washington Times ,
10/7/02 , 8:55 , Sarasota Magazine , 9/19/01 , “ just before 9:00 , ” Telegraph , 12/16/01 , “ shortly before 9:00 , ” Sarasota Herald - Tribune , 9/10 /02 , “ just before 9:00 , ” New York Times , 9/16/01 ( B ) , 9:00 , Albuquerque Tribune , 9/10 / 02 ]
When Did Bush First Learn of the Attacks ?
Why does it matter when Bush left the resort and arrived at the school ?
Because this is the crucial time when Bush was first told , or should have been told , of the attacks .
Official accounts , including the words of Bush himself , say Bush was first told of what was happening in New York City after he arrived at the school .
[ Telegraph , 12/16/01 , CBS , 9/11/02 ]
However , this statement does not stand up to scrutiny .
There are at least four reports that Bush was told of the first crash before he arrived at the school .
Two accounts explicitly state Bush was told while in the motorcade .
“ The President was on Highway 301 , just north of Main Street ... [ when ] he received the news that a plane had crashed in New York City . ”
[ Sarasota Magazine , 11/01 ]
( See adjacent map for the location where he is told . )
Another account states , “ Bush was driving to the school in a motorcade when the phone rang .
An airline accident appeared to have happened .
He pressed on with his visit . ” [ Observer , 9/16/01 ]
The first media reports of Flight 11's crash into the World Trade Center began around 8:48 , two minutes after the crash happened .
[ New York Times , 9/15/01 ] CNN broke into its regular programming at that time [ CNN , 9/11/01 ] , though other networks , such as ABC , took a few more minutes to begin reporting .
[ ABC , 9/14/02 ]
So within minutes , millions were aware of the story , yet Bush supposedly remained unaware for about another ten minutes .
Claims of Bush 's ignorance become harder to believe when one learns that others in his motorcade were immediately told of the attack .
For instance , Kia Baskerville , a CBS News producer traveling with Bush that morning , received a message about a plane crash “ as the presidential motorcade headed to President Bush 's first event . ”
Baskerville said , “ Fifteen minutes later I was standing in a second grade classroom [ waiting for Bush 's entrance ] ” — which means she got the news at about 8:47 — right as the story was first being reported .
[ CBS , 8/19/02 ]
A news photographer in the motorcade overheard a radio transmission that Press Secretary Ari Fleischer would be needed on arrival at the school to discuss reports of some sort of crash .
[ Christian Science Monitor , 9/17/01 ]
Another account notes Fleischer got the news that the crash had occurred “ just minutes before , ” but notes that Bush was not in the same car as Fleischer .
[ CBS , 11/1/02 ]
Senior presidential communications officer Thomas Herman said , “ Just as we were arriving at the school , I received a notification from our operations center than [ sic ] an airliner had struck one of the towers .... ” [ Marist College Magazine , Fall 2002 ]
Meanwhile , CIA Director George Tenet was told of the crash a few minutes after it happened .
A messenger gave him the news as he was eating breakfast with former Senator David Boren in a Washington restaurant three blocks from the White House .
Boren says Tenet was told that the World Trade Center had been attacked by an airplane : “ I was struck by the fact that [ the messenger ] used the word attacked . ”
An aide then handed a cell phone to Tenet , and Tenet made some calls , showing that at least some at the highest levels of the Bush administration were talking about an attack at this time .
Tenet then said to Boren , “ You know , this has bin Laden 's fingerprints all over it . ”
[ ABC , 9/14/02 ]
Some people at the school also heard of the news before Bush arrived .
Around 8:50 , Tampa Bay 's Channel 8 reporter Jackie Barron was on the phone with her mother , who mentioned the first news reports .
At almost the same time , Brian Goff , a Fox reporter from Tampa , heard the same thing on his cell phone .
[ Sarasota Magazine , 11/01 ]
Associated Press reporter Sonia Ross was also told of the crash by phone from a colleague .
[ AP , 9/12/01 ( D ) ]
Florida Congressman Dan Miller , waiting in front of the school as part of the official greeting party , was told by an aide about the crash at 8:55 , before Bush arrived .
[ Sarasota Magazine , 11/01 ]
Given all this , how could Bush have remained ignorant ?
Could he have been out of the loop because he was in a car ?
No .
The previous night , Colony Resort manager Katie Klauber Moulon toured the presidential limousine and marveled “ at all the phones and electronic equipment . ”
[ Sarasota Magazine , 11/01 ]
Karl Rove , Bush 's “ chief political strategist , ” who presumably was riding with Bush , used a wireless e-mail device on 9/11 as well .
[ Newsweek , 10/14/02 ]
There seems to have been ample opportunity and the means to alert Bush .
Another Warning
If Bush was n't told while in his limousine , he certainly was told immediately after he got out of it .
US Navy Captain Deborah Loewer , the director of the White House Situation Room , was traveling in the motorcade when she received a message from an assistant back in Washington about the first crash .
Loewer said that as soon as the car arrived at Booker , she ran quickly over to Bush .
“ It 's a very good thing the Secret Service knows who I am , ” Loewer later said .
She told Bush that an aircraft had “ impacted the World Trade Center .
This is all we know . ”
[ Catholic Telegraph , 12/7/01 , AP , 11/26/01 ]
Meanwhile , More Hijackings
Even though Flight 175 left about the same time as Flight 11 , it appears to have been hijacked much later .
At 8:41 , its pilot was still talking to ground control [ New York Times , 10/16/01 ] , but at 8:42 it sharply veered off course , and a flight controller noted that its transponder had been turned off and communication cut .
[ Boston Globe , 11/23/01 , New York Times ,
10/16/01 ]
One minute later , at 8:43 , NORAD was notified the plane had been hijacked .
[ NORAD , 9/18/01 ]
The hijackers turned the transponder back on but used a different signal code .
This allowed flight controllers to “ easily ” track the plane as it flew toward New York City .
[ Washington Post , 9/17/01 ]
At about 8:46 , Flight 77 began to go severely off course .
According to regulations , a fighter is required to be dispatched if a plane strays from its official course by more than two miles or 15 degrees [ MSNBC , 9/12/01 ] .
As the adjacent map shows , Flight 77 returned to its proper course for a time , but its last radio contact occurred at 8:50 .
[ Guardian , 10/17/01 ]
Supposedly , NORAD was not officially notified that Flight 77 has been hijacked until 9:24 [ NORAD , 9/18/01 ] , but the New York Times reported that by around 8:50 , military officials at the Pentagon were already discussing what to do about Flight 77 .
[ New York Times , 9/15/01 ]
Note the difference in notification times : 27 minutes for Flight 11 , 1 minute for Flight 175 and 38 minutes for Flight 77 .
Flight 93 was n't hijacked until about 9:16 , but by about 8:50 , it was clear that at least three planes had been hijacked .
Vice President Dick Cheney , speaking on NBC's Meet the Press , said , “ The Secret Service has an arrangement with the FAA .
They had open lines after the World Trade Center was ... ” [ Meet the Press , 9/16/01 ]
Cheney never finished his sentence ( interesting in itself — did he say too much ? ) , but it seems safe to say that his next word would have been “ hit . ”
Cheney 's statement makes it clear the Secret Service knew the extent of the situation well before 9:00 am .
An Accident ?
Intelligence agencies were suffering “ warning fatigue ” from so many warnings of an al - Qaeda attack [ Independent , 9/7/02 ] , some specifically mentioning the use of hijacked airplanes as missiles ( see this essay ) .
Bush himself was given an intelligence briefing a month earlier entitled “ Bin Laden to Strike in US , ” and it contained a warning from the British government that the US should expect multiple airline hijackings from al - Qaeda .
[ Sunday Herald , 5/19 /02 ]
So with the clear knowledge that three planes had been hijacked , with one of them already crashed into the World Trade Center , who would have possibly assumed that Flight 11's crash was an accident ?
Yet that is precisely what the official story claims .
There are a number of different “ official ” accounts , but all of them stress that Bush was n't told until after he arrived inside the school ( contrary to the account of Captain Loewer ) and that it was assumed to be an accident ( contradicting Tenet being told that it was an attack ) .
In some accounts , “ President Bush had emerged from his car and was shaking hands with local officials standing outside the school when Chief of Staff Andrew Card sidled up to him with the news . ”
[ CBS , 11/1/02 ]
Bush later recalled that it was Card who first notified him : “  Here 's what you 're going to be doing ; you 're going to meet so - and - so , such - and - such . 
Then Andy Card said ,  By the way , an aircraft flew into the World Trade Center .  ” [ Washington Times , 10/7/02 ]
At a press conference later that day , Press Secretary Ari Fleischer also claimed it was Andy Card who first informed him , “ as the President finished shaking hands in a hallway of school officials . ”
[ Knoxville News Sentinel , 9/11/01 ]
In other accounts , it was advisor Karl Rove who first told Bush .
According to photographer Eric Draper , who was standing nearby , Rove rushed up , took Bush aside in a corridor inside the school and said the cause of the crash was unclear .
Bush replied , “ What a horrible accident ! ” Bush also suggested the pilot may have had a heart attack .
[ Daily Mail , 9/8/02 ]
Dan Bartlett , White House Communications Director , says he was there when Bush was told : “ [ Bush ] being a former pilot , had kind of the same reaction , going , was it bad weather ?
And I said no , apparently not . ”
[ ABC News , 9/11/02 ]
A reporter who was standing nearby later said , “ From the demeanor of the President , grinning at the children , it appeared that the enormity of what he had been told was taking a while to sink in . ”
[ Daily Mail , 9/8/02 ]
One account explicitly says that Rove told Bush the World Trade Center had been hit by a large commercial airliner .
[ Telegraph , 12/16/01 ]
However , Bush later remembered Rove saying it appeared to be an accident involving a small , twin - engine plane .
[ Washington Post , 1/27/02 , MSNBC , 9/02 ]
In yet another account , Blake Gottesman , Bush 's personal assistant , while giving the president some final instructions as they walked to the school , remarked , “ Andy Card says ,  By the way , an aircraft flew into the World Trade Center .  ” [ Fighting Back : The War on Terrorism — From Inside the Bush White House , by Bill Sammon , 10/02 , pp. 41 - 42 ]
Told Again , Yet Still Clueless
Booker principal Gwen Tose - Rigell was waiting for Bush outside the school .
“ The limousine stops and the president comes out .
He walks toward me .
I 'm standing there in a lineup ; there are about five people .
He walks over and says he has to make a phone call , and he 'll be right back . ”
[ MSNBC , 09/02 , Telegraph , 12/16/01 ]
The phone call was with National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice .
From a room with secure communications , Rice updated Bush on the situation .
[ Christian Science Monitor , 9/17/01 , Time , 9/12/01 ]
The fact that Bush immediately said he had to make an important call strongly suggests he was told about the situation while in the motorcade .
But some accounts have Andrew Card saying to Bush as he gets out of his limousine , “ Mr. President , you really need to take this phone call , ” thereby implying that Card knows what 's going on , but Bush does n't .
[ St. Petersburg Times , 9/8/02 ( B ) ]
As National Security Advisor , Rice had to have had as much information as anyone .
By the time she spoke to Bush , she must have known that three planes had been hijacked and that the country was under attack .
We know very little about the conversation — only that Rice later claimed , “ [ Bush ] said , what a terrible , it sounds like a terrible accident .
Keep me informed . ”
[ ABC News , 9/11/02 ]
One reporter noted : “ Bush did not appear preoccupied [ after the phone call ] …
There was no sign that Rice had just told [ him ] about the first attack [ on the World Trade Center ] . ” [ Cox News , 9/12/01 ( B ) ]
Tose - Rigell was then summoned to a room to talk with Bush : “ He said a commercial plane has hit the World Trade Center , and we 're going to go ahead and go on , we 're going on to do the reading thing anyway . ”
[ AP , 8/19/02 ( D ) ]
One local reporter notes that at this point , “ He could and arguably should have left Emma E. Booker Elementary School immediately , gotten onto Air Force One and left Sarasota without a moment 's delay ...
But he did n't . ”
[ Sarasota Herald - Tribune , 9/12/01 ( B ) ]
The only possible excuse is that Bush was completely clueless as to what was happening .
Sure enough , at a press conference on the evening of 9/11 , Press Secretary Ari Fleischer was asked by a reporter , “ And then this morning , when Andy Card told him about the first accident , was Andy Card or Condi Rice or any of those aware of the hijackings ?
What did they know when they — -” Fleischer cut in and replied , “ No , at that point they were not . ” [ Knoxville News Sentinel , 9/11/01 ]
So supposedly , 15 minutes after the first crash , none of Bush 's aides , not even Rice back in Washington , DC , knew a thing about the hijackings that had been reported to NORAD 20 minutes earlier ?
This simply is not plausible .
Bush 's Confused Recollection
Bush 's own recollection of the first crash only complicates the picture .
Less than two months after the attacks , Bush made the preposterous claim that he had watched the first attack as it happened on live television .
This is the seventh different account of how Bush learned about the first crash ( in his limousine , from Loewer , from Card , from Rove , from Gottesman , from Rice , from television ) .
On December 4 , 2001 , Bush was asked : “ How did you feel when you heard about the terrorist attack ? ”
Bush replied , “ I was sitting outside the classroom waiting to go in , and I saw an airplane hit the tower — the TV was obviously on .
And I used to fly , myself , and I said , well , there 's one terrible pilot .
I said , it must have been a horrible accident .
But I was whisked off there , I did n't have much time to think about it . ”
[ White House , 12/4/01 ]
There was no film footage of the first attack until at least the following day , and Bush did n't have access to a television until 15 or so minutes later .
[ Washington Times , 10/7/02 ]
The Boston Herald later noted , “ Think about that .
Bush 's remark implies he saw the first plane hit the tower .
But we all know that video of the first plane hitting did not surface until the next day .
Could Bush have meant he saw the second plane hit — which many Americans witnessed ?
No , because he said that he was in the classroom when Card whispered in his ear that a second plane hit . ”
[ Boston Herald , 10/22/02 ]
Bush 's recollection has many precise details .
Is he simply confused ?
It 's doubly strange why his advisors did n't correct him or — at the very least — stop him from repeating the same story only four weeks later .
[ White House , 1/5/02 , CBS , 9/11/02 ]
On January 5 , 2002 , Bush stated : “ Well , I was sitting in a schoolhouse in Florida ... and my Chief of Staff – well , first of all , when we walked into the classroom , I had seen this plane fly into the first building .
There was a TV set on .
And you know , I thought it was pilot error and I was amazed that anybody could make such a terrible mistake .
And something was wrong with the plane ... ” [ White House , 1/5/02 ]
Unfortunately , Bush has never been asked — not even once — to explain these statements .
His memory not only contradicts every single media report , it also contradicts what he said that evening .
In his speech to the nation that evening , Bush said : “ Immediately following the first attack , I implemented our government 's emergency response plans . ”
[ White House , 9/11/01 ]
It 's not known what these emergency plans were , because neither Bush nor anyone in his administration mentioned this immediate response again .
Implementing “ emergency response plans ” seems to completely contradict Bush 's “ by the way ” recollection of a small airplane accident .
Inside the Classroom and the Second Plane Crash
Shortly after his call with National Security Advisor Rice , Bush entered Sandra Kay Daniels 's second - grade class for a photo - op to promote Bush 's education policies .
[ Daily Mail , 9/8/02 ]
The event was to begin precisely at 9:00 , but the call pushed it back to about 9:03 .
[ Washington Times , 10/8/02 , Telegraph ,
12/16/01 , Daily Mail , 9/8/02 ]
Numerous reporters who were traveling with the president , as well as members of the local media , watched from the back of the room .
[ AP , 8/19/02 ( D ) ]
Altogether there were about 150 people in the room , only 16 of them students .
Bush was introduced to the children and then posed for a number of pictures .
Daniels then led the students through some reading exercises ( video footage shows this lasted about three minutes ) .
[ Salon , 9/12/01 ( B ) ]
Bush later related what he was thinking at the time : “ I was concentrating on the program at this point , thinking about what I was going to say [ about the plane crash ] .
Obviously , I felt it was an accident .
I was concerned about it , but there were no alarm bells . ”
[ Washington Times , 10/7/02 ]
At 9:03 , Flight 175 crashed into the South Tower of the World Trade Center .
News of this traveled extremely rapidly .
In fact , some of Bush 's Secret Service agents watched the second crash live on television in an adjacent room .
[ Sarasota Herald - Tribune , 9/10/02 ]
Press Secretary Ari Fleischer , in the same room as Bush but not near him , immediately received the news on his pager .
[ CBS , 9/11/02 ]
Other pagers were going off as well .
Chief of Staff Andrew Card was in a nearby room when he heard the news .
He waited until there was a pause in the reading drill to walk in and tell Bush .
[ Washington Times , 10/7/02 , Washington Times , 10/8/02 ]
The children were getting their books from under their seats to read a story together when Card came in .
[ Daily Mail , 9/8/02 ]
Card whispered to Bush : “ A second plane hit the second tower .
America is under attack . ”
[ San Francisco Chronicle , 9/11/02 ]
Another account has Card saying : “ A second plane has hit the World Trade Center .
America is under attack . ”
[ Telegraph , 12/16/01 ]
Accounts vary as to when Card gave Bush the news .
Some say 9:05 [ Salon 9/11/01 , New York Times ,
9/16/01 ( B ) , Telegraph , 12/16/01 , Albuquerque Tribune , 9/10/02 ] , and some say 9:07 .
[ Washington Post , 9/11/01 , Washington Times ,
10/8/02 ] ABC
News reporter Ann Compton , who was in the room , said she was surprised by the interruption and “ wrote [ the time ] down in my reporter 's notebook , by my watch , 9:07 a.m . ”
[ ABC News , 9/11/02 ]
The Reaction — Or Lack of One
Descriptions vary greatly as to how Bush responded to the news .
It is said he “ blanched ” [ Richmond Times - Dispatch , 10/1/02 ] , “ the color drained from the president 's face ” [ AP , 9/12/01 ( D ) ] , he “ wore a bemused smile ” [ Orlando Sentinel , 9/12/01 ] , “ because visibly tense and serious ” [ Time , 9/12/01 ] , and so on .
Watch the video and draw your own conclusions ( the 11 - minute video can be viewed at the Center for Cooperative Research , Buzzflash , Global Free Press , The Emperor 's New Clothes , or Liberty DYNU ) .
Bush later recalled his own reaction : “ I am very aware of the cameras .
I 'm trying to absorb that knowledge .
I have nobody to talk to .
I 'm sitting in the midst of a classroom with little kids , listening to a children 's story and I realize I 'm the Commander in Chief and the country has just come under attack . ”
[ Telegraph , 12/16/01 , CBS , 11/1/02 ]
Asked again what he thought after he heard the news , Bush said , “ We 're at war and somebody has dared attack us and we 're going to do something about it .
I realized I was in a unique setting to receive a message that somebody attacked us … [ I ]t became evident that we were , you know , that the world had changed . ”
[ CBS , 9/11/02 ]
So what did the Commander in Chief do with the knowledge that the United States was under attack ?
He did nothing .
Bush did not say one word .
He did not ask Card any questions .
He did not give any orders .
He did not know who ( or which country ) was attacking , whether there would be more attacks , what military plans had been taken , what military actions should be taken — indeed , he knew virtually nothing about what was going on outside the room .
He just sat there .
Bush later recalled : “ There was no time for discussion or anything . ” [ Fighting Back : The War on Terrorism — From Inside the Bush White House , by Bill Sammon , 10/02 , pp. 83 - 84 ]
Even stranger , as one newspaper put it , although the nation was under terrorist attack , “ for some reason , Secret Service agents [ did ] not bustle him away . ”
[ Globe and Mail , 9/12/01 ]
Military pilots must have “ permission from the White House because only the president has the authority to order a civilian aircraft shot down . ”
[ CNN , 10/26/99 ]
But if retaliatory strikes needed to the authorized , Bush was not available .
If one of the planes had to be shot down to save more lives on the ground , Bush was not available .
Although several fighters had been dispatched to defend New York City , the pilot of one of the planes flying to catch Flight 175 later noted that it would n't have mattered if he caught up with it , because only Bush could order a shootdown , and Bush could not be reached in the classroom .
[ Cape Cod Times , 8/21/02 ]
Secret Service agents and other security personnel had set up a television in a nearby classroom .
They turned on the TV just as Flight 175 crashed into the World Trade Center .
According to Sarasota County Sheriff Bill Balkwill , who was in the room , a Marine responsible for carrying Bush 's phone immediately said to Balkwill , “ We 're out of here .
Can you get everyone ready ? ” [ Sarasota Herald - Tribune , 9/10 / 02 ]
But he must have been overruled by someone , because Bush did not leave .
Meanwhile , Secret Service agents burst into Vice President Cheney 's White House office .
They carried him under his arms — nearly lifting him off the ground — and propelled him down the steps into the White House basement and through a long tunnel toward an underground bunker .
Accounts of when this happened vary greatly , from 9:06 [ New York Times , 9/16/01 ( B ) , Telegraph , 12/16/01 ] to after 9:30 .
[ CBS , 9/11/02 , Washington Post ,
1/27/02 ]
Cheney 's own account is vague and contradictory .
[ Meet the Press , 9/16/01 ]
The one eyewitness account , by White House photographer David Bohrer , said it happened just after 9:00 .
[ ABC , 9/14/02 ( B ) ]
It 's easy to see why the White House would have wanted this event placed at a later time ( after Bush 's initial statement to the nation rather than after the second crash ) to avoid the obvious question : if Cheney was immediately evacuated , why was n't Bush ?
The Photo - Op Goes On
After Card told Bush about the second plane and quickly left , the classroom was silent for about 30 seconds or so .
[ Tampa Tribune , 9/1/02 ]
The children were about to take turns reading from a story called The Pet Goat .
[ AFP , 9/7/02 ]
Bush picked up the book and began to read with the children .
[ Tampa Tribune , 9/1/02 ]
In unison , the children read out loud , “ The — Pet — Goat .
A — girl — got — a— pet — goat .
But — the — goat — did — some — things — that — made — the — girl's — dad —mad . ”
Bush mostly listened , but occasionally asked the children a few questions to encourage them .
[ Washington Times , 10/7/02 ]
At one point he said , “ Really good readers , whew ! ...
These must be sixth - graders ! ” [ Time , 9/12/01 ]
Who was really in control ?
Certainly not Bush .
In the back of the room , Press Secretary Ari Fleischer caught Bush 's eye and held up a pad of paper for him to see , with “ DON'T SAY ANYTHING YET ” written on it in big block letters .
[ Washington Times , 10/7/02 ]
Some person or people had overruled the security who wanted Bush evacuated immediately , even as Vice President Cheney was taken from his White House office to a safe location .
Bush 's security overruled Bush on security matters later in the day on Air Force One , but who overruled them that morning ?
When Did Bush Leave the Classroom ?
Nearly every news account fails to mention when Bush left the classroom after being told America was under attack .
Three mention 9:12 a.m. [ New York Times , 9/16/01 ( B ) , Telegraph , 12/16/01 , Daily Mail , 9/8/02 ]
Remaining in the classroom for approximately five to seven minutes is inexcusable , but the video of Bush in the classroom suggests he stayed longer than that .
The video contains several edits and ends before Bush leaves the room , so it also does n't tell us exactly how long he stayed .
One newspaper suggested he remained “ for eight or nine minutes ” — sometime between 9:13 and 9:16 , since Card 's arrival is uncertain .
[ Tampa Tribune , 9/1/02 ]
When Bush finally did leave , he did n't act like a man in a hurry .
In fact , he was described as “ openly stretching out the moment . ”
[ Fighting Back : The War on Terrorism — From Inside the Bush White House , by Bill Sammon , 10/02 , p. 89 ]
When the lesson was over , Bush said to the children : “ Hoo !
These are great readers .
Very impressive !
Thank you all so much for showing me your reading skills .
I bet they practice too .
Do n't you ?
Reading more than they watch TV ?
Anybody do that ?
Read more than you watch TV ?
[ Hands go up ]
Oh that 's great !
Very good .
Very important to practice !
Thanks for having me .
Very impressed . ”
[ Transcribed from Booker video , Fighting Back : The War on Terrorism — From Inside the Bush White House , by Bill Sammon , 10/02 , pp. 89-90 ]
Bush still continued to talk , advising the children to stay in school and be good citizens .
[ Tampa Tribune , 9/1/02 , St. Petersburg Times ,
9/8/02 ( B ) ]
One student asked Bush a question , and he gave a quick response on his education policy .
[ New York Post , 9/12/02 ]
The only source to describe what happened next is Fighting Back by Bill Sammon .
Publishers Weekly described Sammon 's book as an “ inside account of the Bush administration 's reaction to 9 - 11 [ and ] a breathless , highly complimentary portrait of the president [ showing ] the great merit and unwavering moral vision of his inner circle . ”
[ Publisher 's Weekly , 10/15/02 ]
Sammon 's conservative perspective makes his account of Bush 's behavior at the end of the photo - op all the more surprising .
Bush is described as smiling and chatting with the children “ as if he did n't have a care in the world ” and “ in the most relaxed manner imaginable . ”
White House aide Gordon Johndroe , then came in as he usually does at the end of press conferences , and said , “ Thank you , press .
If you could step out the door we came in , please . ”
A reporter then asked , “ Mr. President , are you aware of the reports of the plane crash in New York ?
Is there anything ... , ” But Bush interrupted , and no doubt recalling his order , “ DON'T SAY ANYTHING YET , ” Bush responded , “ I 'll talk about it later . ”
But still the president did not leave .
“ He stepped forward and shook hands with [ classroom teacher ]
Daniels , slipping his left hand behind her in another photo - op pose .
He was taking his good old time .
...
Bush lingered until the press was gone . ”
[ Fighting Back : The War on Terrorism — From Inside the Bush White House , by Bill Sammon , 10/02 , p. 90 ]
Think about that : rather than rush out of the room at the first chance , Bush actually stayed until after all the dozens of reporters had left !
Having just been told of a Pearl Harbor - type attack on US soil , Bush was indeed “ openly stretching out the moment . ”
But he still was n't done .
Bush then turned to principal Tose - Rigell , who was waiting to take him to the library for his speech on education .
He explained to her about the terror attacks and why he had to leave .
[ Fighting Back : The War on Terrorism — From Inside the Bush White House , by Bill Sammon , 10/02 , p. 90 ]
Finally , he went to an empty classroom next door where his staff was based .
[ ABC News , 9/11/02 ]
Given that Bush 's program was supposed to end at 9:20 , he left the classroom only a couple of minutes earlier than planned , if even that .
[ Sarasota Herald - Tribune , 9/16/01 ]
Why Stay ?
The reason given why Bush did n't leave as soon as Card told him the news is : “ Without all the facts at hand , George Bush had no intention of upsetting the schoolchildren who had come to read for him . ”
[ MSNBC , 10/29/02 ]
Advisor Karl Rove said , “ The President thought for a second or two about getting up and walking out of the room .
But the drill was coming to a close and he did n't want to alarm the children . ”
[ ABC , 9/11/02 ]
This excuse is patently absurd , given the security risks and importance of Bush being informed and making decisions as Commander in Chief .
Nor was the drill coming to a close : one drill had ended and another was about to begin — it was a perfect time to simply say , “ Excuse me ” and leave the room .
Sarasota - Bradenton International Airport is only 3 ½ miles away ; in fact , Booker was chosen as the location for the photo - op partly because of its proximity to the airport .
[ Sarasota Herald - Tribune , 9/12/02 ]
Hijackers could have crashed a plane into Bush 's publicized location and his security would have been completely helpless to stop it .
Remember , Bush 's schedule had been announced on September 7 and two of the 9/11 hijackers came to Sarasota that same day .
[ White House , 9/7/01 , Longboat Observer , 11/21/01 , Washington Post , 1/27/02 ]
Furthermore , the Secret Service was aware of the strange request for an interview a few hours earlier and the previous night 's report of a person in town who had made violent threats against Bush .
Indeed , a few days after 9/11 , Sarasota 's main newspaper reported , “ Sarasota barely skirted its own disaster .
As it turns out , terrorists targeted the president and Air Force One on Tuesday , maybe even while they were on the ground in Sarasota and certainly not long after .
The Secret Service learned of the threat just minutes after Bush left Booker Elementary . ” [ Sarasota Herald - Tribune , 9/16/01 ]
Bush Lingers On
Once he was out of the classroom , did Bush immediately leave Booker ?
No .
He stayed in the adjacent room with his staff , calling Vice President Cheney and National Security Advisor Rice , and preparing a speech .
[ Telegraph , 12/16/01 , St. Petersburg Times 9/8/02 ]
Incredibly , even as uncertain information began to surface , suggesting that more planes had been hijacked ( eventually 11 planes would be suspected ) [ CBS , 9/11/02 ] , Bush was allowed to make his remarks at 9:30 — exactly the time and place stated on his advance schedule .
[ Federal News Service , 9/10 /01 , see the transcript of his speech here ]
Why has n't Bush 's security staff been criticized for their completely inexplicable decision to stay at the school ?
And why did n't Bush 's concern for the children extend to not making them and the rest of the 200 or so people at the school terrorist targets ?
At 9:16 , NORAD was notified that Flight 93 had been hijacked , and at 9:24 it was notified that Flight 77 had also been hijacked and was heading toward Washington ( though , as discussed above , the hijacking was known long before this ) .
[ NORAD , 9/18/01 ]
No media report has suggested that the possible shooting down of hijacked airplanes was discussed at this time , however .
It appears the discussion was not broached until after 9:55 .
[ Washington Post , 1/27/02 , CBS , 9/11/02 ]
At about 9:26 , it was either FAA head Jane Garvey or FAA administrator Ben Sliney ( and not Bush ) who decided to halt all airplane takeoffs in the US .
[ Time , 9/14/01 , USA Today , 8/13/02 ]
Additionally , no evidence has appeared suggesting Bush had a role in ordering any fighters into the skies .
Finally , to the Airport
By 9:35 , Bush 's motorcade was ready to take him to the Sarasota airport where Air Force One was waiting .
[ Telegraph , 12/16/01 ]
At 9:37 , Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon .
Bush was informed as his motorcade got near the airport .
( Apparently Bush could be reached by phone in his limousine at this time . )
[ Washington Times , 10/8/02 , Telegraph , 12/16/01 ]
The motorcade arrived around 9:43 and pulled up close to Air Force One .
Security conducted an extra - thorough search of all the baggage for the other passengers , delaying takeoff until 9:55 .
[ St. Petersburg Times , 9/8/02 ( B ) ]
A year later , Chief of Staff Andrew Card recalled that , “ As we were heading to Air Force One ... [ we ] learned , what turned out to be a mistake , but we learned that the Air Force One package could in fact be a target . ”
[ MSNBC , 9/9/02 ]
This echoes the report mentioned above that “ terrorists targeted the president and Air Force One ... maybe even while they were on the ground in Sarasota ... ” [ Sarasota Herald - Tribune , 9/16/01 ]
This only increases the strangeness that Bush was n't immediately evacuated at 9:03 as some of his security had recommended .
Bush spoke by telephone to Cheney as the motorcade raced to the airport .
[ St. Petersburg Times 9/8/02 ]
Supposedly , during this call Bush issued an order to ground all flights within the country .
[ Sarasota Magazine , 11/01 ]
The FAA did shut down the nationwide air traffic system at around 9:45 .
[ MSNBC , 9/22/01 , CNN , 9/12/01 , New York Times ,
9/12/01 , Newsday , 9/10/02 , Washington Post , 9/12/01 ]
But other reports state that it was FAA administrator Ben Sliney who made the decision without consulting anyone .
[ USA Today ,
8/13/02 , USA Today ,
8/13/02 ( B ) ]
For some time it was claimed that Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta had made the decision , but it was later revealed that Mineta did n't even know of the order until 15 minutes later .
Apparently , “ FAA officials had begged [ the reporter ] to maintain the fiction . ” [ Slate , 4/2/02 ]
The idea that Bush made the decision is even less plausible .
In fact , there is no evidence at all to suggest that Bush had by this point made even one decision relevant to his security or that of the country .
Air Force One Takes Off Without Fighter Escort
Air Force
One took off at either 9:55 or 9:57 a.m. [ CNN , 9/12/01 , New York Times ,
9/12/01 , Telegraph ,
12/16/01 , CBS , 9/11/02 , Washington Post ,
9/12/01 , Washington Post ,
1/27/02 , AP , 9/12/01 ] Communications Director Dan Bartlett remembered , “ It was like a rocket .
For a good ten minutes , the plane was going almost straight up . ” [ CBS , 9/11/02 ]
But , incredibly , Air Force
One took off without any military fighter protection .
This defies all explanation .
Recall that at 9:03 a.m. , one of Bush 's security people said , “ We 're out of here .
Can you get everyone ready ? ” [ Sarasota Herald - Tribune , 9/10/02 ]
Certainly , long before Bush left the elementary school at 9:35 a.m. , arrangements would have been made to get fighters to Sarasota as soon as possible .
Not only would it have been advisable to protect Air Force One , but it would have been only sensible as another way to protect Bush on the ground from terrorist attack even before he left the school .
In Florida , there were two bases said to have fighters on 24 - hour alert , capable of getting airborne in approximately five minutes .
Homestead Air Station , 185 miles from Sarasota , and Tyndall Air Station , 235 miles from Sarasota ; both had the highest readiness status on 9/11 .
Presumably , as happened at other bases across the country , just after 9:03 , base commanders throughout Florida would have immediately begun preparations to get their fighters ready .
[ Aviation Week and Space Technology , 6/3/02 ]
Fighters left bases on the same alert status and traveled similar distances to reach Washington , DC , well before 10:00 , so why were the fighters delayed in Florida ?
[ Aviation Week and Space Technology , 9/9/02 ]
Military planes should have been over Sarasota by the time Bush left Booker at 9:35 a.m .
Yet , as will be described below , more than one hour after Air Force
One took off , there were still no fighters protecting it !
An administration official claimed , “ The object seemed to be simply to get the President airborne and out of the way . ”
[ Telegraph , 12/16/01 ]
But without fighter cover this makes little sense , because the sky was arguably more dangerous than the ground .
At the time , there were still over 3,000 planes in the air over the US [ USA Today , 8/13/02 ( B ) ] , including about half of the planes in the region of Florida where Bush was .
[ St. Petersburg Times , 9/7/02 ]
Recall , too , that the Secret Service learned of a threat to Bush and Air Force One “ just minutes after Bush left Booker Elementary . ”
Karl Rove , also on Air Force
One , confirmed that a dangerous threat was known before the plane took off : “ They also made it clear they wanted to get us up quickly , and they wanted to get us to a high altitude , because there had been a specific threat made to Air Force One ....
A declaration that Air Force One was a target , and said in a way that they called it credible . ”
[ New Yorker , 10/1/01 ]
Shoot Down Authorized — Too Late
Once he was airborne , Bush talked to Cheney again and Cheney recommended that Bush “ order our aircraft to shoot down these airliners that have been hijacked . ” [ CBS , 9/11/02 ]
“ I said ,  You bet ,  ” Bush later recalled .
“ We had a little discussion , but not much . ” [ Newsday , 9/23/01 , USA Today , 9/16/01 , Washington Post , 1/27/02 ]
However , even though only Bush had the authority to order a passenger plane shot down [ CNN , 10/26/99 ] , the order was apparently given before Bush discussed it with Cheney .
One flight commander recalled , “ After the Pentagon was hit , we were told there were more [ airliners ] coming .
Not might be ; they were coming . ”
A call from someone in the White House declared the Washington area “ a free - fire zone , ” meaning , according to one of the responding fighter pilots , “ we were given authority to use force , if the situation required it . ”
[ Aviation Week and Space Technology , 9/9/02 ]
Extraordinary times can demand extraordinary measures , so having someone other than Bush give this order could be understandable .
But Bush was available and talking to people like Cheney after 9:30 a.m .
Around this time , officials feared that as many as 11 airliners had been hijacked [ CBS , 9/11/02 ] , so why were n't Bush and Cheney even considering this course of action until about 10:00 a.m.?
Was Bush being kept out of the loop in reality , or only in the media reports ?
Is the lateness of this discussion merely political spin to reduce speculation that Flight 93 had been shot down ?
Flight 93 was still in the air after the Bush authorization , and fighters were given orders to shoot it down if necessary .
[ ABC News , 9/11/02 ] NORAD knew at 9:16 a.m. that Flight 93 was hijacked [ NORAD , 9/18/01 ] , but supposedly fighters were n't scrambled until minutes before it crashed at 10:06 a.m .
Going Nowhere as Threats Increase
Shortly after takeoff , Cheney apparently informed Bush of “ a credible threat ” to Air Force One .
[ AP , 9/13/01 ( D ) ]
US Representative Adam Putnam “ had barely settled into his seat on Air Force One ... when he got the news that terrorists apparently had set their sights on the plane . ”
[ Orlando Sentinel , 9/14/01 ]
The Secret Service had received an anonymous call : “ Air Force One is next . ”
The caller allegedly knew the agency 's code words relating to Air Force One procedures .
Pilot Colonel Mark Tillman was told of the threat and he asked that an armed guard be stationed at the cockpit door .
The Associated Press reported that the threat came “ within the same hour ” as the Pentagon crash ( i.e. , before 10:00 a.m. , roughly when the plane took off ) .
[ AP , 9/13/01 ( D ) ]
Details suggest this threat was not the same as the earlier one , but it 's hard to know for sure .
In his comments at Booker , Bush said he was immediately flying back to Washington , but soon after takeoff , he , Cheney and the Secret Service began arguing whether it was safe to fly back to the capital .
[ Telegraph , 12/16/01 ]
Andrew Card told Bush , “ We 've got to let the dust settle before we go back . ”
[ St. Petersburg Times , 9/8/02 ]
The plane apparently stayed over Sarasota until the argument was settled .
Accounts differ , but until about 10:35 a.m. [ CBS , 9/11/02 ( B ) , Washington Post , 1/27/02 ] , Air Force
One “ appeared to be going nowhere .
The journalists on board – all of whom were barred from communicating with their offices – sensed that the plane was flying in big , slow circles . ”
[ Telegraph , 12/16/01 ]
Cheney apparently called Bush again at 10:32 a.m. , and told him of another threat to Air Force One .
Within minutes , the argument was over , and the plane turned away from Washington and flew to Louisiana instead .
[ Washington Post , 1/27/02 ]
Bush recalled : “ I wanted to come back to Washington , but the circumstances were such that it was just impossible for the Secret Service or the national security team to clear the way for Air Force One to come back . ”
[ CBS , 9/11/02 ]
Given that the rocket - like takeoff was due to a threat , this must have been another threat , possibly even a third threat .
Around 10:55 a.m. , there was yet another threat to Air Force One .
The pilot , Colonel Mark Tillman , said he was warned that a suspect airliner was dead ahead .
“ Coming out of Sarasota there was one call that said there was an airliner off our nose that they did not have contact with . ”
Tillman took evasive action , pulling his plane even higher above normal traffic .
[ CBS , 9/11/02 ( B ) ]
Reporters on board noticed the rise in elevation .
[ Dallas Morning News ,
8/28/02 , Salon , 9/12/01 ]
The report was apparently a false alarm , but it shows the folly of having Bush fly without a fighter escort .
Were There Threats to Air Force One ?
The threat or threats to Air Force
One were announced on September 12 , after mounting criticism that Bush was out of sight in Louisiana and Nebraska during most of the day and did not return to Washington until 10 hours after the attacks .
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said there was “ real and credible information that the White House and Air Force One were targets . ”
[ White House , 9/12/01 ]
On September 13 , New York Times columnist William Safire wrote — and Bush 's political strategist Karl Rove confirmed — that there was an “ inside ” threat that “ may have broken the secret codes [ showing a knowledge of presidential procedures ] . ”
[ New York Times , 9/13/01 ]
Had terrorists hacked their way into sensitive White House computers ?
Was there a mole in the White House ?
No .
It turned out the entire story was made up .
[ Washington Post , 9/27/01 ]
The press expressed considerable skepticism about the story .
For instance , one Florida newspaper thought Fleischer 's disclosure was “ an apparent effort to explain why the president was flown to Air Force bases ” before returning to Washington .
[ St. Petersburg Times , 9/13/01 ]
When asked on September 15 about the “ credible evidence , ” Fleischer said , “ we exhausted that topic about two days ago . ”
[ White House , 9/15/01 ]
On September 26 , CBS News reported : “ Finally , there is this postscript to the puzzle of how someone presumed to be a terrorist was able to call in a threat against Air Force
One using a secret code name for the president 's plane .
Well , as it turns out , that simply never happened .
Sources say White House staffers apparently misunderstood comments made by their security detail . ”
[ CBS , 9/26/01 ]
One former official who served in George Bush Sr.'s administration told Human Events Online , which bills itself as “ the national conservative weekly , ” that he was “ deeply disappointed by [ Bush 's ] zigzagging across the country . ”
[ Human Events Online , 9/17/01 ]
At the end of the month , Slate magazine awarded its “ Whopper of the Week ” to Karl Rove , Ari Fleischer , and Dick Cheney .
[ Slate , 9/28/01 ]
No one knew exactly where the bogus story originated from , but “ what can be safely said is that it served the White House 's immediate purposes , even though it was completely untrue . ”
[ Telegraph , 12/16/01 ]
What were those purposes ?
A well - informed , anonymous Washington official said , “ It did two things for [ Cheney ] .
It reinforced his argument that the President should stay out of town , and it gave George W. an excellent reason for doing so . ”
[ Telegraph , 12/16/01 ]
When Bush was asked in May 2002 why he had flown to two Air Force bases before returning to Washington , Bush said , “ I was trying to get out of harm 's way . ”
[ White House , 5/21/02 ]
The most obviously bogus threat — the mole knowing secret codes — came from Cheney in a pivotal moment in his argument with Bush over where Bush should go .
But were the other threats , for instance , the one made before Air Force
One even took off , or the airline suspected of crashing into Air Force One , also bogus ?
When Does the Fighter Escort Finally Arrive ?
Much like the time when Bush left the Booker classroom , the time when fighters finally reached Air Force
One is rarely mentioned , and when it is , the facts are highly debatable .
According to one account , around 10:00 a.m. Air Force
One was “ joined by an escort of F - 16 fighters from a base near Jacksonville , Florida . ”
[ Telegraph , 12/16/01 ]
But one month later , it was reported that in Cheney 's 10:32 phone call , he told Bush that it would take another 40 to 90 minutes [ as late as noon ] to get protective fighters up to escort Air Force One .
[ Washington Post , 1/27/02 ]
Another account said , “ Air Force One headed toward Jacksonville [ at 10:41 ] to meet jets scrambled to give the presidential jet its own air cover , ” but it is n't said when the plane actually met up with the fighters .
[ New York Times , 9/16/01 ( B ) ]
We know that when Air Force One took evasive action around 10:55 , there was no fighter escort .
NORAD commander Major General Larry Arnold later said , “ We scrambled available airplanes from Tyndall [ note this is near Tallahassee , not Jacksonville , Florida ] and then from Ellington in Houston , Texas , ” but he does n't say when .
[ Code One Magazine , 1/02 ]
In another account , the first two F - 16s to arrive are piloted by Shane Brotherton and Randy Roberts , from the Texas Air National Guard , not from any Florida base .
[ CBS , 9/11/02 ]
All that 's known for sure is that by 11:30 there were six fighters protecting Air Force One .
[ Sarasota Magazine , 9/19/01 ]
It would appear that fighters arrived some time between 11:00 and 11:30 .
These fighters were supposed to be on 24 - hour alert , ready to get into the air in about five minutes .
If we assume the fighters flew at a speed of 1,100 mph , the same speed Major Gen .
Arnold said fighters used to reach New York City earlier in the day when traveling a comparable distance [ MSNBC , 9/23/01 ( C ) , Slate , 1/16/02 ] , the fighters should have reached Sarasota in about 10 minutes .
Yet they took around two hours to reach Air Force
One from when they were likely first needed , shortly after 9:00 .
This clearly goes beyond mere incompetence , yet no newspaper article has ever raised the issue .
Was Cheney able to prevent the fighters from reaching Air Force One , perhaps to convince Bush not to return to Washington ?
If so , why ?
Did Cheney assume ( or know ) that Bush was in no real danger ?
Like so many other questions surrounding 9/11 , we do not know .
Barksdale Air Force Base
Air Force One at Barksdale Air Force Base . [ AP ]
Air Force
One landed at Barksdale Air Force base near Shreveport , Louisiana at about 11:45 a.m. [ CBS , 9/11/02 , Telegraph , 12/16/01 , Sarasota Magazine , 11/01 ]
“ The official reason for landing at Barksdale was that Bush felt it necessary to make a further statement , but it is n't unreasonable to assume that – as there was no agreement as to what the President 's movements should be it was felt he might as well be on the ground as in the air . ”
[ Telegraph , 12/16/01 , CBS , 9/11/02 ]
Ironically , the landing came only a short time after Bush 's plane was finally protected by fighters .
There was quite a difference in the protection afforded Bush at Barksdale and what was in Sarasota .
Bush was left unprotected at a known location in Sarasota for nearly 30 minutes .
At Barksdale , a location that was at the time unknown , Congressman Dan Miller “ was amazed at the armored equipment and soldiers with automatic weapons that immediately surrounded the plane . ”
[ Sarasota Magazine , 11/01 ]
Bush was driven to base headquarters in a Humvee escorted by armed outriders .
Reporters and others remained under strict orders not to give out their location .

Shortly after 12:30 p.m. , Bush taped a short speech , which he wrote on a napkin .
[ Louisiana Life , Autumn 2002 , Salon , 9/12/01 , Washington Times , 10/8/02 ]
The tape was broadcast on television at around 1:20 p.m. [ Salon 9/11/01 ]
He also “ spent the next hour and a half talking on the phone , ” again arguing with Cheney and others over where he should go next .
[ Sarasota Magazine , 11/01 ]

Bush told Karl Rove : “ I want to go back home as soon as possible . ”
Rove answered : “ Our people are saying it 's unstable still . ” [ AP , 9/13/01 ( D ) ]
Bush was told he could get to the US Strategic Command center in Offutt , Nebraska , quicker than he could fly to Washington , so he agreed to go to Nebraska .
[ Telegraph , 12/16/01 , AP , 9/13/01 ( D ) ]
Just after 1:00 p.m. , Bush supposedly “ received an intelligence report from the base commander that a high - speed object was headed for his ranch in Crawford , Texas . ”
It turned out to be another false alarm .
[ Fighting Back : The War on Terrorism — From Inside the Bush White House , by Bill Sammon , 10/02 , p.117 ]
This may well be another bogus report designed to explain why Bush did n't return to Washington at this time , since US airspace was declared clear except for some military and emergency flights at 12:16 p.m. [ USA Today , 8/12/02 ( C ) ]
By 12:30 , the FAA reported that only about 50 of these flights were still flying in US airspace , and none were reporting problems [ CNN , 9/12/01 , New York Times , 9/12/01 ] , so how could an unknown plane have been headed toward Bush 's ranch 30 minutes after that ?

Rice recalled that during the meeting , Tenet told Bush , “ Sir , I believe it 's al - Qaeda .
We 're doing the assessment but it looks like , it feels like , it smells like al - Qaeda . ” [ CBS , 9/11/02 ]
By this time , people were anticipating and expecting another reassuring public statement from Bush .
[ Orlando Sentinel , 9/12/01 ]
The White House staff was preparing for Bush to address the nation from the Offutt bunker , but Bush decided instead to return to Washington .
[ CBS , 9/11/02 ]
As a side note , Warren Buffett , one of the richest people in the world , was hosting an unpublicized charity benefit inside the high security Offutt military base at 8:00 a.m .

[ San Francisco Business Times , 2/1/02 ]
They watched a lot of the television coverage that morning , but it 's unknown if any of these people were still at Offutt by the time Bush arrived in the afternoon .

Around 9:00 p.m. , Bush met with his full National Security Council , followed roughly half an hour later by a meeting with a smaller group of key advisors .
Bush and his advisors had already decided bin Laden was behind the attacks .
CIA Director Tenet told Bush that al - Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan were essentially one and the same .
[ Washington Post , 1/27/02 ]
Before going to sleep around 11:30 p.m. , Bush wrote in his diary , “ The Pearl Harbor of the 21st century took place today ....
We think it 's Osama bin Laden . ” [ Washington Post , 1/27/02 ]
Rewriting History
The many accounts of what happened to Bush on 9/11 are riddled with disinformation of false threats , omitted details , fudged timing , and more .
But around September 11 , 2002 , the heavily publicized first anniversary of the attacks , there was an obvious attempt to further rewrite the story .
Chief of Staff Andrew Card claimed that after he told Bush about the second World Trade Center crash , “ it was only a matter of seconds ” before Bush “ excused himself very politely to the teacher and to the students , and he left ” the classroom .
Card also stated that Bush “ quickly excused himself to a holding room . ”
[ San Francisco Chronicle , 9/11/02 ]
In a different account , Card said , “ Not that many seconds later the president excused himself from the classroom . ”
[ MSNBC , 9/9/02 ]
The Booker school video shows these statements are lies — unless “ a matter of seconds ” means over 700 seconds !
Sandra Kay Daniels , the teacher whose second - grade classroom Bush visited on 9/11 , told the Los Angeles Times that after Card informed Bush of the second crash , Bush got up and left .
“ He said ,  Ms. Daniels , I have to leave now .  ...
Looking at his face , you knew something was wrong .
I said a little prayer for him .
He shook my hand and left . ”
Daniels also said , “ I knew something was up when President Bush did n't pick up the book and participate in the lesson . ”
[ Los Angeles Times , 9/11/02 ]
However , the Booker video clearly shows that Bush did follow along after being told of the second plane .
[ Video : Center for Cooperative Research , Buzzflash , Global Free Press , The Emperor 's New Clothes , or Liberty DYNU ]
The New York Post reported , “ A federal agent rushed into the room to inform the president of the United States .
President Bush had been presiding over [ Daniels 's ] reading class last 9/11 , when a Secret Service agent interrupted the lesson and asked ,  Where can we get to a television ?  ” Daniels then claimed that Bush left the class even before the second crash : “ The president bolted right out of here and told me :  Take over .  ” When the second crash occurred , she claims her students were watching TV in a nearby media room .
[ New York Post , 9/12/02 ]
This article is riddled with errors .
As mentioned previously , the Secret Service was already watching the second plane crash live on television in an adjacent room at 9:03 — long before this supposedly happened .
Nor did Bush “ bolt ” out of the room ; in fact , even pro-Bush author Bill Sammon called Bush “ the dawdler in chief ” for taking so long to leave the room .

Bush himself took part in the historical revisionism .
In an extensive video interview shown on CBS 's “ 60 Minutes , ” he again repeated his bizarre belief that he was watching television when the first crash took place .
CBS also revived the false story that terrorists had broken Air Force One 's secret codes , even though it was CBS who debunked that same story nearly a year earlier .
[ CBS , 9/11/02 ]
Vital Questions Remain Unanswered
Needless to say , in the anniversary hoopla , Bush and other leaders were described as “ resolute , ” “ brave , ” “ strong , ” and so forth .
Even the minor level of media criticism just after 9/11 that led to several reporters losing their jobs was absent .
The topic of Bush 's behavior on 9/11 has been barely mentioned in the media since .
There are many questions that deserve answers .
So many pieces of the puzzle do not fit .
Simply by reading the mainstream media reports , we can see that mere incompetence does n't explain what happened to Bush on that day .
For instance , it makes no sense that Bush would listen to a story about a goat long after being told the US was under attack , and even after the Secret Service decided to immediately evacuate him from the school .
It defies explanation that Air Force One 's fighter escort took two hours to appear .
And it is mind - boggling that there are seven different versions of how Bush learned about the first crash .
It 's doubtful that the Independent Commission investigation will look critically at what Bush did on 9/11 and why he did it .
Despite the contradictory reports , no one in the mainstream media has yet demanded clarification of the many obvious inconsistencies and problems of the official version .
Anyone even asking questions has been quickly insulted as anti-American , accused of bashing the president in a time of war , or branded a conspiracy nut .
Only a few relatives of the 9/11 attacks have been able to raise these issues publicly .
For instance , Kristen Breitweiser told Phil Donahue : “ It was clear that we were under attack .
Why did n't the Secret Service whisk [ Bush ] out of that school ? ... [ H ]e is the commander - in - chief of the United States of America , our country was clearly under attack , it was after the second building was hit .
I want to know why he sat there for 25 minutes . ”
[ Donahue , 8/13/02 ]
But so far , few have listened to their concerns .
Because the media has failed in its role to ask these questions , much less attempt to answer them , it is now the responsibility of ordinary Americans — of you , of me , and the people we know — to gather the information , look for answers , and sound the alarm .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A tornado damaged the building housing a nuclear research reactor at Kansas State University , the university told the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission in an event report early Thursday .
The tornado caused extensive damage to the building , but no damage to the reactor , which had been shut down properly earlier in the day , the university said .
The reactor is located in Manhattan in Riley County , about 120 miles west of Kansas City , Missouri .
Because of the event , the university declared an alert , which is the second lowest of the NRC ’s four emergency classifications .
There are more than 30 operating research and test reactors in the United States , according to the NRC ’s website .
Exxon Mobil Corp.'s $ 10.89 billion first - quarter profit report Thursday ranks as one of the biggest hauls in U.S. corporate history .
But the results disappointed Wall Street and added to concerns about the future of the industry .
Exxon , the world 's biggest non-government controlled oil company by market capitalization , notched a 17.3 % increase in profit over the year - earlier period largely from the surge in oil prices , which set new records earlier this year .
Yet the earnings discouraged investors , who at one point sent Exxon shares down as much as 5.1 % in intraday composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , the stock 's largest one - day drop since January .
At 4 p.m. , its shares finished at $ 89.70 , down $ 3.37 , or 3.6 % .
Among the biggest concerns : A number of factors conspired to affect production , pushing down the number of barrels pumped by 9.9 % from a year earlier .
Exxon Mobil 's head of investor relations , Henry Hubble , conceded the quarter was a rare " miss " for the energy giant , with earnings falling about $ 600 million short of analysts ' predictions .
It was all the more disappointing to investors because surprisingly strong earnings reports by BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC earlier this week had raised hopes Exxon also would exceed expectations .
The soaring profits from fossil - fuels are coming as the rules for the industry are being rewritten , pressuring oil companies to move beyond fossil fuels to new sources of energy .
With new finds rare and the best sources in countries that limit Western investors , crude oil is no longer viewed as the abundant , dominant fuel it once was .
Critics contend that unless these companies focus more on the future , today 's record profits could dry up .
This time there were no robes , no hoods , no masks .
Students were expected to become friends , and allies .
And everyone knew why you were in the classroom .
It would have been pointless to pretend you were n't in the Conspiracy .
Their sensei was Jeffreyssai , who might have been the best of his era , in his era .
His students were either the most promising learners , or those whom the beisutsukai saw political advantage in molding .
Brennan fell into the latter category , and knew it .
Nor had he hesitated to use his Mistress 's name to open doors .
You used every avenue available to you , in seeking knowledge ; that was respected here .
" — for over thirty years , " Jeffreyssai said .
" Not one of them saw it ; not Einstein , not Schrödinger , not even von Neumann . "
He turned away from his sketcher , and toward the classroom .
" I pose to you to the question : How did they fail ? "
The students exchanged quick glances , a calculus of mutual risk between the wary and the merely baffled .
Jeffreyssai was known to play games .
Finally Hiriwa - called - the - Black leaned forward , jangling slightly as her equation - carved bracelets shifted on her ankles .
" By your years given , sensei , this was two hundred and fifty years after Newton .
Surely , the scientists of that era must have grokked the concept of a universal law . "
" Knowing the universal law of gravity , " said the student Taji , from a nearby seat , " is not the same as understanding the concept of a universal law . "
He was one of the promising ones , as was Hiriwa .
Hiriwa frowned .
" No ... it was said that Newton had been praised for discovering the first universal .
Even in his own era .
So it was known . "
Hiriwa paused .
" But Newton himself would have been gone .
Was there a religious injunction against proposing further universals ?
Did they refrain out of respect for Newton , or were they waiting for his ghost to speak ?
I am not clear on how Eld science was motivated — "
" No , " murmured Taji , a laugh in his voice , " you really , really are n't . "
Jeffreyssai's expression was kindly .
" Hiriwa , it was n't religion , and it was n't lead in the drinking water , and they did n't all have Alzheimers , and they were n't sitting around all day reading webcomics .
Forget the catalogue of horrors out of ancient times .
Just think in terms of cognitive errors .
What could Eld science have been thinking wrong ? "
Hiriwa sat back with a sigh .
" Sensei , I truly cannot imagine a snafu that would do that . "
" It would n't be just one mistake , " Taji corrected her .
" As the saying goes : Mistakes do n't travel alone ; they hunt in packs . "
" But the entire human species ? " said Hiriwa .
" Thirty years ? "
" It was n't the entire human species , Hiriwa , " said Styrlyn .
He was one of the older - looking students , wearing a short beard speckled in grey .
" Maybe one in a hundred thousand could have written out Schrödinger 's Equation from memory .
So that would have been their first and primary error — failure to concentrate their forces . "
" Spare us the propaganda ! " Jeffreyssai's gaze was suddenly fierce .
" You are not here to proselytize for the Cooperative Conspiracy , my lord politician !
Bend not the truth to make your points !
I believe your Conspiracy has a phrase : ' Comparative advantage . '
Do you really think that it would have helped to call in the whole human species , as it existed at that time , to debate quantum physics ? "
Styrlyn did n't flinch .
" Perhaps not , sensei , " he said .
" But if you are to compare that era to this one , it is a consideration . "
Jeffreyssai moved his hand flatly through the air ; the maybe - gesture he used to dismiss an argument that was true but not relevant .
" It is not what I would call a primary mistake .
The puzzle should not have required a billion physicists to solve . "
" I can think of more specific ancient horrors , " said Taji .
" Spending all day writing grant proposals .
Teaching undergraduates who would rather be somewhere else .
Needing to publish thirty papers a year to get tenure ... "
" But we are not speaking of only the lower - status scientists , " said Yin ; she wore a slightly teasing grin .
" It was said of Schrödinger that he retired to a villa for a month , with his mistress to provide inspiration , and emerged with his eponymous equation .
We consider it a famous historical success of our methodology .
Some Eld physicists did understand how to focus their mental energies ; and would have been senior enough to do so , had they chose . "
" True , " Taji said .
" In the end , administrative burdens are only a generic obstacle .
Likewise such answers as , ' They were not trained in probability theory , and did not know of cognitive biases . '
Our sensei seems to desire some more specific reply . "
Jeffreyssai lifted an eyebrow encouragingly .
" Do n't dismiss your line of thought so quickly , Taji ; it begins to be relevant .
What kind of system would create administrative burdens on its own people ? "
" A system that failed to support its people adequately , " said Styrlyn .
" One that failed to value their work . "
" Ah , " said Jeffreyssai .
" But there is a student who has not yet spoken .
Brennan ? "
Brennan did n't jump .
He deliberately waited just long enough to show he was n't scared , and then said , " Lack of pragmatic motivation , sensei . "
Jeffreyssai smiled slightly .
" Expand . "
What kind of system would create administrative burdens on its own people ? , their sensei had asked them .
The other students were pursuing their own lines of thought .
Brennan , hanging back , had more attention to spare for his teacher 's few hints .
Being the beginner was n't always a disadvantage — and he had been taught , long before the Bayesians took him in , to take every available advantage .
" The Manhattan Project , " Brennan said , " was launched with a specific technological end in sight : a weapon of great power , in time of war .
But the error that Eld Science committed with respect to quantum physics had no immediate consequences for their technology .
They were confused , but they had no desperate need for an answer .
Otherwise the surrounding system would have removed all burdens from their effort to solve it .
Surely the Manhattan Project must have done so — Taji ?
Do you know ? "
Taji looked thoughtful .
" Not all burdens — but I 'm pretty sure they were n't writing grant proposals in the middle of their work . "
" So , " Jeffreyssai said .
He advanced a few steps , stood directly in front of Brennan 's desk .
" You think Eld scientists simply were n't trying hard enough .
Because their art had no military applications ?
A rather competitive point of view , I should think . "
" Not necessarily , " Brennan said calmly .
" Pragmatism is a virtue of rationality also .
A desired use for a better quantum theory , would have helped the Eld scientists in many ways beyond just motivating them .
It would have given shape to their curiosity , and told them what constituted success or failure . "
Jeffreyssai chuckled slightly .
" Do n't guess so hard what I might prefer to hear , Competitor .
Your first statement came closer to my hidden mark ; your oh - so - Bayesian disclaimer fell wide ...
The factor I had in mind , Brennan , was that Eld scientists thought it was acceptable to take thirty years to solve a problem .
Their entire social process of science was based on getting to the truth eventually .
A wrong theory got discarded eventually — once the next generation of students grew up familiar with the replacement .
Work expands to fill the time allotted , as the saying goes .
But people can think important thoughts in far less than thirty years , if they expect speed of themselves . "
Jeffreyssai suddenly slammed down a hand on the arm of Brennan 's chair .
" How long do you have to dodge a thrown knife ? "
" Very little time , sensei ! "
" Less than a second !
Two opponents are attacking you !
How long do you have to guess who 's more dangerous ? "
" Less than a second , sensei ! "
" The two opponents have split up and are attacking two of your girlfriends !
How long do you have to decide which one you truly love ? "
" Less than a second , sensei !'
" A new argument shows your precious theory is flawed !
How long does it take you to change your mind ? "
" Less than a second , sensei ! "
" WRONG ! DON'T GIVE ME THE WRONG ANSWER JUST BECAUSE IT FITS A CONVENIENT PATTERN AND I SEEM TO EXPECT IT OF YOU !
How long does it really take , Brennan ? "
Sweat was forming on Brennan 's back , but he stopped and actually thought about it —
" ANSWER , BRENNAN ! "
" No sensei !
I 'm not finished thinking sensei !
An answer would be premature !
Sensei ! "
" Very good !
Continue !
But do n't take thirty years ! "
Brennan breathed deeply , reforming his thoughts .
He finally said , " Realistically , sensei , the best - case scenario is that I would see the problem immediately ; use the discipline of suspending judgment ; try to re-accumulate all the evidence before continuing ; and depending on how emotionally attached I had been to the theory , use the crisis - of - belief technique to ensure I could genuinely go either way .
So at least five minutes and perhaps up to an hour . "
" Good !
You actually thought about it that time !
Think about it every time !
Break patterns !
In the days of Eld Science , Brennan , it was not uncommon for a grant agency to spend six months reviewing a proposal .
They permitted themselves the time !
You are being graded on your speed , Brennan !
The question is not whether you get there eventually !
Anyone can find the truth in five thousand years !
You need to move faster ! "
" Yes , sensei ! "
" Now , Brennan , have you just learned something new ? "
" Yes , sensei ! "
" How long did it take you to learn this new thing ? "
An arbitrary choice there ...
" Less than a minute , sensei , from the boundary that seems most obvious . "
" Less than a minute , " Jeffreyssai repeated .
" So , Brennan , how long do you think it should take to solve a major scientific problem , if you are not wasting any time ? "
Now there was a trapped question if Brennan had ever heard one .
There was no way to guess what time period Jeffreyssai had in mind — what the sensei would consider too long , or too short .
Which meant that the only way out was to just try for the genuine truth ; this would offer him the defense of honesty , little defense though it was .
" One year , sensei ? "
" Do you think it could be done in one month , Brennan ?
In a case , let us stipulate , where in principle you already have enough experimental evidence to determine an answer , but not so much experimental evidence that you can afford to make errors in interpreting it . "
Again , no way to guess which answer Jeffreyssai might want ...
" One month seems like an unrealistically short time to me , sensei . "
" A short time ? " Jeffreyssai said incredulously .
" How many minutes in thirty days ?
Hiriwa ? "
" 43200 , sensei , " she answered .
" If you assume sixteen - hour waking periods and daily sleep , then 28800 minutes . "
" Assume , Brennan , that it takes five whole minutes to think an original thought , rather than learning it from someone else .
Does even a major scientific problem require 5760 distinct insights ? "
" I confess , sensei , " Brennan said slowly , " that I have never thought of it that way before ... but do you tell me that is truly a realistic level of productivity ? "
" No , " said Jeffreyssai , " but neither is it realistic to think that a single problem requires 5760 insights .
And yes , it has been done . "
Jeffreyssai stepped back , and smiled benevolently .
Every student in the room stiffened ; they knew that smile .
" Though none of you hit the particular answer that I had in mind , nonetheless your answers were as reasonable as mine .
Except Styrlyn's , I 'm afraid .
Even Hiriwa 's answer was not entirely wrong : the task of proposing new theories was once considered a sacred duty reserved for those of high status , there being a limited supply of problems in circulation , at that time .
But Brennan 's answer is particularly interesting , and I am minded to test his theory of motivation . "
Oh , hell , Brennan said silently to himself .
Jeffreyssai was gesturing for Brennan to stand up before the class .
When Brenann had risen , Jeffreyssai neatly seated himself in Brennan 's chair .
" Brennan - sensei , " Jeffreyssai said , " you have five minutes to think of something stunningly brilliant to say about the failure of Eld science on quantum physics .
As for the rest of us , our job will be to gaze at you expectantly .
I can only imagine how embarrassing it will be , should you fail to think of anything good . "
Bastard .
Brennan did n't say it aloud .
Taji's face showed a certain amount of sympathy ; Styrlyn held himself aloof from the game ; but Yin was looking at him with sardonic interest .
Worse , Hiriwa was gazing at him expectantly , assuming that he would rise to the challenge .
And Jeffreyssai was gawking wide - eyed , waiting for the guru 's words of wisdom .
Screw you , sensei .
Brennan did n't panic .
It was very , very , very far from being the scariest situation he 'd ever faced .
He took a moment to decide how to think ; then thought .
At four minutes and thirty seconds , Brennan spoke .
( There was an art to such things ; as long as you were doing it anyway , you might as well make it look easy . )
" A woman of wisdom , " Brennan said , " once told me that it is wisest to regard our past selves as fools beyond redemption — to see the people we once were as idiots entire .
I do not necessarily say this myself ; but it is what she said to me , and there is more than a grain of truth in it .
As long as we are making excuses for the past , trying to make it look better , respecting it , we can not make a clean break .
It occurs to me that the rule may be no different for human civilizations .
So I tried looking back and considering the Eld scientists as simple fools . "
" Which they were not , " Jeffreyssai said .
" Which they were not , " Brennan continued .
" In terms of raw intelligence , they undoubtedly exceeded me .
But it occurred to me that a difficulty in seeing what Eld scientists did wrong , might have been in respecting the ancient and legendary names too highly .
And that did indeed produce an insight . "
" Enough introduction , Brennan , " said Jeffreyssai .
" If you found an insight , state it . "
" Eld scientists were not trained ... "
Brennan paused .
" No , untrained is not the concept .
They were trained for the wrong task .
At that time , there were no Conspiracies , no secret truths ; as soon as Eld scientists solved a major problem , they published the solution to the world and each other .
Truly scary and confusing open problems would have been in extremely rare supply , and used up the moment they were solved .
So it would not have been possible to train Eld researchers to bring order out of scientific chaos .
They would have been trained for something else — I'm not sure what — "
" Trained to manipulate whatever science had already been discovered , " said Taji .
" It was a difficult enough task for Eld teachers to train their students to use existing knowledge , or follow already - known methodologies ; that was all Eld science teachers aspired to impart . "
Brennan nodded .
" Which is a very different matter from creating new science of their own .
The Eld scientists faced with problems of quantum theory , might never have faced that kind of fear before — the dismay of not knowing .
The Eld scientists might have seized on unsatisfactory answers prematurely , because they were accustomed to working with a neat , agreed - upon body of knowledge . "
" Good , Brennan , " murmured Jeffreyssai .
" But above all , " Brennan continued , " an Eld scientist could n't have practiced the actual problem the quantum scientists faced — that of resolving a major confusion .
It was something you did once per lifetime if you were lucky , and as Hiriwa observed , Newton would no longer have been around .
So while the Eld physicists who messed up quantum theory were not unintelligent , they were , in a strong sense , amateurs — ad - libbing the whole process of paradigm shift . "
" And no probability theory , " Hiriwa noted .
" So anyone who did succeed at the problem would have no idea what they 'd just done .
They would n't be able to communicate it to anyone else , except vaguely . "
" Yes , " Styrlyn said .
" And it was only a handful of people who could tackle the problem at all , with no training in doing so ; those are the physicists whose names have passed down to us .
A handful of people , making a handful of discoveries each .
It would not have been enough to sustain a community .
Each Eld scientist tackling a new paradigm shift would have needed to rediscover the rules from scratch . "
Jeffreyssai rose from Brenann 's desk .
" Acceptable , Brennan ; you surprise me , in fact .
I shall have to give further thought to this method of yours . "
Jeffreyssai went to the classroom door , then looked back .
" However , I did have in mind at least one other major flaw of Eld science , which none of you suggested .
I expect to receive a list of possible flaws tomorrow .
I expect the flaw I have in mind to be on the list .
You have 480 minutes , excluding sleep time .
I see five of you here .
The challenge does not require more than 480 insights to solve , nor more than 96 insights in series . "
And Jeffreyssai left the room .
The precision ......
The detail .......
It 's stunning ....... It 's like , it 's drawing me in ......
Arghhhhhhhhhh ........... I'm ....... Aughhhhh ......... Dinner .......
That 's a wrap !

" That 's just like your opinion man "
Gary Rinehart clearly remembers the summer day in 2002 when the stranger walked in and issued his threat .
Rinehart was behind the counter of the Square Deal , his “ old - time country store , ” as he calls it , on the fading town square of Eagleville , Missouri , a tiny farm community 100 miles north of Kansas City .
The Square Deal is a fixture in Eagleville , a place where farmers and townspeople can go for lightbulbs , greeting cards , hunting gear , ice cream , aspirin , and dozens of other small items without having to drive to a big - box store in Bethany , the county seat , 15 miles down Interstate 35 .
Everyone knows Rinehart , who was born and raised in the area and runs one of Eagleville ’s few surviving businesses .
The stranger came up to the counter and asked for him by name .
“ Well , that ’s me , ” said Rinehart .
As Rinehart would recall , the man began verbally attacking him , saying he had proof that Rinehart had planted Monsanto ’s genetically modified ( G.M. ) soybeans in violation of the company ’s patent .
Better come clean and settle with Monsanto , Rinehart says the man told him — or face the consequences .
Rinehart was incredulous , listening to the words as puzzled customers and employees looked on .
Like many others in rural America , Rinehart knew of Monsanto ’s fierce reputation for enforcing its patents and suing anyone who allegedly violated them .
But Rinehart was n’t a farmer .
He was n’t a seed dealer .
He had n’t planted any seeds or sold any seeds .
He owned a small — a really small — country store in a town of 350 people .
He was angry that somebody could just barge into the store and embarrass him in front of everyone .
“ It made me and my business look bad , ” he says .
Rinehart says he told the intruder , “ You got the wrong guy . ”
When the stranger persisted , Rinehart showed him the door .
On the way out the man kept making threats .
Rinehart says he can’t remember the exact words , but they were to the effect of : “ Monsanto is big .
You ca n’t win .
We will get you .
You will pay . ”
Scenes like this are playing out in many parts of rural America these days as Monsanto goes after farmers , farmers ’ co-ops , seed dealers — anyone it suspects may have infringed its patents of genetically modified seeds .
As interviews and reams of court documents reveal , Monsanto relies on a shadowy army of private investigators and agents in the American heartland to strike fear into farm country .
They fan out into fields and farm towns , where they secretly videotape and photograph farmers , store owners , and co-ops ; infiltrate community meetings ; and gather information from informants about farming activities .
Farmers say that some Monsanto agents pretend to be surveyors .
Others confront farmers on their land and try to pressure them to sign papers giving Monsanto access to their private records .
Farmers call them the “ seed police ” and use words such as “ Gestapo ” and “ Mafia ” to describe their tactics .
When asked about these practices , Monsanto declined to comment specifically , other than to say that the company is simply protecting its patents .
“ Monsanto spends more than $ 2 million a day in research to identify , test , develop and bring to market innovative new seeds and technologies that benefit farmers , ” Monsanto spokesman Darren Wallis wrote in an e-mailed letter to Vanity Fair .
“ One tool in protecting this investment is patenting our discoveries and , if necessary , legally defending those patents against those who might choose to infringe upon them . ”
Wallis said that , while the vast majority of farmers and seed dealers follow the licensing agreements , “ a tiny fraction ” do not , and that Monsanto is obligated to those who do abide by its rules to enforce its patent rights on those who “ reap the benefits of the technology without paying for its use . ”
He said only a small number of cases ever go to trial .
Existing reserves of oil are running down and not many new reserves are being discovered .
But the biggest factor putting upward pressure on the price is the huge growth in demand from China , India and other developing countries .
These countries consume half the world 's energy and accounted for 80 % of the growth in demand for oil in the first half of this decade .
That growth is almost certain to continue and keep prices rising in the years to come .
Martin Wolf , of the Financial Times , summarises the outlook for oil with three facts : it 's a finite resource , it drives the global transport system , and if emerging economies consumed as much oil as Europeans do , consumption would jump by 150 % .
Next , the global food crisis .
Across the world , the basic cost of food has risen by more than half in the past year , with grain prices the worst affected .
Rioting over food prices has occurred in more than 30 developing countries .
The most fundamental explanation for this is that rapid economic growth in China and other emerging economies has raised consumers ' purchasing power , generating rising demand for food and shifting food demand away from traditional staples towards higher - value foods such as meat and milk .
This dietary shift is leading to increased demand for grains to feed animals .
But this is now a long - term trend and does n't adequately explain the recent price surge .
It 's more convincingly explained by the effect of the US and other countries ' diversion of grains towards the production of ethanol and other biofuels , and by the loss of wheat production caused by adverse weather conditions in key production areas , particularly the drought in Australia .
So , China is not responsible for the food crisis after all ?
Sorry , not that simple .
Why are the Americans subsidising their farmers to shift into growing maize for ethanol ?
Because they 're reacting to the high price of oil , which would be higher than it is had they not done such a ( dubious ) thing .
Then we 've got the high price of oil adding to the costs of farm production , via transport costs , the cost of mechanical cultivation , and the cost of fertilisers and pesticides .
Some dirt - poor farmers have had to give up planting crops .
As for adverse weather conditions , while we can't prove our exceptionally long drought is a product of global warming , there 's a fair chance it is .
Imagine my surprise when my last posting , a tidbit about relieving stress , was linked to Reddit , which is apparently some kind of internet clearinghouse for articles about Barack Obama and photos of kitty cats .
Within moments , I noticed a huge spike in traffic to my normally moribund site .
People were not only reading the post , but taking the time to leave thoughtful messages like this one :
“ Who the hell is this guy ?
Celebrity ?
In your own head , maybe .
let me guess , headed to the gym in 26 minutes ? ”
And this one :
“ You are easily one of the biggest hacks in the entertainment industry today . ”
And this one :
“ Who are you , sorry ?
My celebrity - meter is reading a big fat zero ... ”
What these people do n’t realize is that OF COURSE I am a celebrity .
It says so on my blog .
But just because I am a celebrity ( very famous ) does n’t mean I do n’t have feelings .
I do .
And those feelings , fortunately , are usually numbed by prescription medications and acupuncture .
My blog used to be a happy place where likeminded people gathered to exchange lighthearted bonhomie .
Now , with my sudden internet stardom , it has become no better than Times Square pre-Giuliani : a cesspool of boarded - up bodegas and adult novelty stores .
And guess what ?
I like it .
I like it a lot .
Yes , there will always be haters , just as there will always be panda bears ( fingers crossed ) .
But I do n’t let either haters or panda bears spoil my day .
Not when there is so much good to wring from having a blog as popular as mine .
With all this attention , I finally know what it feels like to be Chris “ Leave Brittany alone ” Crocker : incredible .
Internet fame is like regular fame only without all the annoying “ money ” and “ power . ”
It ’s a good day to be on the internet .
A very good day indeed .
My ever - present security guard Major Quimby ( pictured below ) has asked that we beef up my security detail .
I ’ve told him to go ahead and do that .
Not because I feel I need any extra security , but because I welcome any excuse to bring more mustachioed men in Prussian army uniforms into my entourage .

Up to now , regular expression support in C/ C++ programs was achieved using third party or open source regular expression libraries such as the PCRE library .
With the addition of regex support to the C++ standard library as part of the C++0 x standard update , using regular expressions in C++ programs has become much simpler .
This feature is included in the TR1 draft reportwhich has already been implemented in some popular compilers such as gcc and Visual Studio 2008 ( as part of service pack 1 ) .
Six regular expression grammars will be supported in C++0 x .
The default is based upon the ECMAScript grammar specified in ECMA - 262 .
This syntax is based upon the PCRE syntax and is used by languages such as Perl , Python and Ruby which also provide built in regular expression support .
Other supported grammars include the POSIX regex syntax , and the syntaxes used in tools such as awk , grep and egrep .
Here are some examples that illustrate how to perform some basic tasks with the new C++ regex component of the standard library .
Header files and namespaces :
#include < regex > using namespace std::tr1 ;
Finding a match :
regex rgx ( " ello " ) ; assert ( regex_search ( " Hello World " , rgx ) ) ;
The above example illustrates the construction of a regex object , with the regex pattern being passed as a parameter to the regex constructor .
The regex object is a specialization of the basic_regex template for working with regular expressions which are provided using sequences of char s. The regex_search ( ) function template is then used to see if the “ Hello world ” string contains the “ ello ” pattern .
This function returns true as soon as the first matching substring is found .
The regex_search ( ) function is also overloaded to provide versions that take sequence iterators as params ( instead of a full string ) and also versions that provide additional info on the match results .
Note : The use of assert ( ) in the examples is used to highlight the “ contract ” provided by the api – e.g. to highlight if a function can be used in a conditional expression and if the function should return true or false for the particular example .
Finding an exact match :
The regex_match ( ) function template is an alternative to regex_search ( ) and is used when the target sequence must exactly match the regular expression .
regex rgx ( " ello " ) ; assert ( regex_match ( " Hello World " , rgx ) == false ) ; assert ( regex_match ( " ello " , rgx ) ) ;
Finding the position of a match :
The sub_match or match_results template is used to receive search results from regex_search ( ) .
When searching char data , the library provides a ready made specialization of match_results called cmatch .
regex rgx ( " llo " ) ; cmatch result ; regex_search ( " Hello World " , result , rgx ) ; cout << " Matched \ " " << result.str ( ) << " \ " after \ " " << result.prefix ( ) << " \ " at offset : " << result.position ( ) << " with length : " << result.length ( ) << endl ;
Working with capture groups :
Capture groups provide a means for capturing matched regions within a regular expression .
Each captured region is represented by a sub_match template object .
The smatch specialization of match_results is provided by the library for working with sequences of string sub-matches .
string seq = " foo@helloworld.com " ; regex rgx ( " (.*) @(.* ) " ) ; smatch result ; regex_search ( seq , result , rgx ) ; for ( size_t i=0 ; i< result.size ( ) ; ++i ) { cout << result [ i ] << endl ; }
Case insensitive searches :
regex rgx ( " ello " , regex_constants : : icase ) ; assert( regex_search ( " HELLO WORLD " , rgx ) ) ;

Zimbabwe opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) leader Morgan Tsvangirai addresses a MDC parliamentary caucus in Harare May 30 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Philimon Bulawayo
HARARE ( Reuters ) - Zimbabwe ’s opposition Movement for Democratic Change said on Wednesday its leader Morgan Tsvangirai had been detained by police at a roadblock while campaigning in a run-off presidential vote .
“ We are currently held up .
They are saying there ’s a commanding officer whom we should wait for .
They are not saying why they are holding us up .
It ’s not an arrest but illegal detention .
It appears they want to disrupt our campaign program , ” Tsvangirai ’s spokesman George Sibotshiwe said .
Tsvangirai was detained at 1000 GMT , the MDC said .
Police searched all vehicles and inspected documents .
The MDC says 50 people have been killed by President Robert Mugabe ’s supporters since the first round vote .
On Wednesday , it said soldiers and ZANU - PF activists had beaten and threatened to shoot Zimbabweans who wanted to meet and support Tsvangirai .
“ Mugabe is determined to turn the whole country into a war zone in order to subvert the will of the people and steal the June 27th election by any means possible , ” Tsvangirai said while campaigning in Bulawayo .
South Park 's creators have rolled out a series of " making of " shorts about " Major Boobage , " the drug - addled episode that pays homage to ' 80s triptastic cult film Heavy Metal .
In a series of shorts available at South Park Studios , the show 's online headquarters , fans can get a closer look at the mechanics behind Kenny 's cat - urine - induced psychedelic " cheesing " experiences from the episode , which aired in March .
The fourth and final " making of " installment , " Kenny 's Hot Chick , " debuted Wednesday .
It features commentary by * South Park * creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone that details their approach to " Major Boobage . "
( Hint : It was an opportunity to overdose on boobs and violence . )
To mimic the hand - drawn feel of Heavy Metal in the episode , the South Park animation team used a combination of live - action and rotoscoping – similar to the techniques used in Richard Linklater 's animated films Waking Life and A Scanner Darkly ( a Philip K. Dick adaptation ) .
In the series of four featurettes ( available with and without commentary ) , the South Park creators explain the integration of live - action models with hand - drawn animation online .
While " Major Boobage " is n't the first South Park tribute episode – remember the anime - inspired " Chinpokomon " and the epic World of Warcraft spoof " Make Love , Not Warcraft " ?
– it was the first episode to sail past a million views at South Park Studios .
And it looks like this is only the tip of the Trans Am .
" We 've got more exclusive content coming out all summer , as we head to October and the new season of South Park , " a press release on the site promises .

Sure , you squat , but do you squat BIG ?
I watched the guys squatting over in the corner of the gym and knew immediately the subject of my next article for T -mag .
After a few warm - up sets and some instruction from the trainer , these guys began to perform some of the most interesting " squatting " I 've ever seen .
The verbal commands still echo in my head : " elbows back , " " head up , " " hips in , " " big chest air , " " down , down , down . "
It went on and on and began to look like something from The Karate Kid .
I walked over to the group after their session and made them an offer they could n't refuse , at least I thought so .
I invited them all to attend the seminar I was conducting the following day at that particular gym .

Well , as Meatloaf says , " Two out of three ain't bad . "
That 's when it hit me .
My Bench Press 600
Pounds article had been a hit , so why not do the same thing for the squat ?
You see , there 's a huge difference between squatting and squatting big .
Let me explain very quickly .
How much can you currently squat ?
If you answered 500 pounds , I 'd reply , " How much more do you know about squatting now compared to when you could only squat 300 pounds ?
How much more will you have to learn to squat 700 pounds ? "
This is what squatting big is all about .
I spent many years knowing how to squat but it took the help of Westside Barbell to learn the art of squatting big .
Squatting big is as much an art as it is a science .
If you relied on just one aspect , either art ( training ) or science , you'd be able to squat , but not squat big .
You have to rely on the combination of both to really increase your numbers .
Squatting the big one requires figuring a lot of stuff out .
Much of this stuff you 've probably been exposed to but perhaps have forgotten or have n't applied yet .
But there are others items you may not know about that can really send your squat over the top .
Sometimes the smallest things can make the biggest difference .
Take for example , Matt Smith .
Matt is Westside 's newest member of the 900 club .
( By the way , that now makes nine in the 900s for Westside , seven of whom all train together .
We also have one guy that squats over a grand . )
Matt realized a few months back that he sucked at the glute ham raise .
So realizing that his hamstrings were a weakness for him , he pushed them up .
The net result was that he beat his old squat record by 30 pounds !
That 's all it took , finding a weakness and bringing it up .
If Matt had n't found this weakness he could still be squatting in the 800s or worse yet , he could 've been stuck there for several years .
I know all about having my squat stuck .
I once went five years without any progress .
I tried many things and most did n't work .
Then I stumbled upon the chains .
( See my article called Accommodating Resistance for details . )
This broke my rut and started me on the way to squatting big .
You see , both Matt and I knew how to squat , but we had to learn to squat big .
At Westside Barbell , we 've figured out the secrets to squatting big weights and have been sharing these with other powerlifters for the past few years .
I can think of eleven others outside of Westside who 've also squatted over 900 by using these same secrets .
How did we come up with these special secrets ?
It 's simple .
We combined the art of training with science .
Very few scientists can squat big and very few who do squat big can replicate the results in someone else .
You must have a good understanding of both if you want to pile plates on the bar .
So if you think you 're ready to load up the bar , then read on .
1 – Get your stance out wide !
If you squat with a close stance , move your feet out .
If you think you squat wide already , move your feet further out !
We teach everyone at Westside to squat wide .
We do n't believe in a close - stance squatter .
When you squat wide you create better leverages for the squat .
The distance between your knee and hip is greater with a close stance , thus a longer and more difficult squat .
By using a wide squat you cut this distance back as well as place the emphasis on the glutes , hamstrings and lower back .
These are the muscles that squat big weights !
While squatting wide , try to keep your toes straight ahead or slightly turned out .
This will create a tremendous amount of tension in the hips and glutes and make it hard to squat down .
This tension will create a great stretch reflex out of the bottom of the squat .
This is vital to the development of barbell speed .
2 – Get a tight arch !
You must learn to develop the strength to keep a tight arch in the lower back .
This arch must be kept throughout the entire movement .
The moment you begin to lose this arch , the bar will begin to drift forward and out of the natural barbell path .
When the bar starts to drift toward the toes , you 'll lose the squat and end up stapled to the floor .
The bar must stay close to the hip joint and away from the toes .
You must also keep the shoulder blades pulled together with your elbows pulled forward .
This will create the much needed upper back tightness to keep the barbell in proper position .
Remember , the shortest distance between two points is a straight line , so you must keep the barbell in the proper path .
When your elbows turn out toward the back , the bar will drift forward again and end up stapling you to the floor as well as ripping your head off .
This is one common mistake I see in all my seminars .
When I ask attendees who taught them to squat with their elbows back , nine out of ten times they say , " My coach . "
This is another example of those who think they know how to squat not knowingsquat !
3 – Spread the floor !
Spread the floor with your feet as you squat .
Remember the wide stance ?
Well , you must also force your knees out hard during the entire motion and push out on the sides of your shoes while you squat .
This keeps the tension in the hips where it should be .
This is also why most squat shoes , tennis shoes , and cross trainers suck for squatting .
The best shoes for squatting are Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars .
The soles are flat and the side construction is rugged enough to push out against without a blowout or rolling over the sole .
4 – Drive your head into the bar !
This does n't mean look up toward the sky like your old high school coach told you to .
You must look straight ahead and drive your head back into the traps .
Your body will always follow the head so you want to make sure your head is driving back into the bar .
As a side note , what 's the last thing to move when you squat ?
It would be your head .
So what should be the first thing to move when coming out of the hole ?
You got it , your head .
This only makes perfect sense .
You have to think about driving your back and head into the bar first during the assent .
We tell our lifters the chest and head should always be first .
You 're trying to raise the bar , so move it first !
If the quads flex first , the hips will rise before the bar and force the barbell forward .
Here 's another coaching tool : watch the lifter 's quads .
If they flex first get him to sit back more and force his knees out .
The glutes should flex first .
5 – The hips should move before the knees !
If your knees are the first to move while beginning a squat , then your path is going to be straight down .
As discussed before , the tension must be on the glutes , hips and hamstrings .
These are the muscles that squat big weights , not the quads .
Think about this :
Why ca n't a lifter with a 400 - pound deep Olympic squat perform a 700 - pound power squat ?
A powerlifter who can squat 700 can do an easy 400 - pound Olympic squat .
This is because the Olympic squatter does n't have the back , glutes or hamstring to support the 700 pounds !
What 's that tell you about the quads and squatting big weights ?
( Hint : They just are n't that important ! )
6 – Get on the box !
The greatest secret to our success at Westside is the use of the box squat .
We do n't do any full squatting at all , except for in competition .
We have n't had any lifters over the past 15 years have any lower back or knee injuries , either .
The only side effects we 've seen with box squatting are big squats !
The key is to do them properly .
For more information on this , see my Squatting from Head to Toe article .
The benefits of the box are many .
First , you can sit back further than you could without it .
This places more stress on the posterior chain muscles .
Second , you always know how low you 're going .
If you want to squat two inches below parallel then set your box up at that height .
This way your body will always sit as low as it's conditioned .
If you want to squat one inch high , then set the box higher .
We suggest one inch below parallel since this is what 's needed to pass in a powerlifting competition .
Third , squatting on a box breaks the eccentric / concentric chain .
This is one of the best ways to develop explosive strength .
Fourth , the box is great for teaching proper squatting technique .
Most athletes and lifters have very poor squat technique because of bad coaching , muscle imbalances and flexibility .
The box can work as a great aid to teaching the proper way to sit back into a squat .
I 'll be the first to tell you that the competitive power squat is n't an easy thing to master .
It takes many years of work and technique is very important .
The stronger you get , the more you need better technique .
One inch in the wrong direction and you 'll miss the lift .
7 – Learn to use your belly !
I 've caught more shit over this than any other aspect of training .
But the truth is that every big squatter I know has learned how to use his abdominals while squatting .
You must learn how to breathe into your belly .
You want to pull as much air as you can into your belly , then flex and force your abdominals out .
Walk over to a mirror .
Take a look at your shoulders and take a deep breath .
Did they rise ?
If they did , then you 're pulling all the air into your chest , not your belly .
You need to learn how to breath into your belly .
This is how we teach everyone to squat .
For the squat , we advise the use of a weight belt worn one notch loose .
This is to teach you to pull air into your belly then push out into the belt .
The belt acts as a great training aid to push against .
As a side note , we use the same technique for all of our max - effort work , but do n't use the belt in that situation .
This is one aspect of our training that has been misunderstood for too long .
We use the belt to teach how to use the abdominals for the squat , bench , and deadlift , and do not advocate its use for anything else unless the lifter feels it 's needed .
Many in the gym have worked up to 600 and 700 pound good mornings without any adverse effects and have been doing them this way for over ten years .
This brings me to the next point .
We 've been told breathing and using the abdominals this way will lead to back injuries .
Louie Simmons has been coaching this for the past twenty years at Westside and has n't had any lifters with these problems .
Learning to use the belly has made a profound difference in all of our squats , especially for those who 've never tried it .
I 've seen squats increase by 25 to 50 pounds on this aspect alone .
Now that 's what squatting big is all about .
Filling your belly with air will also create a larger torso and give you a bigger base of support from which to drive .
Ever wonder why those with bigger waists squat so much ?
Think about it .
We want as much tightness and support as we can get from the gross muscles of the spinal errectors , abdominals , and obliques .
8 – Train for speed !
If you were to jump up on a table , how high would you get if you jumped slowly ?
How much force would you develop ?
Not much , huh ?
So why in the world would you want to train to be slow ?
Why not train to be faster ?
The faster you are , the greater the chance you 'll have of blasting through your sticking point .
This is what the dynamic training day is all about .
If you 're a 500 pound squatter and are training with 250 , then you must apply 500 pounds of force to the bar during the lift .
Think blast !
For most T - mag readers , I 'd suggest a four week wave using the box squat .
The percentages listed below would be of your best squat .
For you competitive powerlifters out there , percentages would be lower since you may be using squat suits .
Week 1 : 10 sets of 2 reps with 65 %
Week 2 : 10 sets of 2 reps with 70 %
Week 3 : 10 sets of 2 reps with 73 %
Week 4 : 10 sets of 2 reps with 75 %
Only take 45 to 60 seconds rest between sets and use compensatory acceleration when performing all of your reps .
That means you should really try to explode the weight up .
9 – Train for chaos !
Chaos training is a system of training that will make or break your squat .
A cardinal sin of squatting is falling forward during the lift or dumping the bar over your head .
When this happens it means only one thing :
You have n't done the necessary work to squat big .
When a barbell falls forward it 's known as a chaotic event .
You have to train to avoid these situations .
This is why we have a max effort day .
On this day you 'll perform a one rep max on some type of low box squat , deadlift or good morning .
You 'll want to use some type of good morning seven out of ten workouts or 70 % percent of all max effort days for the lower body .
The low box squat should be used 20 % of the time , the deadlift 10 % .
This would be a once a week workout .
The reason for so many good mornings is twofold .
First we 've found this type of movement to be the absolute best for the development of the squat and deadlift .
Second , remember the cardinal sin of falling over ?
Well that 's exactly what happens with a good morning .
If your good morning is strong enough you 'll be able to keep the arch and not fall forward .
If you do begin to fall forward you 'll be able to arch the bar back into position without even thinking about it .
You 'll have the strength and it 'll be automatic .
We 've found a minimum good morning of 60 % of your max squat to be a very important element of squatting big .
10 – Build the glutes and hamstrings !
As I 've stated before , the quads are n't an important element of a big squat .
You have to have very strong hamstrings and glutes .
You must prioritize your hamstring and hit them at least twice a week .
The best movements we 've found for training the hamstrings are glute ham raises , band leg curls , reverse hypers and pull throughs , and high - rep partial deadlifts .
We 've found that two heavy hamstring workouts a week to be fine for most lifters but many times we 've prescribed up to six hamstring training sessions a week to bring them up to where they should be .
This is all based on the situation , exercises , and lifter .
Summary
After my seminar was over I sat there watching an aerobics class .
Remember , I train in a key club with 20 to 30 other powerlifters and have n't trained in a gym like this for over 12 years .
It was quite a sight .
I have n't missed training at a fitness club at all , and I still do n't .
As far as the two guys I 'd invited to the seminar , they showed up .
Their trainer did n't .
Now these two guys know how to squat big .
When I go back next year , I 'll bet the trainer attends , too .
That 's because his two former clients will soon be out - squatting him .
You see , he may know how to squat and that 's fine , but they know how to squat big !
5 Psychological Experiments That Expose Humanity 's Dark Side By Alexandra Gedrose / Source : Cracked.com

The United States dollar has been the king currency in the world for decades .
Could it now lose its throne ?
It 's " definitely a possibility , " says Barry Eichengreen , an economist at the University of California , Berkeley .
The US has been spending hundreds of billions on the Iraq war , suffered massive trade deficits for many years ( $ 708 billion in 2007 ) , and now is paying about $ 1.2 billion a day for imported oil .
Moreover , the dollar has been hugely devalued against the euro ( the currency of 15 nations in the European Union ) , the British pound , and some other currencies .
Conventional wisdom among economists is that currency ascendancy gives a nation an economic advantage .
The US , for instance , finances much of its international payments deficit by issuing Treasury bonds and other debt instruments denominated in dollars .
So when the dollar loses value , as it has on foreign - exchange markets , the debts are paid in those same cheaper dollars .
Other nations cannot finance an international payments deficit in their own currency .
So they can be more easily pressured by external forces to take unpopular domestic policy measures to restore an external balance .
Those forces may include the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) or a group of wealthy nations demanding repayment on loans .
In effect , the dominance of the dollar has enabled the US to live beyond its real means for decades .
Charles de Gaulle , founder of France 's fifth republic , complained in the 1960s about the " exorbitant privilege " the dollar gave the US .
( It turns out that his finance minister , Valery Giscard d'Estaing , first used this famous phrase usually attributed to de Gaulle . )
Loss of the privilege could lower US living standards a little .
Another piece of conventional wisdom is that loss of the key currency role can take many decades to happen .
" This is not what history tells us , " Professor Eichengreen says .
It is usually thought that it took some 50 years , World War II , and the loss of the British Empire for the dollar to overtake the pound in 1945 with the creation of what is known as the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system .
From that point , the value of most significant currencies were pegged to the dollar .
Eichengreen points out that in fact the dollar beat out the pound as the leading currency held by central banks in their official international monetary reserves in 1924 .
These reserves are held by nations to give them more time to manage an international financial crisis or a bad turn in their trade balance .
Further , Brazil switched in 1930 to pricing its coffee exports in dollars , rather than pounds .
Today oil and most other commodities are priced in international trade in dollars .
A few nations , including El Salvador , Panama , and Ecuador , have adopted the dollar as their national currency .
They thereby lost the benefit of seigniorage , the free money governments receive when they issue new money .
More than 100 nations do not allow foreign exchange markets to set the value of their currency , pegging its value to the dollar or euro by buying or selling that currency in those markets .
But with the jump in the price of oil and the tumble in the dollar , the psychology of world financial markets and perhaps central bankers is changing .
For one thing , the dollar has a serious competitor now – the euro , says Robert Hormats , vice chairman of Goldman Sachs ( International ) .
Euro member nations had a combined output of goods and services of about $ 12.7 trillion last year , not too far from that of the US .
It also has a major financial market , even though it does n't include that of London .
Britain has stayed outside the euro area .
Already , central banks hold close to 30 percent of their international foreign exchange reserves in euros ( about $ 1 trillion ) , a currency created in 1999 , notes Mr. Hormats .
Bankers are hedging against further drops in the dollar .
Another trend is for nations to peg their currency to the euro or a basket of currencies , which may include the dollar .
In effect , both governments and private investors are seeking to diversify their international investment portfolios .
An IMF Working Paper ( not official policy ) released last week noted that " a sudden decrease in the willingness of nonresidents to continue funding ongoing trade deficits " [ such as that of the US ] could lead to a " currency crisis " with " a critical number " of nations switching their currency pegs or letting foreign exchange markets decide the value of their currencies .
Investors " are in the middle of hedging their bets , " says Hormats , buying oil and other commodities on the futures markets .
Such moves reflect concerns about US budget deficits , its dependence on imported oil , and a lack of consumer savings .
Some US hedge funds are now betting that certain Middle East nations will drop their dollar pegs and let their currencies soar .
Last year Kuwait pegged its currency to a basket of currencies .
Qatar has talked about doing the same .
Ukraine last week altered its peg against the dollar to make its hryvnia more valuable .
Senator Joseph Lieberman , a stalwart backer of John McCain who calls himself an " independent Democrat " , could face punishment from the Democratic party if he is asked to speak at this summer 's Republican convention .
Lieberman has said he would appear at McCain 's nominating convention if invited by the Republican , fuelling frustration among US liberals already angered by his support for the Iraq war .
Democrats revoked his superdelegate status earlier this year .
The onetime vice presidential nominee of Al Gore has played a pivotal role in maintaining Democrats ' narrow control of the Senate .
But party leader Harry Reid today left the door open to sanctioning Lieberman if he speaks in favour of McCain 's nomination .
" I 'll consider anything , " Reid said at a breakfast with reporters today , adding that the Democratic presidential nominee , likely Barack Obama , would want to weigh in on Lieberman 's future role .
Reid noted that Lieberman 's reliable alignment with Democrats on domestic issues such as education and taxes - he has proposed a " war on terrorism " tax to fund the US presence in Iraq - makes the case for his continued value in the party .
The Connecticut senator sides with Democrats " 90 to 95 % " of the time outside of war - related issues , Reid said .
But Iraq has permanently discoloured Lieberman 's standing with some US Democrats who believe his praise for George Bush has undercut the party 's efforts to end the war .
The strong bond between Lieberman and McCain has only exacerbated those doubts .
Democrats nearly faced a similar conundrum in 2004 when their senator from Georgia , Zell Miller , publicly denounced presidential nominee John Kerry at the Republican convention .
Miller 's previously announced retirement from politics that year spared him sanctions within the party .
The possibility of punitive action against Lieberman exists largely because of Democrats ' excellent position in congressional elections this fall .
Reid said the party is well positioned in as many as 11 Senate races , including several in traditional Republican bastions such as Alaska and Mississippi .
" We 're going to pick up seats , " Reid predicted .
The majority leader also addressed the future role of another influential senator : Hillary Clinton , whose presidential campaign is fading out as Obama builds on his lead in the delegate count .
The prospect of a former first lady and near - nominee returning to the Congress without a leadership post has led to speculation that Clinton might seek a senior role under Reid - or even contest for Reid 's job .
Yet Reid quelled any speculation that he would make way for Clinton or that she would snag a new position upon her return .
" A senator coming back who ran for president , that 's not unique around here , " Reid said , referring to Kerry and two other senators who lost presidential bids , Joseph Biden and Chris Dodd .
" Senator Clinton has some very fine committee assignments .
She 's going to have a lot to do . "

Adware pushers have found a new way to trick you into downloading their annoying products : fake MP3 files .
On Tuesday , security vendor McAfee reported that it 's seen a huge spike in fake MP3 files spreading on peer - to - peer networks .
Although the files have names that make them look like audio recordings , they 're really Trojan horse programs that try to install a shoddy media player and adware on your computer , said Craig Schmugar , a researcher with McAfee .
" Once you run it , there is no content .
You 're taken to this site to install this player which you do n't really need , " he said .
Fake file names include : preview - t- 3545425 - changing times earth wind .mp3 and t-3545425 - just got lucky.mp3 .
Schmugar listed more filenames , as well as details on the adware , in a Tuesday blog posting .
Users are first asked to OK an end - user license agreement before the Trojan installs the Mirar toolbar and two other components , called FBrowsing Advisor & SurfingEnhancer .
Ironically , while Mirar tells users that it does n't display popups , the FBrowsing Advisor & SurfingEnhancer software do deliver popup ads , so users who do not realize that they are installing several programs might feel tricked , Schmugar said .
" You have a Window telling you that there are no popups and right behind it is a popup . "
Although McAfee has seen some nasty software disguising itself as media files in the past , it has never seen anything on this scale , Schmugar said .
Over the past 24 hours , nearly a third of the McAfee customers who reported data back to the security company have detected these files , he said .
In the past few days McAfee has spotted the files on more than 360,000 users ' desktops .
Rolf started shooting panoramic photos many years ago .
He says , " in many places around the world - inside and out - there is more to show than only a picture .

Leonardo DiCaprio will star as Nolan Bushnell in Atari , a new Paramount Pictures biopic about the man who brought us Pong and Chuck E. Cheese .
Bushnell turned down a number of previous requests to turn his life story into a movie , according to
Variety , but signed off on a pitch by Craig Sherman and Brian Hecker ( Bart Got a Room ) .
DiCaprio , who 's also pushing to make Brave New World , knows a little something about ingenious inventor - entrepreneurs , having earned an Oscar nomination for portraying Howard Hughes in The Aviator .
There 's a lot of ground to cover : Bushnell co-founded Atari in 1972 on $ 500 , hired Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak as early employees , and sold the company six years later for $ 28 million to Warner Communication after inventing the Atari 2600 and the addictive arcade game Pong .
Beginning in 1977 , Bushnell developed the Chuck E. Cheese franchise into a 200 - restaurant chain .
A millionaire by age 39 , he then survived a number of ups and downs .
Remember Androbot ?
Probably not .
Now 65 and living in Los Angeles , Bushnell , who has eight kids , told Wired.com in a 2005 interview focused on his uWink interactive game : " The subtle generational cues that make one thing cool and another uncool are n't always obvious to a parent .
My children are my dinner - table sounding board .
I 've come up with some wonderful ideas that they universally dismissed as ' lame . ' "
Bushnell sees gaming as a social activity first and foremost .
He said , " The number of people who have told me that they met their future spouse playing Pong is huge . "

Over time there has been an abnormally high number of UFO sightings in Florida .
The State is definitely a hotbed for UFO activity ; this could be due to it being the home of NASA Space Shuttle launches at Cape Canaveral .
Do n’t forget that Florida forms one corner of the Bermuda triangle ( the other two being from Bermuda and Puerto Rico ) .
Does this make Florida one of the most likely places in the world to see a UFO ?
Many people would agree with this .
You can choose to disregard the evidence or you can open your eyes to the possibility that there may in fact be things on this planet that can not be explained .
1 . Is there a Google cover up ?
Do they know something we do n’t ?
The first image appeared on Google maps .
Not long after that the mysterious object was no longer there …. was this a Google cover up or just an image update ?
What was the unidentified object over this Florida housing community ?
2. Pasco County Sheriff ’s
Office issue a report saying it is a balloon … does it look like a balloon to you ?
This enormous , triangular shaped unidentified object with bright , glowing lights was captured on video over Florida .
Several 911 calls later and the local sheriff ’s office issue a statement saying that the object was a balloon .
Make your own mind up by watching the video below : balloon or UFO ?
This sighting is very similar to a triangular shaped object photographed in Belgium in 1989 ( see photo below )
3. Edward Walters became infamous in 1987 when he claims a UFO tried to kidnap him !
Gulf Breeze in Florida became the focus point of the world in 1987 when a local man , Edward Walters , experienced a close encounter with a UFO .
He was working late one evening when he saw a bright object through his window .
Stepping outside to get a better view he claims that as soon as he saw the object it saw him .
Grabbing his Polaroid he took the photo below however a blue beam of light shot down and raised him off the floor .
Voices told him that they would not hurt him … then he woke up on the floor and the UFO had gone .
You can learn more about Ed ’s unidentified Florida object encounter here , or you can watch the reconstruction video .
4. West Pensacola Florida , April 2007
A retired Marine Corps Pilot noticed a dark object in front of a the cloud formation when reviewing photographs on his PC .
His wife had been taking photos of low flying planes and clouds when this UFO was accidentally snapped .
The shape and colour of the object is not consistent with it being a cloud .
5. STS 48 NASA Mission
The famous NASA Space Shuttle Mission in September 1991 produced over 500 hours of video collected while Discovery orbited .
The following footage is taken from a night flight over Florida .
About 34 seconds into the video an object comes up near to the shuttle and then disappears .
6. Tallahassee Florida , September 2005
On the 9th of September 2005 in Tallahassee , Florida a man and his wife were led in the back of a truck stargazing when the man noticed what appeared to be a bright star .
He focused in on it with his camera and soon realised that it was not a star and that is was in fact a UFO .
Many experts have looked at this video and confirmed that it is authentic and that no special effects were used .
Unidentified Flying Object or Unidentified Florida Object .
For those people who have experienced close encounters in the sunshine state they would probably argue that they both have the same meaning !
JEFF BEZOS , the founder and chief executive of Amazon , destination for nearly four - fifths of online book buyers , appears harmless .
But to some in the publishing industry , he looms like a recurring nightmare .
Having upset booksellers ' apple - carts in the 1990s with his online stores , he is now widening his assault on the industry , as he personably explained in a speech at Book Expo America ( BEA ) , a trade fair in Los Angeles , on May 30th .
AP
You 're all doomed !
From the outside , book publishing looks like an impregnable edifice : 411,000 new titles were published in America last year , and more than 3 billion books sold there .
Growth was 4.3 % in the “ adult trade ” segment , the mainstay of the market .
In fact , the existing order is fragile .
Reading in America , as in many rich countries , is down .
A study by the National Endowment for the Arts , an independent federal agency , says leisure reading is declining , especially among the young .
Since 1985 , books ' share of entertainment spending has fallen by seven percentage points .
Books have changed very little in half a millennium , but they may now be on the verge of going digital .
The first high - resolution e-book reader , made by Sony , came out in 2004 .
Last November Amazon launched the Kindle ( pictured ) , a $ 359 e- book reader with a high - speed wireless link to the firm 's online store , allowing e-books to be downloaded in seconds .
Mr Bezos says Kindle e-books now account for 6 % of sales of the 125,000 titles available in both print and electronic formats .
Though they are an improvement on a computer screen , e-book readers remain crude simulacra of books .
A poll released by John Zogby at BEA found that 82 % of Americans strongly prefer paper to pixels .
None of the handful of e-book manufacturers will divulge sales figures .
First - quarter sales of mass - market e-books in America have tripled since the same period in 2005 , but they were worth just $ 10 m .
But Kindle and its kind are merely the first generation of a product that is sure to evolve quickly in the coming years .
Eventually , e-books point the way towards a cleavage of content from platform , threatening publishing with the wholesale change that has hit the music industry .
It is a familiar story : fearing piracy , publishers are already adopting various mutually incompatible security technologies that are sure to annoy readers — although ePub , a new standard backed by many big publishers , may clarify things .
Unlike digital music or video , digital books require consumers to change their consumption habits .
In some categories , such as textbooks , digital books are growing rapidly .
As well as reducing costs by eliminating printing , warehousing , shipping and returns , this transformation could help publishers such as Elsevier and Springer recapture America 's $ 2.3 billion college textbook - resale market .
Although e-books may one day transform the industry , another new technology that is less visible to readers is already making itself felt .
Print on Demand ( POD ) , which allows books to be printed and bound to order , is making millions of books available even if they appeal to only a narrow readership .
Here , too , academia leads the way .
Stephen DeForge of Ames On - Demand says his POD business , which specialises in printing small runs of customised books for schools and universities , has been growing by 45 % a year since 2001 .
Last year his firm printed more than 800,000 books in runs as small as ten copies at a time .
The opportunity has not been lost on Mr Bezos .
In March Amazon announced that it would require all the POD books it sells to be printed by the company at its warehouses .
Mr Bezos says that this enables Amazon to have a book ready to ship within two hours of an order being placed online .
Between POD and the Kindle , Mr Bezos thinks he can sell “ any book ever printed in any language ” .
But printers and distributors , like booksellers before them , fear the oncoming Amazon juggernaut .
Technology is also opening up new formats .
Serialisation is making a comeback : a firm called DailyLit divides e-books into small chunks for drip - feeding by e-mail .
Harlequin , a Canadian publisher of romantic fiction , sells short - fiction e-books for reading on PCs or other devices in a lunch hour .
Last autumn the firm , which sells around 130 m books a year , became the first big publisher to offer its entire catalogue in both printed and digital formats .
Brent Lewis , who runs Harlequin 's digital business , says his firm 's digital readership is composed of the same middle - aged women who read its printed books .
An economic slowdown may play to the new technologies ' strengths .
The costs of printing and shipping paper and cardboard are rising .
Mr DeForge says POD is now cheaper than standard printing for runs of fewer than 1,200 copies , and the threshold is rising quickly .
And if consumers become more price - sensitive , e-books may become more appealing .
This week 's Kindle bestseller , a political memoir by Scott McClellan , a former White House spokesman , can be downloaded from thin air in less than a minute for $ 9.99 .
A paper copy costs $ 15.37 on Amazon 's website , and will not be in stock for three weeks .
Publishing has only two indispensable participants : authors and readers .
As with music , any technology that brings these two groups closer makes the whole industry more efficient — but hurts those who benefit from the distance between them .
( CNN ) --
A contract to build what is being called the nation 's first offshore field of wind turbines was announced Monday by a Delaware utility and a firm that will build the generators off the Atlantic coast .
The 150 wind turbines off Delaware are expected to be operational in four years , say developers .
Officials from Delmarva Power and Bluewater Wind announced details of their agreement in Newark , Delaware .
Bluewater spokesman Jim Lanard said the power company will get about 16 percent of its electricity from a field of 150 wind turbines , anchored in the seafloor about a dozen miles off Rehoboth Beach , Delaware .
The contract with Delmarva would use less than half the projected generating capacity the energy park is expected to have when completed .
The rest would be sold to other customers .
The project 's cost is estimated at $ 1.6 billion , according to a project official with Bluewater .
The offshore site is expected to be operational within four years , but the timing depends on how quickly regulatory agencies can review and approve the construction project .
Using electricity generated by the wind , " Delmarva Power will be able to light about 50,000 homes a year , every year " for the duration of the 25 - year contract , Lanard said , with first power expected by 2012 .
He said the project may help stabilize consumer energy costs , since the contract locks in the price Delmarva will pay per kilowatt - hour .
Bluewater has previously established an offshore " energy park " operating off Denmark .
Each turbine in the Delaware project is to sit on a pole about 250 feet above the waterline , where the ocean is about 75 feet deep .
The poles are to extend 90 feet into the seafloor , and the units are to be constructed to withstand hurricane - force winds .
From the shore , the park will be visible only on clear winter days , and the turbines will be nearly invisible during summer months when Rehoboth Beach fills with vacationers , Lanard said .
Each blade on the three - blade rotor is to be 150 feet long .
" If they can see them at all , the turbine blades would cover about the size of your thumbnail , and the poles would be about the width of a toothpick , " he said .

WASHINGTON 
The Bush administration wants to require all recipients of aid under federal health programs to certify that they will not refuse to hire nurses and other providers who object to abortion and even certain types of birth control .
Under the draft of a proposed rule , hospitals , clinics , researchers and medical schools would have to sign “ written certifications ” as a prerequisite to getting money under any program run by the Department of Health and Human Services .
Such certification would also be required of state and local governments , forbidden to discriminate , in areas like grant - making , against hospitals and other institutions that have policies against providing abortion .
The proposal , which circulated in the department on Monday , says the new requirement is needed to ensure that federal money does not “ support morally coercive or discriminatory practices or policies in violation of federal law . ”
The administration said Congress had passed a number of laws to ensure that doctors , hospitals and health plans would not be forced to perform abortions .
Estate agent who kidnapped and tortured her boss for seven hours after she was sacked is jailed for 10 years
Guilty : Ambreen
Gul was jailed for 10 years today for the kidnap and torture of her former boss Waqas Malik
An estate agent kidnapped , tortured and drugged her former boss while demanding a £ 200,000 ransom from his wife in revenge for firing her .
Ambreen Gul lured wealthy businessman Waqas Malik to her flat by pretending she wanted him to value it .
The evil 23 - year - old recruited another disgruntled sacked colleague Mokshud Ali and three of his friends to act as ' heavies ' .
When Gul and Malik arrived at her home , he was punched , stamped on and pistol - whipped on the kitchen floor before being bound and blindfolded with ducktape and tied to a chair in a terrifying seven - hour ordeal .
The 48 - year - old was forced to call his bemused wife three times and tell her he needed her to get £ 200,000 for a ' big deal ' he was doing .
He was threatened with a knife and gun and told he and his 13 - year - old son would be executed if he did not come up with the money .
His kidnappers then forced him to drink a powerful sedative which rendered him unconscious and nearly sent him into a coma .
Fearing he might die , Gul panicked , bundled him into a car and drove him back to his home where he lived with his wife Uzma and two sons , aged nine and 13 .
Mukshud Ali ( left ) and Quasim Ahmed were both jailed for their part in the kidnap plot
As Mrs Malik dragged her husband into the house , Gul accused him of being drunk and sexually assaulting her before driving off .
Mr Malik spent four days in hospital where he was treated for gashes to his head , a black eye and a split lip .
He is still suffering from the psychological trauma of the attack and is struggling to work and support his family .
Shakib Chowdhury was convicted along with his co-conspirators
Gul and her accomplices were arrested after Scotland Yard 's Kidnap Unit were tipped off by an anonymous 999 call .
Yesterday Gul was jailed for ten years at Southwark Crown Court in London .
Judge Deborah Taylor described it as a ' premeditated and brutal attack ' and told Gul : ' Throughout this case you have shown little remorse and consistently shown yourself to be dishonest and manipulative , prepared to do or say anything to save yourself even writing to Mr Malik to try and get him to change his mind about pursuing this case . '
She said : ' These are serious and ugly crimes and it is chilling to those as young as you to be involved in them . '
Gul and 18 - year - old Ali worked at Sky Lord Properties , a sales and letting agent in Ilford , East London , for a few months when Mr Malik decided they were not up to the job and dismissed them .
Furious and hellbent on revenge , Gul hatched the kidnap plot and enlisted Ali to help her .
He recruited friends Quasim Ahmed , 21 , an IT student , 19 - year - old Shakim Chowdhury , a student and former player for West Ham and Arsenal under 17 teams and a third man .
At about 7 pm on June 18 last year , several weeks after being sacked , she went to Sky Lord and asked Mr Malik to have a look at her two - bed flat in Hackney , East London .
Once inside , she gave the signal to ' her boys ' who burst in with their faces masked with balaclavas and scarves and attacked Mr Malik .
His captors laughed and chatted as one of the gang stood on Mr Malik 's hands and head before sticking a strip of tape over his eyes .
He was kicked , punched and pistol - whipped , threatened with a knife and told he would be shot dead .
Gul directed operations and brandished a gun at the victim .
One kidnapper another warned that he would never see his family again unless he raised £ 200,000 ransom and was told failure would result in the executions of both himself and his 13 - year - old son .
The thugs stole his wallet , which contained £ 1,300 in cash and his Mitsubishi jeep , which was later found abandoned .
When the victim passed out they took him home to Ilford at about 3 am the next morning .
Ali , of Barking , East London , was sentenced to seven years and nine months in a young offenders ' institution .
Ahmed was jailed for eight years for his part and Chowdhury , of Ilford , was sentenced to for eight and a half years in a young offenders ' institute .
Earlier a fifth defendant , Al - Imran Uddin , 20 , of Dagenham , East London was cleared of all charges .
Gul and Chowdhury were found guilty of false imprisonment , administering a poison or noxious substance , wounding with intent , blackmail , having an imitation firearm and theft .
Ahmed , of Barking , East London , was found guilty of five identical charges but was cleared of administering a poison or noxious substance .
Ali , of Barking , pleaded guilty to false imprisonment , wounding with intent , blackmail , having an imitation firearm and theft before the trial began .
Gul has previous convictions for perverting the course of justice for lying that her sister 's boyfriend had tried to run her over .
She was also given a 15 - month suspended sentence for fraud for claiming child benefit for her sister 's baby , claiming it was hers .
Detective Sergeant John Bishop , of the Met's Kidnap Unit , said : ' Gul was the driving force behind this horrific attack .
She is an evil and calculated individual who was motivated by sheer greed and revenge . '
Detective Chief Inspector John O'Leary said ' The Metropolitan Police are pleased that the sentences awarded reflect the gravity of the offences , the ordeal suffered by the victim and will also act as a deterrent to others . '

At this rate , by the time Honda actually releases the production version of the successor to the NSX , we may well have seen more video and photos of the prototypes running at the ' Ring than we ever saw of the original .
Thankfully , for those of us into really fast cars , the Nürburgring is a public place with a variety of roadside vantage points where people can view the latest and greatest supercars in action .
The crew at Germany 's Auto Motor und Sport seem to have staged videographers at all the available viewing locations to capture three minutes of footage that they have posted on YouTube for the rest of us to enjoy .
There 's some good stuff here , including the last few seconds where the driver is clearly pushing the new Honda as the back end slips a little wide before coming back .
We 're all waiting anxiously to see how this one matches up against the GT - R , ZR1 , and LF - A .

The NPD console sales numbers have been released for April , stuffed with fascinating content .
How did the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of Grand Theft Auto stack up against each other ?
Did Mario Kart
Wii sell as many copies as expected ?
Will Nintendo continue its winning streak ?
Before we break things down by company , it 's important to point out that the games industry is still going strong .
" The industry continues to set a blistering sales pace , and now shows a year - to - date increase of 31 percent over last year 's record - setting revenues , " NPD Group 's Anita Frazier said .
Nintendo
Surprising absolutely no one , Nintendo took the number one and two slots in hardware sales .
The Wii sold 714,200 units while the Nintendo DS moved 414,800 units ( third place sales go to the PSP with 192,700 units ) .
This month the Wii outsold the Playstation 2 , PlayStation 3 , PSP , and Xbox 360 ... combined .
While Grand Theft Auto IV took up the first ( 360 ) and third ( PS3 ) slots in software sales , Mario Kart Wii came in number two with 1.12 million units sold in April .
Frazier calls it " a classic example of counter - programming . "
Wii Play came in number four with 360,000 units sold , Super Smash Bros .
Brawl came in at number five with 326,000 units , Pokemon Mystery Dungeon : Explorers of Darkness and Time came in at numbers seven and eight , with both games selling 202,000 units .
Guitar Hero III took the number nine slot with 152,000 units .
All told , Nintendo games took up six of the top ten games for April .
Microsoft may choose to say that it's not competing with Nintendo , and that 's probably a smart move .
No one is even coming close to matching these sales numbers .
Microsoft
The Xbox 360 did outsell the PS3 with 188,000 units sold , but it only led by 900 units against the PlayStation 3 .
The 360 also had the best - selling game with Grand Theft Auto IV selling ( 1.85 million units ) and the tenth best selling game with Call of Duty 4 ( 141,000 units ) .
Sony has already begun to take some of the shine out of Microsoft 's Grand Theft Auto IV win .
" There 's a larger installed base right now on Xbox 360 than on PS3 .
So it 's not surprising that there 's going to be more selling on Xbox 360 than PS3 .
Having said that , we 're really excited about the ratio , " PlayStation senior vice president of marketing Peter Dille told N'Gai Croal .
" If I had an installed base advantage of 3 - 1 , I would n't be crowing too much about a 60 - 40 sales advantage . "
Microsoft added a note about its online play in its reactions to the sales numbers .
" Gamers eager to experience Grand Theft Auto IV online helped boost Xbox LIVE global membership totals to over 12 million this month ... the Xbox LIVE service has doubled in membership in only one year 's time . "
Microsoft also brought up the exclusive downloadable content coming to the 360 version of Grand Theft Auto IV .
Sony
As we 've already noted , the PlayStation 3 came within 900 units of the Xbox 360 sales for April ; the system moved 187,100 units in total .
The PlayStation Portable moved 192,700 units to come in third place behind the monster that is Nintendo , and the PlayStation 2 saw quite the sales slip as it only moved 124,400 units in April .
( In March , the classic system moved 216,000 units . )
Sony had two entries in the top ten games list .
The PS3 version of Grand Theft Auto IV came in at number three with 1 million units sold and Gran Turismo 5 : Prologue took the sixth slot with 224,000 units sold .
Hardware in general did n't see the bump that many expected .
Anita Frazier has a few thoughts on why .
" It was surprising not to see bigger hardware sales for the Xbox 360 and the PS3 given the release of GTA IV .
However , since the game was only in the market for 5 days during this reporting period , that sales lift could very well be evident in May data . "
It 's hard to imagine a time when Microsoft or Sony are able to make any headway against Nintendo 's impenetrable hold on this generation , but the race for number three behind the Nintendo Wii and DS continues .
Editor 's Note :
This edited version of " Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed - - Ben Stein Launches a Science - free Attack on Darwin , " published in the June 2008 issue of Scientific American , was originally published on SciAm.com as part of our series " Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed -- Scientific American 's Take . "
“ Should I be worried about the Crips and the Bloods up here ? ”
These were the first words out of the mouth of Ben Stein as he entered my office at Skeptic magazine , located in the racially mixed neighborhood of Altadena , Calif .
I cringed and hoped that the two African - American women in my employ were out of earshot of what was perhaps merely Stein ’s ham - handed attempt at humor before he began interviewing me for what I was told was a film on the intersection of science and religion entitled Crossroads .
That is not what the interview was about .
And neither is the film , now called Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed .
The subtitle exposes its motif — intelligent design has been expelled from classrooms and culture , and Ben Stein sees a sinister conspiracy at work .
This supercilious financial columnist and ersatz actor and game show host proceeded to grill me on whether or not I think someone should be fired for expressing dissenting views .
My answer : it depends .
Who is being fired for what , when and where ?
People are usually fired for reasons having to do with budgetary constraints , incompetence or failure to fulfill the terms of a contract .
If you are hired to teach biology according to the curriculum standards of your school district but instead spend the semester telling students that science has no definitive explanation for DNA , wings , eyes , brains and that mystery of mysteries — bacteria flagella — then , yes , you should be fired posthaste .
But I know of no instance in which this has happened , and the film ’s examples of such alleged abuses have reasonable explanations detailed at www.expelledexposed.com, where Eugenie Scott and her tireless crew at the National Center for Science Education have tracked down the specifics of each case .
After asking the question a dozen different ways , Stein finally changed the subject and queried my opinion on the social impact of Darwinism .
Having just finished my book on evolutionary economics ( The Mind of the Market ) , I drew the connection between Adam Smith ’s invisible hand and Charles Darwin ’s natural selection and noted how capitalists have long used social Darwinism to justify unfettered market competition , from the early 20th - century belief in the survival of the fittest corporations to Enron ’s CEO Jeffrey Skilling , who said his favorite book in Harvard Business School was Richard Dawkins ’s The Self­ish Gene .
This was not the answer Stein wanted , and he re­­ - joined with a vehemence I did not understand until I saw his film .
Expelled ’s exegesis is this : Darwinism leads to atheism , communism , fascism and a repetition of the Holocaust .
We are in an ideological war between a scientific , natural worldview that leads to the Gulag Archipelago and Nazi gas chambers and a religious , supernatural worldview that leads to freedom , justice and the American way .
Expelling intelligent design from American classrooms and culture will inexorably take us down a path of doom , and the film ’s blunt editing intersperses interview snippets from evolutionary biologists with black - and - white clips of , in ascending scale of ominousness , bullies pounding on a 98 - pound weakling ; Charlton Heston ’s character in Planet of the Apes being blasted by a water hose by a gorilla thug ; Nikita Khrushchev pounding his fist on a United Nations desk ; East Germans captured trying to scale the Berlin Wall ; and Nazi crematoria remains and Holocaust victims being bulldozed into mass graves .
The formula is unmistakable : Darwinism = death .
Expelled is pure propaganda that would make even Leni Riefenstahl blush .
The film deserves the Michael Moore Palme d’Or Award for Objective Journalism .
Tellingly , it is being marketed to church groups , religious organizations and conservative Christians .
I saw it at the National Religious Broadcasters convention , where Stein and the producers received a standing ovation and we were all given an Expelled “ Event & Resource Kit , ” which includes movie posters , bumper stickers , teaching outlines , literature from the pro–intelligent design Discovery Institute and even a whistle for “ Blowing the whistle on suppression . ”
A DVD includes interviews with intelligent design proponents and suggestions on how to “ host a ‘ Dinner with Darwin ’ ... using the Discussion Guide , DVD and the film as an opportunity to educate yourselves about the ‘ good science ’ in support of our faith . ”
When will Americans learn that evolutionary theory has nothing to do with religion and that “ good science ” is the product of good data and theory , not “ good fit to scripture ” ?
After Expelled , will anyone take Ben Stein seriously again ?
Anyone ?
Anyone ?

The device has been used to combat anti-social behaviour
' Buzz ' simulated
There are estimated to be 3,500 of the devices , known as the Mosquito , in use in England , many at shopping centres .
Their sound causes discomfort to young ears - but their frequency is above the normal hearing range of people over 25 .
England 's children 's commissioner backs a ban but stores say the devices can be useful against anti-social youths .
The devices , which exploit the fact that a person 's ability to hear high frequencies generally declines once they reach their 20s , have proved popular with councils and police who aim to tackle anti-social behaviour by using them to disperse groups of youths .
But a new campaign called " Buzz off " , led by the children 's commissioner for England and backed by groups including civil liberties group Liberty , is calling for them to be banned .
What type of society uses a low - level sonic weapon on its children ?

Mosquito device splits opinion Firm defends teen deterrent
The organisations want to highlight what they call the " increasingly negative " way society views and deals with children and young people .
Sir Al Aynsley - Green , children 's commissioner for England , said he had spoken to many young people who had been " deeply affected " by the deterrents .
He said : " These devices are indiscriminate and target all children and young people , including babies , regardless of whether they are behaving or misbehaving .
" The use of measures such as these are simply demonising children and young people , creating a dangerous and widening divide between the young and the old . "
He also argued that such an approach was " not addressing the root cause " of anti-social behaviour .
Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti said the device had no place in a country that values its children .
Device emits a tone between 17.5k Hz and 18.5 k Hz inaudible to people over about 25 years
Tone can be heard from a distance of 15 - 20 m
Exposure to sound becomes annoying after 5 - 10 minutes Sound automatically shuts off after 20 minutes
On a ' Mosquito ' estate
" What type of society uses a low - level sonic weapon on its children ?
Imagine the outcry if a device was introduced that caused blanket discomfort to people of one race or gender , rather than to our kids , " she said .
Liberty argues that the use of the Mosquito devices constitutes " a disproportionate interference with an individual 's right to a private life " .
A spokeswoman added : " The device does not discriminate between bad apples and the vast majority of youngsters who are law abiding . "
Work towards a ban on the use of Mosquito devices in Scotland has been under way since last year .
Scotland 's commissioner for children and young people is pursuing the issue with the Scottish Government , the police , supermarkets and the manufacturers .
But Association of Convenience Stores chief executive James Lowman said the body would " fully support " the use of the device as a " last resort " in situations where staff and customers were intimidated by anti-social youths .
HAVE YOUR SAY Screaming kids frequently cause ' discomfort ' to my ears .
If it gets rid of the little brats , I am all for it Bill , Southampton
Mr Lowman , whose association represents 33,000 local shops , said : " Removing the ability to use tools like Mosquitoes will make life harder for retailers that face real problems .
" It would also reinforce the retailer 's view that whilst many in government are quick to blame the retailer for anti-social problems created by gangs of youths , they are unwilling to make those same young people accountable for their own actions . "
Mr Lowman said he had written to the children 's commissioner and the children 's minister , calling for a balanced approach that did not remove deterrents but ensured they were used appropriately .
Meanwhile , a spokesman for the Local Government Association said councils used an array of techniques to disperse groups of youths .
' Small sector '
He said : " It is imperative that local people work with their local council to ensure the most appropriate technique for ensuing that not only anti-social behaviour is dispersed but also that children have somewhere to go to release their energy in a safe place which does not disturb or annoy residents . "
Howard Stapleton , the man who invented the machine , rejected the criticisms put forward by the children 's commissioner , describing the notion that the device was discriminatory as " ridiculous " .
He said : " We 're talking about a small sector of the population , teenagers , drunk , behaving badly , this device is to be used against .
" What about the rest of us out there ?
Are n't we all sick and tired of what 's going on on our streets at the moment ? "
Who would have expected a sequel to Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle ?
The film , about a couple of New Jersey stoners desperately seeking sliders , grossed only $ 18.2 million in 2004 — less than Transformers made in a single day .
And yet the follow - up , Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay , arrives in theaters on April 25 with all the buzz of a mainstream studio comedy .
How ’d that happen ?
Home video , man .
” Pot movies do n’t do terribly well in theaters , and yet on video they ’re wildly out of proportion to the theatrical gross , ” says Jay Chandrasekhar , director of the weed - centered Super Troopers .
His 2002 film made $ 18.5 million in theaters — and almost $ 80 million on DVD and pay TV .
” Our theory , ” he says , ” is that our audience is too stoned to leave the house . ”
White Castle offers further proof .
The film , which cost only $ 9 million to make , became a cult hit for the couch - bound .
It has grossed more than $ 60 million in DVD rentals and sales .
In short , says White Castle co-writer Jon Hurwitz , ” it ’s like printing money . ”
Pot-centric comedies have become a major cash crop for Hollywood .
Between sleeper hits and blockbusters , the genre has generated more than $ 400 million in domestic box office in the last 10 years , and even more on DVD — following a pattern typical for other genres , like horror flicks and family fare .
Stoner roles have launched or resurrected the careers of Oscar winners ( Sean Penn , Fast Times at Ridgemont High ) , movie stars ( Matthew McConaughey , Dazed and Confused ) , and former child actors ( Neil Patrick Harris , White Castle ) .
And for better or worse , toking up on screen even seems to have lost some of its shock value .
” The 40 Year - Old Virgin was like testing the waters to see if people would freak out that characters are nonchalantly passing joints , ” says Seth Rogen .
” And no one did .
The shot where Steve Carell smokes out of an apple pipe — the audience exploded in applause . ”
Of course , that ’s one of the film ’s stars talking — but he ’s got a point .
Stoner movies have pushed further into the mainstream than ever before , and deciding whether or not to stop lighting up and start growing up has become a dilemma for more than one arrested adolescent on screen .
Guantanamo will be followed in August by Pineapple Express , a bud -smoking action comedy , starring and co-written by Rogen , that is already being hailed as one of the greatest stoner movies ever , as well as a hilarious romp for audiences in any condition .
Then there ’s a documentary , Super High Me , with comedian Doug Benson , an indie drama , Humboldt County , and a Sundance darling , The Wackness , starring Ben Kingsley .
Factor in the popularity of Showtime ’s Weeds , and it ’s pretty clear we ’re witnessing a bong boom .
Just do n’t call it that in Hollywood .
Despite the success of stoner movies , the major studios would rather avoid that label .
Neither New Line ( Guantanamo ) nor Sony ( Pineapple ) would comment for this story .
Presumably , that ’s partly because they ’re worried about being accused of promoting drug use to kids :
Many parents are less comfortable with the depiction of drug use than they are with onscreen violence , and while most pot movies are R-rated , underage kids certainly sneak in .
But Hollywood ’s ambivalence about the stoner movies label may have more to do with trying to maximize their profit .
” We ’re not releasing a niche picture ; it ’s a big , broad comedy , ” insists one studio insider .
” There ’s more to it than a ‘ stoner ’ movie . ”
Oookayy .
But they might just want to chill .
The market for stoner fare has never been better .
” They always say that Hollywood is the most rebellious when there are Republicans in control , ” Chandrasekhar offers .
” But honestly , when Bill Clinton and Barack Obama admit to having smoked , there ’s nothing to rebel against .
I almost think there ’s not the same fun in pot movies now .
[ In 1978 ] you saw Cheech and Chong smoking a joint and you were like , ‘ Holy s — ! ” ’
The area around St. Louis , Missouri , in August 1991 and 1993 .
The 1993 image was captured slightly after the peak water levels in this part of the Mississippi River .
Flood waters had started to recede , but remained well above normal .
This false - color image was created by combining infrared , near infrared , and green wavelengths of light observed by the Landsat 5 satellite .
This month 's flooding in the Midwest is reminiscent of the Great Flood of 1993 , weather officials now say .
But while a repeat of 1993 can't be ruled out , they say , this year is unlikely to match that colossal disaster .
Several of the 1993 records have already been broken this year and flooding is forecasted to last for weeks more .
Preliminary estimates put damage into the billions of dollars with overall storm deaths put at 24 since late May .
But barring unexpected summer rains , National Weather Service officials do not expect a repeat of the incredible intensity and duration of the tremendous flood 15 years ago .
Regardless , history is repeating itself as some residents who moved into the floodplain since 1993 , with assurances from FEMA and other officials that they would be safe , have seen their towns submerged this month , creating personal financial disasters for people who in many cases have no flood insurance .
Looking back
Few disasters in U.S. history match the devastation of 1993 , when hundreds of levees along the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers failed , killing 50 people and causing more than $ 15 billion in damage .
One of the most remarkable aspects of the 1993 flood was its duration .
From May through September , major flooding occurred across North Dakota , South Dakota , Nebraska , Kansas , Minnesota , Iowa , Missouri , Wisconsin , and Illinois .
Some 50,000 homes were destroyed or damaged .
And 75 towns were " totally and completely under flood waters , " according to an account by Lee W. Larson , Chief of the Hydrologic Research Laboratory at NOAA 's National Weather Service .
" It was certainly the largest and most significant flood event ever to occur in the United States , " Larson said .
There were plenty of lessons to learn .
Levees inadequate
According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , water overtopped or damaged 40 of 229 federal levees and 1,043 of 1,347 non-federal levees .
Among the other monumental effects in 1993 :
Barge traffic on both mighty rivers halted for almost 2 months .
Bridges were out or not accessible on the Mississippi River from Davenport , Iowa to St. Louis , Missouri .
Ten commercial airports were flooded .
All railroad traffic in the Midwest was halted .
The 1993 and 1994 harvests were lost .
Numerous sewage treatment plants were destroyed .
The 1993 flood was not entirely unexpected .
NOAA hydrologists had warned that a wet fall in 1992 and normal or above normal snowpack in the central United States meant flooding could be serious when things began to thaw in 1993 .
" I think everyone was ready for some short - term heavy rain and serious flooding , but nobody thought it would last all summer , " recalled Kenneth D. King , chief of hydrologic services at the NOAA National Weather Service Central Region Headquarters in Kansas City , Mo .
Nonstop rain
The rains were unrelenting .
In a five - month stretch starting April 1 , 1993 , nearly 48 inches fell in east - central Iowa , where an average of 33 inches of precipitation normally falls in an entire year .
By mid-June , soil throughout the entire region was saturated , so additional rains brought heavy runoff .
In many locations within the nine - state area hardest hit by the flooding , it rained for 20 or more days in July ; normally it rains eight or nine days during that month .
An unusual climate setup fueled the rains .
A high pressure system known as the Bermuda High , which typically sits out in the Atlantic Ocean during summer and steers hurricanes toward the United States , was stronger than normal and moved farther to the north and west .
This created a dam of air that stopped storms in their tracks over the Midwest , preventing them from sliding to the East Coast as they normally would .
The Missouri River crested at a record 48.9 feet at Kansas City on July 27 , 1993 .
This water joined the already full Mississippi River and pushed the Mississippi to a record crest of 49.47 feet at St. Louis in Aug .
1 .
Some locations on the Mississippi River were in continuous flood for six months .
Lessons learned ?
One might assume some lessons had been learned .
In fact , the NOAA administrator at the time , Dr. James ( Jim ) Baker , assumed so , too :
" Although the Great Flood of 1993 has caused devastating human , environmental and economic impacts , the lessons learned will guide us in providing improved services and benefits to the nation in the future , " Baker wrote then .
But 15 years later , more homes than ever exist in the Midwest floodplains , and few projects to improve levees have been undertaken .
As an example of lessons not learned , the town of Gulfport , Illinois was inundated by 10 feet of water this month when a levee failed .
That levee had been deemed safe by local officials and FEMA .
Only 28 of the town 's 750 residents had flood insurance , the Associated Press reports .
As Gerald Galloway , a professor of engineering at the University of Maryland , put it a few months after Hurricane Katrina : " The half - life of the memory of a flood is very short . ”
Repeat of 1993 ?
Already , several 1993 records have fallen .
" Major and record flooding continues at numerous points from Iowa to Missouri , " according to NOAA .
So far 31 levees have been overtopped or breached on the Mississippi between southern Iowa and St. Louis , with additional levees threatened through the weekend , the agency said in a statement .
The breached levees actually reduce flooding downstream , officials note .
The Mississippi is not expected to rise above 40 feet this week at St. Louis .
That 's nearly 10 feet lower than in 1993 .
Rivers across Iowa are generally falling , while record and major flooding continues on several rivers in Wisconsin , NOAA states .
Preliminary indications are that new records have been set at 21 National Weather Service river forecast locations on tributaries to Mississippi and Missouri Rivers .
Flooding will continue for weeks , forecasters say .
" If we compare 1993 and 2008 for the same time periods — through mid-June — we cannot rule out 2008 flooding could become comparable to 1993 if we have similar storms during the summer of 2008 , " the agency stated .
Bright future
The summer outlook appears sunny , however :
" As the upcoming weather pattern is expected to change and favor drier weather for the central plains in mid-late June , the chance of repeating 1993 appears to be low at this time , " NOAA states .
" The critical unknown elements are the pattern of future rainfall ... and the timing and frequency of any future rainfall . "
Predicting the future is of course tricky .
And it 's liable to get trickier .
Last week , NOAA released a report detailing how the agency expects global warming to affect the United States .
The bottom line : " Droughts , heavy downpours , excessive heat , and intense hurricanes are likely to become more commonplace . "
Loss of memory with advanced age is a significant problem within most societies , and appears particularly severe in advanced industrialized nations .
A less visible and often ignored problem comes from a food supply high in cholesterol and saturated fat , which has led to high obesity rates particularly in the United States .
Researchers from the Medical University of South Carolina ( MUSC ) have linked memory loss to a diet high in saturated fat and cholesterol .
Collaboration between two laboratories at MUSC and one at Arizona State University led researchers to discover that rodents that were fed a diet high in cholesterol and saturated fat displayed impairment in working memory .
This memory loss is associated with inflammation in the brain , as well as the impairment of structural proteins that affect how a nerve cell functions .
As inflammation is associated with a poor diet , the failure of functions in other key organs such as the eye and the ear also could be expected .
Assuming that the same phenomenon occurs in human beings , the study suggests that as humans age , memory may be preserved and brain functions improved by restricting the consumption of cholesterol and saturated fats .
As cases of obesity and obesity - related diseases have increased exponentially in the United States , and are second only to tobacco use for premature mortality and the number of health - care dollars spent , the importance of this issue is immediate .

I have recently written two articles in my TechRepublic IT Security column about browsing securely from unsecured networks via an SSH proxy .
I figured I ’d go into more detail about how it works behind the scenes .
The specific articles in question are :
Technically , you can use PuTTY as a secure proxy on other OSes ( such as FreeBSD and Debian GNU / Linux ) as well , but OpenSSH is not only the obvious and default choice on such platforms — it ’s also probably a better choice than PuTTY when you have it available .
Regardless of what platform and tool you ’re using , the explanation is essentially the same — and I ’ll refer to your “ SSH tool ” , regardless of whether it ’s OpenSSH or PuTTY .
Here ’s how it works , in brief :
When you set up the local proxy with the SSH tool , and you authenticate your SSH connection to the remote Unix / Linux system , you are creating two things :
A. a connection to a remote system via SSH through which any data can be sent , including other networking protocols B. a local service that listens on a specific port and accepts whatever you give to it When you configure your browser to use a proxy , you are telling it to : A. send all HTTP requests to the SSH tool ’s service B. listen for responses to those requests from the SSH tool ’s service
When the SSH tool receives requests from the browser , it forwards them to your remote Unix or Linux system .
That forwarding is done over an encrypted SSH “ tunnel ” , which the local network only recognizes as a single SSH connection , regardless of what data may be passing through that connection .
When the remote Unix or Linux system receives those requests , it acts as part of the proxy system , forwarding the requests to the Internet .
When the remote system receives responses to those requests , it sends them back to your SSH tool .
When your SSH tool gets them , your browser gets them .
As long as you have a broadband Internet connection at the location of the remote Unix / Linux system , you should not notice any real connection performance drop — unless the network you ’re using with the local client system has an Internet connection significantly greater than that of the network where your remote system is connected .
Assuming a 1.5 Mbps connection at your home network ( and assuming the home network is where the remote system is located ) , your connection to the Internet should be at a 1.5 M bps rate unless the network where you have your local client connected is slower .
Now . . . there may be some latency .
You might be getting that 1.5 M bps rate ( or whatever your ISP actually gives you , which may be less than the advertised 1.5 Mbps ) a tiny fraction of a second later than usual .
It should be such a minor latency difference that you ’ll never notice , however — unless there ’s something odd going on , like your connection getting routed from your location in Kansas , through China , and back to Colorado where your home network is located .
Of course , that ’s absurdly unlikely .
Like I said : “ unless there ’s something odd going on . ”
There are a few more points that need to be made :
This is not the same as X forwarding over SSH , MS Windows Remote Desktop , or any other remote application access along those lines .
All applications are being run locally , on your local client system .
All that is being sent back and forth between your local client and your remote server is networking protocol data .
If actual GUI application interface data were being sent back and forth : A . It could have a significant effect on networking performance .
HTTP requests and responses alone are generally quite light - weight , carrying very little data across the network .
GUI interface data , on the other hand , is very “ heavy ” , requiring a lot more data to be carried across the network connection — thus consuming more bandwidth that might otherwise be used to ensure quick response to network requests .
B . Any file operations and other application behavior that depends upon local conditions treats the remote system as the local system , because it is the local system to the application .
This means that ( for instance ) if you download a file with a browser run on the remote system via some kind of “ remote desktop ” software ( like VNC , X forwarding , and MS Windows Remote Desktop ) , it will be downloaded to your remote server , on your home network — and not on the machine you ’re using as your client system on the network away from home .
Because all the local , unsecured network sees is your encrypted SSH tunnel , nobody can “ listen in ” on your Web traffic through that tunnel .
Any network packets sent through that tunnel are protected against eavesdropping of any kind by the strong encryption employed by SSH .
The SSH protocol itself is designed so that your authentication ( where login username and password ) are sent to the server is encrypted as well , so that eavesdroppers cannot even pick that out of the network communications being sent back and forth .
It is , however , still advisable to use key - based authentication , and to disable password authentication entirely on the server if you can , just to eliminate opportunity for brute force password cracking attacks and similar issues .
When setting up your proxy configuration options on your browser , do n’t forget that you should configure it to use the localhost IP address ( 127.0.0.1 ) and the port number specified in your SSH tool ’s proxy setup ( 8080 in the examples in both articles , though you may end up selecting a different port number ) .
If you configure it to use the IP address or hostname of the remote network , your proxy connection wo n’t be set up properly .
Hopefully that helps settle any confusion or misunderstanding that may exist in readers of those articles .
Let me know if you ( my readers ) have any questions .
A diving zookeeper tries to measure a hammerhead shark at the Sea Life aquarium in Hanover January 28 , 2008 .
The number of sharks in the Mediterranean has fallen by 97 percent in the last 200 years , putting the sea 's ecological balance at risk , a report released on Wednesday said .
REUTERS / Christian Charisius
ROME ( Reuters ) -
The number of sharks in the Mediterranean has fallen by 97 percent in the last 200 years , putting the sea ’s ecological balance at risk , a report released on Wednesday said .
The report , by the Washington - based Lenfest Ocean Program , used records such as fishermen ’s logs , shark landings , museum specimens and visual sightings to estimate the number and size of the Mediterranean sharks over the last two centuries .
There was only enough data on five of the 20 big shark species present in the Mediterranean to be useful to the study -- the hammerhead , thresher , blue and two species of mackerel shark , which averaged a decline of 97 percent .
“ It will have a major impact on the ecosystem because large predatory sharks are at the top of the food chain , ” said Francesco Ferretti , the report ’s lead author .
Losing the top of the food chain can mean smaller fish thrive and consume more of their prey , upsetting the ecological balance .
“ If we lose these sharks we are going to lose this important portion of the ecosystem functioning , ” said Ferretti .
A report last month by the International Union for Conservation of Nature found 11 kinds of shark faced extinction due to overfishing , partly caused by booming demand for shark fin soup in Asia .
Fishers from all over the world catch and trade sharks for their lucrative fins , often discarding their carcasses , the report said , noting Indonesia and Spain are among the top culprits .
Ferretti said the practice was not thought to be common in the Mediterranean due to the small numbers of sharks now present there .
More of a problem was “ by - catch ” -- where sharks are caught in long - line fishing meant to snag tuna and swordfish .
“ The Mediterranean has been fished since Roman times , it ’s a historical thing , ” said Ferretti .
“ But now ( modern ) fishing has put big impact on the shark population . ”

決して混ぜないよう気をつけてコード書くべきなんですが、もう無理かもな。
や ぱしwchar_tを使うってことは、ISO-Cにのっとって移植性のあるコードを書くということだと思います。
そもそもwchar_tがUCS4であることを仮定して書いたコードには移植性はありません。
仮にwchar_t=UCS4を__STDC_ISO10646__を盾に認めさせたとしても
wchar_t=UCS2(これはUCS4はUCS2のスーパーセットなのでOK)ならばwchar_t=UTF16でもいいだろうと
サロゲートペア処理するなんてのはwchar_t=1文字という規格すらぶち壊すことになりますやね

wchar_t=UTF16が都合がいい、という理由ってのはどうせWin32APIの要求なわけですし
それなら移植性もへったくれもないのでwchart_t/mbrtowc/wcrtombなんぞ使わず

There 's no method to get the metaclass .
Some people create modules as a hint that they reopened the class .
I can't remember the last time I actually wanted a method to get the metaclass .
If you use a module to add behavior your behavior becomes part of the ancestor tree , which is significantly more helpful than putting your behavior directly on the class .
No metaclass method necessary
Include modules instead of reopening classes
Use modules instead of adding behavior directly
expects
hello
class Object
def hello
" hello "
end
end
class Object
alias old_hello hello
def hello ( name )
" #{ old_hello } #{ name } "
end
end
hello ( " Ali " )
class Object
module Hello
def hello
" hello "
end
end
include Hello
end
class Object
module HelloName
def hello ( name )
" #{ super ( ) } #{ name } "
end
end
include HelloName
end
hello ( " Ali " )
super
note :
Object.send :include , HelloName
Prefer Modules to metaclasses and reopened classes
When I began seriously using Ruby I noticed two things that I did n't like about the language .
It 's a few years later and I 've noticed a few interesting things .
In April 2005 , Why gave us Seeing Metaclasses Clearly .
I 'm not sure the article actually helped me see metaclasses clearly , but I know I pasted that first block of code into several of my first Ruby projects .
I used metaclasses in every way possible , several of which were probably inappropriate , and saw exactly what was possible , desirable , and painful .
I thought I had a good understanding of the proper uses for metaclasses , and then Ali Aghareza brought me a fresh point of view : defining methods on a metaclass is just mean .
We were on the phone talking about who knows what , and he brought up a blog entry I 'd written where I dynamically defined delegation methods on the metaclass based on a constructor argument .
He pointed out that doing so limited your ability to change the method behavior in the future .
I created some simple examples and found out he was right , which lead to my blog entry on why you should Extend modules instead of defining methods on a metaclass
Ever since that conversation and the subsequent blog entry , I 've been using modules instead of accessing the metaclass directly .
" Just in case someone wants to redefine behavior " is n't really a good enough reason for me if the level of effort increases , but in this case I found the code to be easier to follow when I used modules .
In programming , there are few win -win situations , but Ali definitely showed me one on this occasion .
If you interact with a metaclass directly , do a quick spike where you introduce a module instead .
I think you 'll be happy with the resulting code .
In January of 2007 I wrote a blog entry titled Class Reopening Hints .
I did n't write it because I thought it was very valuable , I wrote it so developers afraid of open classes could get some sleep at night .
Those guys think we are going to bring the end of the world with our crazy open classes , and I wanted to let them know we'd at least thought about the situation .
I 'm really not kidding , I thought the entry was a puff piece , but it made some people feel better about Ruby so I put it together .
I never followed theadvice though , and I do n't think many other Rubyists did either .
It was extra effort , and I did n't see the benefit .
In over two and an half years working with Ruby I 've never once had a problem finding where behavior was defined .
With that kind of experience , I could n't justify the extra effort of defining a module -- until the day I wanted to change the behavior of Object #expects ( defined by Mocha ) .
I was able to work around the fact that Mocha defines themethod directly on Object , but the solution was anything but pretty .
It turns out , using modules instead of adding behavior directly to a reopened class has one large benefit : I can easily define new behavior on a class by including a new module .
If you only need new behavior , then defining a new method on the class would be fine .
But , if you want to preserve the original behavior , having it as an ancestor is much better .
Take the following example .
This example assumes that a methodhas been defined on object .
Your task is to change the hello method to include the original behavior and add a name .
That code is n't terrible .
In fact , there are a few different ways to redefine methods and access the original behavior , but none of them look as nice as the following example .
When you have an ancestor , the behavior is only acall away .
Yes , I 've also reopened the class to include the module , but when I talk about reopening the class I 'm talking about defining the behavior directly on the reopened class .
I could have also included the module by using .
Do whichever you like , it 's not pertinent to this discussion .
The previous example illustrates why you should prefer modules , it gives simple access to your method behavior to anyone who wishes to alter but reuse the original behavior .
This fact applies to both classes that include modules and instances that extend modules .
So why did n't Matz give us first class access to the metaclass ?
Who cares .
He probably knew extending modules was a better solution , but even if he did n't -- it is .
He did n't give you a method to access the metaclass , and whether he knew it or not , you do n't need it .
The Trojan Horse Example By Bryan Caplan
Austrian economists often attack the mainstream for ignoring something they call “ radical uncertainty , ” “ sheer ignorance , ” or sometimes “ Knightian uncertainty . ”
A common Austrian slogan is that “ Neoclassical economists study only cases where people know that they do n’t know ; we study cases where people do n’t know that they do n’t know . ”
All of this sounds plausible until you press the Austrian to do one of two things :
1. Explain his point using standard probability language .
What probability does “ do n’t know that you do n’t know ” correspond to ?
Zero ?
But if people really assigned p=0 to an event , than the arrival of counter - evidence should make them think that they are delusional , not than a p=0 event has occured .
2. Give a good concrete example .
I ’ve heard Israel Kirzner give examples involving library books , pay phones , and bumps on the head , but none of them make any sense to me .
A better example , suggested by Richard Langlois , is the Trojan Horse .
What I discovered a few years ago , and only remembered yesterday when my kids read a book about the Trojan War , is that in Virgil ’s canonical account , the Trojans specifically consider the possibility that the horse contains Greeks :
Laocoon , follow’d by a num ’rous crowd ,
Ran from the fort , and cried , from far , aloud :
‘ O wretched countrymen ! what fury reigns ?
What more than madness has possess ’d your brains ?
Think you the Grecians from your coasts are gone ?
And are Ulysses ’ arts no better known ?
This hollow fabric either must inclose ,
Within its blind recess , our secret foes ;
Or ‘t is an engine rais ’d above the town ,
T’ o’erlook the walls , and then to batter down .
Somewhat is sure design ’d , by fraud or force :
Trust not their presents , nor admit the horse . ’ ( bold - face mine )
So why in the world does the Trojan horse ruse work ?
Because Poseidon punishes the leading skeptic by sending sea serpents to eat him and his children , and that ends the debate :
Two serpents , rank ’d abreast , the seas divide ,
And smoothly sweep along the swelling tide .
[…]
We fled amaz ’d ; their destin’d way they take ,
And to Laocoon and his children make ;
And first around the tender boys they wind ,
Then with their sharpen ’d fangs their limbs and bodies grind .
The wretched father , running to their aid
With pious haste , but vain , they next invade ;
Twice round his waist their winding volumes roll ’d ;
And twice about his gasping throat they fold .
[…]
Amazement seizes all ; the gen ’ral cry
Proclaims Laocoon justly doom’d to die ,
Whose hand the will of Pallas had withstood ,
And dared to violate the sacred wood .
Of course , the fact that the Trojan horse is a bad example of radical ignorance does n’t prove that Austrians can’t produce a decent example .
But I ’ve been pressing Austrians on this point for over a decade , and yet to get a decent response .
Anyone want to give it a try ?
I have it on good authority that Poseidon ’s sea serpents will leave you alone even if you hit the nail on the head . 🙂

In the ad , McCain says : " Only a fool or a fraud talks tough or romantically about war .
... I was shot down over Vietnam and spent five years as a POW .
... I hate war .
And I know how terrible its costs are .
I 'm running for president to keep the country I love safe .
I'm John McCain , and I approve this message . "
Oops .
I guess John Sidney McCain did n't refrain hard enough :
Oh , and this one 's no longer available on YouTube : I 'm sure there are lots more examples out there .
But those would all be erroneous .
He 's been Swiftboated , but he'd never exploit his P.O.W. status , never .
Kelly O'Donnell said so , so it must be true .
Mount Nyiragongo , located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , January 17 , 2002 , ejecting a large cloud of smoke and ash high into the sky and spewing lava down three sides of the volcano .
Mount Nyiragongo is located roughly 10 km ( 6 miles ) north of the town of Goma , near the Congo 's border with Rwanda .
One river of lava headed straight toward Goma , where international aid teams were evacuating residents .
The lava flows burned through large swaths of the surrounding jungle and destroyed dozens of homes .
This false - color image was acquired January 17 , 2002 by the Moderate - resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) roughly 5 hours after the eruption began .
Notice Mount Nyiragongo's large plume ( bright white ) can be seen streaming westward in this scene .
The plume appears to be higher than the immediately adjacent clouds and so it is colder in temperature , making it easy for MODIS to distinguish the volcanic plume from the clouds by using image bands sensitive to thermal radiation .
The news from The Congo , where I spent three years as a Peace Corps Volunteer , continues to depress .
Two earthquakes struck hours apart in Rwanda and the neighboring Congo on Sunday .
At least 39 people were killed and hundreds of others injured in Rwanda .
Some of the victims died when the church they were attending collapsed .
Across the border in the lakeside city of Bukavu , five people were killed and 149 wounded .
Many homes , as well as schools and churches , were damaged in the city but the extent was not immediately clear .
The area where the quakes hit is part of Africa ’s Great Rift Valley , which includes a seismically active fault line .
Mount Nyiragongo erupted in the Democratic Republic of Congo in January 2002 .
Molten lava plunged down the hillside and poured into nearby Lake Kivu .
Many died , and much of the city of Goma was destroyed .
In fact , the local people were lucky .
Had the eruption spread to one of the many volcanic faults under Lake Kivu , it could have unleashed one of the most terrifying of all natural phenomena - lake overturn .
A limnic eruption , also referred to as a lake overturn or exploding lake , is a rare type of natural disaster in which CO2 suddenly erupts from deep lake water , posing the threat of suffocating wildlife , livestock and humans .
Such an eruption may also cause tsunamis in the lake as the rising CO2 displaces water .
Scientists believe landslides , volcanic activity , or explosions can trigger such an eruption ..
In 1986 , the tragedy of Lake Nyos , in Cameroon , made headlines around the world when almost 1,800 people sleeping in houses around the lake suffocated in their sleep .
The team of scientists that went to investigate concluded that carbon dioxide , trapped at the bottom of the lake , had suddenly risen to the surface , killing everything within 25 km .
They called their theory lake overturn .
Eventually the scientists came to realize that carbon dioxide springs underground were pumping carbon dioxide into the lake and that the whole tragedy would be repeated if nothing was done .
They installed an extraordinary fountain in the middle of the lake to help the gas disperse .
Even so , the level of carbon dioxide in the waters remains a concern .
The Nyos disaster promoted a survey of deep lakes in Africa and Indonesia to see where else lake overturn could happen .
All seem to be safe , except one - Lake Kivu , in Rwanda .
Lake Kivu is one of the largest and deepest lakes in Africa and two million people live around its shore .
It is also filling up with carbon dioxide , although it 's not yet saturated with the deadly gas .
The only thing that could trigger a gas release would be a massive geological event .
Lake Kivu is sitting in an earthquake zone and surrounded by active volcanoes , including Mount Nyiragongo .
If an eruption or an earthquake was to happen under the lake , then the effect could release millions of tons of asphyxiating gas into the surrounding areas .
Until a solution is found , millions of lives could be at risk .
I trained for three months on the shores of Lake Kivu , learning French and teaching methodologies .
Each day I would swim across the lake - I was in much better condition - Ah youth !
I knew that the citizens of the country , then called the Republic of Zaire , suffered : malnutrition disease and tribal atrocities were daily realities .
Never could I have imagined that the lake itself could pose a threat .

Everybody 's in favor of food safety but not everyone agrees about how to get there from here .
Consumer groups want tougher regulation and more frequent inspection of food processing plants and farms .
While almost no one opposes this , many public health scientists think irradiation could go a long way towards killing many of the pathogens that sicken thousands of Americans each year .
There 's not likely to be agreement anytime soon .
A big part of the problem is the highly industrialized nature of food production .
Never before has food been grown in such vast quantities and shipped over such great distances before it reaches our table .
Writing from India , globe - trotting correspondent Tom Glaister examines the issue in Industrial " Food " a Growing Menace .
Government sites
Food recalls are handled by both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Food Safety and Inspection Service .
It may be July , but Christmas came early this year for Big Brother and the telecommunications giants .
Unfortunately , it is average Americans who will pay — dearly — on three separate counts .
First , precious constitutional and other legal protections against warrantless domestic surveillance have been shattered .
The federal government may now secretly and legally eavesdrop on virtually any American ’s e-mail , cell phone and landline communications — without first getting a court - ordered warrant .
New federal legislation gives the government and phone companies sweeping new domestic surveillance powers .
It allows for mass , untargeted , warrantless eavesdropping against ordinary American citizens and political activists .
It sets back hard - fought free speech , civil rights and privacy protections that were won by popular pressure following the Vietnam War and Watergate era .
The second price that Americans will pay is by those who have been illegally monitored since 9/11 .
They will lose billions of dollars from dozens of anti-spying lawsuits pending against the likes of Sprint , AT&T and Verizon .
These suits , covering the last seven years , will now be dismissed in a huge giveaway of immunity to the telecommunications lobby and big campaign donors .
The lawsuits arose from the government ’s secret eavesdropping on American citizens , carried out since September 11 by Verizon , AT&T and others at the behest of the Bush administration , without court - ordered warrant , which until now had been legally required .
Third , Americans will be unable to discover the extent and details of the government ’s post - 9/11 domestic spying operation , which barely came to light three years ago .
That domestic eavesdropping campaign will now continue and expand further — with legal sanction — in the dark recesses of total secrecy .
The new bill is a huge and blatant cover-up .
Democrats had claimed to be against the bill for months , but — as they did with the earlier USA PATRIOT Act — easily and completely capitulated .
The new legislation received overwhelming bipartisan support in the U.S. House of Representatives on June 19 ; its imminent approval by the Senate is a foregone conclusion .
Reversing himself along with so many of his colleagues , Barack Obama gave fresh evidence of what can be expected of him if he wins the presidency .
In February , when he was running against Hillary Clinton , Obama said he “ was proud ” to stand against this bill ’s predecessor and its blanket immunity for the telecommunications companies ’ violations of individuals ’ civil rights .
Four months later , no longer needing to position himself to the left of his former Democratic rival , Obama has revealed his real stance .
He has announced he will vote in favor of the state powers and immunity for crimes and violations he so recently denounced .
At a time when Democrats are most ascendant — when Republicans , the war and bogus post - 9/11 “ national security ” scams for gutting constitutional rights have been most discredited — Obama and “ bipartisan ” Democrats are giving the completely weakened Bush administration exactly what it wants .
Why ?
There can be only one reason .
It is what they want , too .
The new bill guts the post - Watergate Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) , which was created in 1978 to require warrants from secret courts for domestic government spying in national security matters .
These were created to curb blatant government domestic wiretap abuse , revealed by the Senate ’s Church Committee and others .
The Church Committee , convened in the 1970s to investigate government claims against domestic “ terrorists , ” instead revealed a massive , secret official campaign of spying , sabotage , thug tactics , “ dirty tricks ” and criminal activity by the government against ordinary Americans .
The secret surveillance and criminal sabotage were carried out especially against many thousands of movement activists — antiwar , civil rights , antiracist , left wing and many other dissenters .
The political opponents the government systematically “ terrorized ” covered a broad range : the Black Panthers , antiwar organizers , Puerto Rican nationalists , journalists , Native American groups , socialist organizations , peace vigil groups , Martin Luther King , Jr. Even congressional opponents were targeted .
The eavesdropping , disruption schemes , blackmail , assaults , assassinations and other crimes were carried out by the CIA , FBI and many other government agencies , through programs like the infamous COINTELPRO ( COunterINtelligence PROgram ) .
Mass popular opposition won victories that curbed government thuggery and spying against the American people and political activists .
But longtime official efforts to rehabilitate such programs have used 9/11 as a cover for supposedly “ temporary ” measures against ostensible “ terrorists ” ( most notably via the Patriot Act ) .
Those efforts have now succeeded in getting exactly what was wanted all along — permanent “ legal ” license to listen in on any American ’s communications at will , without meaningful “ interference ” or supervision from the courts , without the ability of ordinary folks to find out or challenge what the government is doing , and without recourse to legal remedies for what was previously known as breaking the law .
The demolition of civil liberties and human rights introduced at Guantánamo is coming home .
Feb. 28 , 2008  --
In his back - and - forth with Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , over Iraq , Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz . , Thursday morning sought to portray the Democratic front - runner as representing the Iraq politics of the past by focusing on the decision to invade in 2003 rather than what to do now .
" That 's history , that 's the past , " McCain told attendees at a town hall meeting at Rice University .
" That 's talking about what happened before .
What we should be talking about is what we 're going to do now .
And what we 're going to do now is continue this strategy which is succeeding in Iraq and we are carrying out the goals of the surge , the Iraqi military are taking over more and more of the responsibilities . "
It was an interesting claim from the man seeking to be the oldest American ever first elected president — about a candidate 25 years his junior — and is just the latest charge in what may be a preview of the general election .
al Qaeda in Iraq
McCain Wednesday criticized Obama for stating that as president , after withdrawing combat troops from Iraq , he might send troops back in " if al Qaeda is forming a base " there .
Seeking to portray Obama as naïve and ill - informed on national security , McCain said , " I have some news — al Qaeda is in Iraq .
It 's called : ' Al Qaeda in Iraq . ' "
In Columbus , Ohio , that day , Obama said , " I have some news for John McCain , and that is that there was no such thing as al Qaeda in Iraq until George Bush and John McCain decided to invade Iraq . "
McCain continued to debate this argument today at Rice University .
" So let me get this right , " McCain said .
" Senator Obama wants to leave immediately from Iraq , but if al Qaeda is in Iraq then he would consider going back .
Obviously that 's , that 's not logical .
In fact , we are succeeding in Iraq something that both he and Senator Clinton refuse to acknowledge . "
Questions of Fear - Mongering
McCain went on to list ways he says the surge strategy in Iraq is working .
" The Iraqi military are taking over more and more of the responsibilities .
The casualties are down , and we will be able to withdraw and come home but we will come home with honor . "
He said " if we do what Senator Clinton and Senator Obama want — which is declare a date for withdrawal — then al Qaeda will tell the world that they defeated the United States of America and we will be fighting again in that region and in the rest of the world and they will follow us home . "
Pushing back on any idea he 's fear - mongering , McCain said his charge that al Qaeda would follow Americans home is based on al Qaeda rhetoric .
" That 's not my idea , that 's theirs , if you read what [ Osama ] bin Laden … [ Ayman ] Zawahiri and all the others are saying , " he said .
" There 's a lot at stake here , my friends . "
In Defense of NAFTA
McCain went after both Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - NY , on the subject of trade , as both Democrats continued to rail against NAFTA as they compete for votes in Ohio , where union households represent 25 percent of Democratic primary voters .
" NAFTA has created jobs , " McCain said , arguing that the trade deal has been good for the American , Canadian , and Mexican economies .
" Anyone who studies history understands that every time this country or other nations in the world have practiced protectionism , they 've paid a very , very heavy price for it , " McCain said , adding that " some would argue that one of the major contributors to World War II was the Smoot - Hawley tariffs acts . "
McCain called himself an advocate of " free trade , " which would be " one of the many differences between myself and whoever the nominee of the Democratic party is . "
Many parts of Bletchley Park are showing their age
A call to save Bletchley Park has gone out from the UK 's computer scientists .
More than 100 academics have signed a letter to The Times saying the code - cracking centre and crucible of the UK computer industry deserves better .
They say Bletchley , Buckinghamshire , should be put on a secure financial basis like other " great museums " .
" We cannot allow this crucial and unique piece of both British and World heritage to be neglected in this way , " the letter to The Times said .
Please turn on JavaScript .

The academics were brought together by Dr Sue Black , head of the computer science department at the University of Westminster , who was moved to act after visiting Bletchley Park in early July .
" I went up there and felt quite upset by what I saw , " she said .
Many of the buildings on the Bletchley estate were in a state of serious disrepair , she said .
One building , where code - breakers worked during World War II , was falling apart , said Dr Black , and was protected by a blue tarpaulin that was nailed down over it .
Describing Bletchley as a " gem " , Dr Black said it was a " national disgrace " that such a historic site was being allowed to fall into ruin .
Celebrating the UK 's computer pioneers " I do not know why they do not have funding as a national museum , " she said .
The visit led her to contact other heads of computer science departments at universities up and down the country .
Within hours , she had hundreds of responses - all of them backing her call .
Dr Black said she had been " overwhelmed " by the response which showed the depth of feeling about Bletchley and the position it occupies in the history of the computer age .
Bletchley Park is well known as the place where the Enigma codes were broken but it is also the place where Colossus was created - a machine that was the forerunner of many modern computers .
The engineers that worked on Colossus at Bletchley helped define and develop the UK computer industry after WWII ended , said Dr Black .
What was needed , she said , was for Bletchley Park to get secure funding from the government .
Until recently the site was deemed ineligible for Lottery funding that would help preserve it .
A change to the rules on who can get funds has led to negotiations with the Lottery Fund .
However , said Dr Black , it could still take up to a year for funds to materialise .
In the meantime , said Dr Black , the site was falling into an ever worse state of disrepair .

NEW ORLEANS 
The sharp surge in black turnout that Senator Barack Obama has helped to generate in recent primaries and Congressional races could signal a threat this fall to the longtime Republican dominance of the South , according to politicians and voting experts .
Should Mr. Obama become the Democratic nominee , he would still have to struggle for white swing voters in the South and in border states like West Virginia , where he lost decisively to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in Tuesday ’s presidential primary .
In West Virginia , where more than three - fourths of white voters chose Mrs. Clinton , 20 percent of the white voters said the race of the candidate mattered in their choice .
But in Southern states with large black populations , like Alabama , Mississippi and Virginia , an energized black electorate could create a countervailing force , particularly if conservative white voters choose not to flock to Senator John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee .
Merle Black , a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta , predicts “ the largest black turnout in the history of the United States ” this fall if Mr. Obama is the nominee .
To hold these states , Republicans may have to work harder than ever .
Already , turnout in Democratic primaries this year has substantially exceeded Republican turnout in states like Arkansas , Louisiana , South Carolina , Tennessee and Virginia .
Would you reveal how much you earn ?
The majority of people would be happy to tell colleagues how much they earn , according to a report .
About two thirds of workers said they would welcome more openness - believing it would help tackle the gender pay gap , said recruitment firm Hudson .
A similar proportion felt senior bosses should disclose their own salaries .
Londoners were least prepared to discuss pay with others , the survey said , while those in the West Midlands were most relaxed about it .
" A policy of salary disclosure at all levels is not likely to be appropriate at many organisations , " said Hudson 's chief executive Andy Rogerson .
" But the underlying principle , of ensuring fairness and transparency in the process of setting and reviewing salaries is a good one . "
Why should you mind others knowing what you earn , unless you have something to hide or you 're ashamed of it for some reason .
Peter , Bristol
Read what others think According to the union Unite , some organisations had made it a disciplinary offence to discuss pay .
This was " totally unacceptable " , it said .
The TUC said that the vast majority of employers refused to disclose pay scales .
Mandatory pay audits were the only way to stamp out gender pay gaps , said its general secretary Brendan Barber .
Earlier this week , there was outrage in Italy after the outgoing government published every Italian 's declared earnings and tax contributions on the internet .
The tax authority 's website was inundated by people curious to know how much their neighbours , celebrities or sports stars were making .
The Italian treasury suspended the website after a formal complaint from the country 's privacy watchdog .
The information was put on the site with no warning for nearly 24 hours .

What are these ?
Russell Gold reports :
It 's been a hot June in Austin , Texas .
Fourteen days above 100 degrees Fahrenheit - so far .
Ten days have set new heat records .
Bad for lawns .
Good for Office Depot .
The national retailer of pens , paper , computer mice and other office stuff is opening its newest - and most energy - efficient - store here this week .
Here comes the sun ( Office Depot ) Inside , the store looked like any other brightly - lit big box retailer .
By itself , this is an impressive feat , since much of the ambient light comes from skylights .
But not just any run -of - the - mill skylights .
Office Depot installed 50 skylights from Utah - based Ciralight Inc. Office Depot 's vice president of construction Edward Costa clambered up to the roof to show off what look like giant plastic pimples .
Each one has a reflective mirror that tracks the sun , directing sunlight through a prismatic lens that diffuses it into the store .
Psychological studies point out one more reason why long meetings are no fun and get less done :
Imagine , for a moment , that you are facing a very difficult decision about which of two job offers to accept .
One position offers good pay and job security , but is pretty mundane , whereas the other job is really interesting and offers reasonable pay , but has questionable job security .
Clearly you can go about resolving this dilemma in many ways .
Few people , however , would say that your decision should be affected or influenced by whether or not you resisted the urge to eat cookies prior to contemplating the job offers .
A decade of psychology research suggests otherwise .
Unrelated activities that tax the executive function have important lingering effects , and may disrupt your ability to make such an important decision .
In other words , you might choose the wrong job because you did n’t eat a cookie .
Research by University of Minnesota psychologist Kathleen Vohs and colleagues indicates that we have a limited amount of what they call executive resources .
Once they start to get depleted , we make bad choices .
And how do you consume your executive resources ?
In three ways .
You use them every time you :
Exercise commitment ( as in not eating that cookie you really wanted because you ’re on a diet )
Focus your attention ( as in listening to someone speaking , though you ’d rather check email on your Blackberry )
Make a decision ( as in choosing which of two possible projects to approve )
A - HA !!!!!
Business meetings require participants to commit , focus and make decisions – with no acknowledgment of the fact that in doing so they ’re consuming a finite resource .
Once this resource runs out , people make worse decisions !!!
Suddenly those three - hour project meetings are n’t looking so smart , are they ?
Not that they ever really did , but you know what I mean .
The article left me with a few questions :
How do we recharge our executive resources ?
Can we increase our executive resources over time by exercising them ?
The way physical exercise makes you tired right now but increases your fitness over time .
How quickly can they be recharged ?
Once they ’re gone , are they gone for the day ?
The week ?
Or can they be recharged in time for the next meeting ?
If you know the answer to any of these questions , I ’d love to hear it !
Your take
What do you think ?
Have you noticed this kind of thing in meetings ?
What do you think is the cut - off point beyond which meetings just devolve into pointlessness and no good decisions can be made ?
An hour ?
Two? 15 minutes ?

The Internet is a great breeding ground for political conspiracies , and there is a new one lighting up computer monitors across the country .
Bloggers are fascinated by what they see as eerie parallels between Watergate and a phone - jamming scandal in New Hampshire .
It has low - level Republican operatives involved in dirty campaign tricks .
It has checks from donors with murky backgrounds .
It has telephone calls to the White House .
What is unclear is whether it is the work of a few rogue actors , or something larger .
In 2002 , there was a hard - fought Senate race between Gov. Jeanne Shaheen , the Democrat , and John Sununu , the Republican .
On Election Day , Democratic workers arrived at five get - out - the - vote offices to find their phone lines jammed .
It turned out that the jamming was being done by an Idaho telemarketing firm that was being paid by a Virginia consulting group .
The fee for the jamming , reportedly $ 15,600 , was paid by New Hampshire Republicans .
The executive director of the New Hampshire Republican Party and the president of the Virginia consulting group pleaded guilty for their part in the scheme .
James Tobin , who was the New England political director for the Republican National Committee , went to trial and was convicted of telephone harassment last December .
Now , Jack Abramoff and his Indian tribe clients have joined the cast of characters , and some records of phone calls to the White House have turned up , though the significance of both of these revelations is hotly disputed .
The evidence that the phone - jamming scandal goes higher than Mr. Tobin remains scant .
But the watchdogs are right about this : the news media , prosecutors and the general public should demand more information about what happened .
