Armed police are out in force in Urumqi , Xinjiang 's capital
New protests have flared in the western Chinese city of Urumqi , two days after more than 150 people died in clashes involving ethnic groups and police .
About 200 ethnic Uighurs , who are a Muslim minority , faced off against police to protest over the arrest of 1,434 people over Sunday 's unrest .
Groups of ethnic Han Chinese have now armed themselves with batons and stones and have gathered in Urumqi .
Beijing and the Uighurs blame each other for the outbreak of violence .
Witnesses to Sunday 's protests said Uighur protesters attacked vehicles before turning on local Han Chinese .
The unrest was apparently sparked by a brawl between Uighurs and Han Chinese several weeks earlier in a toy factory thousands of miles away in Guandong province .
Officials say 156 people - mostly ethnic Han Chinese - died in Sunday 's violence and more than 1,000 were injured .
Uighur groups say many more have died , claiming 90 % of the dead were Uighurs .
State - run news agency Xinhua also reported a protest in another part of Xinjiang province on Monday , with police breaking up a 200 - strong demonstration near a mosque in the city of Kashgar .
' Extraordinary defiance '
The BBC's Quentin Sommerville , on the streets of Urumqi , says at least 200 people - mostly elderly women or women with children - took to the streets , complaining that their relatives had been arbitrarily arrested .
AT THE SCENE Quentin Sommerville , Urumqi
Hundreds of people , mainly women , have come into the streets .
They are screaming and shouting , " Give us our freedom , give us back our men . "
The police are running at a trot with batons and shields .
The Uighur men and women are standing their ground .
Some are beginning to disperse .
This is a city where the Chinese authorities say they have regained control , but the scenes going on around me tell an entirely different story .
Foreign journalists witnessed the protest during a tour led by government officials showing them parts of the city where shops and homes had been destroyed in Sunday 's violence .

Our correspondent says it was an extraordinary act of defiance by the protesters .
He says riot police - armed with rifles and tear gas - charged the women and surrounded them .
But they sat on the ground in defiance of orders from officers to disperse .
He says the protesters finally began leaving as the journalists were ushered away from the area .
But policemen were waiting in the side streets , he said , and it was unclear what had happened to the women .
Later , in what seems to be a counter - protest , Han Chinese people gathered in various parts of the city .
Reports say riot police dispersed them with tear gas .
Buses ' torn apart '
The mass arrests have been going on since Sunday 's clashes .
Reports are surfacing that police have been going from house to house , rounding up young men for questioning .

In pictures : Xinjiang protests Q&A : China and the Uighurs China tells its own story Accounts of Xinjiang violence The Chinese authorities say they have arrested the " ringleaders " of the protests , but that they are still seeking others .
Witnesses said Uighur protesters tore apart buses and cars with their bare hands on Sunday , and then turned on the local Han Chinese in what appears to have been an ethnic attack .
Some Chinese were dragged from the windows of buses while others were beaten in their homes .
Many of the injured - Uighur , Han and some from another ethnic group , the Hui - are still being treated in Urumqi 's hospitals .
Demonstrators said they had been demanding justice for two Uighurs killed last month in a fight with ethnic Han Chinese at a factory in south - eastern China .
Officials say 15 people have now been arrested over the Guandong incident .
There has been widespread international concern at the clashes , which some analysts say are the most serious in China since Tiananmen Square in 1989 .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon led the calls for restraint , a sentiment echoed by Britain and the US .

Force India 's Giancarlo Fisichella sent shockwaves through Formula 1 by setting pole position for the Belgian Grand Prix - but it is Toyota 's Jarno Trulli who on paper has the best chance of winning Sunday 's race .
Once the amount of fuel being carried by the cars is taken into account , Trulli - who qualified second - was the fastest man at Spa - Francorchamps on Saturday .
Fisichella was fourth behind Red Bull 's Sebastian Vettel and BMW Sauber 's Nick Heidfeld - still a stunningly good result for a team more used to being at the back of the F1 grid .
The BBC Sport fuel - adjusted Belgian Grand Prix grid , with predicted first pit stops , is as follows :
1 Trulli ( lap 12 )
2 Vettel +0.156 secs ( lap 15 )
3 Heidfeld +0.157secs ( lap 12 )
4 Fisichella +0.211 ( lap 10 )
5 Kimi Raikkonen +0.290 ( lap 12 )
6 Mark Webber +0.341 ( lap 13 )
7 Robert Kubica +0.454 ( lap 10 )
8 Nico Rosberg +0.495 ( lap 16 )
9 Rubens Barrichello +0.538 ( lap nine )
10 Timo Glock +0.562 ( lap 10 )
We calculate these figures by combining the weight of fuel in the cars in qualifying , the lap - time penalty for each kilogramme of fuel and the amount of fuel used by a car on a lap .
The cars in the top 10 shoot - out are not allowed to refuel between qualifying and the race so their pace , and their first stop , are dictated by the amount of fuel they are carrying .
The fuel - adjusted grid therefore makes analysing how the race might pan out much easier - and in this case Trulli is clearly in the best shape to win , in that he is the fastest car closest to the front of the grid .
Could Raikkonen win at Spa from sixth on the grid ?
This is not the first time that has happened this year - Trulli also should have won in Bahrain , where a bizarre strategy decision by Toyota scuppered his chances .
With question marks hanging over their future in F1 , the team are desperate to score their first victory in their ninth season in the sport .
But with the traditionally faster cars some way behind them , Toyota have never had a better chance than this to shed their reputation for being the masters of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory .
Underlining that point , the de facto second fastest man in qualifying was Vettel - but the Red Bull driver is only eighth on the grid , so he is likely to be hamstrung by spending time behind slower cars that will prevent him running at his ultimate pace .
He will hope to leapfrog them by running longer than most to his first pit stop , but even so he will be doing well to overcome the handicap of starting so low down .
Heidfeld was third on the grid and on fuel - adjusted times , and this steady , consistent driver must therefore be fancied for a strong points finish .
But the man all the leading runners may be most wary of is Raikkonen in the Ferrari .
He has been second and third in the last two races - both times after qualifying sixth , which is again his starting position at Spa .
There are two factors pointing towards a potentially even stronger finish for Raikkonen this time , though .
The first is that only Barrichello of the regular front - runners is in front of him - and the Brazilian is only ninth fastest on fuel - corrected times and will pit about three laps before the Ferrari driver .
The second is that Raikkonen is the only driver in the top 10 with the Kers power - boost system after the McLarens qualified 12th ( Lewis Hamilton ) and 15th ( Heikki Kovalainen ) .
That should ensure Raikkonen gains several places on the first lap - he will press the button on the hill down from La Source and should be strongly placed to slingshot past his rivals on the climb to Les Combes after Eau Rouge .
For that reason , while Trulli has to be the favourite on paper , it is Raikkonen who is the Mole 's dark horse for victory in the Belgian Grand Prix .
Why the anti-capitalism focus ?
Hi ,
I 've come to anarchy via Austrian Economics ( reading Mises , Rothbard etc. ) and the US Libertarian movement .
Reading this work and others I started to see the State as an institution that can only exist with the threatened or actual use of force over the ' free ' individual , something that I find immoral and wrong .
Hence , I started calling myself an anarchist , to signify my anti-state position .
However , reading this : http://www.afed.org.uk/organisation/aims-and-principles.html
I was slightly bemused to see that the AF seems to define things primarily in terms of a war against capitalism .
But I 'm struggling to understand why if you 're an anarchist you would necessarily be anti-capitalist , something which has at its core the freedom for consenting individuals to trade with one an other without the interference of the state .
But perhaps the more perplexing thing is that we do n't live under a capitalist regime anyway , so being anti something we do n't have seems a little redundant .
We have some kind of capitalist / corporatist / merchantilist / socialist and increasingly fascist hybrid , something that is a long way from laissez faire free - market capitalism .
Perhaps someone can enlighten me on what exactly is wrong with the idea of being able to trade freely with one and other ?
Thanks ,
mf .

Now identified – the woman who stood aside as her partner and his brother subjected her son , Peter , to an unparalleled and disturbing , sustained abuse and torture – Tracy Connelly is woman who ’s face will be burned into the public conscious for years to come .
And it seems – so will the outrage , anger and hatred of the abuse suffered by ‘ Baby P’ – which has fallen almost exclusively on her shoulders .
Described as everything from a ‘ sex obsessed slob ’ and ‘ evil mother ’ to a ‘ woman defined by abuse ’ – Tracey Connelly has been the chief focus of the story – whilst her partner Steven Barker and his brother ( and their lodger ) Jason Owen have bafflingly played second fiddle in the ongoing media saga .
The lack of equality attributed to all involved in this case is both sexist and misandristic .
From drunken pub brawls to a mounting body count in Iraq – the papers on an almost daily basis feature coverage of acts of male perpetrated violence and abuse – be it against other men , women or children .
Rarely , are levels of harried outrage equal to when a woman commits such acts .
The outrage appropriated by the actions ( or inactions ) of notorious women – Myra Hindley , Rose West , Maxine Carr and now Tracy Connelly – are tantamount to none .
And rightly so .
Awful , indecent acts reflexively prompt awful , indecent hatred .
But why when these acts are committed by a man does our outrage become slightly more , perhaps , wearisome ?
What does this say about society ’s approximation of the male nature ?
That it is more understandable for a man to commit acts that are to most people , direly unimaginable , but for a woman to commit or turn a blind eye to these acts – well , the thought ’s not even worth entertaining .
The morbid fascination of Amanda Knox – the American woman standing accused of sexually assaulting and murdering British student Meredith Kercher , whilst studying in Italy – has been a long - standing media fixture .
Apparently the only thing more shocking than a woman committing atrocious acts of malevolence , is a pretty woman committing such acts .
Almost , at this point , a household name – she is unquestioningly the poster girl of this case whilst her ex-boyfriend Raffaelle Sollecito , is conveniently shirked aside despite the fact he stands accused of the same crime .
Do we subconsciously believe violence is inherent in the male nature ?
If not , why do we not feel equal outrage when confronted with male acts of atrocity ?
This feeling is grossly misandristic – and has a negative impact on both men and women .
There have been more attempts to humanise Connelly than there are her partner and his brother .
Psychological profiles detailing past instances of abuse , of maternal neglect and paternal abandonment .
We know that she suffered presumed alcoholism .
There have been questions raised over whether Connelly is another example of the abused becoming the abuser .
She has been singled out of this case and the sole recipient of public scrutiny and enquiry .
Meanwhile , her partner and brother are all too readily painted as undeviating monsters .
Why is it that we must view Connelly ’s actions in human terms – that we want understanding , that we want answers – whilst we instinctively just accept the actions of Owen and Barker , no questions asked ?
This two - dimensional coverage of male violence not only excuses these acts – it absolves them .
A swimmer swims , a hunter hunts and an abuser abuses .
Should n’t we be getting as angry , if not more angry , about the actions of Owen and Barker as we are about Connelly ?
Do we not want answers if the perpetrators are men ?
Unless we engage in the complexities of both male and female acts of deviance equally , how can there be any understanding of them ?
The fact is , women too have the capacity for evil .
And acts of hideous violence , abuse or neglect perpetrated by a woman should not be shocking because of her gender – but because of her humanity .

Silverlight 3 does n't offer native support for loading and rendering 3D models .
However , Balder offers a very complete managed 3D engine for Silverlight 3 .
It achieved the necessary frame rate taking advantage of Silverlight 's threading capabilities .
I 've been working with Balder in many projects in the last year and I had the possibility to talk to Einar and Petri Wilhelmsen ( two gaming gurus ) about many potential performance improvements .
Balder does n't use the GPU ( Graphics Processing Unit ) to render 3D models .
It uses a software rendering process .
Silverlight 3 has many restrictions and you cannot access DirectX or OpenGL from a Silverlight application .
Therefore , an efficient software rendering process was the only opportunity to bring 3D models to life in a Silverlight viewport .
There are other open source 3D engines offering some software rendering capabilities to Silverlight .
However , one of Balder 's key features is its optimization to take advantage of multiple logical cores ( hardware threads ) in the software rendering process .
This way , it is capable of offering a very interesting frame rate when running on microprocessors with two or more logical cores ( hardware threads ) .
Silverlight 3 does n't offer the new task - based programming included in .NET 4 .
You have to work with the classic .
NET 3.5 Threading model in order to take advantage of multiple cores .
Balder 's software rendering process had a reasonable performance .
However , it was not enough to reach 60 frames per seconds ( FPS ) with dozens of 3D models being rendered in real - time .
The software rendering process was using a single - threaded model , old - fashioned non-scalable sequential code .
Rewriting a complete software rendering algorithm to take full advantage of multiple cores is indeed a very complex task .
However , there was a very easy to detect hotspot .
A very easy to identify block of sequential code that could be broken down into many concurrent blocks of code .
Balder 's team worked to optimize this loop using multiple threads .
They used wait handles to coordinate the start and the end of many concurrent loops .
Of course , this process required a new design .
It was n't just a copy and paste .
It was n't a simple code refactoring .
The new design had to consider concurrency .
Nevertheless , as the focus was in just one block of code , it was easier to achieve faster results than rewriting the complete engine .
The performance improvements were really important .
The rendering process was really faster when more than two logical cores were available .
Balder became a really serious 3D engine with a high performance software rendering process .
It has a great advantage over other 3D engines for Silverlight , because it uses many logical cores to improve its performance .
But wait , what about compatibility ?
There were many incompatibility problems with the new multithreaded version .
A classic multithreading problem .
Some code in the engine was supposed to run on the main UI thread ( the only thread capable of making changes to the UI controls ) .
In the optimization process , some of this code was n't running on the main UI thread anymore .
Therefore , some applications did n't work as expected .
Luckily , the problem was solved in a newer version .
This is a very interesting situation .
When you optimize an engine to take advantage of multiple cores using concurrent code , you have to keep compatibility with previous versions .
There is a lot of code prepared to use the services offered by this engine .
Einar solved the problem in just a few hours .
Performance improvements in engines should n't destroy backward compatibility .
The parallel code used in Balder is n't perfect .
There are many other possibilities to offer more scalability and to improve its performance .
However , it 's a good example of how to translate multicore power into application performance .
I 'm sure Balder 's team is going to improve the engine in future versions and they 'll be able to take even more advantage of multicore microprocessors .
What are you waiting for ?
It 's time to go parallel .
If you find a RIA running too slow , remember that you can take advantage of multiple cores in many programming languages used for developing RIAs .
You can read more details about Balder 's optimizations in Balder Silverlight 3 optimization - round 1 by Einar Ingebrigtsen .
you can compare the performance and the code for this 3D engine downloading the different versions from its Codeplex website .

Ever notice an annoying , persistent lag every ten seconds or so when you 're watching a YouTube ( or other ) video in Firefox ?
Reader Bernard Sandberg has , and he 's written in with a smart about : config that solves the problem for him .
Although Bernard 's talking specifically about YouTube , this tweak should help fix any similar jumpiness in Firefox .
Many users , myself included , visit YouTube on an almost daily basis .
Ever since Firefox version 2.0 implemented the session restore function , when you are watching a video on YouTube ( perhaps on other video sites as well , I have n't really tested that ) , you may notice a tiny freeze - up of the video every 10 seconds or so .
This happens because the session restore is by default set to save all open tabs every 10 seconds .
This is especially noticeable if you happen to have a lot of tabs open at once .
The quick fix for this problem , at least for my own sake , is to increase the time between each of the saves performed by session restore .
By opening about : config in your Firefox address bar , then typing browser.sessionstore .
interval in the filter box , you 'll see a value of 10000 , which is in milliseconds .
( Meaning your session is saved every 10 seconds . )
I changed this to 300000 , or every 5 minutes , as I do n't have the urgent need for tab restoration .
If you feel like being more on the safe side , try increasing it to something a bit lower , say 120000 , or every 2 minutes .
Advertisement
We did a bit of research , and it looks like Bernard 's not alone with his solution .
I 've experienced this problem plenty in Firefox , so it 's great to see a relatively simple solution , even if it does mean sacrificing a bit in the way of up - to - the - minute session saving .
If you give it a try , let 's hear if it does the trick for you in the comments ( assuming you 've experienced this problem in the first place ) .
﻿ Update !
﻿ We have a newer version of this post that has a much better setup here : Create a jQuery calendar with AJAX , PHP , and MySQL
This tutorial demonstrates how to create a jQuery calendar with PHP and Javascript using a remote data source .
This is an extension of my previous article about the jQuery calendar I developed for the Salvation Army of Wake County website .
The final calendar in this tutorial contains a hyperlink for each day of the month .
When a hyperlink is clicked , a list of events for that day is requested from a remote script , cached client - side , and displayed on the page .
Download project ZIP file
Tutorial Requirements
You should be comfortable with HTML , jQuery , and PHP .
However , I explain the code step - by - step to show how all of the pieces fit together .
In this tutorial I use PHP and a SQLite database ; however , you may use any database for which there is a PHP PDO database driver .
Tutorial Overview
There are several pieces that work together in this tutorial .
/frontend.php
This is the epicenter of the tutorial .
You will view this file in a web browser .
This file provides the calendar 's HTML markup , includes the jQuery calendar script , and displays the calendar and its events .
/backend.php
This connects frontend . php and the database .
This PHP script is called remotely from frontend .
php and accepts a GET parameter called " timestamp " .
This script queries the database for all events that occur on the same day as the timestamp parameter .
The events returned from the database are output in an HTML unordered list .
/ scripts/calendar.js
This Javascript file is included into frontend . php and uses jQuery to attach onclick event handlers to each hyperlink in the calendar table .
Each event handler will send an HTTP request to backend .
php along with a unique " timestamp " GET parameter .
The HTTP response from each HTTP request is cached client - side to avoid duplicate HTTP requests .
This script also inserts the HTML returned from backend .
php into the document object model of frontend .
php .
/includes/calendar.php
This PHP script contains a function written by David Walsh that creates the calendar 's initial HTML markup .
I made several edits to David 's original function for this tutorial .
You can read more about my edits in this file 's header .
This file is included into and called from frontend .
php .
/db/calendar.db
This is the SQLite database file that contains a tuple for each calendar event .
This file is referenced from backend .
php with a PDO database driver .
Step 1 : Setup the database
First , create and prepare the database using the schema shown below .
You need to create the database and load it with the sample data before moving on with this tutorial .
If you use SQLite , create a database file called calendar.db in the " db " directory within the project directory .
If you use the ZIP download for this project , the SQLite database has already been created for you .
CREATE TABLE events ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY , title TEXT , slug TEXT , time INTEGER ) ; INSERT INTO events ( title , slug , time ) VALUES ( ' Soccer Game ' , 'soccer- game ' ,1250256000 ) ; INSERT INTO events ( title , slug , time ) VALUES ( ' Basketball Game ' , 'basketball -game ',1250361000 ) ; INSERT INTO events ( title , slug , time ) VALUES ( ' Hockey Game ' , 'hockey - game ' , 1250367840 ) ; INSERT INTO events ( title , slug , time ) VALUES ( ' Lacrosse Game ' , ' lacrosse - game ' , 1250438700 ) ; INSERT INTO events ( title , slug , time ) VALUES ( ' Ping Pong Game ' , 'ping - pong - game ' ,1250463600 ) ;
`id` is an auto - incrementing integer primary key
`slug` is a URL - friendly text representation of the event title
`time` is an integer UNIX timestamp
Next , I establish a PHP PDO database connection in the backend .
php file .
Open backend .
php in a plain - text editor and edit line 10 to establish a connection to the database .
If you use the ZIP download for this project , the database connection has already been created for you .
Visit the PHP PDO website to learn more about creating PDO database connections .
$ db = new PDO ( ' sqlite:db/calendar.db ' ) ;
Step 2 : Create the calendar markup
Next , I create the calendar 's HTML markup with PHP .
I see no point in re-inventing the wheel , so I use a great PHP calendar generation script by David Walsh .
I make several changes to David 's original function .
You can read about my changes in the header of / includes / calendar.php .
The calendar is displayed in frontend .
php .
First , I include the calendar function into frontend .
php on line 1 .
<?php include ( ' includes/calendar.php ' ) ; ?>
Next , I call the draw_calendar ( ) method in frontend .
php on line 16 .
This outputs the entire calendar HTML markup .
<h1 > August 2009 </ h1 > <?php echo draw_calendar ( 8,2009 ) ; ?> < div id=" calendar - events " ></div >
Step 3 : Setup the backend PHP script
The backend . php script connects frontend .php to the database .
The backend . php script receives an XMLHttpRequest from frontend .
php that looks like this :
backend.php?timestamp=1249966800
Next , the backend .
php script asks the database for all events that occur on the same day as the timestamp .
Let 's walk through the code step by step .
$ db = new PDO ( ' sqlite:db/calendar.db ' ) ;
First , I establish a PDO connection to the SQLite database .
If you do not use the database provided in the ZIP download for this project , edit line 10 to establish a PDO connection to your own database .
// Set date from GET timestamp parameter if ( !isset ( $_GET [' timestamp ' ] ) ) die (' You must provide a timestamp ' ) ; else $ date = getdate ( $ _GET [' timestamp ' ] ) ;
Next , I verify that a timestamp is specified .
If a timestamp is not specified , I return an error message to frontend .
php .
Else , I extract an array of date and time information based on the provided timestamp .
// Define start and end timestamps for the requested day $ time_start = mktime ( 0,0,0 , $ date [ ' mon ' ] , $ date [ ' mday ' ] , $ date [ ' year ' ] ) ; $ time_end = mktime ( 23,59,59 , $date [ ' mon ' ] , $ date [ ' mday ' ] , $ date [ ' year ' ] ) ;
Using the timestamp provided in the previous step , I extrapolate two additional timestamps : one for the beginning of the same day and one for the end of the same day .
// Fetch events from database as associative array $ stmt = $ db -> prepare ( ' SELECT id , title , slug , time FROM events WHERE time BETWEEN ?
AND ? ORDER BY time ASC ' ) ; $ stmt->bindParam( 1 , $time_start , PDO :: PARAM_INT ) ; $ stmt->bindParam ( 2 , $time_end , PDO :: PARAM_INT ) ; $ stmt ->execute ( ) ; $events = $ stmt->fetchAll ( PDO ::FETCH_ASSOC ) ;
Next , I create a PDO statement and execute a SQL query against the database .
This SQL query returns all events that start on the same day as the specified timestamp .
Notice how I use the two extrapolated timestamps as boundaries for the BETWEEN clause .
The returned events are collected into an associative array referenced by the $events variable .
// Send output if ( ! count ( $events ) ) exit ( '< p>
No events were found </ p >' ) ; $ output = ' < ul > ' ; foreach ( $ events as $ event ) $ output .= ' < li > '.strftime ( " %l : %M %p " , $event [ ' time ' ] ) . ' - '. $ event [ ' title ' ] .'</ li >' ; $ output .= '< /ul >' ; exit ( $output ) ;
Finally , I output an HTML unordered list containing all of the events returned by the SQL query .
Step 4 : Add XMLHttpRequest behavior with jQuery
In this last step of the tutorial , I add behavior to frontend .
php with jQuery .
The Javascript attaches onclick event handlers to each hyperlink in the calendar table .
When a hyperlink is clicked , an XMLHttpRequest is sent to backend .
php with a unique timestamp parameter .
When a response is received from backend .
php , the HTML returned by backend .
php is inserted into the document object model ( DOM ) to reveal the events for the clicked day .
You must provide the absolute or relative path to the backend .
php on line 4 of / scripts / calendar.js .
This path will be different than the path shown below .
j Query ( document ) .ready ( function ( $ ) {
//CHANGE ME !!!
Define the relative or absolute path to your backend script var remoteUrl = '/~joshlockhart/calendar/backend.php ' ; // Initialize the HTTP cache var remoteCache = new Array ( ) ; // For each link in the calendar ... $ ( 'table.calendar a' ) .each ( function ( i, item ) { // Unique ID for the link var link Id = item.id ; // Unique URL for the link var link Url = remoteUrl+'?timestamp='+linkId ; //Attach onclick event handler $ ( this ).click ( function ( ) { var calendarEvents = $ ( ' #calendar-events ' ) ; calendarEvents.slideUp( ' fast ' , function ( ) { if ( remoteCache[ linkId ] != undefined ) { calendarEvents.html(remoteCache[linkId ] ) ; calendarEvents.slideDown ( ' fast ' ) ; } else { calendarEvents.load( linkUrl, function ( ) { remoteCache[linkId ] = calendarEvents.html( ) ; calendarEvents.slideDown( ' fast ' ) ; } ) ; } } ) ; return false ; } ) ; } ) ; } ) ;
The jQuery script caches all responses received from backend .
php .
If a calendar link is clicked more than once , the list of events for the given day is retrieved from cache if available instead of sending a duplicate HTTP request .
This saves bandwidth and significantly increases the responsiveness of the jQuery calendar .
This script is saved in the external Javascript file / scripts / calendar.js .
I include this external Javascript on line 12 of frontend .
php .
Step 5 : View the finished jQuery calendar
View frontend .php in a web browser and click on the 14th , 15th , or 16th .
You should see a list of events appear for each day .
Feel free to add more events to your database and watch them appear on the calendar .

It seems that the thorny issue of where registered sex offenders should be allowed to live just wo n’t go away .
In 2007 , I wrote an article entitled " Sex Offenders : Where Can They Live ? , " and in 2008 I wrote an article entitled " Where Can You Live in Florida if You Are a Registered Sex Offender ? "
Palm Beach
Post staff writer John Lantigua has now written an article entitled " Registered sex offenders :
Where can they live ? "
In his article , Mr. Lantigua reports that just last week the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida sued Miami - Dade County over an ordinance that prohibits individuals convicted of sex crimes involving minors from living within 2,500 feet of such places as schools , playgrounds , and school bus stops .
According to the article , however , the ACLU is not suing out of a concern for the safety of those sex offenders living under a bridge but rather out of a concern for the safety of the general public .
In that regard , the executive director of the ACLU of Florida is quoted as saying that " [ p ] eople have to realize that making them live under that bridge has created a more dangerous situation .
Because of the conditions , some of these individuals are absconding , evading supervision .
These ordinances interfere with the Department of Corrections ’ ability to keep track of them .
This is a crisis situation . "
Apparently , the Florida Department of Corrections –the agency in charge of supervising sex offenders–agrees .
A spokesperson for that agency is quoted as saying that " [ o ] ur concern is for public safety .
If they are homeless there is more of a chance they will abscond .
There are already 91 homeless offenders around the state , mostly in South Florida , and the problem is getting bigger . "
When two unlikely bedfellows such as the ACLU and the Florida Department of Corrections agree on something as serious as where registered sex offenders should be allowed to live , perhaps it ’s time to change the law .
TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) --
A reporter for Newsweek magazine who was arrested in Tehran has confessed to doing the bidding of Western governments , the semi-official Fars News Agency reported Wednesday .
Newsweek says Maziar Bahari has been reporting for years without bias and beyond reproach .
Maziar Bahari , 42 , made his alleged confession at a news conference Tuesday .
Because international journalists have been limited in their ability to gather news in Iran , CNN has not been able to confirm the agency report .
Fars reported that the Canadian - Iranian reporter who had worked for the BBC and England 's Channel 4 network admitted having filed false reports for Newsweek during the elections -- a charge the magazine rejected .
" He has been reporting for years without any possible hint of bias and beyond reproach , " Newsweek Paris Bureau Chief Chris Dickey told CNN .
" We think he 's one of the best reporters in the business . "
He called the report " preposterous . "
Dickey said Bahari had not been allowed to speak with a lawyer or with his family since his arrest on June 21 .
" The Western media are part of the capitalist machinery and liberal democratic governments of the West , " Bahari reportedly said .
" When a Western reporter comes to Iran , like a politician or specialist , he will be made to fit into the Western complex .
For that person , the interests of the Westerners , who take advantage of every occasion to stand against Iran , are of utmost importance . "
The Fars News Agency account adds that most Western news outlets oppose Iran , but that the Ministry of Information scrutinizes reporters ' work , minimizing any harm they might do .
Bahari reportedly said Iranian reporters can be tempted by offers of money from Western news organizations to report for them .
" Unfortunately , sometimes we fall prey to mistakes , wrong feelings and we become greedy , thus falling into the traps of the foreigners , " he said , according to the news agency transcript .
In their alleged attempt to foment revolution in Iran , journalists ' efforts began two months before the election , according to the account attributed to Bahari :
" The first step was to propagate the thought of questioning religious authority and maintain that the Islamic Republic of Iran has no popular support and then they said that , under the shadow of such a system , the voting process would be rigged and much hard work went into making this thought a reality in peoples ' minds . "
Hassiba Hadj - Sahraoui of Amnesty International rejected Bahari's alleged confession , calling it part of the Islamic Republic 's effort to intimidate the opposition and blame Western powers for the post-election chaos .
" We know from people we 've talked to that people have been forced to make confessions on TV where they are supposed to have acted on instigation of foreign powers , " she said .
Indeed , Iran 's state - run Press TV has broadcast interviews with people who said they were guilt - ridden protesters who wanted to unburden themselves by confessing that the Western media had made them act as they did .
Bahari is not the only reporter said to have confessed , according to Reporters Without Borders , which last week condemned " a parade of Iranian demonstrators being shown on state - run TV confessing to having protested at the behest of foreign media . "
The reporters all used the same words : " I admit that I demonstrated under the influence of the BBC , the radio Voice of America and other foreign media , " according to the advocacy group .

In a posting on his Web site , former President Mahmoud Khatami accused the government of having restricted communications in the country .
" The state - owned media outlet shows the same scenes over and over again , in order to provoke people 's feelings , " he said .
" Where was this media outlet when tens of people were killed and hundreds of people beaten ? "
He added , " The majority of those arrested are the political activists , journalists and attorneys , who now , unbelievably are pressured , as foreign agents , to falsely confess in television spectacles . "
Reporters Without Borders said that 28 journalists -- including about 20 who work for a newspaper owned by opposition presidential candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi -- have been arrested since the election .
" Arresting an entire editorial staff is totally unprecedented , " Reporters Without Borders said .
Questioned about the arrest of foreign journalists during demonstrations , the intelligence minister , Mohseni Ejehi , said that " one or two people who came to gather secret information were arrested , but not as journalists .
One of them had his equipment confiscated and he is now the subject of an investigation . "
Reporters are not the only people at risk .
Amnesty International said as many as 1,000 people have disappeared since the June 12 election .
With his purported confession , Bahari is no longer among them .
" We 're very happy that they 've acknowledged responsibility for holding him , " Newsweek 's Dickey said .
" And we hope very much that they will understand that it is in everybody 's interest to release him as soon as possible . "

Found while reading Charles Stross ’ web diary is this wonderful link from 02000 Forbes Magazine on where computers would be in ten years … now just a few months away .
Some gems :
Within 10 years , in fact , silicon will fall to the computer scientist ’s triple curse : “ It ’s bulky , it ’s slow , and it runs too hot . ”
At this point , computers will need a new architecture , one that depends less on electrons and more on … well … what else ?
Optics .
Optical computers still seem about ten years away even now .
The PC will be protected from theft , thanks to an advanced biometric scanner that can recognize your fingerprint .
They got that one bang on .
You ’ll communicate with the PC primarily with your voice , putting it truly at your beck and call .
Not so much .
While there are decent voice control systems for limited applications , I would not call voice based computing a mature technology .
In 2010 , a “ desktop ” will be a desk top … in other words , by plugging our computer into an office desk , its top becomes a gigantic computer screen–an interactive photonic display .
It is certainly true that this type of computer has come out , not quite a standard yet though .
What do we do with our 2010 computer when we arrive home after a long day ’s work ?
Plug it into the wall with a magnetic clamp and watch as our home comes to life .
In essence , the computer becomes the operating system for our house , and our house , in turn , knows our habits and responds to our needs
Hmmmm .
There are more computer controlled home appliances now , but my bet is this will happen more with smart phones than PCs ( like Apples Remote app for the iPhone ) .
The disk will be holographic and will somewhat resemble a CD - ROM or DVD .
That is , it will be a spinning , transparent plastic platter with a writing laser on one side and reading laser on the other , and it will hold an astounding terabyte ( 1 trillion bytes ) of data
Bingo ! sorta… .
Yes you can buy a 1 terabyte hard disk at Best Buy , but it sure is n’t holographic storage .
Our 2010 CPU will operate on the same principle as today ’s PCs .
But instead of electronic microprocessors providing the brains and brawn , our future CPU will have optoelectronic integrated circuits ( chips that use silicon to switch but optics to communicate ) .
With communication between components no longer bottlenecked by electronic transmission , we can probably push the clock rate to 100 gigahertz , 100 times faster than what ’s available now .
Well I am writing this on a two core 3
Ghz computer , and there are 8 core versions commercially available , but we certainly have not reached 100 Ghz .
Our main RAM will be purely optical , in fact , holographic .
Holographic memory is three - dimensional by nature , so we can stack up any number of memory planes into a rectangular solid to create 256 gigabytes of optical main memory , 1,000 times as much as a really powerful desktop computer today .
Again no optical RAM , and machines seem to be selling with around 2 - 4 Gb of the old standard silicon in them .
Nice work Forbes for putting some actual testable predictions out there !
O’Grady says that he was told that he was suspected of being an illegal from Cuba due to his accent .
The problem is that he was ultimately released into the country to undermine our indigenous comedians with his foreign humor and one - liners .
If Homeland Security had simply looked down the list they would have seen that two slots below “ illegal alien ” is another barred category for “ English comedian . ”
Fortunately , I am at the beach with my family in a remote spot .

Expert answer
A person who gets a specific influenza and recovers generally has immunity to that specific virus for some period , usually a decade or two .
After time the immune system may have a lapse in memory and the person can get re-infected .
A very few individuals with compromised immune systems may be susceptible to it earlier .
Some viruses have been known to mutate or change just enough that people who had the virus just a short time earlier technically can be re-infected with the mutated or changed virus .
We are still learning about the H1N1 and do not know if it will change so quickly .
This is a long - winded way of saying everyone should be vigilant .
Even if you have had the H1N1 , you should practice flu prevention .
There are other germs out there that can be easily spread to include the seasonal flu .
Wash hands frequently , and cough or sneeze into the upper arm .
If sick with a fever or flu - like symptoms , stay home .
Do not go to work or school if sick .
Most flu viruses are spread when people start congregating indoors .
I do n't know what kind of school this kid goes to , but I doubt my shop teacher would have allowed me to build an electromagnetic coil gun that can send a round through a soda can .

Aside from the electromagnetics ( in a linear electric motor config ) and bolt - action which supports a six - round magazine clip , this gun makes use of a multimeter , a few custom switches to turn the weapon on and off , some PVC piping , a scope , and presumably , a battery pack .
My favorite part are the fold - down wood legs for those moments when hitting a can with extreme accuracy is imperative .

The actual power of this sniper rifle - inspired gun is n't overwhelming , as it seems on par with ( or maybe a bit more powerful than , a bb gun ) .
But the use of electronics and the clever use of wood through out the design give it a DIY allure that I just can't resist .

New Construction
As a State Certified General Contractor , Suncoast has had many successful Commercial and Residential New Construction projects in the Tampa Bay area , including recent projects in Tampa , St. Petersburg and Clearwater , Largo , Pinellas Park , Tierra Verde , Gulf Beaches , St. Pete Beach and Madeira Beach with some incorporating our Design / Build services , and we cover all of Hillsborough , Pinellas , Pasco , Manatee and Sarasota Counties .
New Construction is generally the easiest to build , as long as the proper work has been performed upfront .
It is important to have a good design group , consisting of architects , engineers and possibly a landscape architect and other consulting services , as it is usually in the permitting process that a new construction project will be delayed .
It is also important to understand the subsurface conditions of the site prior to starting the design process .
Here are a few of our most recent New Construction Projects : Trademark Metals Recycling - Sutton Yard
This project was to build the support structure for a 1,240 ton capacity scrap- metal shear , a machine that cuts steel coming out of a 3 ’ x 3 ’ x 30 ’ hopper like scissors cutting through paper .
Due to the terrific impact forces , the shear rests on a 4 ’ thick foundation on 60 concrete piles driven 40 ’ into the earth .
The support building houses a hydraulic unit with six pumps and an electrical array that covers a 16 ’ x 8 ' wall .
Trademark Metals Recycling - Acre Iron Yard
As a seasoned commercial builder , the construction of this relatively small employee building was not particularly difficult but there were challenges in tying this and the another existing building into the sanitary system , eliminating the existing septic system .
The challenge was that the sanitary system was several blocks away and we needed to keep the yard in full operation throughout construction .
Suncoast provided all of the design services as well as the construction .
RJ Longboat & Sons Construction new offices and equipment yard Suncoast handled this Design / Build project from the initial stages , starting with the design phase and working with the planning staff , correcting rezoning issues through City of St Petersburg , achieving an approval over some of the staff 's unfair recommendations at the City Council hearing , through construction and final approvals .
New Treasure Island Home Suncoast has built custom homes across the Tampa Bay area .
New home construction requires strong communication with the Client and Suncoast is a construction company who has always understood the importance of this communication .
We work with our Clients from the design phase to ensure that the materials used and the styles implemented reflect the personalities and needs of our Clients .

In every corner , greed continues to amaze .
Please consider Bankrupt suppliers seek exec bonuses .
A growing number of bankrupt auto suppliers are seeking court approval to pay tens of millions of dollars in bonuses to key executives , as they shed employees and cut costs .
Some of the bonuses have come under sharp criticism from General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. , as well as the trustees named by the Justice Department to monitor bankruptcy cases .
" Considering the condition of the automotive industry and the adverse effect on auto suppliers , it is unclear why payments are even needed to retain employees who may have limited options to find employment elsewhere , " said Diana G. Adams , the U.S. trustee in objecting to a plan by Lear Corp .
Southfield - based Lear , which is in the process of cutting costs by $ 350 million , won approval Tuesday to pay $ 20.6 million in bonuses to 29 execs .
Congress rewrote the bankruptcy code in 2005 in an attempt to prevent executives from rewarding themselves during bankruptcy , while rank - and - file workers make significant sacrifices .
Yet Visteon , which sought bankruptcy protection on May 28 , wants to give bonuses of up to $ 80.1 million to top execs -- as much as 250 percent of base pay , for some of them .
Ford , in court documents , said it " cannot see how , in a market with mass layoffs , salary reductions and bonus program curtailments occurring daily , anyone can justify a bonus program of $ 80.1 million when job retention should be enough . "
And Northville - based wheel producer Hayes Lemmerz International Inc. wants permission to pay more than $ 10 million in bonuses , including as much as $ 6.7 million to its top five execs .
Just Friday , however , Hayes proposed canceling its retiree health and life insurance coverage for households covering 2,200 families .
Hayes has proposed creating a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association , which would allow retirees who are ineligible for Medicare to keep coverage at a cost of $ 900 to $ 2,100 a month .
Hayes would contribute as much as $ 4.8 million over four years to cancel its accrued liability of $ 147.5 million .

Zurich , Switzerland , August 28 , 2009 — IBM ( NYSE : IBM ) scientists have been able to image the “ anatomy ” — or chemical structure — inside a molecule with unprecedented resolution , using a complex technique known as noncontact atomic force microscopy .
The results push the exploration of using molecules and atoms at the smallest scale and could greatly impact the field of nanotechnology , which seeks to understand and control some of the smallest objects know to mankind .
“ Though not an exact comparison , if you think about how a doctor uses an X - ray to image bones and organs inside the human body , we are using the atomic force microscope to image the atomic structures that are the backbones of individual molecules , ” said IBM Researcher Gerhard Meyer .
“ Scanning probe techniques offer amazing potential for prototyping complex functional structures and for tailoring and studying their electronic and chemical properties on the atomic scale . ”
The team ’s current publication follows on the heels of another experiment published just two months ago in the June 12 issue of Science ( Volume 324 , Issue 5933 , pp. 1428 – 1431 ) where IBM scientists measured the charge states of atoms using an AFM .
These breakthroughs will open new possibilities for investigating how charge transmits through molecules or molecular networks .
Understanding the charge distribution at the atomic scale is essential for building smaller , faster and more energy - efficient computing components than today ’s processors and memory devices .
These components could one day contribute to IBM 's vision of a smarter planet by helping instrument and interconnect the physical world .
As reported in the August 28 issue of Science magazine , IBM Research – Zurich scientists Leo Gross , Fabian Mohn , Nikolaj Moll and Gerhard Meyer , in collaboration with Peter Liljeroth of Utrecht University , used an AFM operated in an ultrahigh vacuum and at very low temperatures ( –268 °C or – 451 °F ) to image the chemical structure of individual pentacene molecules .
With their AFM , the IBM scientists , for the first time ever , were able to look through the electron cloud and see the atomic backbone of an individual molecule .
While not a direct technological comparison , this is reminiscent of X - rays that pass through soft tissue to enable clear images of bones .
The tip that tipped the scale
The AFM uses a sharp metal tip to measure the tiny forces between the tip and the sample , such as a molecule , to create an image .
In the present experiments , the molecule investigated was pentacene .
Pentacene is an oblong organic molecule consisting of 22 carbon atoms and 14 hydrogen atoms measuring 1.4 nanometers in length .
The spacing between neighboring carbon atoms is only 0.14 nanometers — roughly 1 million times smaller than the diameter of a grain of sand .
In the experimental image , the hexagonal shapes of the five carbon rings as well as the carbon atoms in the molecule are clearly resolved .
Even the positions of the hydrogen atoms of the molecule can be deduced from the image .
“ The key to achieving atomic resolution was an atomically sharp and defined tip apex as well as the very high stability of the system , ” recalls IBM scientist Leo Gross .
To image the chemical structure of a molecule with an AFM , it is necessary to operate in very close proximity to the molecule .
The range , where chemical interactions give significant contributions to the forces , is less than a nanometer .
To achieve this , the IBM scientists were required to increase the sensitivity of the tip and overcome a major limitation : Similar to the way two magnets would attract or repel each other when getting close , the molecules would easily be displaced by or attach to the tip when the tip was approached too closely — rendering further measurements impossible .
Leo Gross adds ,
“ We prepared our tip by deliberately picking up single atoms and molecules and showed that it is the foremost tip atom or molecule that governs the contrast and resolution of our AFM measurements . ”
A tip terminated with a carbon monoxide ( CO ) molecule yielded the optimum contrast at a tip height of approximately 0.5 nanometers above the molecule being imaged and — acting like a powerful magnifying glass — resolved the individual atoms within the pentacene molecule , revealing its exact atomic - scale chemical structure .
Furthermore , the scientists were able to derive a complete three - dimensional force map of the molecule investigated .
“ To obtain a complete force map the microscope needed to be highly stable , both mechanically and thermally , to ensure that both the tip of the AFM and the molecule remained unaltered during the more than 20 hours of data acquisition , ” says Fabian Mohn , who is working on his PhD thesis at IBM Research – Zurich .
To corroborate the experimental findings and gain further insight into the exact nature of the imaging mechanism , IBM scientist Nikolaj Moll performed first - principles density functional theory calculations of the system investigated .
He explains , “ The calculations helped us understand what caused the atomic contrast .
In fact , we found that its source was Pauli repulsion between the CO and the pentacene molecule . ”
This repulsive force stems from a quantum mechanical effect called the Pauli exclusion principle .
It states that two identical electrons can not approach each other too closely .
IBM and nanotechnology
Scientists have been striving to “ see ” and manipulate atoms and molecules to extend human knowledge and push the frontiers of manufacturing capabilities to the nanometer regime .
IBM has been a pioneer in nanoscience and nanotechnology ever since the development of the scanning tunneling microscope in 1981 by IBM Fellows Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer at IBM Research – Zurich .
For this invention , which made it possible to image individual atoms and later on to manipulate them , Binnig and Rohrer were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986 .
The AFM , an offspring of the STM , was invented by Binnig in 1986 .
The STM is widely regarded as the instrument that opened the door to the nanoworld .
A new facility for world - class collaborative nanoscale research , the Nanoscale Exploratory Technology Laboratory , will open in 2011 on the campus of IBM Research – Zurich .
The nanotech center is part of a strategic partnership in nanotechnology with ETH Zurich , one of Europe ’s premier technical universities .
The scientific paper entitled “ The Chemical Structure of a Molecule Resolved by Atomic Force Microscopy ” by L. Gross , F. Mohn , N. Moll , P. Liljeroth , and G. Meyer , appears in Science , Volume 325 , Issue 5944 , pp. 1110 – 1114 ( 28 August 2009 ) .
Bottled water manufacturers are not required to disclose as much information as municipal water utilities because of gaps in federal oversight authority , according to reports released yesterday by government auditors .
Bottom line : The Food and Drug Administration oversees bottled water , and U.S. EPA is in charge of tap water .
FDA lacks the regulatory authority of EPA , John Stephenson of the Government Accountability Office told a House panel .
The Safe Drinking Water
Act empowers EPA to require water testing by certified laboratories and that violations be reported within a specified time frame .
Public water systems must also provide reports to customers about their water , noting its source , evidence of contaminants and compliance with regulations .
By comparison , GAO said , FDA regulates bottled water as a food and cannot require certified lab testing or violation reporting .
Furthermore , FDA does not require bottled water companies to disclose to consumers where the water came from , how it has been treated or what contaminants it contains .
In a survey of 188 brands of bottled water released yesterday , the nonprofit Environmental Working Group found only two providing such information about its product to consumers .
FDA should look for ways of providing consumers with this kind of information , Stephenson told the House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee .
" Our work suggests that consumers may benefit from such additional information . "
Bottling companies could be required to provide a phone number on their labels so consumers can follow through if they want more information , said Joseph Doss , president and CEO of the International Bottled Water Association .
Doss emphasized , however , that bottled water is more strictly regulated than other food products to ensure safety across the board .
House Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) and Investigations Subcommittee Chairman Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) yesterday sent letters to 13 bottlers asking for information regarding testing , water sources and treatment processes .
" [ N ] either the public nor federal regulators know nearly enough about where bottled water comes and what safeguards are in place to ensure its safety , " Stupak said .
EPA and FDA have similar standards of water quality regulations , said Joshua Sharfstein , principal deputy commissioner of food and drugs for FDA .
The law governing FDA -- the Federal Food , Drug and Cosmetic Act -- requires that the agency establish a quality standard once EPA has determined a safe level for individual contaminants in drinking water .
That means FDA has generally adopted EPA 's standards for contaminants in drinking water for its bottled water regulations .
Some contaminants have resulted in different standards , however .
For example , EPA requires public water systems to treat their water to reduce lead levels that exceed 15 parts per billion .
Because bottled water does not have to deal with leaching from plumbing systems , however , FDA set its standard at 5 ppb , Sharfstein said .
A notable exception has been regarding a type of a chemical used to soften plastic -- DEHP , a member of the phthalate family -- Sharfstein acknowledged .
More than a decade ago , EPA issued a standard for DEHP in public drinking water .
FDA deferred proposing an allowable level for bottled water because the chemical is allowed in some food packaging .
This raised the concern that legal uses could exceed the standard , Sharfstein said .
But FDA has now determined that bottled water manufacturers do not use DEHP in their bottles , Sharfstein said , so the agency is moving forward with the decision to set a standard .
Sharfstein declined to discuss a timeline , saying that it is now a matter of the time it takes to prepare a standard .

When my coauthor and I began working on Programming Scala last year , the most frequent comment I got was , “ you ’re never going to want to write another book once you ’re done . ”
Well , as of this morning , I ’m pretty much done , and I can say that I ’d very much like to write another book .
I do n’t think , though , that I would commit to another one while working a full - time job , and I certainly would n’t recommend trying to write a book while working at a rapidly growing startup .
When I announced that I was going to be working on the book , a critic insinuated that it would detract from my work at Twitter .
In practice , the opposite was true .
I had many an evening or weekend afternoon of writing interrupted by fires at work that needed fighting .
For that reason , I would n’t consider taking on another book project until I can give it my full attention .
The value of sabbaticals as practiced in the academic world was made crystal clear to me throughout the writing process .
There ’s a reason why Dean ’s name comes first on the book ’s cover : he is unambiguously the principal contributor to Programming Scala .
We worked from his outline , and though much was changed and reorganized collaboratively , the backbone of the book is absolutely Dean’s .
I could n’t have asked for a better coauthor .
If anything , I wish that I could have contributed more equally to the text .
What I did contribute , though , I ’m proud of .
We handed off our content to the production team at O’Reilly earlier today , and I can hardly wait until October to have the final product in my hands ( and on my Kindle ) .
I took on the book in part to develop a mastery of Scala , and I ’ve looked forward to learning something new every time I sit down to write , week after week .
Though I understand more of the language than I did when I started , I still do n’t feel that I ’m on the level of folks like David Pollak , Jorge Ortiz , Daniel Spiewak , and the rest of the Scala gurus who dove into the language well before Dean or I .
Still , it ’s been an incredible learning experience , and I ’m extremely grateful to everyone who made it possible , not least of all our editor , Mike Loukides .
This coming weekend will be my first in many months that is completely open , free of examples that need to be written , sections that need to be reorganized , reader feedback to incorporate , and unfamiliar concepts that need to be researched before I can write about them with confidence .
With the free time I now have again , I can get back to writing open source code , mixing music , exploring the Bay Area , posting to this blog , and all the other things I ’ve set aside while working on the book .
It ’s liberating to be done , but bittersweet .
Since I Left You
I have managed to do a bit of this and that while wrapping up the book .
We ’ve set up a blog for the Twitter platform , and I ’ve contributed a few posts to that .
I ’ve managed several talks , and committed to a couple more later this year .
Most cathartically , I ’ve laid open my virtual notebook of ideas for all the web to see .
I ’m going to be at Twitter for a couple more years at least , if all goes well , and it seems a shame to let ideas sit in a text file and rot in the interim .
Some of the ideas I fully intend on seeing through myself , in time .
Others I hope will be picked up , improved upon , or made irrelevant by people smarter and more talented than myself .
Either way , it ’s been an experiment in radical openness ( a topic I ’m preoccupied with ) , and one that ’s paid off from day one .
It should be less quiet around here , again , now .

The US original ( top ) and the altered Polish version ( bottom )
Enlarge Image
Software giant Microsoft has apologised for editing a photo to change a black man 's head to that of a white man .
The picture , showing employees sitting around a desk , appeared unaltered on the firm 's US website .
But on the website of its Polish business unit the black man 's head was replaced with a white face , although the colour of his hands was unchanged .
Microsoft said it had pulled the image and would be investigating who made the changes .
It apologised for the gaffe .
The altered image , which also featured an Asian man and a white woman , was quickly circulated online .
Bloggers have had a field day with the story , with some suggesting Microsoft was attempting to please all markets by having a man with both a white face and a black hand .
" The white head and black hand actually symbolise interracial harmony .
It is supposed to show that a person can be white and black , old and young at the same time , " said one blogger on the Photoshop Disasters blog .
Others have suggested the ethnic make - up of the Polish population , which is predominantly white , may have played a part in the decision to change the photo .

If it were n’t so tragic , it would actually be entertaining to watch Israel work every possible legal and political angle to get its way in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
The IDF , intelligence agencies , and military lawyers would put those of Kafka ’s The Trial to shame .
And they ’ve worked their magic once again in the case of Tristan Anderson , American peace activist who was shot in the head at an anti-Separation Wall demonstration several months ago , suffering serious brain injury for which he is still hospitalized .
It simply would not do for Israel to accept any responsibility for assaulting and nearly killing an unarmed , non-violent protestor who posed no threat to Israeli personnel .
As a matter of principle , Israel believes it must refuse comfort to its enemies , even if Israel itself has inflicted the suffering .
Thus we learn that the government has informed Anderson ’s Israeli lawyers that he was shot under an “ act of war . ”
This seems to be the equivalent in insurance lingo of an “ act of God . ”
In other words , in the midst of war all sins are excused and no one is responsible no matter how heinous the act .
Just witness the IDF ’s approach to the Gaza war .
Plenty of incidents verging on war crimes but somehow the army comes out smelling like a rose : it was an act of war , do n’t you know .
The idea that an Israeli army facing a melange of Palestinian and international demonstrators armed with nothing more than the shirts on their backs and the sounds of their own voice constitutes an act of war is an insult to the world ’s intelligence .
Yes , some demonstrators at Bilin do throw rocks at heavily armed IDF soldiers who have rarely endured so much as a scratch .
But Tristan Anderson was not one of these and there was absolutely no violence in the area when he was attacked .
Further , after B’Tselem admonished the IDF and insisted it direct its forces NOT to fire high velocity tear gas canisters at demonstrators ’ bodies ( heads , actually ) as is its custom , no action has been taken .
This would be the equivalent in a civil action where a defendant not only causes injury to the plaintiff but refuses to correct the dangerous condition that caused the injury .
Any lawyer fresh out of law school could tell you that ’s a recipe for a major financial penalty .
Israel has already agreed to pay the filmmaker James Miller ’s family a $ 2.2 - million settlement after the British attorney general threatened legal action against the government if it did n’t take heed .
I expect the same thing will happen in this case , especially if the U.S. government acts as boldly as the Brits did ( and they should ) .
And I say more power to the Anderson family .
If Israel ca n’t be made to see reason through moral suasion then stick it to them in the pocketbook .
Enough of these settlements and maybe a few Israelis will begin to wonder why maintaining the Occupation is so costly .
Whatever it takes .

A new survey by ScriptLogic , a company that helps other companies manage their Windows systems and security , claims the majority of corporations have no plans to quickly move to Windows 7 .
Relax , it 's not as bad as it may seem at first glance .
The survey , which received feedback from 1,000 IT administrators ( 20,000 surveys were distributed ) , found that 41 percent of organizations plan a wholesale migration to Windows 7 by the end of 2010 ( after just over 14 months ) .
5.4 percent of respondents said they expected to move to Windows 7 by the end of 2009 ( after just over two months ) .
To give you some perspective , Windows 7 is expected to RTM by the end of the month and to hit General Availability ( GA ) on October 22 , 2009 .
ScriptLogic pointed out that this is actually a strong adoption rate when compared to the 12 to 14 percent adoption rate of Windows XP in its first year .
One of the questions asked during the survey was " What is your biggest barrier to deploying Windows 7 ? " and there were five options to choose from .
Here are how the respondents answered :
Time and Resources : 42.7 percent
Application Compatibility : 39.1 percent
OS Deployment / Migration : 8.4 percent
Hardware Support : 7.5 percent
Migration of User Settings : 2.2 percent
Windows Vista sold over 180 million copies as of July 2008 , and Windows 7 will likely do much better .
It 's hard to tell , however , if the fraction of these sales that are to businesses will be bigger or smaller with the upcoming release .
Businesses are battling the recession : the cost to move to a newer operating system is a much bigger deal to them than to the average consumer picking up a new laptop .
Still , the numbers are looking quite good for Microsoft .

A confidential Red Cross report has come into public view , along with formerly classified government documents , leaving no doubt that the agency subjected scores of terror suspects to prolonged physical and psychological cruelty .
Officers shackled prisoners for weeks in contorted positions ; chained them to the ceiling wearing only diapers ; exploited their phobias ; propelled them head first into walls .
At least three prisoners died .
Torture is a felony , and is sometimes treated as a capital crime .
The Convention Against Torture , which America ratified in 1994 , requires a government to prosecute all acts of torture ; failure to do so is considered a breach of international law ...
The C.I.A. ’s role in providing misleading intelligence about the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq has also provoked calls for reform .
Senator Dianne Feinstein , the new chairman of the Intelligence Committee , told me , “ There ’s no vote that I regret more than the vote to authorize war with Iraq ” ; her vote was based on intelligence that she describes as “ flat wrong . ”
Feinstein went on , “ I am absolutely determined to reform the process of gathering and analyzing intelligence . ”
Several well - respected former C.I.A. officials -- including Fred Hitz , a former inspector general , and Paul Pillar , a former Middle East analyst -- told me that they saw no harm in releasing the documents .
Dennis C. Blair , the director of National Intelligence , who oversees the U.S. intelligence establishment , including the C.I.A. , also supported the release of the documents , after his staff concluded that the disclosures would likely do no damage .
The C.I.A. has apparently done nothing to penalize the officer who oversaw one of the most notorious renditions -- that of a German car salesman named Khaled el - Masri .
He was abducted while on a holiday in Macedonia , and flown by the agency to Afghanistan , where he was detained in a dungeon for five months without charges , before being released .
From the start , the rendition team suspected that his case was one of mistaken identity .
But the C.I.A. officer in charge at Langley -- the agency asked that the officer ’s name be withheld -- insisted that Masri be further interrogated .
“ She just looked in her crystal ball and it said that he was bad , ” a colleague recalls .
Masri says that he was chained in a freezing cell with no bed , and given water so putrid that he could smell it across the room .
He was threatened and stripped , and could hear other detainees crying all around him .
After several weeks , the C.I.A. officer in charge learned that Masri ’s German passport was not a forgery , as was originally suspected , and that he was not the terror suspect the agency thought he was .
( The names were similar . )
Even so , the officer in charge refused to release him .
Eventually , Masri went on a hunger strike , losing sixty pounds .
Skeptics in the agency went directly over the officer ’s head to Tenet , who realized that his agency had been brutalizing an innocent man .
Masri was released after a hundred and forty - nine days .
But the officer in charge was not disciplined ; in fact , a former colleague says , “ she ’s been promoted -- twice . ”
Masri , meanwhile , has been unable to sue the U.S. government for either an apology or damages , because the courts consider the very existence of rendition a state secret -- a position that the Obama Justice Department has so far supported .
No criminal charges have ever been brought against any C.I.A. officer involved in the torture program , despite the fact that at least three prisoners interrogated by agency personnel died as the result of mistreatment .
In the first case , an unnamed detainee under C.I.A. supervision in Afghanistan froze to death after having been chained , naked , to a concrete floor overnight .
The body was buried in an unmarked grave .
In the second case , an Iraqi prisoner named Manadel al - Jamadi died on November 4 , 2003 , while being interrogated by the C.I.A. at Abu Ghraib prison , outside Baghdad .
A forensic examiner found that he had essentially been crucified ; he died from asphyxiation after having been hung by his arms , in a hood , and suffering broken ribs .
Military pathologists classified the case a homicide .
A third prisoner died after an interrogation in which a C.I.A. officer participated , though the officer evidently did not cause the death .
( Several other detainees have disappeared and remain unaccounted for , according to Human Rights Watch . )
This morning I was trying to figure out what would be least depressing to blog about , Miss McConnell , fresh from endorsing fellow hypocritical closet queen Charlie Crist , swishing onto the set of CBS 'to declare , when not being hysterical about health care reform , that the GOP is still weighing whether or not it will be more advantageous to fillibuster Judge Sonia Sotomayor ; President Kent Conrad , along with 2 other conservative presidents , President Ben Nelson and President Susan Collins , telling CNN talking head John King onthat Obama can't pass a public option because he does n't have 60 votes ; or Jane Mayer 's troubling examination of the C.I.A. in the .
If you readwith any regularity , you probably know we harbor quite a few misgivings about the nature of the C.I.A. , the role it has played internationally and domestically , and that we are open to the premises in Russ Baker 's magnificent new book , Family of Secrets , that implicates the C.I.A. in removing two American presidents whose policies they did n't agree with , John Kennedy and Richard Nixon .
I chose Door # 3 .
Mayer asks in her subtitle whether Obama's C.I.A. chief , Leon Panetta can succeed at Langley without confronting the agency 's past -- and she 's not talking about Dealey Plaza For Mayer , Obama is somewhat heroically attempting to restore the rule of law , so thoroughly savaged by the Cheney Regime , without sacrificing national security , safety and the support of conservative Democrats .
He 's been trying " to recalibrate the agency ’s policies without investigating past mistakes or holding anyone responsible for them , " infuriating the left and the right about equally .
Panetta , somehow , " has to ride the tiger without being eaten , " a particularly vicious tiger that certainly has no moral compass whatsoever .
They do n't want any investigations -- and they mean it .
Those are two things the C.I.A. is n't eager to see the covers drawn back on .
Panetta is surrounded by incestuous Tenet operatives who claim Bush and Cheney were the bad guys but that they themselves were n't .
And Obama seems to be playing ball with C.I.A. elements of dubious loyalty ( to him and to the United States ) .
On April 16th he promised immunity from prosecution to any C.I.A. officer who relied on the advice of legal counsel during the Bush years , i.e. , torture cheerleaders like Mormon fanatic Jay Bybee and Korean fascist John Yoo .
Jeffrey Smith , a former general counsel to the C.I.A. , points out that this is a low standard , given that “ what the Justice Department approved was outrageous .
” Needless to say , those implicated in torture adamantly oppose anything and everything that would expose them in any way and the media has made much of claims that release of documents and photos " could spark an anti-American backlash . "
Where -- in the blogosphere ?
Some C.I.A. agents seem to have learned absolutely nothing from the generally mild outrage over the torture disclosures -- which have come with no accountability -- and are still adamant that they need " preventive detention " and rendition .
Panetta favors a kinder and gentler rendition -- and one that , presumably , will make fewer mistakes in kidnapping innocent people and arbitrarily torturing them for months on end .
There have been at least 7 but possibly many more .
There has been no accounting , let along accountability .
Short of passing universal health care , there 's probably nothing Obama could do that would be more beneficial to this country than abolishing the C.I.A. and starting over again from scratch .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Bill Gross , the influential manager who runs top bond fund PIMCO , on Wednesday lambasted his industry for charging investors hefty fees for subpar performance amidst the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression .
PIMCO 's Bill Gross in an undated photo .
REUTERS / Handout
In his latest investment letter to clients , Gross , co-chief investment offer of Pacific Investment Management Co. , said roughly 90 percent of the $ 1.5 trillion in 401 K and other defined contribution assets in mutual funds are “ actively managed . ”
And yet many of those portfolio managers posted unspectacular performance for exorbitant fees , close to 1 percent , he asserted .
He likened the situation to the infamous Madame Rue selling Potion # 9 .
“ I ’ve never known any gold - capped tooth money managers , but without squinting very hard there is undoubtedly a strong resemblance between all of us “ managers ” and the infamous Madame Rue selling Potion # 9 , ” Gross said .
“ Instead of love , though , we sell “ hope , ” but very few are able to seal the deal with performance anywhere close to compensating for the generous fees we command . ”
Gross said investors paying for those potions during an era of asset appreciation with double - digit returns may have been “ tolerable , ” but if investment returns gravitate close to 6 percent as his firm envisions , “ then 15 percent of your income will be extracted based on the beguiling promise of Madame Rue . ”
He highlighted a recent Barron ’s article that pointed out that stock funds extract an average 99 basis points or virtually 1 percent a year in fees from an investor ’s portfolio , while bond managers at 75 basis points .
Many money market funds manage to charge 38 basis points .
“ Since money market funds barely earn 38 basis points these days , much of the return winds up in the hands of investment managers , ” Gross said .
“ A mighty expensive potion indeed . ”
For his part , Gross ’ PIMCO Total Return fund , whose assets under management of $ 164 billion makes it the world ’s largest mutual fund , ranks as a strong performer .
“ On a grade scale , we have them at a ‘ B ’ because of their consistent performance , low fees and low volatility -- that ’s very good , ” said Steven Carpenter , founder and chief executive officer of Cake Financial Corporation , an online independent management service in San Francisco , Calif .
“ That fund has also significantly outperformed the Standard & Poor ’s 500 over the last two years , ” Carpenter added .
The PIMCO Total Return fund charges 46 basis points to investors .
Gross reiterated that economic growth for the United States will fall short of recent years , expanding around 3 percent a year once it emerges from recession .
The U.S. economy was growing at 5 to 7 percent a year for 15 years before it plunged into the worst recession in decades .
Slower growth means lower profit growth , permanently higher joblessness , constrained consumer spending and increased government involvement , Gross added .
“ The “ new normal ” nominal GDP , the future return on our stock of labor and capital investment , will likely be centered closer to 3 percent , for at least a few years once a recovery is in place beginning in this year ’s second half , ” Gross said .
“ Diminished capitalistic risk taking and constrained policymaker releveraging will lead to that likely conclusion . ”
Gross ’s cautious outlook was echoed by Mohamed El - Erian , Pimco ’s chief executive , who told Reuters on Tuesday it was too soon to declare the recession is over in the United States .
What do prediction and financial markets have to say about the prospect of dropping the public option and replacing it with health care co-ops ?
Arin Dube has an answer ( which is a follow - up to this post ) :
Public Option versus “ Co-ops ” : The Market Test , by Arin Dube : President Obama says he is serious about making sure we have a competitive alternative to the private health insurance companies to drive down costs .
However , he is now apparently open to the idea of “ health co-operatives ” that will be regional purchasing pools operating independently of the federal government .
How well will these co-ops achieve his stated goals ?
To assess this , we can start with his own words and those of his subordinates .
Well , to be precise , how various investors reacted to these words .
Exhibit A
So as the public option ’s condition went to critical , and “ co-ops ” started looking increasingly likely , how did investors in the top 4 private health insurance companies react ?
As exhibit B shows , champagne bottles were popped .
Exhibit A shows how investors in the Intrade prediction market reacted to signals from the Obama administration on Sunday August 16 that they are willing to ditch the public health insurance option .
In the market ’s assessment , the likelihood of a federally administered health plan passing fell from around 35 % to around 20 % , the biggest one - day drop since the prediction market started in June .
Exhibit B
On a day when the broader stock market took a hit ( dropping 2.2 % at the time of writing ) , these four companies with a combined market cap of $ 80 billion saw their prices rise an average of 3 % .
Actually , if you dot the i’s and cross the t’s in calculating “ abnormal returns ” ** for these four companies , it comes to be 5.8 % .
All in all , statements by the Obama administration over the weekend helped investors of private health insurance markets make around $ 4.6 billion .
So , as the market ’s assessed likelihood of the public option passing dropped by 15 percentage points , share prices rose by around 6 percentage .
If you are willing to extrapolate based on this event , going from a public option to “ co-ops ” would be worth around 40 % of the value of these companies , or around $ 32 billion .
This is similar to the results from my previous analysis of how market reacted to announcements by members of the Senate Finance Committee .
President Obama may have harsh words for the insurance companies .
But those are not the words investors in these companies are paying attention to .
They are paying attention to whether President Obama will sign a bill with vague “ co-ops ” or demand a public option .
And the reaction by these investors bodes poorly for “ co-ops ” fulfilling their role as a serious competitive alternative to private insurance companies .

At E3 I had a meeting scheduled with the fine folks of High Voltage Software , creators of the very attractive Wii title The Conduit .
What you may not know is that actor Mark Sheppard was hired to provide the lead character 's voice in that game , and I faced the charismatic Brit as I checked in .
It 's not every day you come face to face with Gaius Baltar 's lawyer , or one of Firefly 's more flamboyant gangsters .
To me though , he 'll always be ...
" Mr. President , " I said , shaking his hand .
" I can tell you 're a man of character ! "
Sheppard told me , laughing .
" Have you played the game ? "
In a few minutes I learned that Sheppard goes everywhere the game is , talking to people , getting them excited about the game .
At E3 he worked the booth like a master showman , grabbing people and giving them demos .
I made my way upstairs to the roof of the booth , where creative officer Eric Nofsinger and design director David Pellas were waiting for me .
The Conduit is shipping in a matter of weeks , so we were there to talk about The Grinder , the upcoming four - player online co-op title where a scrappy band of characters fights off a collection of monsters .
The game looked great , with detailed environments , gun play , and even a miniboss on display .
Nofsinger happily played the game in front of me , explaining the concepts and the story of the game .
You 're a bounty hunter , a mysterious stranger hires you to take down some monsters , and there you are .
" We wanted to do something that takes advantage of our tech , our experience , and our resources that we gained on the Conduit .
So we decided to do a first - person shooter with traditional monsters . "
You 'll also see giant worm - like creatures , " very much inspired by the movie Tremors . "
The team also wanted to include wolf - men .
I was asked if I remembered the cult - classic film Monster Squad .
" Wolfman has nards ? " I asked helpfully .
They nodded .
Wolfman has nards .
So far we had met Romo Lampkin , name - dropped Tremors , and discussed the genitalia of classic movie monsters .
This was , so far , one of the most nerd - tastic meetings I had at E3 .
They extolled the virtues of the game 's Architect system , which controls the behavior of the enemies on screen .
You 'll be fighting the monsters , the monsters will be fighting each other , and the game will exist in a barely controlled state of chaos .
The technology is impressive .
If you light a collection of vampires on fire , each one becomes a separate light source .
The game looks great , especially for the Wii , and we were told that WiiSpeak will be supported for the online play , and four - player online will be the " minimum . "
They 're also looking at competitive game play modes , and Pellas asked if I have any ideas for that aspect of gameplay .
I shrugged , but the amazing thing is that I know he 's not blowing smoke .
When High Voltage took the Conduit to shows back in the day they asked gamers for ideas on what they wanted to see in terms of control .
The best ones were incorporated into the game .
These guys do n't just show off their games , they brainstorm with the press and the public .
The game is coming in late 2010 , which means we saw at E3 is very early work .
What 's impressive is that the fully - fleshed out level we played was created in two months .
" We have an amazingly talented group , and incredible technology and mature tools .
All of the tricks of the trade we learned on the Conduit , and many we 've learn since them , are all incorporated into this game . "
It took many hours , they stressed , and the team did four months of work in that two month period , but it 's still an amazing feat .
" It 's a testament to the tools we built for the Conduit , and the maturity of them .
We have such a robust toolset , we were able to get this up and running in a week . "
It may not have looked as good as the final E3 demo , but it was playable and functional .
" It 's amazing to demo this and know that two months ago , it did n't exist . "
The final game will also likely support the Wii MotionPlus , along with some nice swordplay .
It was n't just the voice actors who got caught up in the excitement .
" We have an amazing angel investor , " I was told .
" And he does n't just write the check .
He comes in , he plays the games , he 's been here for two days , he works the booth .
He 's a really awesome guy . "
They could n't tell me who that is , although they also assured me it's not Mark Sheppard , which was my first guess after seeing how invested the actor has been while working the booth .
The take - away is that the company is fully funded , and is focusing on making the games , not worrying about finding a publisher ... although there is no shortage of interest .
At this point I had to run to my next meeting , but High Voltage stuck in my head for the rest of the day .
This developer has no shortage of gee - whiz technology and enthusiasm , and even the voice actors fall in love with the product .
The investor was there at E3 , working the booth and getting people excited .
They invited me to tour the studio next time I 'm in Chicago , and I promised to give them a call when I 'm in town .
Surrounded once again by booth babes and blasting music as I made my way back onto the show floor and away from the nice little meeting room on top of High Voltage 's booth , I was glad to know that in this sometimes jaded and cynical industry , there are still a few people living their dream .
The destruction of a once proud and thriving city .
A few months ago we came across a surprising little iPhone game by the name of Spider .
In it , you use your eight - legged - platforming - prowess to scale walls , spin webs , snack on bugs – y’know , the usual bad - ass spider stuff .
I got a chance to talk with David Kalina , Co-Owner and Lead Programmer at Tiger Style Games and an industry veteran ( Splinter Cell , Deus Ex : Invisible War , Thief ) , about Spider and why he made the jump from big - budget studios to indie games .
The game ’s premise is about as simple as I ’ve just explained : you ’re a spider , go nuts !
But Tiger
Style games has managed to build some depth , as well as instant fun , into that seemingly basic package .
Flicking your finger against the iPhone ’s screen causes the spider to spring across the room with pinpoint precision .
Building a web , which you can walk around on and use to capture prey , is as simple as connecting dots .
Combine these solid platforming mechanics with hand - drawn art and a helping of online features and you ’ve got a promising game .
GD : So what ’s Spider in a nutshell ?
Kalina : Spider : The Secret of Bryce Manor is a unique action / adventure game for the iPhone and iPod Touch .
You draw webs with your finger , trap bugs and eat them , and explore an abandoned mansion , uncovering its secrets .
GD : What drove you to make the game in the first place ?
Kalina :
We threw around a ton of concepts in the very early days .
Ideas are cheap ; picking the right idea for our goals as a developer is hard .
It was very important to us to find something that was unique for the platform , had strong personality , and was possible to build with a small team in a short period of time .
The initial concept was just a couple of sentences .
Our friend and contributor Jon Whitmore gave us this :
“ You are a spider , and you spin your web with your finger on the screen .
You have to eat the flies . ”
As we filtered through the many , many possibilities for our first game , we started developing a few of the simple concepts into more elaborate game design treatments .
The initial game design treatment for Spider was actually quite different from the game it turned into , but it helped us get focused on something attainable and got us excited about the possibility of making a Spider game .
GD : How long has it been in development ?
Kalina :
From the first line of code to our submission to Apple , the entire game ’s development took exactly 8 months .
GD : One thing that stands out about Spider is its physics .
How did you capture that feeling of spring - loaded energy ?
Kalina : Getting the physical motion of the spider right was one of the hardest and most important problems we had to solve for this game .
The main challenge was n’t really technical — Spider actually has a very simple physical model .
The challenge came from developing a control scheme that is completely native to the touchscreen and getting it to “ feel right ” for everyone .
If you tell a group of people who have never seen the game before that they need to “ swipe to jump ” you ’re going to get a wide range of actual input .
Some people will swipe their finger quickly and aggressively , some will move slower and more tentatively .
Ultimately , this one action has to work reliably for everybody who plays — it ’s the most important , most common action in the game , and it had to be fun and accessible .
The real trick was playtesting early ( our first internal build was sent out back in February ) and iterating often .
In earlier builds , playtesters had a lot of trouble controlling the Spider ’s jumps .
We took that information , simplified the way it worked , and kept tuning and tweaking it until people started getting it immediately .
Quality animation also makes a big difference in the feel of the Spider .
We were lucky to have a really great animator named Jen Cha working on the Spider with us ; her contributions really impact the look and feel of the game .
GD : What kinds of features does Spider offer , aside from the core game ?
Kalina : Spider does feature online leaderboards for each of the four game modes ( Adventure , Feeding Frenzy , Hunger , and Precision ) .
We also have integrated Facebook Connect into our leaderboard system .
If you sign into Facebook through Spider , you can compare your high scores directly with your friends ’ high scores .
It ’s super sweet to see your friends ’ faces inside the app , and it ’s fun to compete against their best performances .
In some ways , the game has a casual feel ; it ’s fun to just drop in and build webs and explore .
But there is also a lot of content to satisfy more hardcore gamers .
In addition to the 4 distinct game modes , we have 24 achievements to unlock and 12 secret areas to discover across 28 levels .
Spider has plenty of content to keep you engaged for hours .
GD : So when can we download Spider , and for how much ?
Kalina :
If all goes well , we hope to be in the App Store in mid-August for $ 2.99
( Edit : Spider is available for download from the Apple Store as of today 8/10 )
As well as launching their new game , Tiger Style Games has been busy launching itself as a studio .
GD : Having worked at big - budget studios like Midway , Ion Storm , and UbiSoft , what brought you to indie games ?
Kalina : Randy Smith and I found ourselves looking for an inspiring opportunity at the same time , and the traditional AAA development jobs were starting to lose their lustre .
We had both worked on projects for over 3 years that never saw the light of day .
The iPhone market offered a clear opportunity for a small group to quickly make something exciting and different .
Both Randy and I have 10 + years experience in the industry and it just felt like the right time to take the plunge and try to do it our own way .
On top of that , we both love our iPhones and believe that they have tremendous power as a gaming platform .
It is a space in the gaming universe where an independent developer can take some real creative risks and still have a shot at success .
Being fully independent has incredible perks ( creative freedom , flexibility of hours and lifestyle , working from home / anywhere ) but is also risky and challenging .
We could get rich or we could end up penniless , but either way we will have made games that we are passionate about .
GD : What ’s the present for Tiger Style Games , and what ’s next ?
Kalina :
We are currently moving into full - time promotion mode for Spider .
Most importantly , we are working on putting together a video trailer , which will hopefully be available within the week .
As a fully independent developer , we need to go out and talk to everybody ourselves and try to build up some excitement for our game .
After the game is released , we plan to do an update and a lite version .
We are also super excited to start working on Game # 2 .
We intend to leverage our experience on the platform and the technology we ’ve built to take on new creative challenges .
Our second game will hopefully be very different from Spider , but like Spider , our goal is to continue making stuff that is different from everything else available in the App Store .
Keep up with Spider and the folks at Tiger Style Games by following them at @tigerstylegames on Twitter .
Also , there ’s some sweet tiger - related art .
To people used to associating sex with romance and romance with mystery , these guidelines look stifling .
Each and every time ?
You can see what the good folks at Antioch are trying to do : eliminate the sort of boorishness that expresses itself as " Well , we did it once , so it must be O.K. to do it again , " or " You kissed me , so of course you want me to pull all your clothes off . "
Some Antioch students , interviewed by The Times , said the rules were n't so bad in practice .
You could obtain permission to do something without being clunky about it .
Others were n't happy .
If permission must be sought for a kiss , and if previous permission is n't to be taken as permission in the future , a student could risk serious consequences with a spontaneous smooch delivered to a longtime lover who happened to be in a bad mood .
The policy stipulates that verbal consent is required for any sexual contact or conduct that is not " mutually and simultaneously initiated . "
Here is fertile ground for misunderstandings galore .
One person 's mutuality , even simultaneity , can often be another person 's submission .
Antioch 's enumeration of dating do's and do n't's is not a list of suggestions -- and that 's part of the problem .
Worrying about worst - case scenarios is appropriate since , as one disgruntled student put it : " This is a real policy .
I can get kicked out over this . "

For those who have read closely here , I am an inspiree of David Graeber ’s ethnographic Anarchism work .
And his new book has just been released by A K Press , found here .
Yet to sample it of course , though he was kind enough to share with me some of the theoretical issues he has recently been facing and his possible solutions , so it surely is to touch on some of the necessarily non-Marxist responses to contemporary society , in particular an address of the relative dearth of anarchistic theorizing , here taken on in practical terms ( let ’s face it , Anarchists do n’t really like to over - determine political action with the kinds of principles and discussion that most academics love to quibble endlessly about ) .
By means of recommendation David himself says that he has read it , and its not so bad .
From the publisher :
In the best tradition of participant - observation , anthropologist David Graeber undertakes the first detailed ethnographic study of the global justice movement .
Starting from the assumption that , when dealing with possibilities of global transformation and emerging political forms , a disinterested , “ objective ” perspective is impossible , he writes as both scholar and activist .
At the same time , his experiment in the application of ethnographic methods to important ongoing political events is a serious and unique contribution to the field of anthropology , as well as an inquiry into anthropology ’s political implications .
The case study at the center of Direct Action is the organizing and events that led to the dramatic protest against the Summit of the Americas in Québec City in 2001 .
Written in a clear , accessible style ( with a minimum of academic jargon ) , this study brings readers behind the scenes of a movement that has changed the terms of debate about world power relations .
From informal conversations in coffee shops to large “ spokescouncil ” planning meetings and teargas - drenched street actions , Graeber paints a vivid and fascinating picture .
Along the way , he addresses matters of deep interest to anthropologists : meeting structure and process , language , symbolism , representation , the specific rituals of activist culture , and much more .
David Graeber is an anthropologist and activist who teaches at the University of London .
Active in numerous direct - action political organizations , he is the author of Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology ; Towards an Anthropological Theory of Value ; and Possibilities : Essays on Hierarchy , Rebellion , and Desire .
NEW YORK , Aug 10 ( Reuters ) - McKesson Corp MCK.N said on Monday it has widened its vaccine - distribution contract with the U.S. government to include preparations for distributing H1N1 flu vaccines now under development , sending its share higher .
McKesson already distributes about 80 million doses of various other vaccines , involving more than 40,000 providers , to U.S. adults and children through an existing contract with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
“ The H1N1 vaccine distribution effort will include the centralized distribution of the H1N1 flu vaccine to as many as 90,000 sites across the country , making it the largest public health initiative in the CDC ’s history , ” McKesson said in a release .
McKesson , whose shares were up 1.6 percent on the New York Stock Exchange in midday trading , said it would distribute H1N1 vaccines to sites designated by state health departments across the country .
Health experts have said that infants and children have been especially susceptible to infection with the H1N1 strain of the flu virus .
The H1N1 flu outbreak , declared a pandemic in June , has spread around the world and could eventually affect 2 billion people , according to World Health Organization estimates .
The virus has killed more than 800 people worldwide since emerging in April .

May 26 , 2013 Add full Python new buffer protocol support to Pygame 1.9.2 .
In addition Python level array interface support is added to several Pygame objects and function .
This changeset marks the end of a series of commits , starting with revision 98e3a61592c1 on September 8 , 2012 .
Affected Pygame buffer exporting objects are BufferProxy , Surface ( through method get_buffer ) , Sound , PixelArray , and Color .
Affected importers are Sound , freetype .
Font , BufferProxy , and the pixelcopy module functions ( array_to_surface , surface_to_array , map_array , and make_surface ) .
Internally , Pygame has been rewritten to use the C Py_buffer to represent external array objects .
For Python 2.5 and earlier , which do not support the new buffer protocol , Py_buffer is defined in pygame .h.
The details of translating between Py_buffer and the array interface are now found in only on C file , base .c .
Consequently , the base module exports several new Pygame C api functions and a new exception : PgBuffer_AsArrayInterface , PgBuffer_AsArrayStruct , PgObject_GetBuffer , PgBuffer_Release , PgDict_AsBuffer , and PgExc_BufferError .
These api additions also reduce the amount of conditional compilation code required to support Python versions which lack the new buffer protocol .
Finally , for proper testing , additions are made to the unit test framework .
A new extension module , pygame .
newbuffer , adds new classes for importing and exporting the new buffer interface at the Python level .
It is built conditionally .
The new pygame.tests.test_utils.buftools
Python module implements the high level classes used in the actual unit tests .
Also , a new class in pygame.tests.test_utils.arrinter exports a C level array interface from the Python level .

Color objects now export an array struct interface .
Various bug fixes for Python 3.1 . [ SVN 3000 - 3002 ]
Feb 20 , 2011 Merge the surface_buffer branch back into trunk .
1 ) Rename module _arraysurfarray to pixelcopy , which implements array_to_surface ( blit_surface ) , surface_to_array , and map_array .
2 ) Reimplement _numpysurfarray methods array2d , array3d , array_alpha , array_colorkey , and map_surface to use new pixelcopy methods .
Module pixelcopy reimplements _numericsurfarray using generic copy methods that accept objects exporting an array struct interface .
Along with Surface views , it moves almost all of the _numpysurfarray .
py functionality into C code .
pixelcopy is also independent of NumPy , so can work with other array like objects .
[ SVN 2983 - 2987 ] Feb 08 , 2011

3 ) Add a new Type , pygame ._view .
View as a proxy for exporting an array struct interface .
4 ) Add the pygame .
Surface.get_view ( ) method , which returns a View instance .
Besides creating views describing pixel2d , pixels3d , and pixels_alpha arrays , new pixels_red , pixels_green , and pixels_blue views have been added .
5 ) Update the pixels surfarray methods to use Surface.get_view ( ) for numpy arrays , removing the Python array manipulation code .

We first heard last week a rumor that the woman accusing Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger of sexual assault wanted to drop the case but that her lawyer , Calvin Dunlap , had strongly advised her against it .
We opted at the time not to mention it here , since we were n’t sure how widespread the rumor truly was .
But we ’ve heard the rumor again this morning from a completely separate source , and based on recent developments in the case we ’re now convinced that the recent push by Roethlisberger to leverage the accuser into walking away suggests that his lawyers believe that the accuser is indeed wavering .
( By the way , some of you have objected to our characterization of recent statements made in briefs filed on behalf of Roethlisberger as being made by Roethlisberger himself .
Though the words are coming from his lawyers , they are speaking on his behalf .
Thus , their words are his words .
So , for example , when the lawyers say that the accuser is mentally unstable , then Roethsliberger himself is making that assertion .
We realize that the use of such strong words might not mesh with the image that some fans have of Roethlisberger .
In our view , however , pretending that the words are n’t really his is n’t the best way to come to terms with the reality that , right or wrong , Roethlisberger is indeed using very strong terms to defend himself . )
The lengthy filing that Roethlisberger made on August 21 in support of his motion to dismiss the case suggests that his lawyers might have caught wind of the rumor right here .
Not in an official story on the site , but from a comment posted in response to one of our stories from last week .
The potential risk , in our view , is that by pushing the accuser so aggressively to drop the case , Roethlisberger might eventually cause her to decide to stand firm and fight .
( For more on this specific dynamic of the human condition , rent or buy Changeling on DVD . )
The accuser ’s final decision in this regard might largely hinge on whether the accuser really is telling the truth .
If she is n’t , the smart move would be to throw in the towel and move on .
The problem is that Dunlap possibly has inserted language into his standard fee agreement that would require the plaintiff to reimburse him for all out - of - pocket expenses incurred if the plaintiff acts against Dunlap ’s advice .
So if the plaintiff wants out , she might need to write Dunlap a check bigger than what she can afford .
( Typically , the plaintiff ’s expenses and legal fees are paid from any settlement or judgment , with no cost to the plaintiff if the case ultimately fails . )
That ’s why we now think the best move for Roethlisberger would be to dangle a chunk of the money he has been spending on legal fees of his own ( which are paid by the hour , usually monthly ) for a quick and quiet settlement , with very strong language ensuring that the plaintiff and Dunlap will keep the settlement a secret .
The goal would n’t be to make the plaintiff rich , but to give the plaintiff and Dunlap a popcorn trail out of this mess in a manner that allows both of them to save face .
The presence of multiple other defendants complicates the process , however .
But we think it should be fairly easy for Harrah ’s and Roethlisberger to put together a nuisance - level settlement package and resolve this thing under circumstances that will appear to be an abandonment by the plaintiff — if she also will agree to publicly exonerate Roethlisberger as part of the deal .
So even though Roethlisberger has adopted an extremely aggressive approach , he arguably has been too aggressive to permit a dismissal with no strings attached .
If he decides to soften his defense in the short term , he might be able to put this thing behind him via a settlement that , to the average person , would look like a complete and total vindication .
New Attack on AES
There ’s a new cryptanalytic attack on AES that is better than brute force :
Abstract .
In this paper we present two related - key attacks on the full AES .
For AES - 256 we show the first key recovery attack that works for all the keys and has complexity 2119 , while the recent attack by Biryukov - Khovratovich - Nikolic works for a weak key class and has higher complexity .
The second attack is the first cryptanalysis of the full AES - 192 .
Both our attacks are boomerang attacks , which are based on the recent idea of finding local collisions in block ciphers and enhanced with the boomerang switching techniques to gain free rounds in the middle .
In an e-mail , the authors wrote :
We also expect that a careful analysis may reduce the complexities .
As a preliminary result , we think that the complexity of the attack on AES - 256 can be lowered from 2119 to about 2110.5 data and time .
We believe that these results may shed a new light on the design of the key - schedules of block ciphers , but they pose no immediate threat for the real world applications that use AES .
Agreed .
While this attack is better than brute force — and some cryptographers will describe the algorithm as “ broken ” because of it — it is still far , far beyond our capabilities of computation .
The attack is , and probably forever will be , theoretical .
But remember : attacks always get better , they never get worse .
Others will continue to improve on these numbers .
While there ’s no reason to panic , no reason to stop using AES , no reason to insist that NIST choose another encryption standard , this will certainly be a problem for some of the AES - based SHA - 3 candidate hash functions .

So what is your favorite ?
We ’re a bit partial to the 02 Sustainability and Yellow Treehouse restaurant builds , but we ’re more interested in your opinion .
Share your thoughts in the comments , and if you ’ve spotted any that we should have included here , let us know .
In the mean time , check out these other great TheCoolist features !
Yup , you read the title right .
This Young House is going the way of the dodo and the dinosaur .
And although it certainly was n’t our idea ( let ’s just say lawyers were involved ) it sure has added some excitement to our lives .
The good news is that we ’re already whipping up lemonade from the sour lemons hurled in our general direction .
We ’ve got a brand - spanking - new name and URL , but the site remains exactly the same otherwise .
So remember to visit younghouselove.com from this day forth ( and to update you reader , bookmarks and even your blogroll if you link out to us ) .
Ok , so here ’s the full scoop .
On July 7th , as many of you know , we were busy celebrating our two year wedding anniversary .
But on July 8th we got a nice little present in the form of a cease and desist letter from a prominent home improvement magazine / TV show which bears a few similarities to our old site ’s name ( you guys can figure it out , right ? ) .
Do n’t they know the two year anniversary present is cotton , not paper ?
Anyway , they basically ordered that we immediately surrender the use of our old name and URL because they believed consumers were getting confused and may think that Young House Love was in some way related to their brand .
Picture us scratching our heads .
In almost two years of blogging under that moniker not one person has ever asked if we were related to that company .
That started a rollercoaster ride of emotions .
First came fear and sadness – were we really going to get sued or be forced to hand over nearly two years of hard work ?
Then came confusion and anger – why was the same pub that contacted us last year to compliment our work and offer us a free magazine subscription suddenly sending lawyers after us ?
Not to mention the fact that our site and our logo looked nothing like theirs , our names were essentially opposites , our projects are on a completely different scale , and we ’re clearly just two young people with a personal blog ( not a corporation with deep pockets and an army of lifelong experts ) .
But we eventually unclenched our fists and faced reality .
Even though we completely disagreed with every single point they made , what two - person blog wants to go up against such an industry powerhouse ?
Can you just imagine that ?
In this corner we have a million dollar company .
And in this corner …
John , Sherry , and a feisty chihuahua .
No thanks .
So after many hours spent huddling with an attorney , we decided the best way to move forward ( and spare ourselves a potentially long and expensive legal battle ) would be to turn the other cheek and change our name and URL .
After all , just as the - magazine - that - shall - not - be - named does n’t want to be accidentally associated with us , we certainly share that sentiment .
Now more than ever .
And a funny thing happened after we made the decision to move on to bigger and better things .
We got fired up .
Not throw - something - I ’m - mad fired up , but this - could - be - an - amazing - opportunity fired up .
Then came the search for the perfect new name .
We tossed out a few odd but applicable ones first ( involving our infamous love of white paint , ceramic animals and charming chihuahuas ) but we still felt like Youngsters at heart .
So we decided to bridge the gap between our old name and the thing that our last URL had always been missing : the can ’t - deny - it crush we have on our home .
We secured our new website addy on Bluehost for $ 4 with a coupon ( you know we like to sniff out a good deal ) and our new blog baby : Young House Love was born .
It instantly felt like a place we could call home , and we really like referencing the idea of falling in “ house love ” ( that unmistakable puppy love that we all feel for the casa we ’re tenderly fixing up ) .
And here we are less than a week later , welcoming you to our new virtual abode .
We ’re still unpacking a bit , so bear with us as we transition everything .
We know it may take some time for you guys to get comfortable with our new name and URL , but just as our old blog was once our baby , this one is our “ youngest child ” which means we ’re gonna coddle it and spoil our lovely readers even more than we did before .
Weekly giveaways ( starting back up tomorrow ! ) , before & afters , step by step tutorials - we ’ll serve it all up on a white lacquered platter .
In the order of housekeeping , we would also love to remind you to change your bookmarks , Google Reader ( click that link or add “ www.younghouselove.com/feed” to find the right feed ) , and even your blogroll and the outgoing links ( old and new ) on your blog if you ’ve linked over to us ( links to specific posts can easily be redirected to the right place by replacing “ thisyounghouse ” with “ younghouselove ” in the URL and leaving the rest of the address as - is ) .
Now that we ’re legally bound to go by Young House Love from this day forward , replacing those old links and switching any old copy that says “ This Young House ” to “ Young House Love ” will really help our new blog grow and prosper ( and make our day to boot ) .
Plus , if you ’ve been following us on Twitter or Facebook ( btw , we had lots of fun reading everyone ’s guesses about our big news all weekend ) please take a moment to switch over to our new Young House Love Twitter and Young House Love Facebook pages .
They ’re a little bare at the moment , but rest assured they ’ll be the only place for bonus content and what - we ’re - doing details from this point forward .
Our old accounts will just turn into periodic annoying reminders to make the move so it ’s best to abandon ship and jump aboard our new ones asap ( note : please unfollow or unfan the old YHL pages after your switch to help us clean ’em out ) .
Oh and of course , we ’d be forever grateful it you ’d tell your friends / family / blog readers / coworkers / dog / gourd lamp about our new address .
We would hate to lose a single one of you in the switch .
We even made a handy little 120 x 120 button for any fellow bloggers out there who would n’t mind adding it to their sidebar with a link back to younghouselove.com ( click HERE to grab it ) , which will really make us feel all warm and fuzzy inside .
Thanks so much for your support .
You guys put the love in Young House Love , so smooches all around .
Be sure and check out my interview with Christopher McDougall !
In it , Chris talks about denying your nature , the sports shoe industry , getting to barefoot , cross- pollinating ideas , and more !
Christopher McDougall , author of the recently released Born to Run , talked to Ron Hogan about how he had regressed in his running form after switching back to wearing running shoes .
The solution ?
Keeping his form honest by wearing Vibram Five Fingers .
Here ’s the video , and I ’ve transcribed much of what McDougall says below :
And if you prefer to read it , here ’s my transcription .
Christopher McDougall :
“ I thought that once I learned how to run like those [ ultra long distance runners ] do , my problems are gone forever except that while I was writing [ Born to Run ] the problem came back .
I started getting this heel pain and I could n’t shake it .
I spent nine months trying to shake this stupid heel pain .
“ And I thought well it ca n’t be the way I run because now I run perfectly .
I ’ve learned perfect biomechanics , it ca n’t be that .
I went through the same cycle of seeing sports medicine doctors and nothing helped .
I went to see a guy who is a barefoot running coach .
He took 30 seconds of video and he ’s like “ Okay .
You ’re cured .
Problem solved . ”
He showed me the video and I had regressed because I had gone back to wearing running shoes and I had just lost that sense of contact with the ground and I was n’t aware of where my body was in space .
I regressed back to that old running form and that was what was causing the heel pain .
“ So now I wear these [ Vibram Five Fingers ] because they keep you honest .
You ca n’t be sloppy in these things because there ’s basically nothing to them .
It ’s basically like dipping your foot in paint . . . it ’s just a chunk of rubber and a velcro strap .
“ A lot of barefoot runners have taken to these things like wildfire .
They really love them .
The cool thing is that once they are on your feet you forget you ’re wearing them .
It ’s like you ’re barefoot all the time .
“ Even when you ’re in the house .
Ordinarily you ’re in the house you kick your shoes off – you forget you ’re wearing these .
You just leave them on all the time . ”
Justin here .
I do n’t know about you , but my copy of BtR is presently in the mail from Amazon ( Update : read and reviewed Born to Run — read the review here ) .
I thought this was a great video from McDougall and it really illustrates how even knowing the correct way to run is impaired by the “ noise ” caused by running in your typical running shoes .
Knowing you run wrong , and knowing how to run right just is n’t enough .
The best solution is to minimize the interference between your feet and the ground .
This means running completely barefoot ( Ideal ) or wearing only a minimal amount of footwear ( As in with fivefingers or huaraches , for example ) , if anything .
In the video , McDougall is wearing KSO Five Fingers ( I ’ve reviewed the KSO FiveFingers here .
You can get find KSO VFFs at a authorized Vibram Five Fingers retailer ) .
Finally , I ’ll echo Christopher ’s comment about VFFs in the house .
I frequently throw them on for some reason ( say to run outside to take out the trash ) only to come back in and forget to take them off .
A few hours later I ’ll think , “ Why am I still wearing these things ? ”

Israel 's former prime minister Ehud Olmert has officially been charged with corruption , relating to events before he became premier .
A year ago , Olmert was hoping to leave his mark as the man who achieved peace with the Palestinians .
But these charges are multiple and serious and include allegations of taking cash - filled envelopes and double - billing for trips abroad .
He has always insisted he is innocent .
The charges have been a long time coming .
Olmert was dogged by corruption allegations throughout his time as prime minister .
But when he finally declared he would step down he fully expected he would eventually be cleared .
" I will vacate my seat in the proper way , respectfully , fairly and responsibly , as I have behaved throughout my term , and then I will prove my innocence and that my hands are clean , " Olmert said last year .
But he will not appear so clean though if the charges are upheld , and could face at least five years in jail if he is found guilty .
Olmert is accused of accepting envelopes filled with cash from an American businessman , Morris Talansky .
In a police interview later played in court , Mr Talansky said he had handed Olmert $ US25,000 , only to be asked for more .
" He asked me for double the amount ... what do you think my name is , Rockefeller ? " he said .
Olmert denies he has ever taken a single shekel that was not his , and has vowed to fight the charges in court .
He might have hoped his legacy would be as the Israeli leader who finally brought peace with the Palestinians .
Instead , if he is found guilty , he might be remembered as a fraudster .
The chief political reporter at the Jerusalem Post , Gil Hoffman , says Olmert wanted to fall on the sword of peace but he is falling on the sword of corruption instead .
" That 's what brought him down politically , " he said .
" That 's what forced the election that led to [ Benjamin ] Netanyahu coming to power .
And it 's very unfortunate for him because he really made an effort to move the peace process forward . "
Corruption allegations are hardly new in Israeli politics , although Olmert could be the first former prime minister sent to jail .
Just recently two other former ministers were found guilty of corruption and sentenced to jail and the government that replaced Olmert 's is itself tainted by allegations .
Just this month police formally recommended charges against Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman for graft and money laundering .
He too denies he has done anything wrong .
A former president , Moshe Katsav , is currently on trial for rape .

Obama : " Victory " Not Necessarily
The " Goal " In Afghanistan
FOX News : President Obama has put securing Afghanistan near the top of his foreign policy agenda , but " victory " in the war - torn country is n't necessarily the United States ' goal , he said Thursday in a TV interview .
" I 'm always worried about using the word ' victory , ' because , you know , it invokes this notion of Emperor Hirohito coming down and signing a surrender to MacArthur , " Obama told ABC News .
In a recent opinion poll , consumers preferred the new Union Bank logo , a swollen red vagina , to Walmart ’s yellow puckered anus , by a margin of two - to - one .
In a recent opinion poll , consumers preferred the new Union Bank logo , a swollen red vagina , to Walmart ’s yellow puckered anus , by a margin of two - to - one .
“ People have always associated the banking industry with that very special female part , ” according to Mel Wornauschky , Vice President of Marketing for Union Bank .
“ In fact , many of our employees are playfully called ‘ Vaginas ’ by our loyal customers . ”
While admitting that more males than females prefer the new logo , Wornauschky insists the use of the vagina makes for more than just a cool letterhead .
“ It reflects our corporate philosophy , ” he explained .
“ We detached it from its hiding place and made it the new symbol for banking excellence .
We ’re saying , ‘ Come in and apply for a loan .
No need to hide anything .
At Union Bank , you can expose your vagina — or your wife ’s .
And as tempting for us as that might be , we will never screw you — or your wife . ' ”
“ Well , at least not during business hours , ” he added .
“ You have more than our word on it ; you have the integrity of the Union Bank swollen red vagina . ”
While Union Bank was pleased with the survey results , a Walmart executive said his company does n’t give them much credence .
“ The polling criteria were too narrow , ” insisted Advertising Director Norman Ellijay , a thirty - year Walmart veteran who came up with the new design .
“ Our customers love our huge puckered anus .
It draws them in . ”
He also discredited the pollsters , as “ rank amateurs who have probably never even seen the inside of a Walmart , yet alone a man ’s anus , and have no business soliciting the opinions of those of us who have . ”
While admitting that more gay males than straight ones prefer the new logo , Ellijay insists that most customers overwhelming approve of the puckered - anus design , and claimed that since Walmart switched to the new symbol , sales have increased dramatically .
“ The puckered anus reflects Walmart ’s dedication to the common man , ” noted Elalja .
“ We ’re saying , ‘ Come on in .
We ’ll bend over backwards to serve you , while showing off our little yellow swollen sphincters , to boot . ' ”
Nicholad Zakas , who wrote this book , recently spoke about JavaScript performance at Google ; his presentation was called “ Speed Up Your JavaScript ” and it ’s available to view on Youtube .
In the presentation Nicholas covers areas rarely talked about ; he takes a low - level approach by explaining what ’s happening behind the scenes when you do something as simple as creating or requesting a variable in JavaScript .
It ’s not all conjecture though ; he has a number of graphs comparing performance across browsers and then details the steps you can take to optimise your code , in order to protect yourself from less - than - satisfactory JavaScript implementations ( IE comes to mind ) .
I ’m not obsessed about performance by any means but I do think that the practices shared in his presentation should be followed to the letter .
Speed and performance are hot topics on the client - side ; our users demand fast and responsive applications / websites .
His advice :
Five key points emerged during the presentation :
Store out - of - scope variables in local variables .
Minimise property access .
Do as little as possible on each iteration of a loop .
Minimise document reflow by only changing the DOM when absolutely necessary .
Do n’t use inline styles unless you ’re animating .
Store out - of - scope variables in local variables
The idea behind this technique is to minimise the amount of work required to get at the variable you want .
The further away it is ( in the scope chain ) the longer it ’s going to take to retrieve it .
The performance cost is normally marginal but it ’s still a good practice .
Here ’s an example :
/*--- scope [ 2 ] ---*/ /*
jQuery library is defined up here */ var someModule = ( function ( ) { /*--- scope [ 1 ] ---*/ var privateProp = 123 ; return function ( ) { /*--- scope [ 0 ]
---*/ var jQuery = jQuery ; //
Speeds up all references to jQuery /*
Do stuff with jQuery */ } ; } ) ( ) ;
With each new scope you ’re getting further and further away from the global scope , so it makes sense to create local variables pointing to global variables ( or any variable higher up in the scope chain ) .
Note that this is only worth doing if you ’re going to be referencing the higher variable more than once in the current scope .
Minimize property access
This is quite an obvious one ; when you ’re going to be retrieving a property more than once you should assign its value to a local variable .
For example , caching a method deepely embedded in an object :
var domGet = YAHOO .
util .
Dom .
get ; var logo = domGet ( ' logo ' ) ; var header = domGet ( ' header ' ) ;
Do as little as possible on each iteration of a loop
Loops are the first thing people consider when on the topic of performance .
There are a few steps you should take to speed up any given loop .
First , if at all possible , use a reverse loop ; doing so means you can combine the control condition and any control variable changes :
/* Forward loop */ var i = 0 ; while ( i < length ) { i ++ ; } /* Reverse loop ( faster ) */ var i = length ; while ( i -- ) { /*
No need to increment ; it 's already been done in the control condition */ }
If you ca n’t use a reverse loop then make sure to do as little as you can get away with on each iteration .
Always cache the length property !
If you ’re concerned about performance then do n’t use iteration - abstractions like jQuery ’s each or ECMA - 262- 5’s Array.forEach ( ) .
Minimise document reflow by only changing the DOM when absolutely necessary
I found this particularly interesting ; whenever you change the DOM , in any way , the document is “ reflowed ” ( i.e. the browser re-draws it ) .
This is something you want to avoid .
As an example , if you want to change a bunch of things within a table you should first remove that table from the DOM ( using parentElement.removeChild ) , make your changes , and then place it back in the DOM .
You can retain a reference to its original previous sibling or parent in order to place it back in the same position :
var table = $ ( ' # some - table ' ) ; var parent = table .
parent ( ) ; table .
remove ( ) ; table .
addLotsAndLotsOfRows ( ) ; parent .
append ( table ) ;
Changing DOM properties or CSS styles will also cause the document to “ reflow ” .
E.g .
j Query ( ' a ' ) . css ( ' color ' , ' red ' ) ; /*
Causes multiple reflows ! */
/* Only causes one reflow */ j Query ( ' < style type =" text /css " > a { color : red ; } </style > ' ) . appendTo ( ' head ' ) ;
I ’m not advocating a new < style > tag for every new style – it ’s just an example .
Another useful technique is to build DOM structures outside of the DOM and then to insert them as one document fragment .
Do n’t use inline styles unless you ’re animating
This is really an extension of the last point ; minimising document reflows .
Instead of applying several styles to many elements just apply a class that ’s already defined somewhere in your CSS .
Ideally inline styles should only be used for animating or for small simple changes .
So , instead of :
j Query ( elements ) . css ( { color : ' red ' , backgroundColor : ' yellow ' , border : ' 3 px solid # 000 ' } ) ;
Do this :
j Query ( elements ) .
addClass ( ' important ' ) ;

Bill Clinton , in a fundraising email for the DCCC :
Friend –
It seems like the 1993 health care debate all over again .
Back then , I led the charge for comprehensive health insurance reform .
I fought tooth and nail to get it done , keenly aware that millions of Americans were living in fear that a serious illness or injury could spell economic disaster for their families .
Americans needed health care reform then and we urgently need it now .
But , just as I did in 1993 , President Obama has run into a buzz saw of special interest opposition to his top domestic policy priority — health care reform .
He is facing off against some of the most powerful special interests in Washington who ’ve launched a furious campaign to preserve the status quo .
Simply put , they ’re at it again .
That ’s why I ’m calling on you to stand with President Obama and the DCCC in fighting for change right now ...
Republicans have made a political calculation that they ’d rather attack Congressional Democrats with sound bites and misleading characterizations of the President ’s health care reform plan than work on behalf of the American people .
It ’s up to us to prevent the Republican Party and their special interest backers from doing whatever they can to prevent this historic opportunity to make quality health care affordable and accessible to all .
Sounds great !
Except that first of all , there 's nothing Republicans can do in the House to stop health care reform .
All roadblocks to reform are coming from inside the Democratic caucus -- the Blue Dogs who are flirting with Republicans in order to extract concessions watering down the House version of health care reform .
And it should be clear -- DCCC money would go to Blue Dogs -- you know , those guys who have been threatening to make common cause with Republicans to water down or outright kill health care reform .
Look at who overlaps the DCCC's " Frontline " program of endangered congressional Democrats with the Blue Dog 's membership list : Arcuri , Boswell , Bright , Carney , Childers , Dahlkember , Giffords , Griffith , Hill ( leadership ) , Kratovil , Mitchell , Nye , and Space .
That 's your dollars , raised supposedly to help health care reform , going to the anti-health care reform Blue Dog coalition .
The DCCC email is disingenuous at best .
Remember , Democrats have the White House and dominant majorities in Congress .
Any problems passing a health care bill are self - inflicted .
Were the tables reversed , Republicans would n't have any problem pushing through their agenda unimpeded by an irrelevant minority .

When you come across two Gods creating universes from scratch , it can be worthwhile to compare their approaches .
Our perspective on Home is , by now , well known .
My mother always said that if I “ ca n’t say something nice about an extensible multi-user environment , I should n’t say anything at all ” - but they make it very difficult not to have an opinion on their service .
Because this troubled realm lies at the very knot of a hundred disparate interests , the experience is fractured quite out of necessity .
Every aesthetic from every major brand must have some place at the table , and those “ games ” which do poke through the gloom are heavily rationed , lackadaisical , or most likely both .
They ’ve consistently said that Home is a great place to meet other gamers , but I ’ve been meeting gamers inside games since the dawn of the consumer Internet , and it seems to have worked pretty well .
Home is a ridiculously complex solution in search of a problem .
Contrived is the word .
To contrast , 1 vs 100 gave me something to do with my avatar that felt , well , real : it took the little guy that I skip past in my Dashboard and it gave him a context .
Your primary method of interaction is not traversal , as it is in Home - you interact with it by playing a game .
There is no “ not play ” option , and there ’s no twisted , Soviet rationing of play like that proposed by the Sony offering .
They both have ads , but one has ads in the form of commercial breaks , and one commands the player to literally exist inside an advertisement .
In essence , 1 vs 100 showed what Home could be .
Which I think we can all agree is very weird .

If the U.S. wasn ” t already insolvent , I ” d say that Obama was bankrupting the country , and sending the health care we have to hell in a handcart , for the ostensible benefit of less than ten percent of the population .
But the U.S. is already in the red , courtesy of the current president and his predecessor .
According to the Census Bureau report , “  Income , Poverty , and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States : 2007 “ ³ ( p. 20 ) , in 2007 , the number of children under 18 years old without health insurance was 8.1 million .
Uninsured , non-Hispanic
Whites stood at 20.5 million .
At 7.4 million , the number of uninsured Blacks was not statistically different from 2006 .
The number of uninsured Hispanics came to 14.8 million .
The reported numbers ” between 46 and 50 million ” are inflated .
If CBS News says so , you can believe it .
The figures factor in illegal aliens and many who already avail themselves of programs for the poor .
Children , for instance .
Obama has only just expanded the entitlement plan known as the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program , or SCHIP .
For the correct number of uninsured subtract the SCHIP - covered kids and another 20 million illegal aliens still in the country .
( Although fewer Mexicans are entering the U.S. , illegal aliens are not repatriating to Mexico , despite the economic depression , reports the Washington Independent . )
Large - scale wealth destruction in the purported service of the few ” does that sound familiar ?
Last year , a bumbling Bush bailed out and nationalized large sections of the financial sector because of a few million bad mortgages .
For the benefit of these bad debtors , B.O. has since beefed - up Bush ’s initial offering with a $ 75 billion foreclosure relief plan .
Although sources cited by FOX Business estimate “ that up to 6 million homes could be lost to foreclosure in the current economic crisis , ”  so far approximately four million loans have gone under , out of a total of 44.4 million mortgages countrywide .
Heavily concentrated in California and Florida ” thirty percent of mortgages in the Golden State and the Sunshine State are in “ a negative equity position , ” or underwater ”  the beneficiaries of affirmative - action loans currently being foreclosed upon are hardly numerous .
Next are Texas , Georgia , and Michigan .
That ’s it .
The rest of the country is paying its bills ” and theirs , by the looks of it .
Because of the State - mandated spoils system for minorities , and thanks to the mediation of the governing lunatics , the entire country is being shoved like lemmings into the economic abyss .
Blue - Dog Democrats have accepted the plan to total healthcare for the few uninsured .
The cynically titled “ American Affordable Health Choices Act Of 2009 , ”  disgorged by the lower chamber , will lumbers through the upper chamber ” specifically the Senate ’s Finance Committee ” and will be approved subject to tiny tweaks .
The “ compromise ”  over this unaffordable , choice - denying medical monstrosity will entail fewer coercive measures and minor cost - saving cuts ( or rationing ) ” $ 900 billion instead of 1 trillion over 10 years .
The name of The Thing will be changed .
“  Co-ops , ”  however , will offer a good deal of co-optation and not many options .
Those who ” re smitten by B.O. ’s Svengali - style hypnotism will welcome the news that he and the secretary of Health and Human Services will be running their cozy “ co-op . ”  
The aggregated wisdom of men acting freely in the market place accounts for the cornucopia Americans take for granted .
This abundance does not preclude affordable health insurance .
For six dollars a day , the baying Boobus can purchase pretty comprehensive coverage , no deductibles or screening for pre-existing conditions .
The average immoral dolt , however , prefers to spend the meager sum on a six - pack and hope that others will be coerced into covering his care .
The uninsured will multiply , not for any other reason than that unemployment is rising ( the borders are still flung wide open and no attrition among illegal immigrants is in sight ) .
Lose your job , and you lose your health - care coverage .
The Census Bureau survey on health insurance coverage for 2008 , to be released in September of this year , will , no doubt , confirm the unyielding trend .
Yet instead of creating the conditions for jobs in the private economy , Obama has chosen , Chicago style , to kneecap job creators .
How so ?
The lavish healthcare expansion , notes the New York Times , would be paid for in part “ by raising $ 544 billion over the next decade with a graduated income surtax on the wealthiest Americans : families with adjusted gross incomes exceeding $ 350,000 and individuals making more than $ 280,000 . ” 
Who exactly are those earning half a million to a million depreciated dollars ?
Rare are the employees who garner such wages in the corporate world , outside of Wall Street .
The rich entrepreneur ”   the middle - class , small business owner ”  that ’s who Obama is looking to filch without flinching .
Yet , the constitutionality of singling out a distinct segment of society ”   the productive ” for punishment is never so much as raised .
The only consideration that seems to counts is , “  How many Americans want it ? ” 
It so happens that attainder laws are unconstitutional ( Article 1 , Sections 9 and 10 ) .
Our high - minded messiah has no authority or right to punish this ( innocent ) group of people without the benefit of due process .
And indeed , this immoral drive will miscarry .
Penalizing the productive will cause them to go into hiding like a tortoise in its shell .
New Design Integrates Wind Turbines Into Transmission Towers
July 6th , 2009 by Timothy B. Hurst
Concept incorporates vertical - axis wind turbines directly into transmission towers already dotting the landscape .
Three Frenchmen , architects Nic­ola Delon and Julien Choppin , along with engineer Raphaël Ménard , believe they have stumbled upon a scalable design that would not only allow wind turbines to work in virtually any landscape , they believe it avoids some of the aesthetic hurdles normally facing large wind farms .
The Wind - it concept would fuse vertical - axis wind turbines directly into new or existing electricity transmission infrastructure .
[ social_buttons ]
The team estimates that if a third of France ’s high - voltage electricity towers were renovated with turbines , they could rival the power generation of two nuclear reactors , or about 5 percent of the country ’s energy needs .
Making its public debut in May 2007 as part of an exhibition about energy and design sponsored by the national utility Électricité de France , the Wind - it concept more recently garnered attention when featured in Metropolis Mag ’s 2009 Next Generation contest .
“ There are half a million pylons already in France , ” engineer Ménard says .
“ If you look to other countries , there are tens of millions .
Even if the power is tiny , as soon as you integrate it like that , it creates big , big energy . ”
While praising it , technical experts who judged the design expressed some concerns .
“ There ’s a slight naïveté about wind power ’s potential in the design , “ says Chris Garvin , a partner with the environmental consultancy Terrapin Bright Green , “ but it ’s compelling nonetheless . ”
Electricity towers are n’t built to accommodate the vibration and stress produced by wind turbines , so existing structures would likely require a magnitude of structural reinforcement likely to make retrofitting of existing towers cost - prohibitive .

I 've seen my fair share of insane buildings over the years but I reckon I just stumbled across one of the strangest yet in the form of a Chinese hotel .
What 's also interesting is that , to my knowledge , very few English speaking websites have seen or mentioned what has got to be one of the most bizarre pieces of hotel architecture on Earth .
Without further ado , I give you Tianzi Hotel ...

To begin , this incredible hotel seems to have a few different names depending on what you read , as far as I can tell it has been known as : Tianzi Hotel , The Emperor Hotel , Son Of Heaven Hotel , and , in Chinese , å¤©å­å¤§é …’ .
The hotel is located in Hebei Province and according to Chinese architecture blog CAIP it was built some time around 2000 / 2001 , The building is 10 storeys / 41.6 m high and was designed to represent Fu Lu Shou ( good fortune , prosperity and longevity ) .
The blog also points out that the hotel won a Guiness World Record for being the world 's ' biggest image building ' .
Largest mimetic building perhaps ?
Finally , you 'll notice that Shou , the chap on the left as you face the hotel , is holding what is apparently a peach .
That peach is actually a suite within the hotel , the two holes in its front being windows .
Searching for the hotel on Google Maps proved to be extremely frustrating , but thankfully after much scrolling I found the building .
Here it is .

All in all , a ridiculously designed hotel that could only be eclipsed by something unimaginably odd .
South Korean intelligence authorities believe that a photo of purportedly showing North Korean leader Kim Jong -il on an inspection of the command of the 7th Infantry Division on June 14 was really taken during a visit to the 851st Unit on April 25 .
Intelligence forces are on alert in case that means that Kim 's health has deteriorated again .
North Korea released a group photo of Kim accompanied by Kim Yong - chun , minister of the People 's Armed Forces , and Kim Jong - gak , first vice - director of the General Political Department of the KPA , to illustrate a story that he visited the 851st Unit on the 77th anniversary of the army on April 25 .

The photo was released on June 14 by the official KCNA news agency to accompany a story on the visit , but it mentions no date .
The positions of people in the two photos except five or six soldiers at both ends of the front row are identical to the earlier picture , as are the ceiling lamps and the words in the placard in the backdrop .
Kim Yong - chun , who is standing on Kim 's right , was apparently in China around June 13 .
A Cheong Wa Dae official said it was " very strange " that Kim is wearing winter clothes in the photo allegedly taken on June 14 .

Both the 7th Infantry Division , which Kim allegedly visited in June , and the 851st Unit , which he allegedly inspected in April , are near Anbyon - gun in Wonsan , an intelligence officer said .
" It 's possible that North Korea put different dates to visits to the two military units at similar times . "
The Unification Ministry said Kim went on 77 field inspections and so - called on - the - spot guidance trips since early this year , up from 50 in the same period last year .
Prof. Nam Joo-hong of Kyonggi University said , " If No rth Korea reused the same photo again to make it look as if Kim were in good health , it shows that the regime is unstable . "
A North Korea expert said the manipulations could add credence to speculation that North Korea 's current international grandstanding is part of efforts to tighten the regime 's hold at home as Kim Jong - il 's health deteriorates .

Rays pursuing Tribe ace Cliff Lee ?
According to a report by Jon Paul Morosi of FOX Sports.com , the Indians are apparently considering trading ace Cliff Lee to the Rays for a couple of minor league prospects .
Who those prospects are , however , seem to be the sticking point in Tampa pulling the trigger .
The article reports that Cleveland GM Mark Shapiro is asking for multiple high - end prospects in return for Lee , and that Shapiro specifically has his eyes set on Class AAA Durham pitcher Wade Davis .
But the Rays value Davis , who is 8 - 6 with a 3.22 ERA in the minors this season and has a fastball that reaches 95 mph .
Along with Davis , we ’re also hearing rumblings that the Tribe want 22 - year - old outfield prospect Desmond Jennings as part of the package for Lee .
Much like some of the other outfielders ( i.e. Carl Crawford and B.J. Upton ) that have come up through Tampa ’s farm system , Jennings is big , strong and incredibly fast , but he ’s raw and he would need some more polishing in the minors before eventually making his major league debut .
It ’ll be interesting to see if the Rays and Indians can come together on a trade for Lee and what the eventual compensation would be .
Considering Scott Kazmir ’s performance / injury troubles this season , Lee would be a tremendous addition to their rotation and could help close the gap between them and the Yankees and Red Sox .
The stories of Massa ’s accident three days have been everywhere .
But how much do we really understand about how hard a blow Massa suffered when he was struck by that spring ?
F1 Fanatic guest writer Kareem Shaya tries to put the crash into perspective .
In all the discussion of Felipe Massa ’s qualifying accident at the Hungarian Grand Prix , there have been few real efforts to quantify what happened .
Massa was hit hard enough to be knocked out and suffer a fractured skull , and that ?
������s essentially all we know .
So let ? ������s figure it out .
How bad is it , exactly , if an 800 - gram coil spring hits you in the head at 160 mph ?
The punch it packs is worse than being shot .
Bullets are deadly because they penetrate the body , but in terms of kinetic energy , most don ?
������t hold a candle to what hit Massa .
Below is a list of kinetic energies of common projectiles .
The bullet energies assume point - blank range ( and are calculated using numbers from Alpine Armoring ) .
All the energies are calculated using the old kinetic energy =
1/2 * mass * velocity ^2 formula you learned in school .
– 100 mph fastball from Nolan Ryan : 145 joules
– Barry Bonds ?������ swing ( 33 oz . bat at 70 mph ) : 458 joules
– 9 mm handgun : 513 joules
– .44 Magnum handgun : 1,510 joules
– The spring that hit Massa ( 800 grams at 160 mph ) : 2,046 joules
– AK - 47 ( 7.62 mm round ) : 2,599 joules
– 12 gauge shotgun slug : 3,580 joules
– The wheel that killed Henry Surtees ( an estimated 12 kg at 120 mph ) : 17,267 joules
Before we talk about those figures , it ’s worth remembering that the Massa and Surtees accidents were real - world situations , and as such , the numbers above may be imprecise .
Massa was moving at 160 mph , but if the spring was traveling at high speed in the same direction as his Ferrari , or if it ricocheted off of his car before striking him , the estimate of 2,046 joules will be too high .
If , for instance , we change the spring ’s collision speed to 120 mph , its kinetic energy drops about 44 % to a still - frightening 1,151 joules .
The same caveats apply to the figures on Henry Surtees ’ accident .
Please suggest any adjustments in the comments .
With that in mind , let ’s consider the baseball examples .
Bullets focus their energy on a tiny area , which is why they would penetrate something like a driver ?
������s helmet .
The contact patch of a baseball or a bat , by contrast , would be close to that of a coil spring , and that makes for some shocking comparisons .
By the numbers above , Massa would have been 14 times better off being hit by Nolan Ryan fastball .
He would have been four times better off letting Barry Bonds take a full - force swing at his head .
For that matter , in terms of sheer energy , he ’d have been better off letting Barry Bonds hit him in the head at the same instant that someone shot him point - blank with Dirty Harry ’s gun .
It ? ������s simply incredible that a helmet can turn that into a survivable injury , but the massive energy of Henry Surtees ?
������ accident ?
������ nearly five times that of a 12 gauge shotgun slug and more than eight times worse than the blow to Massa ’s head ?
������ reminds us that there ?
������s a limit to the protection that one or two inches of padding can provide .
Being hit in the head with a wheel moving at race speeds is easily deadly , helmet or no helmet .
If the same thing causes a death in F1 ’s future , the result may well be a rush to implement closed cockpits .
And if that day should come , let ? ������s not pretend to have learned something we didn ?
������t already know today .
Cockpit covers may or may not make sense , but if we are against them now , we shouldn ?
������t be waiting for a death to change our minds .
Update from Keith :
We have had further good news about Massa ’s condition today , including a quote from one doctor who confirmed the driver has now opened his left eye and can see .
The doctor described it as “ morphologically healthy ” , indicating the eye is healthy and has integrity , with no tissue damage .
This raises hopes that he may be able to return to the cockpit in the future .

@ripfire :
I can see by your recent illogical reply to fuzz 54 that you will just continue to debate your ignorance in an attempt to prove that you 're right .
Therefore I will refrain from getting into a long seeded debate with you on the topic considering it is less than trivial and irrelevant to the post .
However , for the sheer enjoyment in ridiculing your naivety , I will say that you are completely and utterly incorrect .
So you copied and pasted the definition of the scientific method from somewhere online .
Big deal .
That , again , had no relevance to your arguing point , nor did it do any good in aiding to back up your statement .
Not to mention anyone born in the last 50 years was taught the scientific method since middle school .
Then , to top it all off , your second comment :
" I 'm sorry , but you 're understanding of science is just bothering me .. I can't even think straight anymore ! "
just further added to making you look like an ignorant jack ass .
First off , grow up .
Secondly , read a book .
Now , the education part : the entire article is in fact based off the hypothesis that any of this actually exists or could be done .
Hypothesis and theory are two totally different words that often get misconstrued to have the same meaning , which is what you did .
Now , instead of googling the definition of the scientific method , google the definition of the actual points you are arguing which are hypothesis and theory .
Then you might actually learn something and become an educated contributing factor to society .

A basic problem for wind turbines is that the wind often dies down .
As a result , they produce far less electricity than if the wind blew constantly , at full speed .
A good wind machine , therefore , may harvest just 30 percent of its maximum potential energy .
By contrast , a nuclear reactor with a similar energy rating might reach 90 percent of its maximum potential , because it is running virtually nonstop .
One major turbine manufacturer , Siemens Energy , is trying to increase the proportion of potential energy that the wind harvests — by making the blades longer .
The new machines , by Siemens , all use the common three - blade design .
But a new Siemens turbine has a rotor diameter of about 330 feet , rather than one with a 305 - foot diameter .
The “ swept area ” — the circle of air from which the machine captures energy — is therefore about 18 percent bigger .
When the wind blows strongly the longer blades make no difference , because the size of the turbine ’s generator is unchanged .
At moderate speeds , the output goes up .
At 17 miles an hour , for example , Siemens says that the larger blades produce about 7.5 percent more electricity than those with smaller blades .
They do not spin faster , but they extract more energy from the passing air .
This approach may be especially good in spots where the wind is relatively weak , according to Michael B. Revak , vice president of sales at Siemens .
But it has its limits .
One problem is that as the blades get longer , it gets harder to move them from factory to hilltop .
Longer blades are also more expensive to manufacture .
There are already two of the new machines in Washington state , near the Columbia River Gorge .
Another is in Denmark , and two more are scheduled for use by Minnesota Power over the next few years .
Dare I say it ?
This is a refreshing use of network technology .
Add a Windows CE touchscreen , fancy " microdosing " technology and a network connection to a Coca - Cola machine and you get a the next " must have " soda fountain device .
A company called Bsquare has worked with Coca - Cola to create the Coke Freestyle machine , a device that whips up 100 custom sodas for you , using a touchscreen interface and a backlink to soda maker 's network ( and recipe book ) .
The Freestyle machine uses highly concentrated ingredients and the software mixes these together based on microdosing recipes .
The result is more than 100 different types of beverages served without the need for a back room full of giant canisters .
Because the device is connected directly to Coca - Cola ’s network , it can be managed remotely .
Restaurant operators can order new supplies based on demand consumption trends and Coca - Cola can track sales and diagnose equipment issues .
The network can also help handle routine stuff , like downloading new artwork for new selections directly into the unit 's display area .
The dispenser is aimed at the restaurant market , not the home consumer ( although , maybe this is the next big gift for the home theater room that has everything else ? ) .
Freestyle is being tested in various markets in the United States .
About signaling conditions in Common Lisp , Nikodemus Siivola writes :
Use #'ERROR to signal conditions inheriting from SERIOUS - CONDITION .
This includes all subclasses or ERROR .
SERIOUS - CONDITION is a convention that means " this will land you in the debugger if not handled " , which is what #'ERROR ensures .
Inherit from ERROR if unwinding from the error leaves the system in a consistent state .
Subclasses of ERROR mean " oops , we have a problem , but it 's OK to unwind . "
if unwinding from the error leaves the system in a consistent state .
Subclasses of mean " oops , we have a problem , but it 's OK to unwind . "
Inherit from SERIOUS - CONDITION , not ERROR , if the system is messed up somehow , and / or requires either human intervention or special knowledge about the situation to resolve : SERIOUS - CONDITIONs that are not ERRORs mean that " something is deeply wrong and you should know what you are doing if you are going to resolve this . "
There are two problems with this interpretation .
First , it gives meaning to a difference type : ( and serious - condition ( not error ) ) means something beyond what serious - condition alone means .
You could interpret this as “ serious - condition means we can't continue ; error means we can exit safely ” - but non- serious - condition signals also mean we can exit safely .
So the conditions that can be handled safely are ( and condition ( or ( not serious - condition ) error ) ) .
This complex type is at least a warning sign .
If you want to distinguish recoverable from unrecoverable conditions , should n't one or the other have its own class ?
Second , it 's not what the Hyperspec says .
It defines an error as
a situation in which the semantics of a program are not specified , and in which the consequences are undefined
and a serious condition as
a situation that is generally sufficiently severe that entry into the debugger should be expected if the condition is signaled but not handled .
These are n't the most lucid definitions , but the idea is that serious - condition means the signal can't be ignored , and error means this is because the semantics are undefined .
( and serious - condition ( not error ) ) , therefore , is a situation where the semantics are defined , but where execution nonetheless cannot continue for some other reason - running out of memory , for instance .
The distinction is n't between well - behaved states and messed - up ones , but between semantic nonsense and other failures .
C++ has an analogous distinction between logic_error , which is the same as CL's error , and runtime_error , which covers the rest of CL 's serious - condition .
( C++ has only terminating exceptions , so it does n't have non-serious conditions . )
I 'm tempted to make more such distinctions , giving something like this :
Nonsense : the program has asked for something undefined , like (+ ' ( hello ) " world ! " ) .
( CL error , C++ logic_error )
You can define a reasonable meaning for most nonsense errors ; they are errors only because their meaning has n't been defined yet .
: the program has asked for something undefined , like .
( CL , C++ )
You can define a reasonable meaning for most nonsense errors ; they are errors only because their meaning has n't been defined yet .
Limitation : the implementation knows what you mean , but can't deliver , e.g. arithmetic overflow or running out of memory .
( R N RS calls this a “ violation of an implementation restriction ” . )
You could consider “ not yet implemented ” to be a limitation as well .
: the implementation knows what you mean , but can't deliver , e.g. arithmetic overflow or running out of memory .
( R RS calls this a “ violation of an implementation restriction ” . )
You could consider “ not yet implemented ” to be a limitation as well .
Environmental failure : the operation failed because the outside world did not cooperate , e.g. a file was not found or a connection was refused .
: the operation failed because the outside world did not cooperate , e.g. a file was not found or a connection was refused .
Forbidden : operations which do have an well - defined meaning , but you 're not allowed to do them , usually for security or safety reasons , e.g. you do n't have permission to unlink ( " / " ) .
In other words , “ I do n't understand ” , “ I can 't ” , “ It 's not working ” , and “ I 'm sorry , Dave .
I 'm afraid I can't do that . ” .
This is a nice taxonomy , but I 'm not sure it 's actually useful .
The problem is that one error often leads to another , and the error that 's detected is n't necessarily the original problem .
For instance , failure to open a nonexistent file ( an environmental failure ) may manifest as a nonsensical attempt to read from an invalid stream .
( CL actually signals it as an error , even though it 's not a semantic error , perhaps for this reason . )
Or a fixed - size buffer ( a limitation ) causes a buffer overflow ( nonsense ) which is eventually detected as a segfault ( a forbidden operation ) .
Why try to distinguish between classes of errors when they 're so fluid ?
Fortunately , programs do n't usually care why they failed , unless it was a certain specific error they were expecting .
IME most exception handlers are either quite broad ( e.g. catching serious - condition near the root of a large computation ) , and recover in generic ways such as aborting , or quite specific ( e.g. catching file - not - found - error on one particular open ) , and attempt to deal with the problem .
There are n't many handlers that try to generalize at intermediate levels , even in languages that support them .
How many of your Twitter followers are spammers ?
That ’s a question that TwitBlock tries to answer by analyzing your network and looking for patterns .
As a result of scanning about 3,000 accounts so far and analyzing more than 100,000 blocks , TwitBlock thinks it ’s come to a few conclusions about who some of Twitter ’s most prolific spammers are – or , at least what their avatars look like .
TwitBlock has found that many spammers use the same avatar across hundreds of accounts .
Not surprisingly , like other social networking spam , the premise seems to be a familiar one : use pictures of attractive people to lure clicks .
The full top 20 is available here [ warning : some of the pictures are NC - 17 in nature ] , and you can click on any of the user ’s profile names to see how it was determined that they were a spammer .
Tell - tale signs according to TwitBlock include a disproportionate follow - back percentage , sharing an avatar with lots of other users , and a high quantity of new follows every day .
I had TwitBlock analyze my network , and it found that about 10 percent of my followers were spam .
I actually thought it might be a bit higher , though Twitter has recently undergone its own efforts to remove spammers ( which is why you may have noticed a drop in follower count ) as well .
Some of those that TwitBlock identified are n’t necessarily spammers , but they are , to say the least , very aggressive users of Twitter .
One thing is clear though : spam remains a significant problem on Twitter , and they ’re still in the early phases of effectively dealing with it .
Five reasons
Vick makes sense for the Eagles
To the surprise of many , the Eagles went out on a limb and signed free agent quarterback Michael Vick to a one - year , $ 1.6 million deal with a $ 5.2 million team option for 2010 .
Below are five reasons why this move makes sense for Philadelphia .
1 . The Eagles are going for broke this season .
This offseason , Philly traded a first round pick to Buffalo in exchange for Pro Bowl offensive tackle Jason Peters and also signed lineman Stacy Andrews .
They also added playmakers Jeremy Maclin and LeSean “ Shady ” McCoy via the draft , so it ’s clear that the Eagles are stocking their roster with as much offensive talent as they can .
Vick was once highly regarded as the best athlete in the NFL and at $ 1.6 million , Philly is willing to take the risk in hopes that they just added even more talent to their brimming roster .
2. The Eagles offer a solid support system .
The Eagles have always been a model organization and they would n’t have made a move like this if they had n’t first consulted Tony Dungy ( who is mentoring Vick ) and weighed all of their options .
Vick leaves a lot to be desired as a human being , but Andy Reid , Joe Banner and Tom Heckert must believe that he can turn around his life and are willing to take him in .
Plus , one would assume that Vick will be on his best behavior and Reid is n’t going to put up with an attitude .
Another key to this situation is Donovan McNabb , who has the respect of his teammates and will certainly take some of the attention away from Vick ’s arrival .
3 . Kolb ’s knee injury maybe worse than the Eagles are letting on .
While Vick does n’t pose a threat to McNabb ’s starting job , he does put pressure on backup Kevin Kolb , who was carted off the practice field at the beginning of the week after spraining his left knee .
While reports state that Kolb should be fine , the signing of Vick may indicate that Philadelphia wants some insurance behind McNabb and Vick , despite his two - year playing absence , was the best QB on the market .
Of course , it ’s entirely conceivable that the Eagles were working on a contract with Vick before Kolb ’s injury , in which case maybe Philly just is n’t that high on Kolb ’s development after two years .
It ’s a shame to think that a team would give up on a 24 - year old former second round pick after just two years ( especially a quarterback ) , but maybe the Eagles just do n’t see much of a future in Kolb .
4. Vick gives Reid options in the offense .
While Vick never fully developed as a passer before being hauled off to prison for 23 months , he was explosive running various formations for Greg Knapp and Jim Mora in Atlanta .
Reid definitely has a more creative offensive mind than Knapp does , so having an athletic talent like Vick at his disposal could be dangerous to opposing teams .
Vick certainly could be a nice fit in the “ Wildcat ” formation and he could allow the Eagles to give opponents various looks from different offensive sets .
In McNabb , Vick , Maclin , McCoy and DeSean Jackson , Philadelphia now has a host of offensive weapons .
5 . The worst - case scenario is n’t that bad .
Let ’s say half way through the season , the Eagles realize they made a huge mistake and that Vick has lost all of his athletic prowess .
So what – they ’ll cut him and move on .
Let ’s say half way through the season Vick gets into trouble off the field .
So what – they ’ll cut him and move on .
If Vick is a distraction in anyway , the Eagles will cut bait , admit the mistake and carry on .
This is a low - risk signing in terms of football and football alone , seeing as how it ’s essentially only a one - year deal .
They ’re only financially tied to Vick for one season so worst case scenario he ’s gone in a year .
The upside ( again , in terms of football ) is much better than the downside .
That said , the Eagles risked alienating their fan base with a move like this , although it ’s a risk they ’ll gladly take if Vick can somehow contribute to a Super Bowl berth .

Although even the best - connected users can't get their hands on Windows 7's final code until Aug.
6 , people willing to pirate the new operating system can download it today from several file - sharing sites , searches show .
Build 7600.16385 , which Microsoft declared as Windows 7 RTM , or " release to manufacturing , " earlier Wednesday , leaked to the Internet almost a week ago .
On the BitTorrent tracking site Mininova.org , for example , that build first appeared July 16 .
According to the filename on Mininova , the build was compiled July 13 .
Not surprisingly , the first edition of the build to hit BitTorrent was a 64 - bit Chinese edition .
That same day , English - language versions of the 32 - and 64 - bit popped up on Mininova .
Since then , other language editions have appeared , including German , Hungarian and Italian .
Microsoft has not been able to plug the leaks of Windows 7 .
Last October , just hours after the company unveiled the first public build to attendees at its Professional Developers Conference , the alpha hit BitTorrent .
Since then , the OS has leaked repeatedly , including prior to the public beta of January 2009 and the release candidate of May .
But while pirates grab the final bits -- more than 5,000 copies of the English editions posted on Mininovalast week have been downloaded -- legitimate users must wait two weeks for the new operating system .
According to the roll - out schedule Microsoft announced yesterday , developers and IT professionals who subscribe to the MSDN or TechNet services will have first dibs on Windows 7 RTM only on Aug .
6 .
Consumers , on the other hand , must be even more patient :
They wo n't receive their pre-ordered copies of Windows 7 , or be able to buy new PCs with it pre-installed , until Oct. 22 .
Windows 7 retail prices run from $ 119.99 to $ 219.99 for upgrades , and from $ 199.99 to $ 319.99 for full - package editions .

CARACAS ( Reuters ) - Venezuelan lawmakers are moving to outlaw the sale of violent videogames and toys in an attempt to fight rampant crime in the country .
A bill to ban sales of violent games has passed its first hurdle in the National Assembly , the legislative chamber said in a statement issued on Wednesday .
Dozens of people are murdered every week in the capital Caracas , one of Latin America ’s most dangerous cities , sometimes for as little as a pair of shoes or a mobile phone .
Opponents of President Hugo Chavez say 100,000 people have been murdered since he assumed office in February 1999 .
The government says its opponents and Venezuela ’s private media exaggerate the problem .
Police release crime statistics irregularly and officials frequently say they do not know how many homicides have taken place .
To become law , the bill must pass a second vote in the National Assembly and be signed by Chavez .
The National Assembly has not set a date for a second vote .
Some countries ban violent videogames and many restrict their sale to children .
Although few studies have shown that such games cause aggressive tendencies , they have often been the subject of controversy .

Ah , disgusting habits , almost all of us have them , yet nobody wants to talk about them .
These are things that most people do , but few will admit .
We ’re here to tell you that it really is n’t that bad , and there are reasons why you are compelled to do these things .
We ’ll even teach you what to say when you get caught , but first we ’re going to wash our hands , we feel a bit dirty .
1. Nose picking
Look at that .
Just look at it .
It ’s disgusting , is n’t it ?
And that ’s just a raisin .
Now we understand that it itches , and it looks unpleasant , so you have to dig it out ; but why use your fingers ?
Do you also sift through your crap with your hands when you ’re done taking a dump ?
Exactly .
Nose picking is unhygienic and uncivilized , can lead to infections , and sometimes , even death .
Plus , ew .
It really is n’t that bad …
Studies have shown that nose picking is universal , and that the vast majority of us often study — and sometimes eat — the boogies afterwards .
The average person picks their nose four times a day , with about 1 in 500 people spend half an hour a day picking their nose ( but those guys are sick ) .
But why ?
Nose picking actually has health benefits .
The boogers are obviously supposed to come out , and a finger is a lot more flexible than anything else .
Dangers are also greatly exaggerated ; the nerves in your nose are far too high up for you to reach , so the worst you could normally do is get a nose bleed .
Eating your boogers can boost your immune system .
The nose is just a filter in which bacteria is collected .
Eating the bacteria is just like medicine .
And guess what ?
Nose picking ( and eating ) is evolutionary !
That ’s right .
Monkeys have been caught picking their nose .
In fact , real scientists ( see : Wikipedia ) say that the trait first developed 20 million years ago , right after the hominoids ( that ’s us ) diverged from Old World monkeys .
In other words , nose picking is what set us apart .
… and there ’s more !
Why though ?
Many reasons .
First , boogies are nutritious and food was scarce .
Starving , our ancestors began eating their snot .
So why are n’t we still eating our boogies today ?
It ’s because the more they picked their noses , the larger their nostrils grew , and as a result , their smell senses were heightened .
Soon , they would use their sense of smell to become capable hunters .
Back then , our nostril capacity was about 5 cubic centimeters .
Now , it ’s nearly doubled to 9.2 .
As the monkeys evolved , the nostrils grew bigger .
So keep picking your nose .
The future depends on it .
What to say if caught in the act :
I ’m only doing it because like , nose size and monkeys are like , correlation .
Like , what it means to human .
And stuff .
2. Urinating in the shower
Honestly , it ’s baffling .
The toilet is barely a few feet away , and yet you choose to pee in the shower ; knowing that the urine will most likely touch your feet .
Seriously .
Next , you ’ll be wearing diapers , to completely save yourself the arduous trip to and from the bathroom .
It really is n’t that bad …
Pretty much every dude does this , but what about the females ?
We all know males are slobs but females ?
That ’s right .
Even our attractive female friends pee in the shower .
If you think about it , urine is actually clean .
We ’re not suggesting you drink your pee ( do it . ) , but unless you have an unusual diet , the pH of urine is neutral .
And besides , urine is able to kill fungus — in other words , peeing in the shower might save you from having athlete ’s foot .
… and there ’s more !
Truth is , it ’s not your fault .
Being surrounded by water ( even in a shower ) causes immersion dieresis and homeostatis .
In layman terms , the pressure of the water around you directly affects your blood pressure ; which will elicit measures to bring it back to normal , like peeing .
The hot temperature of the water may also contribute : urination releases some of your body heat .
And besides , when you shower , there ’s a very strong visual and auditory connection .
The warm flow of water gushing out the nozzle ; the constant “ shhhhh ” sound that surrounds you as the stream hits the porcelain tub …
And , of course , after you ’ve peed in the shower enough times , and you ’ve pretty much lost all human decency , your brain will begin to associate shower time with pee pee time , which also explains why you only feel the need as soon as the water begins to flow .
What to say if caught in the act :
PERVERT !
3. Schadenfreude
Schadenfreude is the German word for the joy we get at other people ’s suffering .
In English , the closest we have is morbid curiosity .
So it ’s why we click on 2 Girls1 Cup , despite knowing how disgusting it is .
It ’s also why subconsciously , we slow our cars or turn our heads when we see a traffic accident or an ambulance .
And honestly , you should feel ashamed .
Seeking out pain and suffering just to satisfy your twisted appetite .
It really is n’t that bad …
Honestly , most of us do n’t do it because we enjoy other people ’s pain .
Social comparison comes into play : when people around us are suffering , we look better .
Given a choice , would you rather be standing next to Adonis , or Urkel ?
… and there ’s more !
The insular cortex part of our brain is particularly active during times to disgust .
It is also the part responsible for addiction and strong feelings .
Basically , it is the eff you part of your body .
So , you can quite easily get hooked to it — as seen by the millions of people who obsessively follow celebrity gossip and love it when someone famous crashes and burns .
Studies have also shown that looking at someone who is in pain activates the same neural mechanisms in pleasure .
So , humanity is pretty screwed .
What to say if caught in the act :
Hey !
Come on , show some compassion .
I just wanted to see if the passengers are okay .
Hey !
Come on , I just wanted to see if the girls have enough fiber in their diet .
4. Wound licking
You probably do n’t even notice , but whenever you cut or maybe injure your hand , you ’ll instantly put it to your mouth and suck on it .
It ’s disgusting and undignified .
You might also make it worse — wound licking on the thumb has resulted in amputation .
It really is n’t that bad …
Surprisingly , saliva contains several useful chemical compounds .
A simple protein called histatin are well - known for staving off infection , and a recent discovery in Amsterdam shows that it also helps close the wound ( almost two times faster ) .
Saliva also acts as an analgesic , which reduces pain .
Basically , it ’s everything you could ever want in your mouth .
… and wait there ’s more !
The fact that you instantly lick a wound should tell you that it is instinctive , and therefore most likely evolutionary .
Wound licking originally started as a form of zoopharmacognosy , or animal self - meditation .
Despite all this , licking someone else ’s wound ( especially if it ’s a scraped knee ) , like an Oregon teacher did , is probably a bad idea , and pretty gross .
What to say if caught in the act :
* suck *
5. Fart Smelling
Like Fat Bastard from Austin Powers said , “ Everybody likes their own scent . ”
This is n’t just limited to farts .
Studies have shown that your own B.O. , burps , and sometimes even poop smells appealing .
Nah , we ’re just kidding .
You ’re the only person who thinks so , you sicko .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The long - battered U.S. job market showed some signs of improvement in July as employers cut far fewer jobs from payrolls and the unemployment rate fell for the first time in more than a year , according to a government report Friday .
The Labor Department reported a net loss of 247,000 jobs in July , the fewest job losses since August 2008 .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com had forecast a loss of 325,000 .
The job loss in June was also revised lower -- to 443,000 job losses from 467,000 .
The unemployment rate fell to 9.4 % from 9.5 % in June , the first decline in that closely watched reading since April of 2008 .
Economists had expected unemployment to rise to 9.6 % .
The unemployment rate fell even as employers continued to cut jobs because the Labor Department estimated there were 237,000 fewer people it counted as unemployed .
That decline in the labor force can be due to discouraged job seekers who have stopped looking for work , people who now consider themselves retired or those have gone back to school rather than applying for jobs .
" You can't lose jobs and have the unemployment rate decline unless folks are opting out , " said Tig Gilliam , CEO of Adecco Group North America , a unit of the world 's largest employment staffing firm .
" That means unemployment is going to go back up again . "
There were other signs of improvement in the report , however .
The average hourly work week edged up to 33.1 hours , from a record low of 33.0 hours in June .
The number of workers who wanted full - time work but could only find part - time jobs fell by 191,000 , or 2 % .
That suggests that many workers who had their hours cut or were given unpaid days off in the current downturn are going back to full - time status .
But there was also plenty of bad news to be found in the report .
The number of people unemployed for more than six months continued to rise , reaching nearly 5 million people , a record high .
The average time that an unemployed person has been out of work reached 25.1 weeks , the highest reading in the 61 years that this has been tracked by the Labor Department .
The Labor Department also said that one reason for the declining number of job losses was because cuts had been so deep leading up to July that there were fewer workers to lay off during the seasonal shutdown that happens in some factories , such as those in the auto industry .
Since the start of 2008 , 6.7 million jobs have been lost in the U.S. Several economists said that while the report confirms other economic readings suggesting that the recession may be ending , it 's too soon to predict a sharp gain in jobs in the near term .
" The dawn of an economic recovery is here , " said Sung Won Sohn , a professor of economics at Cal State University Channel Islands .
" The economy is in the process of bottoming , but the job market will lag behind .
Businesses , which engaged in preemptive layoffs earlier , are not about to start hiring people . "
Mark Vitner , senior economist at Wells Fargo , agreed that job losses are likely to continue into early next year , with unemployment eventually rising to about 10 % to 10.5 % .
He said the fact that unusual extended shutdowns in auto plants distorted these seasonally - adjusted numbers .
" We 're not ready to break out the champagne , " he said .
" There 's less improvement than meets the eye . "
Gilliam also does n't expect to see overall job gains until late this year at the earliest .
" The glass is both half empty and half full in this report , " said Gilliam .
But Robert Brusca of FAO
Economics said he believes there is more strength in the job market than many people are willing to acknowledge .
He said that the government may even report an overall payroll gain for August next month .
" There is nothing about these numbers that suggest it 's a fluke , " he said .
More jobs were lost in July in the manufacturing and construction sectors as well as in the retail and business and professional services industries .
But there were net gains in the education , health care and leisure hospitality sectors .
Government employers also added jobs .
Average hourly wages edged up 3 cents an hour , to $ 18.56 .
That increase , combined with a slightly longer work week , lifted average weekly wages by 0.5 % .
But that still left weekly wages only 1 % higher than they were a year ago , little better than the 0.9 % rise posted for June .
That increase was which the smallest increase in paychecks in 23 years .

Getting a Toll - Free Number for Your Small Business
Toll - free 800 numbers .
We see them all the time .
Television ads selling products flash them at the bottom of the screen .
If you look at the back of your credit card , you ’ll probably find one there , too .
Most corporations have a toll - free number for customer service assistance , whereas others have them for automated services such as checking a balance on a gift card .
But how do small businesses actually go about getting a toll - free number ?
It is n’t as hard as you might think , and it could benefit your small business greatly .
In the U.S. , the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) regulates toll - free numbers .
Subscribers sign up as “ responsible organizations , ” or RespOrgs for short .
Numbers generally get assigned on a first - come , first - served basis .
The concept of the toll - free number has been around since the 1960s , with “ 800 ” being the first toll - free code established .
Today , toll - free numbers in use begin with either 800 , 888 , 877 , 866 , 855 , 844 , or 833 .
Consumers are not charged for these calls ; instead , the business pays for a service plan that covers the charge for the calls .
Of course , your business phone service provider may automatically give you a toll - free number , but it may not based on your service package .
A toll - free 800 number might be perfect for your small business because it will show consumers that your business is legitimate and established as opposed to a tiny , not well - respected business .
If your small business does business nationally or ships products to other states and even countries , a toll - free number will also come in handy in other areas , as it does n’t give consumers the impression that your small business is simply local and only tied to a specific city or state .
Most of us have seen ads for 1 -800 - FLOWERS and if you ’ve ever contacted FedEx , you may have called 1 - 800 - GoFedEx .
Toll - free numbers that contain a word or phrase are known as vanity toll - free numbers .
These are “ catchy ” and easier for consumers to remember as opposed to a string of numbers .
If you want a vanity toll - free number , the service you decide to use will let you search for the word or phrase you are wanting .
If it is not already in use , the service will allow you to have that number .
Vanity Toll Free Phone Numbers
A vanity number can be very useful to your small business because it is a rememberable , identifiable word or phrase that consumers can easily recognize .
Whether consciously or subconsciously , consumers prefer to buy from businesses they recognize , so opting for a vanity toll - free number can work towards increasing your bottom line and promoting your brand .
As you might expect , vanity numbers are normally more costly than “ normal ” toll - free numbers .
You may have also heard of the term “ virtual number , ” which may sound like a fake number but is actually quite the opposite .
A virtual number , which can be a toll - free number , is connected to an online account as opposed to just one phone or mobile device .
This allows the virtual number to be used across multiple devices and platforms to increase productivity and flexibility .
With most services , virtual numbers can both text message and call .
Virtual numbers are extremely useful because there is no “ geographical boundary ” and can be used anywhere within a country .
As with normal toll - free numbers , virtual numbers are quite easy to obtain – maybe even easier .
Just pick an affordable service plan that is perfect for your small business and sign up with your information .
These days , most providers get you registered and active quickly , meaning you can pick your toll - free number and start using it the same day .
Depending on your service , your toll - free number may come with a lot of great features .
Many providers offer call forwarding , meaning a consumer calling your toll - free number will be directed to a phone of your choice ( i.e. your personal cell phone ) so you can ensure you wo n’t miss an important call .
Some have voicemail - to - email features so you will receive an email transcript of voicemails left on your toll - free number ’s mailbox and therefore do not have to sit and listen to dozens of voicemails on your toll - free line .
Many providers allow call blocking to prevent certain numbers from dialing in , and most providers offer call notes and histories so that you can keep track of callers and trends .
This will block out spam calls while allowing you to download and analyze data of who is calling you so that you can pick up on sales leads and other useful information .
Real time analysis can be extremely useful for small businesses – especially startups – and is critical to their success .
Some providers offer interactive voice response technology , meaning consumers will reach an automated system first that will better help direct the call to you or whoever it should go to .
Many also have on - hold music and / or the ability to record voice messages for callers to listen to while waiting for you or someone else to answer the phone .
The cost of toll - free numbers varies greatly .
If your small business does not plan on using many minutes and does n’t need fancy features and options , you may find a plan for as little as $ 10 a month .
If you need hundreds of thousands of minutes per month , which most small businesses do not , your monthly price could rise to thousands of dollars .
Some services offer plans with a pre-set number of minutes that come with overtime fees , whereas others base your price on a pay - per- minute basis .
Other services , such as CallHippo , allow you to customize a plan that is right for your small business .
So how should you go about getting a toll - free number for your business ?

There are dozens to choose from , but some of the most popular are outlined below .

If your small business is a startup , Kall8 might be a good fit for you .
If you ’re looking for a vanity number , you can search for an available one right away .

1-800 - FLOWERS and 1-888-NEW -CARS are good examples .
To find out whether a specific 800 number is available , contact any 800 service provider .
How Does an 800 Number Work and How Do I Get One ?
Years ago , the expense of setting up a toll - free number prevented many small and mid-size businesses from getting their own 800 phone numbers .
Even today , most people think of a toll free phone number as unattainable for most small businesses – which is probably why it impresses customers so much .
On the contrary , though , a number is relatively easy to acquire .
In most cases , all you need is an existing phone , even a cell phone .
With cell phone accessories being quite affordable today , anyone can afford their own 800 number .
800 Forwarding Versus a Dedicated Line
For the typical small or mid-sized business , the 800 service provider forwards incoming calls to the designated number .
Depending on your business setup , that could be your office phone , your home line , or even a cell phone .
Some providers will even forward the call to multiple lines at once , allowing you to answer the call wherever you are at the time .
Businesses that receive a large number of calls might want to consider a designated line instead .
Basically , you will need to have a new phone line installed , which will be used solely for incoming toll - free calls .
Although you will need to pay for the installation and setup , you will get a better per-minute rate on incoming calls , which will more than make up for the initial expense .
Today , more than ever , small businesses need to save money every way they can .
Whether by lowering energy costs , outsourcing , or improved efficiency , if you do n’t make the changes , your competition will .
The 800 Prefix
It used to be that an 800 number was the only kind of toll - free number .
However , as these numbers became more popular for businesses , other prefixes were added in order to increase availability .
The benefit is that if an 800 number you want – such as one that is similar to your local number , or one that spells something out is already taken , you can get it using another toll free number prefix .
The prefixes for toll - free numbers are :
800
888
877
866
855
844
833
Finding an Toll Free Number Company
Getting a toll free number is easy .
There are many telephone service providers to choose from : the big , well - known providers such as AT&T and MCI , as well as many smaller providers .
Perhaps surprisingly , larger providers cannot offer you a greater choice of numbers .
Although each provider typically has a pool of available numbers under their name , you can choose any 800 phone number that is not already in use .
Since the availability of numbers is the same for every provider , you are free to choose your provider according to the rates and features they can offer .
And to make things even easier , we ’ve already provided a list of the best toll free number services in the table above .

Finding the Best 800 Number Rates
Rates can vary widely between cheap 800 number service providers .
Although many people believe that large service providers will be able to offer the best rates , in fact the opposite is often true .
Your best bet is to shop around , comparing the rates and features offered by different providers .
There are two basic types of rates you will need to compare :
Monthly rates
Most toll - free service providers will charge you a base amount every month , whether or not you receive any incoming calls .
Monthly usage costs may be as much as $ 20 , or you may not need to pay any at all .

Monthly usage costs may be as much as $ 20 , or you may not need to pay any at all .
Per -minute rates
On top of the monthly fees , you will need to consider how much you are charged per minute for incoming calls .
In general , these rates range from 5 cents to 35 cents per minute , although smaller businesses will pay more per minute than those that receive a higher volume of calls .
You should also compare 800 number service plans and the cost of billing increments between plans – the smaller the additional cost , the better – and avoid 800 number providers that require you to pay for a certain number of minutes every month .
Deciding What 800 Number Features You Want
There are a number of features available for 800 phone numbers .
You will need to decide which features you would like to have , and then compare the availability and price of these features between different providers .
Some of the features offered on Toll Free numbers include :
Call blocking
This feature allows you to block callers who are not within your coverage ( and would therefore cost you more than other callers ) , such as calls originating from pay phones .

Dialed Number Identification Service ( DNIS )
If you have more than one 800 number , DNIS lets you know which number was called .
This is particularly useful if you are running multiple marketing campaigns , and would like to know which is the most successful .
Choosing a Toll - Free Number
As already noted , your choice of a toll - free service provider will not limit the variety of 800 numbers available to you .
You can either choose a number from the provider ’s pool , or a vanity number .
And as with any other product or service bought online , be sure to read reviews of the top toll free providers to see how other customers like their quality , features , and customer service .
Choosing from the Provider ’s Pool
Service providers generally have a pool of toll - free numbers that have been set aside for them .
Because these numbers are already in the provider ’s system , your 800 number can be set up much more quickly than if you choose a number from outside the provider ’s pool .
Selecting a Vanity Number
A toll - free number that you choose yourself , either because it is similar to your office number or because the corresponding letters spell out something memorable , is known as a vanity number .
As long as the number is not being used by another business , you will be able to claim it .
However , if it is not already in your provider ’s pool of numbers , you will need to wait about a week for the number to be transferred and your account to be activated .
The good news is that once you have claimed an 800 number , it is yours :
Even if you decide to change providers , you can take your number with you .
Call Center Service
Call centers serve as a centralized office used for the purpose of receiving and sending telephone calls , usually in large volume .
Call centers are used to administer product support or information inquiries from customers .
Outgoing calls are typically used for the purposes of telemarketing , product services , and debt collection .
In addition to call center service , handling of letters , faxes , and emails at one location is called a contact center .
Using Your 800 Number
Once you have selected a phone number and a provider , you need only to wait for your account to be set up .
Before you start giving your 800 number out to customers , you should test it with the help of family and friends in various locations .
After you have ensured that the toll free number works and the sound quality is acceptable , you are ready to benefit from the added credibility an 800 number gives to your business !
Business Phone Systems
In this age of communicating via email and social media , many business owners overlook making phone systems a primary method of contact .
Whether you ’re a one - person operation or have an office full of employees , you will need a way to efficiently communicate with your customers , suppliers , and colleagues ; phone systems are still a tried and true way to make that happen .
Toll - free numbers , conference calling , VoIP , and online faxing are telecommunications systems that a wide range of businesses will find useful .
Here is why you should consider putting these options to work for your business .
Toll - free Numbers
You may not think you need a toll - free number unless you run a business with a storefront or one which retails products and services to consumers , but entrepreneurs in the B2B industry and those without a physical store can definitely benefit from having a toll - free number .
Not only does having a toll - free number prevent you from having to use your personal cell phone or landline number for your business , it provides clients , suppliers , and colleagues who are not local a convenient way to contact you .
Another bonus : having a toll - free number can boost your business ’s professional image and help assure new customers that you ’re running a legitimate operation , which can be especially helpful for startups .
If you run a small business , start with a toll - free number service that is inexpensive — there are several providers that cost less than $ 10 per month — and one that is n’t loaded with features you wo n’t use .
If you ’re constantly on the go or your business is mobile , you may find it helpful to get your toll - free number from a provider which offers free call forwarding to your cell phone and does not require you to use any special hardware .
Those who manage larger businesses should look for toll - free number service providers which offer technical support , unlimited calling , and the ability to forward calls to multiple phone extensions .
Be sure to note whether the toll - free number providers you ’re considering offer the ability to accept international phone calls if you have clients or suppliers outside of the country .
Conference Calling
Conference calling , or teleconferencing , is not just for huge enterprises .
Conferencing can be very useful when it comes to communicating with staff and clients , but some solo business owners also use teleconferencing to make money , especially those who provide coaching services or earn part of their revenue from selling audio seminars .
This is generally how conference calling services work : you ’re provided with a call - in number to give to call participants , and everyone dials in at the time you specify .
Some services allow , or even require , call participants to reserve a space or virtual “ seat ” , while others offer unlimited space and reservation - free conferencing .
If you want to have large numbers of people dial into your conference , choose a service provider which offers unlimited space .
Features often provided by conference calling service providers include the ability to record your calls and replay them online , lecture modes , online controls , and online conference registration and automatic reminders for your participants .
There are many free teleconferencing services , but the more full featured ones require a monthly or one - time fee .
Whether you ’re running a large or small business , save yourself money by choosing a conferencing provider that does not require contracts or charge setup fees .
VoIP Services
Want to cut the cord and completely ditch your business ’s landlines , or add some versatility to your business ’s phone system ?
Then Voice over Internet Protocol — more commonly referred to as VoIP — service is what you need to look into .
VoIP makes use of high - speed Internet to convert analog phone signals into digital signals , and therefore eliminate the need to use a landline for your phone service .
Business owners who frequently travel and are on the move will likely find the convenience of VoIP well worth its nominal cost .
Nowadays , there are many VoIP providers and the cost of service is quite affordable .
VoIP phone service typically costs less than traditional landline or cell phone service , as there is no need for special wiring and most VoIP service providers do n’t charge extra fees and taxes .
A few VoIP service providers even offer reliable , free basic VoIP services , but be prepared to pay a bit extra if you need multiple lines or want to take international calls .
One concern about VoIP centers around the reliability and clarity of calls , compared to using a traditional landline phone service .
If you have broadband Internet service , it ’s likely that your VoIP call quality and reliability will be comparable to having a good cellular phone service provider .
If you have DSL Internet service and want to use VoIP for your business , it ’s advisable that you get a splitter in order to increase your call quality .
Do n’t overlook the benefits of having both landline and VoIP service for your business , especially if you are looking for an all - in - one telelcommunications system .
An increasing number of VoIP providers are offering not only calling service , but teleconferencing , voice mail , and faxing as well .
If you choose to double up , or are a small business owner looking to save , go for a VoIP service provider that is low - cost and does not require a monthly commitment .
Online Fax
Faxing is still seen as a go - to method for sending time sensitive or confidential documents , but having a traditional fax machine can be costly and take up much - needed physical space in your business setup .
Enter online faxing , a more convenient , and much less costly , alternative .
This type of faxing allows you to upload documents online and then send it to the recipient of your choice .
You do n’t need any special equipment or even a landline to use online faxing , just an Internet connection .
Business owners often use a scanner to get their documents to their computer or tablet in order to upload and fax online , but it ’s also possible to photograph documents with your cell phone and upload it that way .
Many online fax service providers offer mobile apps just for this purpose , and cloud based document storage can allow you to eliminate having to physically scan your documents as well .
While there are some free Internet faxing service providers , they typically limit the number of pages that you can send , do not allow you to receive faxes , and do not provide you with a fax number .
These features cost extra , but the good news is that online faxing is generally very affordable , and some service providers will allow you to pay per fax instead of paying a monthly service fee — this is especially convenient for business owners who do not send faxes often .
Using the aforementioned telecommunication methods can help your business run more efficiently .
Remember to carefully evaluate your budget , along with the type of features and support your business needs , before choosing any telecommunications service providers .
Be sure to also check the uptime and track record of the service providers that you consider — your business ’s telecommunication systems will rely upon their quality and dependability .
Follow these suggestions , and you will be well on your way to choosing the right phone system setup for your business .
A place to come for solace in the midst of emotional tumult -- a field of clover in a fickle world of thickets and thorns .
Just an amazing episode .
Two teams with specialists battling over a painting .
The possibilities are endless and this episode delivered on every level .
This episode can certainly be considered the best episode of the series .
This season has n't been on par with season 1 , but I was impressed with the writing .
Not once did the writers miss a beat .
We got to see all the main characters and their counterparts go head to head .
In my opinion , the funniest was Hardison versus Wil Wheaton .
I laughed so much when they both stepped outside their vans , laptops in hand , with the Western music in the foreground .
Parker had some hilarious scenes , stealing things , getting pick pocketed by the other guy , and pick pocketing back .
Eliot fought was an Israeli woman which ended with them kissing .
Each time they would change stances , the other would imagine what could happen , so they kept changing while the audience got to see them fight in their minds .
This season seems to be centering around Sophie and her finding out who she is not as just a name that can play a role , but a real person with an original personality that does n't have to lie about everything .
Sophie almost gets bombed in the beginning and as a ploy to draw her would be killer , they stage a funeral for .
Seeing this really impacts her .
In the last scene , Nate goes in for a kiss , but Sophie walks off not really sure about anything .

On June 30 , Israeli Occupation Forces captured the Free Gaza boat , Spirit of Humanity , with 21 human rights workers aboard , including Nobel laureate Mairead Maguire and former U.S. Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney .
Maguire is co-founder , with Betty Williams , of the Community of Peace People , an organization which attempts to encourage a peaceful resolution of the Troubles in Northern Ireland .
McKinney , who is calling upon President Obama for help , was also the Green Party Presidential candidate .
The US news media , President Obama , and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have so far been silent concerning the capture and subsequent incarceration in Israel of the 21 human rights workers .
IsraCast.com reports that George J. Mitchell Jr. , special envoy to the Middle East , had a meeting in New York with Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak on July 1 .
IsraCast.com said , " After a four - hour meeting ... , Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak and U.S. Middle East ( envoy ) George Mitchell have reduced the gap over Israeli building in West Bank settlements . "
The key to discovering the path to peace in the Middle East may have much more to do with finding ways to allay fear than with building bigger and better weaponry , since it is people 's raging fears that motivate them to bizarre and antisocial reactions .
Might an army of psychologists fare better than the troops currently engaged there ?
Certainly a battalion of Danaan Parrys , Founder of Earthstewards Network , might be able to offer creative solutions that war and aggression have n't unearthed .

The late Parry 's work in conflict resolution around the world was a model of intentional peacemaking .
He worked in Northern Ireland , bringing together Catholic and Protestant teens to plant trees and communicate .
In 1983 , he brought groups of Soviet citizens to the U.S.A. and American groups to the former Soviet Union to melt the fears and prejudices that have often divided the people of these countries .
In 1990 , Earthstewards began the Israel - Palestine Compassionate Listening Project , which promotes Jewish - Israeli - Palestinian friendship .
The Compassionate Listening Project is based on a simple yet profound formula for the resolution of conflict : adversaries giving the gift of listening .
They say that to help reconcile conflicting parties , we must have the ability to understand the suffering of all sides .

While Ubisoft ’s latest ( and possibly last ) installment in the Splinter Cell series , Splinter Cell : Conviction , garnered tons of much deserved attention at this year ’s E3 , many PS3 owners died a little inside as Xbox360 exclusivity was reaffirmed .
However , new information suggests otherwise .
We are all aware that when it comes to video games , the term “ exclusive ” has a variety of different meanings .
That said , this newly surfaced snapshot of a release schedule reportedly from Netherlands retailer , Intertoys , reveals what appears to be a not - so - exclusive Splinter Cell sneaking his way to the PS3 .
Despite that the release dates for the first four listed titles seem to be legit and GT5 is listed for 2010 , there are two possibilities for what you see above .
1 . This is just a misunderstanding on Intertoy ’s part and whoever typed up the schedule made an error , and is now unemployed .
Or
2. Intertoy is somehow privy to information that the rest of us little people unfortunately do n’t have access to .
Honestly , considering how poor of a port Splinter Cell : Double Agent was on the PS3 , I would n’t want to play this on anything other than a 360 .
What do you guys think ?

You never forget the first time your hard drive dies and you realise that you have n't backed up .
The horrible , stomach - turning moment when you know you 've just lost a whole bunch of stuff that 's irreplaceable .
Photos .
Music .
Videos that you took at family events .
All gone .
You 'll probably spend the next few hours sweating , downloading disk utilities and searching for boot disks to try and fix things .
Perhaps you 'll get lucky and be able to kick your drive back into life .
Or perhaps everything will be gone , completely , for good .
And it could all have been avoided .
You could have been sitting back relaxing , sure in the knowledge that everything was safely backed up - on another disk , or online .
You could simply have reformatted your drive , restored everything from your backup , and picked up where you 'd left off .
Then you would have grabbed a cup of tea , put your feet up on the desk , and felt mildly inconvenienced - rather than manically swearing at your Mac .
Let 's face it - backup sounds particularly dull .
But without it , that scenario of losing everything is a distinct possibility .
In this feature we 're going to look at different ways to ensure you 're well backed up , without having to devote hours of time and effort to getting it sorted .
We 're going to take you beyond the basics , and ensure that no matter what happens to your Mac , you 're covered - and wo n't be left losing files that you can never get back .
Why you need to back up
Most of us use hard drives every day , without realising what an amazing piece of engineering they are .
Inside every hard drive are a number of extremely thin circular platters , made from glass or ceramic material , spinning at 7200 rpm or more .
Leave your hard drive on all day , every day , and each platter will spin 3,784 million times in a year .
Floating just nanometers away from these platters is the read / write head , the part of the drive that ( as the name suggests ) reads and writes data to the drive .
As the head passes over the drive , it magnetises the surface of the platters in a series of zeros and ones .
And the drive has to carry on working like this even when knocked , without crashing the head into the platter , which could easily kill the drive .
Given this , it 's perhaps no surprise that hard drives fail .
Generally , though , catastrophic failure is relatively rare .
According to a study released by Google , based on the millions of drives it uses , there 's approximately a one - in - three chance that a drive will fail in five years of use .
Figures like that sound reassuring to us - after all , one in three over five years does n't sound too bad .
But figures like this can also give some false reassurance .
In Google 's study , nearly 3 % of drives failed in less than three months .
And if your drive is one of that 3 % , without a backup you will have lost your precious data .
You might imagine that the answer to this is simple : solid - state disks ( SSDs ) , as found in the current crop of MacBook Airs .
These ' disks ' are n't disks at all , instead using memory chips to store your files .
They have no moving parts : no platters to spin out of control or heads to scratch the disks , which suggests that they should be more reliable .
Yet according to a survey of hard drive failure rates by French tech site hardware .
fr , SSDs were no less prone to failure - particularly in the first few months - than spinning disks .
Some people are occasionally worried about the lifetime of SSDs , because of a quirk in the way they 're rated .
SSDs are rated in terms of write cycles , and a typical SSD might be rated at 100,000 cycles .
Given that hard drives write thousands of times a day , this does n't sound much - but in fact it 's not quite that simple .
Through a process called ' wear levelling ' , the drive tries to ensure that no single storage element gets written to too often , making the entire drive more reliable .
So there is no such thing as a drive that will last forever ; this means that backup should be top of your agenda .
There are several kinds of backup , and which one ( or more ) will be right for you depends on your needs .
The most complete kind of backup is also probably the most simple : a complete , working clone of your entire hard drive .
This would include all of your documents , applications , and even the OS X system .
The huge advantage of cloning your disk like this is you 'll lose absolutely nothing .
Of course , the disadvantage is that it 's time consuming , both to back up the whole thing and to restore it .
The backup can be done incrementally , which means whatever backup application you 're using only backs up files that have changed , but even this can be frustratingly slow under some circumstances .
The question to ask yourself is simply this : if your Mac was lost , stolen or fell into a pit tomorrow , what would you be unable to replace ?
Whatever the answer is , that 's precisely the stuff it 's most important to back up .
Everything else falls under the ' nice to have ' category .
So for data that 's really , truly irreplaceable , you need to ensure that it 's backed up away from your home or office too - and that this backup copy is n't too far out of date .
This is where online backup and other alternatives that move a copy of your data out of your home or office come in - and we 'll cover how to include online backup later in this feature .
Importantly , you need to know where the ' irreplaceable ' stuff lives , because not everything lives in your Documents folder , or even in your Home folder …
The next thing to consider is what the potential disasters are .
For example , it 's no good having a complete , up - to - date backup of your Mac if it only exists on a drive sat next to your iMac and your house burns down .
All you 'll have is two melted , unusable copies of your data instead of one .
If you 're serious about not losing important files , then you 'll need to not only back up to something close at hand ( for your convenience ) , but also to save to something away from your home or office , to ensure that your files would survive even something like a house fire or flood .
How to back up with Time Machine
Time Machine is the default option for backup on every Mac running OS X since the introduction of Leopard ( OS X 10.5 ) in 2007 .
Therefore , this means most Macs are probably running it .
Although Time Machine was n't the first backup software from Apple , it 's probably safe to say it 's the first serious application of its kind the company has produced .
As you would expect , Time Machine is integrated into the OS itself , and is designed to be very easy to use .
Plug in a Mac - formatted external drive , and OS X will ask you if you want to set it up to be used with Time Machine .
Using a drive with it does n't mean you can't use that drive with anything else - you can still use the drive to store files using the Finder .
Within a few clicks , you can be backing up your files , and every time you connect that drive Time Machine will , after a few seconds , start backing up anything that 's changed or new .
Once set up , Time Machine is designed to need as little intervention from you as possible , and to be almost invisible until the point when you need to restore a file .
Time Machine does n't simply ' clone ' everything that 's on your hard drive .
Instead , it creates incremental backups , and using a clever piece of interface design allows you to step ' back in time ' to find a deleted file .
It 's not an archive programme , though : it 's designed to capture the most recent state of data on your disk , as well as files you 've deleted , rather than archiving multiple versions of the same file in a reliable way .
In this sense , Time Machine differs from the auto - save and versioning feature in OS X 10.7 Lion .
Great timing
By default , Time Machine will save backups hourly .
However , as you would imagine , if it saved an hourly snapshot of every file then your backup drive would get filled up very quickly .
So instead , it saves the hourly backups for the past 24 hours ; then consolidated daily backups for the last month ; and a weekly backup for everything older , until your drive runs out of space .
At that point , it will delete the oldest weekly backup .
How big a drive you need to use with Time Machine will , of course , depend on how big your hard drive is and how many old backups you want to store .
Something double the size of your internal drive will allow you to have plenty of room for backups , but you can use Time Machine with something the same size too , if you do n't want to store many old files .
If you have a smaller drive you want to use , you can set Time Machine to exclude files or folders on your drive .
For example , you might decide that you can live without having a backup of your applications folder , and - using the option in Time Machine 's preferences - exclude it .
Once excluded , anything in that folder will no longer be backed up .
Total failure scenarios
Remember though , that what Time Machine wo n't do is create a bootable version of your hard drive , which means that in the event of having a complete hard - drive failure you 'll need to wipe and reinstall OS X from an installation disc and then restore from your Time Machine backup .
Time Machine backups do n't have to be made to a drive connected directly to your Mac .
Instead , you can use any network - attached storage drive formatted as ' journaled HFS + ' that you 're connected to over a network , including ( of course ) Apple 's own dedicated Time Capsule device .
This includes USB drives attached to Airport Express Base Stations , although this is n't supported by Apple .
And Time Machine does n't enable you to back up over the internet - only your local network is supported .
Recovering a backup from Time Machine is simple .
Select ' Enter Time Machine ' ( either from the Dock or the icon in your menu bar ) and Time Machine appears to float the active Finder window above an astronomical background .
Behind the current window is a ' stack ' of older versions , and you simply scroll back through this stack to find whatever deleted file you wish to retrieve .
In addition , some OS X applications can work directly with Time Machine to recover information .
For example , if you select ' Enter Time Machine ' while using Apple Mail , you can step back through deleted emails , in the same way as you can with items in the Finder .
Other apps that support this include Address Book , iPhoto ( '08 and later ) and GarageBand ( '08 and later ) .
If you 're restoring a whole drive , you need to use an installation disc .
When reinstalling OS X on a hard drive , the installation process gives you the option to restore the whole drive using Time Machine .
Select this option , connect the drive with your Time Machine backup on it ( or select a Time Capsule volume ) and let the software do the rest .
How to set up Time Machine
01 . Straight to Preferences
The first thing you 'll need to do when setting up your Mac 's Time Machine is open up its preferences from your menu bar .
It will also offer to do this for you when you connect a new Mac - formatted drive .
02 . Select your drive
The next step is to select the drive you want to use with Time Machine .
This can be a local drive , or any correctly formatted shared drive on your network - it 's entirely up to you .
03 .
Choose what you back up
Finally , if there are any folders that you do n't want to back up , for any reason , then click on the options button to select them .
In this case , we have opted not to back up our Dropbox folder .
The Moscow Trial Was Fair wrote the British lawyer and MP Dennis Pritt , who was subsequently awarded the International Stalin Peace prize , having been expelled from the Labour party in the interim for backing the Soviet invasion of Finland .
The government of Sri Lanka must be hoping for a similarly credulous reaction to its decision last week to parade the five doctors who witnessed the bloody climax of the country 's civil war in May and now claim that they deliberately overestimated the number of civilian casualties .
Since the government blocked access to the conflict zone by all independent observers , the doctors were one of the few sources of first - hand information at its height .
Up to a quarter of a million people were crammed into an areas the size of New York 's central park , which was repeatedly bombarded over a four - month period .
The UN estimated that between 7,000 and 8,000 civilians were killed during the bombardment .
A report by the Times claimed that the death toll – from artillery fire , summary executions , disease and starvation – could have been as high as 20,000 .
Last week the doctors , who have been held in incommunicado detention since their arrest , claimed that only 750 civilians died and that they had made up their earlier accounts for propaganda on behalf of the Tamil Tigers ( LTTE ) .
Looking nervous and flanked by government officials , they said that the only shortages of food and medicine in the blockaded area were due to LTTE appropriations and that there had been little damage to medical facilities .
They said that they regretted their previous " lies " and that no pressure had been exerted on them to change their statements .
Sri Lanka was a democratic country , one said , and so they were no longer lying .
As the Times has noted , the main impact of the press conference was to raise " fresh fears that Sri Lanka , known as a holiday paradise to millions of western tourists , has quietly become a quasi- Stalinist state " .
The tragedy is that Sri Lanka is indeed a democracy , with an independent judiciary and , until recently , a free press .
It has suffered a brutal civil war in which the LTTE has committed countless atrocities from suicide bombings , to ethnic cleansing , deliberate attacks on civilians and the forced recruitment of child soldiers .
The LTTE compelled hundreds of thousands of people to remain in its last stronghold as human shields and the protests of its diaspora sympathisers about the resulting carnage deserve to be treated as hypocritical cant .
With the conflict now over , the government could have seized the moral high ground .
Instead it has clamped down hard .
Around 300,000 civilians remain interned without trial in " welfare centres " that are concentration camps in all but name .
As an al - Jazeera report noted :
Contrary to international law there is no freedom of movement for the displaced , and no transparency in registration and interview processes .
The standards and amounts of water , food and sanitation are well below what they should be and half of the children under age five are suffering from malnutrition .
There have been outbreaks of diseases such as Hepatitis A , chicken pox and skin ailments , and there are fears that cholera may develop .
One estimate said that 1,400 are dying in the camps every week .
The Sri Lankan government could have made a reasonable case that some security restrictions are necessary in the conflict 's aftermath , but it has instead treated all those who question their proportionality as " fifth columnists " .
Earlier this week , the International Bar Association ( IBA ) expressed its alarm at the publication of an article on the ministry for defence 's website entitled " Traitors in black coats flocked together ? " which contained the names and photographs of lawyers defending a Sri Lankan newspaper in a court case .
The IBA had earlier criticised the government for a similar article which implied that defence lawyers were terrorist suspects .
Another article a few months ago accused aid workers of being terrorists and stated that :
... humanitarian agencies , aid agencies , free media , civil rights movements , etc , have made the continued bloodshed on Sri Lankan soil a lucrative business for them .
The only difference observed between them and the LTTE is that the terrorists have been fighting a war on the ground , which is supposed to end in the achievement of their ultimate goal of a separate state , while the latter fights a different battle on the media and in diplomatic circles , to ensure that the LTTE 's war would never end at any cost .
Foreign aid workers are now regularly having their visa requests denied , forcing them out of the country , while local staff are being arrested on trumped up charges .
Journalists , lawyers and human rights activists are being abducted , beaten up , tortured and killed .
Sri Lanka 's president , Mahinda Rajapaksa , is basking in popularity amongst the country 's Sinhalese majority and the Economist recently described him as " cultivating the image of an elected monarch " and deliberately whipping up Sinhalese chauvinism .
Meanwhile the UN human rights council has yet again disgraced itself with a resolution praising Sri Lanka 's human rights record .
But last week 's press conference may come to be seen as overkill .
The conflict almost bankrupted Sri Lanka , which is currently seeking a $ 1.9bn loan from the International Monetary Fund , and its government cannot defy international opinion indefinitely .
The pressure for an independent investigation into alleged war crimes at the end of the conflict is not going to go away and the more news that emerges the less credible the government 's position becomes .
Although aid organisations have deliberately refrained from commenting on the political situation , simple accounts of their work contradict the official line .
Medecins sans Frontieres , for example , has just reported that its staff performed 4,000 surgical operations on conflict - related injuries and dressed 3,000 wounds in the last few months , which is hardly compatible with the doctors ' new claims .
The irony is that the doctors almost certainly were pressurised to lie about the situation by the LTTE but are now clearly under pressure to support the government 's narrative .
Only an independent inquiry can establish the truth , and the government 's latest stunt should strengthen the calls for one .
Got a few grand to spare for a $ 3,000 phone ?
Yeah , we did n't think so .
Nobody does – and that 's a problem for the makers of luxury phones , such as Motorola , Bang & Olufsen , LG and Vertu .
After years of chasing the ultra - wealthy with exclusive devices that carry designer logos and promise craftsmanship from materials such as sapphire and stainless steel , luxury phone makers are now pulling back .
" The culture has shifted away from conspicuous consumption , so if you are going to have a super expensive product this may not be the time for it , " says Avi Greengart , research director for consumer devices at Current Analysis .
Motorola has already gotten the memo .
Earlier this week , the company reportedly canceled the Ivory E18 , a device tentatively priced around $ 3,000 .
The phone had met with lack of interest from telecom carriers .
Motorola declined to comment .
If that sounds like an obvious outcome , perhaps it should n't .
In the last few years , luxury phones had turned into an attractive new business , as designer houses rushed to get a foothold in the tech sector .
Prada collaborated with LG to launch two LG Prada phones in Europe and Asia .
Last September , Samsung launched the M75500 Night Effect phone , which carried the Emporio Armani insignia .
A month later , Motorola offered a $ 2,000 phone , called the Aura , which was fashioned out of stainless steel and sported a 62 - carat sapphire crystal lens .
And then there 's Vertu , a company that makes true luxury phones , the cheapest of which costs about $ 6,000 .
The recession put a spoke in those plans .
And it 's not just the 401Ks of middle - class Americans that have been in peril .
In Russia , many newly - minted billionaires saw their fortunes slip away with falling oil prices .
By the first quarter this year , the U.S. economy had shrunk 5.5 percent .
Even 50 Cent has complained about losing more than a few Benjamins on the stock market .
And just like that , the crystal dominoes started to fall .
Last October , Bang & Olufsen , whose phones retailed in Europe for more than $ 1500 , shuttered its cellphone business as it decided to trim its costs and get out of non-profitable ventures .
Motorola is the latest to pull back its luxury line .
Luxury phones have never been a big phenomenon in North America , says Greengart .
Their manufacturers have had better luck in emerging markets .
But now even in those countries , where once 8 percent GDP growth seemed conservative , wealthy consumers are feeling the pinch .
" Super expensive , bling bling phones are big in markets where conspicuous consumption is a way to tell your countrymen you have arrived , " says Greengart .
" But now , it 's a very different economy for everyone . "
Many of the troubles that the uber - expensive phones face are because they are created by companies whose main expertise is in targeting a mass market , says Frank Nuovo , former chief of design for Nokia and current head of Vertu .
" I did n't start this business to soak the phones in diamonds and jewels , " says Nuovo .
" The concept is same as a fine watch or a fabulous car .
To be a true luxury product , you have to look at making something that does n't have an 18 - month shelf life . "
True luxury , as Nuovo defines it , does n't apply to a mere $ 2,000 phone : A Vertu device , soaked in platinum , can run up to $ 70,000 .
The company 's one - off phones , designed in collaboration with luxury jewels house Boucheron , cost even more .
Nuovo may have inadvertently hit on the real problem with luxury phones :
Phones are still a very feature - driven products .
They are products where the rapid advances in technology can rend older models obsolete very quickly .
" Phones are n't like a handbag where the fundamental utility remains the same and the design changes all the time , " says Greengart .
But Nuovo is n't convinced .
" Take watches and cars , " he says .
" They all run the same but everyone has a unique way of delivering them stylistically .
We can do the same with phones . "
Despite the bumps on the road now , Nuovo says the luxury phones will bounce back and find an audience .
" It is no different than a fine watch or a car , " he says .
" If you take people who value something that is made extraordinarily well there will always be a group interested in it . "
Vertu is determined to prove that .
It will launch its latest handset the Carbon Fibre Ascent Ti in August .
The phone is made of high - gloss carbon fiber and has a sandblasted titanium surface .
The price tag ?
$ 9,800 .

Dick Peixoto planted hedges of fennel and flowering cilantro around his organic vegetable fields in the Pajaro Valley near Watsonville to harbor beneficial insects , an alternative to pesticides .
He has since ripped out such plants in the name of food safety , because his big customers demand sterile buffers around his crops .
No vegetation .
No water .
No wildlife of any kind .
" I was driving by a field where a squirrel fed off the end of the field , and so 30 feet in we had to destroy the crop , " he said .
" On one field where a deer walked through , did n't eat anything , just walked through and you could see the tracks , we had to take out 30 feet on each side of the tracks and annihilate the crop . "
In the verdant farmland surrounding Monterey Bay , a national marine sanctuary and one of the world 's biological jewels , scorched - earth strategies are being imposed on hundreds of thousands of acres in the quest for an antiseptic field of greens .
And the scheme is about to go national .
Invisible to a public that sees only the headlines of the latest food - safety scare - spinach , peppers and now cookie dough - ponds are being poisoned and bulldozed .
Vegetation harboring pollinators and filtering storm runoff is being cleared .
Fences and poison baits line wildlife corridors .
Birds , frogs , mice and deer - and anything that shelters them - are caught in a raging battle in the Salinas Valley against E. coli O157 : H7 , a lethal , food - borne bacteria .
In pending legislation and in proposed federal regulations , the push for food safety butts up against the movement toward biologically diverse farming methods , while evidence suggests that industrial agriculture may be the bigger culprit .
' Foolhardy ' approach
" Sanitizing American agriculture , aside from being impossible , is foolhardy , " said UC Berkeley food guru Michael Pollan , who most recently made his case for smaller - scale farming in the documentary film " Food , Inc . "
" You have to think about what 's the logical end point of looking at food this way .
It 's food grown indoors hydroponically . "
Scientists do not know how the killer E. coli pathogen , which dwells mainly in the guts of cattle , made its way to a spinach field near San Juan Bautista ( San Benito County ) in 2006 , leaving four people dead , 35 with acute kidney failure and 103 hospitalized .
The deadly bug first appeared in hamburger meat in the early 1980s and migrated to certain kinds of produce , mainly lettuce and other leafy greens that are cut , mixed and bagged for the convenience of supermarket shoppers .
Hundreds of thousands of the bug can fit on the head of a pin ; as few as 10 can lodge in a salad and end in lifelong disability , including organ failure .
Going national
For many giant food retailers , the choice between a dead pond and a dead child is no choice at all .
Industry has paid more than $ 100 million in court settlements and verdicts in spinach and lettuce lawsuits , a fraction of the lost sales involved .
Galvanized by the spinach disaster , large growers instituted a quasi - governmental program of new protocols for growing greens safely , called the " leafy greens marketing agreement . "
A proposal was submitted last month in Washington to take these rules nationwide .
A food safety bill sponsored by Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Los Angeles , passed this month in the House Energy and Commerce Committee .
It would give new powers to the Food and Drug Administration to regulate all farms and produce in an attempt to fix the problem .
The bill would require consideration of farm diversity and environmental rules , but would leave much to the FDA .
An Amish farmer in Ohio who uses horses to plow his fields could find himself caught in a net aimed 2,000 miles away at a feral pig in San Benito County .
While he may pick , pack and sell his greens in one day because he does not refrigerate , the bagged lettuce trucked from Salinas with a 17 - day shelf life may be considered safer .
The leafy - green agreement is based on available science , but it is just a jumping - off point .
Large produce buyers have compiled secret " super metrics " that go much further .
Farmers must follow them if they expect to sell their crops .
These can include vast bare - dirt buffers , elimination of wildlife , and strict rules on water sources .
To enforce these rules , retail buyers have sent forth armies of food - safety auditors , many of them trained in indoor processing plants , to inspect fields .
Keeping children out
" They 're used to working inside the factory walls , " said Ken Kimes , owner of New Natives farms in Aptos ( Santa Cruz County ) and a board member of the Community Alliance With Family Farmers , a California group .
" If they 're not prepared for the farm landscape , it can come as quite a shock to them .
Some of this stuff that they want , you just can't actually do . "
Auditors have told Kimes that no children younger than 5 can be allowed on his farm for fear of diapers .
He has been asked to issue identification badges to all visitors .
Not only do the rules conflict with organic and environmental standards ; many are simply unscientific .
Surprisingly little is known about how E. coli is transmitted from cow to table .
Reducing E. coli
Scientists have created a vaccine to reduce E. coli in livestock , and a White House working group announced plans Tuesday to boost safety standards for eggs and meat .
This month , the group is expected to issue draft guidelines for reducing E. coli contamination in leafy greens , tomatoes and melons .
Some science suggests that removing vegetation near field crops could make food less safe .
Vegetation and wetlands are a landscape 's lungs and kidneys , filtering out not just fertilizers , sediments and pesticides , but also pathogens .
UC Davis scientists found that vegetation buffers can remove as much as 98 percent of E. coli from surface water .
UC Davis advisers warn that some rodents prefer cleared areas .
Produce buyers compete to demand the most draconian standards , said Jo Ann Baumgartner , head of the Wild Farm Alliance in Watsonville , so that they can sell their products as the " safest . "
State agencies responsible for California 's water , air and wildlife have been unable to find out from buyers what they are demanding .
They do know that trees have been bulldozed along the riparian corridors of the Salinas Valley , while poison - filled tubes targeting rodents dot lettuce fields .
Dying rodents have led to deaths of owls and hawks that naturally control rodents .
Unscientific approach
" It 's all based on panic and fear , and the science is not there , " said Dr. Andy Gordus , an environmental scientist with the California Department of Fish and Game .
Preliminary results released in April from a two - year study by the state wildlife agency , UC Davis and the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that less than one - half of 1 percent of 866 wild animals tested positive for E. coli O157:H7 in Central California .
Frogs are unrelated to E. coli , but their remains in bags of mechanically harvested greens are unsightly , Gordus said , so " the industry has been using food safety as a premise to eliminate frogs . "
Farmers are told that ponds used to recycle irrigation water are unsafe .
So they bulldoze the ponds and pump more groundwater , opening more of the aquifer to saltwater intrusion , said Jill Wilson , an environmental scientist at the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board in San Luis Obispo .
Wilson said demands for 450 - foot dirt buffers remove the agency 's chief means of preventing pollution from entering streams and rivers .
Jovita Pajarillo , associate director of the water division in the San Francisco office of the Environmental Protection Agency , said removal of vegetative buffers threatens Arroyo Seco , one of the last remaining stretches of habitat for steelhead trout .
Turning down clients
" It 's been a problem for us trying to balance the organic growing methods with the food safety requirements , " Peixoto said .
" At some point , we can't really meet their criteria .
We just tell them that 's all we can do , and we have to turn down that customer . "
Large retailers did not respond to requests for comment .
Food trade groups in Washington suggested calling other trade groups , which did n't comment .
Chiquita / Fresh Express , a large Salinas produce handler , told the advocacy group Food and Water Watch that the company has " developed extensive additional guidelines for the procurement of leafy greens and other produce , but we consider such guidelines to be our confidential and proprietary information . "
Seattle trial lawyer Bill Marler , who represented many of the plaintiffs in the 2006 E. coli outbreak in spinach , said , " If we want to have bagged spinach and lettuce available 24/7 , 12 months of the year , it comes with costs . "
Still , he said , the industry rules wo n't stop lawsuits or eliminate the risk of processed greens cut in fields , mingled in large baths , put in bags that must be chilled from packing plant to kitchen , and shipped thousands of miles away .
" In 16 years of handling nearly every major food - borne illness outbreak in America , I can tell you I 've never had a case where it 's been linked to a farmers ' market , " Marler said .
" Could it happen ?
Absolutely .
But the big problem has been the mass - produced product .
What you 're seeing is this rub between trying to make it as clean as possible so they do n't poison anybody , but still not wanting to come to the reality that it may be the industrialized process that 's making it all so risky . "
Europe on the Brink
And Then There Was Leverage
Too Big To Save
Those Wild and Crazy Swiss
A Positive Third Quarter ?
New York and Maine
We have avoided Armageddon , at least for now .
The cost to the US taxpayer has been a few trillion .
Some in the media are loudly announcing the end of the recession .
But we are not out of the
woods yet .
There are a few more bumps in the road .
Actually , some of them are quite steep hills .
As big as the subprime problem ?
Maybe .
When asked a few weeks ago what was my biggest short - term concern , I quickly replied , “ European banks have the potential to create significant risk for the entire worldwide system . ”
This week we will glance “ over the pond ” to see what gives me cause for concern .
Then we briefly look at a few of the bumps I mentioned , which are likely to stretch out any recovery , and maybe even dip us back into recession .
But first , a quick announcement .
We are making dramatic changes to my free Accredited Investor E - Letter and service , and will have a new web site and much improved content in a month or
so .
But in the meantime , I have just finished a new letter ; and if you sign up at the current site , you will of course get all the new services and benefits when we make the changes , as well as this new letter .
Basically , this service is for accredited investors ( net worth of $ 1.5 million or more ) who are interested in learning more about and investing in alternative funds like hedge funds , commodity funds , and so on .
You will get a call from one of my worldwide partners ( Altegris Investments in the US , Absolute Return Partners in Europe , Nicola Asset Management in Canada , Plexus Asset Management in Africa , and Fynn Capital in Latin America ) and gain access to a lot of information and an easy way to preview what I think is a great line - up of quality funds and managers .
You can go to www.accreditedinvestor.ws and sign up today .
Do n’t procrastinate !
And for those of you in the US who are on your way to becoming accredited investors ( but not there yet ) , my friends at CMG have a platform of alternative managers that can be tailored to your specific needs .
You really owe it to yourself to see the managers on their platform .
The link to their form is
http://www.cmgfunds.net/public/mauldin_questionnaire.asp.
And now , let ’s jump into the letter .
Europe on the Brink
Globalization is a two - edged sword .
On balance , it has brought prosperity to those who have
embraced it , with rising lifestyles , better health , longer lives , and more .
The
more we need each other , the less likely it is that we ’ll shoot each other .
Shooting your customers is not a good business strategy .
And while the growth
has not been even or smooth , only a Luddite would want to return to the early
1800s or 1900s , or even 1975 .
The other edge of that sword ?
We are connected in so very many ways , far more than
most of the world suspected .
Who thought that insane lending policies at US
mortgage banks would bring the world financial system to its knees , increasing
unemployment and leading to a global recession ?
World trade is down 20 % or
more .
US railroad shipments are down more than 20 % year - over - year .
Chinese ( and
Asian ) factories have seen their orders drop , as US consumers have gone on
strike .
The US trade deficit was just $ 25 billion last month ; and while our
exports are still dropping , our imports are dropping more .
Oil is becoming a
bigger and bigger share of imports , and that does not come from Asian
exporters .
The US is far and away the country with the largest gross domestic product ( GDP ) .
California would be the 7th largest country , but few think of California
in such terms .
For this letter , at least , I would like to think of Europe as a
whole rather than as 27 countries .
From that perspective , Europe is as
economically important to the world as the US .
What happens in Europe makes a
difference in the US .
Last week we looked at the precarious position of Japan , the second largest economy
( or third if you think of Europe as a whole ) .
It was a sobering letter .
When
you realize the extent to which Japan has funded Asian expansion , what is
happening there cannot be good for the world .
But Europe ’s banks have been much more aggressive in funding emerging - market
expansion than US or Japanese banks .
Western European banks have lent $ 4.5
trillion to various emerging - market countries , businesses , and consumers .
Many
Eastern European businesses borrowed in low - interest - rate euros .
New homeowners
in Hungary and the rest of Eastern Europe borrowed in Swiss francs and euros ,
and as their currencies have collapsed they now find they owe more on their
homes than they ’re worth .
And here ’s the problem .
Europe ’s banking system is in far worse shape than the US system .
The losses may be bigger , and their capital to meet those losses is certainly less .
Let ’s look
at some charts .
Remove sharp objects or pour another adult beverage .
As I noted last week , one of the
real benefits of writing this letter is that I get to see a lot of really
interesting information from readers and meet with very savvy investment
professionals .
I recently had the privilege of sitting with a team of analysts
from Hayman Capital here in Dallas .
Hayman runs a global macro hedge fund , so
they spend a lot of time thinking about how all the different aspects of the
global markets fit together .
This week we again look at some of their analysis .
There was a lot of work ( as in months ) done here ; and Kyle Bass , the founder of
the firm , graciously allowed me to share some of it with you ( and kudos to Wes
Swank , who pulled this together ) .
The graphs are theirs , and my discussion about
them is certainly informed by our meeting ; but I am using the material as a
launching point , so they are not responsible for my conclusions and
interpretations .
And Then There Was Leverage
In the first few years of the G.W .
Bush administration , the banking authorities decided it would be OK to allow
five banks to increase their leverage from 12:1 up to 30:1 .
Which five banks ,
you ask ?
Bear Stearns , Lehman , Merrill Lynch , JPMorgan , and Goldman Sachs .
How
did that work out , just five years later ?
Three are gone and two survived with
large dollops of taxpayer money .
( Sidebar :
Is it really any surprise
that Goldman and JPMorgan are making record profits on the underwriting and
trading side of the business ?
Hell , if I could eliminate 50 % of my competition ,
my profits would grow too !
JPMorgan ’s consumer credit , credit card , and other
business groups are losing money big - time . )
Thirty times leverage means that if
you lose 3.3 % , you wipe out all your capital .
And we watched as banks too big
to fail were bailed out with taxpayer dollars .
Slowly , banks are buying time ,
writing down assets .
Remember , this month is the second anniversary of the
onset of the credit crisis .
I wrote back then that the strategy would be to
stretch this out as long as possible .
Time heals a lot of bad debts , especially
at a 0 % Fed Funds rate .
Banks that are reporting so far
this quarter seem to be saying that the write - offs will start to level off in
about two quarters , although banking expert Chris Whalen says that the level
may stay higher than we think for longer than we think .
There are a lot of
assets to write off , and they are just now getting to the commercial real
estate problems .
This is going to take time .
( For an interesting interview on
CNBC with Maine fishing buddy Chris Whalen , click here :
http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2009/07/christopher-whalen-banking/.)
The point , before we get to Europe ,
is that here there was a central bank and a government that not only could step
in but was willing to .
I know former Treasury Secretary Paulson had his
critics , but I am not one of them .
Did he do some things that in hindsight he
might like to take a “ mulligan ” on ?
Sure .
But he dealt with the problems in the
best manner he could .
The time to have taken action was when we were making
liar and no-doc loans and calling then AAA , or allowing banks to go to 30:1 leverage .
Paulson had to deal with eggs that were already broken .
That the system did not
crater is to his credit .
Securitizing what he and everyone else should have
known would be garbage while he was head of Goldman Sachs is not to his credit .
But I digress .
I am going to give you four charts
showing the leverage of banks in the US , the United Kingdom , the Eurozone , and
Switzerland .
The bottom , blue portion is assets to common and preferred stock ;
the red is assets to common equity , which can include good will ; and the purple
is assets to tangible common equity .
Tangible common equity is all the
rage , and that is what the recent “ stress tests ” measured , as opposed to tier 1
capital , which includes preferred stock ( which would basically be the blue
portion . )
TCE only includes common shares .
Now , let ’s start with the US .
These
graphs show leverage .
The average leverage of tier 1 capital of the five
largest banks is in the range of 12:1 , and is actually down from ten years ago .
( By the way , a very good and simple explanation of all this can be found at
http://baselinescenario.com/2009/02/24/tangible-common-equity-for-beginners/.)
While the TCE has obviously been rising
and taking total leverage to rather lofty levels in the mid-40s , banks are
raising capital , and over time leverage will come back down .
It helps if you
can borrow money at almost nothing and lend it out at much higher rates .
Now ,
let ’s turn to the United Kingdom .
This is uglier .
Regulators
in the UK allowed 20:1 leverage on a regular basis .
It is now almost 40 : and with
TCE is around 55 .
The assets of UK banks are about five times as large as UK
GDP .
By comparison , for the US the ratio is barely 2:1 .
Think
about that for a second .
The UK has banking assets which are five times as
large as the annual domestic output of the country .
They also had a housing
bubble .
They have their own bailouts to deal with , which are massive and will potentially
get much larger .
But at least they have a central bank and government that can
try to fix the problems .
But as the commercial says , “ But
wait , there ’s more ! ”
Let ’s look at the Eurozone .
Leverage
is now 35:1 and with TCE is almost 55 .
How did 35:1 work out for the US ?
Given
the massive credit problems that Eurozone banks have with emerging markets ( plus
Spain ’s housing bubble , which is every bit as bad as that of the US ) , will this
not end up in wailing and weeping ?
Too Big To Save
And
here ’s the real issue .
They have no Paulson and Bernanke .
Now some of my
Austrian - economist friends will say , “ Good , they should all be allowed to die ; ”
but that is a very cavalier attitude when you start talking about actually increasing
the unemployment rate to something like 20 % .
I agree that management should be
changed ( as well as the regulators : 35:1 to 1 – really ?
What were they thinking ? ) and shareholders wiped out , but I do not want the
system to collapse .
And this is a global risk , not just localized to Ireland or
Spain or Austria .
Sure , the pain might be worse in the local region , but we
will all feel it .
The
European Central Bank , at least as of now , cannot step in and start saving
individual banks .
How do you save a Spanish bank and not an Austrian bank ?
Austria ’s banks have made large loans to Eastern Europe , in euros and Swiss
francs , and are going to have large losses , far more than 3 % , which would wipe
out their capital .
But bank assets in Austria are 4 times GDP .
What we have are
banks that are too big to save for relatively small Austria .
And for Italy ,
Spain , Greece , et al .
More on this below .
For now , let ’s turn our eyes to
Switzerland .
Those Wild and Crazy Swiss
We
think of Switzerland as a stodgy , by - the - numbers , clockwork type of banking
country .
I have done business with Swiss private bankers , and they are
conservative .
But somewhere , somehow , UBS and Credit Suisse ran up a little
leverage .
Before the crisis , they were over 40:1 .
And now they ’re nearly at a
nosebleed - high 70 !
As
an aside , I was in Switzerland about two years ago , meeting with some very well - known
Swiss , let ’s call them dignitaries .
In a very off - the - record conversation , they
told me UBS was technically bankrupt .
As it turns out , there were a lot of
banks around the world that were technically bankrupt .
Now ,
the next graph underscores the problem of “ too big to save . ”
Let ’s say the US
will eventually pump $ 1 trillion into the banking system ( in taxpayer losses ) .
That is about 7 % of US GDP .
We may not like it , but it does n’t stop the game .
US bank assets are only twice US GDP .
Switzerland and Ireland are over 7 times ,
the UK is over 5 , and the Eurozone is at 4 times .
And so it goes .
Eurozone
banks are already reeling from losses from US subprime - related problems .
They
are now getting ready to deal with even deeper losses from their own lending
portfolios .
If the losses were just 5 % of the portfolio ( an optimistic
assumption ) , it would be 20 % of Eurozone GDP .
But each country is responsible
for its own banks .
While it is thought Germany will be able to handle its problems ,
the prognostication for Austria and Italy is not so sanguine .
Italy is already
running a massive deficit , and has no central bank to monetize its debt .
The
same goes for Portugal , Spain , Greece , and Ireland .
5 % loan losses in Ireland
would be 40 % of GDP , the equivalent for my fellow US citizens of about $ 5
trillion .
Where does Europe find a few trillion dollars ?
I
was writing in late 2006 that the subprime lending market would end in tears .
And I think the European banking crisis that is on the horizon has the
potential to be every bit as big a problem as subprime loans .
The world
depended on Europeans banks for much of the lending that allowed for growth and
development .
Like their counterparts in the US , they are going to have to
reduce their loan portfolios .
Deleveraging is not fun .
It takes time to build up a banking
infrastructure that can raise the capital necessary to make and process loans .
A lot of time .
Europe is a big customer of the US and Asia .
Their businesses
are going to be hit hard by the lack of capital , which is of course no good for
employment , etc .
We are all connected .
What happens in Rome no longer stays in
Rome .
Let me reprint a graph from last
week .
Burn it into your mind .
The world is going to need to find $ 5 trillion to
finance government debt issuance .
And we need to fund private business and
consumer debt .
Where is all this money going to come from ?
“ If you lend me $ 5
trillion today , I will gladly repay you Tuesday . ”
A Positive Third Quarter ?
Those
who are calling for the end of the recession are shouting that the third
quarter may be positive in terms of GDP .
And that is possible .
But only for
statistical and not for fundamental reasons .
For instance , lower imports are a
net positive for GDP .
But lower imports mean a weaker economy .
Government
spending adds to GDP .
Normally , if the government spends too much , then we get
inflation , which is subtracted from nominal GDP to give us real ( after - inflation )
GDP .
But inflation is low and getting lower , so there is not going to be much
to subtract from nominal GDP .
Are government spending and massive deficits a
sign of fundamental strength ?
It
is quite usual for there to be a positive quarter in the middle of a recession .
Watch the fundamentals : industrial production , unemployment , capacity
utilization , tax receipts , etc .
When those turn up , or at least level off , the
recession is over .
Then we get to the long recovery .
Quick point .
As I have noted ,
unemployment is at 9.5 % and going to 11 % and hopefully no higher .
Average hours
worked per week is at an all - time low .
The number of people working part - time
but wanting full - time work is another 7 % !
And that part - time number is rising
very rapidly .
When the recovery actually does
begin to manifest itself , and it eventually will as we find the New Normal ,
what do you think employers are going to do ?
Hire new workers ?
Or give their
current employees more hours ?
The latter , of course .
This is going to be a
long , slow , painful , jobless recovery .
Unemployment is going to remain
stubbornly high .
And this Congress wants to raise
taxes on small business .
75 % of the “ rich ” are small businesses .
How do you
expand your business in California or New York , where taxes will be over 60 % by
the time you add in local taxes ?
We will talk about this next week ; but as a
preview , from an economic viewpoint , massively raising taxes in the middle of a
recession is about as dumb as you can get .
But it looks like we are headed
there .
Green shoots , my foot .
New York and Maine
I’ll
head to Maine in early August with youngest son
Trey to fish with my friends
and talk economics .
Meanwhile , # 2 daughter Melissa will soon have to have her
gall bladder removed .
Amanda gets married next month .
Two more grandchildren
( in addition to the one I had last month ) in the next five months .
Watching # 2
son struggle with a budding family , and getting fewer hours as even the health - care
business slows down .
UPS is giving # 1 son fewer hours than he needs .
Life is
always interesting with seven kids .
I
can remember really struggling as a young entrepreneur in my 20s and 30s .
There
were many nights I could n’t sleep as I worried about payroll or a bill coming
due .
No one gave me a course in basic business .
I had to learn it “ on –the
–job , ” as they say .
It was n’t always pretty .
It was a struggle starting
out in the ’70s , but you got up every morning and did your best .
It was not
easy .
And now , I watch my kids do the same thing .
It is a struggle for them , too .
It is a reminder how just lucky I am .
I truly feel I am one of the most blessed
of men .
Have
a great week , and remember that the world will not come to an end .
It is
important to find the good in life and enjoy it , even in the midst of the
fight .
Somehow , we will all figure out how to Muddle Through together .

A BNF PARSER IN FORTH ( This article first appeared in ACM SigFORTH Newsletter vol. 2 no . 2 )
Bradford J. Rodriguez
T- Recursive Technology
115 First St. # 105
Collingwood , Ontario L9Y 4W3 Canada
bj@forth.org
1. Introduction
Backus - Naur Form ( BNF ) is a notation for the formal description of programming languages .
While most commonly used to specify the syntax of " conventional " programming languages such as Pascal and C , BNF is also of value in command language interpreters and other language processing .
This paper describes a one - screen Forth extension which transforms BNF expressions to executable Forth words .
This gives Forth a capability equivalent to YACC or TMG , to produce a working parser from a BNF language description .
2. BNF Expressions
BNF expressions or productions are written as follows :
production ::= term ... term ( alternate # 1 ) | term ... term ( alternate # 2 ) | term ... term ( alternate # 3 )
This example indicates that the given production may be formed in one of three ways .
Each alternative is the concatenation of a series of terms .
A term in a production may be either another production , called a nonterminal , or a fundamental token , called a terminal .
A production may use itself recursively in its definition .
For example , an unsigned integer can be defined with the productions
< digit > ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
< number > ::= < digit > | < digit > < number >
which says that a number is either a single digit , or a single digit followed by another number ( of one or more digits ) .
We will use the conventions of a vertical bar | to seperate alternatives , and angle brackets to designate the name of a production .
Unadorned ASCII characters are terminals ( the fundamental tokens ) .
3. A Simple Solution through Conditional Execution
The logic of succession and alternation can be implemented in two " conditional execution " operators , && and || .
These correspond exactly to the " logical connectives " of the same names in the C language ( although their use here was actually inspired by the Unix " find " command ) .
They are defined :
: || IF R> DROP 1 THEN ; ( exit on true )
: && 0= IF R> DROP 0 THEN ; ( exit on false )
|| given a true value on the stack , exits the colon definition immediately with true on the stack .
This can be used to string together alternatives : the first alternative which is satisfied ( returns true ) will stop evaluation of further alternatives .
&& given a false value on the stack , exits the colon definition immediately with false on the stack .
This is the " concatenation " operator : the first term which fails ( returns false ) stops evaluation and causes the entire sequence to fail .
We assume that each " token " ( terminal ) is represented by a Forth word which scans the input stream and returns a success flag .
Productions ( nonterminals ) which are built with such tokens , || , and && , are guaranteed to return a success flag .
So , assuming the " token " words ' 0 ' thru ' 9 ' have been defined , the previous example becomes :
: < DIGIT > ' 0 ' || ' 1 ' || ' 2 ' || ' 3 ' || ' 4 ' || ' 5 ' || ' 6 ' || ' 7 ' || ' 8 ' || ' 9 ' ; : < NUMBER1 > < DIGIT > && < NUMBER > ; : < NUMBER > < DIGIT > || < NUMBER1 > ;
Neglecting the problem of forward referencing for the moment , this example illustrates three limitations :
a ) we need an explicit operator for concatenation , unlike BNF .
b ) && and || have equal precedence , which means we can't mix && and || in the same Forth word and get the equivalent BNF expression .
We needed to split the production < NUMBER > into two words .
c ) we have made no provision for restoring the scan pointer if a BNF production fails .
We will address these next .
4. A Better Solution
Several improvements can be made to this " rough " BNF parser , to remove its limitations and improve its " cosmetics . "
a) Concatenation by juxtaposition .
We can cause the action of && to be performed " invisibly " by enforcing this rule for all terms ( terminals and nonterminals ) :
Each term examines the stack on entry .
if false , the word exits immediately with false on the stack .
Otherwise , it parses and returns a success value .
To illustrate this : consider a series of terms
< ONE > < TWO > < THREE > < FOUR >
Let < ONE > execute normally and return " false . "
The < TWO > is entered , and exits immediately , doing nothing .
Likewise , < THREE > and < FOUR > do nothing .
Thus the remainder of the expression is skipped , without the need for a return - stack exit .
The implementation of this will be described shortly .
b) Precedence .
By eliminating the && operator in this manner , we make it possible to mix concatenation and alternation in a single expression .
A failed concatenation will " skip " only as far as the next operator .
So , our previous example becomes :
: < NUMBER > < DIGIT > || < DIGIT > < NUMBER > ;
c ) Backtracking .
If a token fails to match the input stream , it does not advance the scan pointer .
Likewise , if a BNF production fails , it must restore the scan pointer to the " starting point " where the production was attempted , since that is the point at which alternatives must be tried .
We therefore enforce this rule for all terminals and nonterminals : Each term saves the scan pointer on entry .
If the term fails , the scan pointer is restored ; otherwise , the saved value is discarded .
We will later find it useful to " backtrack " an output pointer , as well .
d ) Success as a variable .
An examination of the stack contents during parsing reveals the surprising fact that , at any time , there is only one success flag on the stack !
( This is because flags placed on the stack are immediately " consumed . " )
We can use a variable , SUCCESS , for the parser success flags , and thereby simplify the manipulations necessary to use the stack for other data .
All BNF productions accept , and return , a truth value in SUCCESS .
5. Implementation
The final BNF parser word set is given on screen 3 .
Three words implement the essential logic :
< BNF is used at the beginning of a production .
If SUCCESS is false , it causes an immediate exit .
Otherwise , it saves the scan pointer on the return stack .
| separates alternatives .
If SUCCESS is true , it causes an immediate exit and discards the saved scan pointer .
Otherwise , it restores the scan position from the saved pointer .
BNF > is used at the end of a production .
If SUCCESS is false , it restores the scan position from the saved pointer .
In any case , it removes the saved pointer from the return stack .
< BNF and BNF > are " run-time " logic , compiled by the words BNF : and ; BNF , respectively .
BNF : name starts the definition of the BNF production name .
; BNF ends a BNF definition .
Finally , there are four words which simplify the definition of token words and other terminals :
@TOKEN fetch the current token from the input .
+TOKEN advance the input scan pointer .
= TOKEN compare the value on top of stack to the current token , following the rules for BNF parsing words .
nn TOKEN name builds a " terminal " name , with the ASCII value nn .
The parser uses the fig -Forth IN as the input pointer , and the dictionary pointer DP as the output pointer .
These choices were made strictly for convenience ; there is no implied connection with the Forth compiler .
6. Examples and Usage
The syntax of a BNF definition in Forth resembles the " traditional " BNF syntax :
Traditional : prod ::= term term | term term
Forth : BNF : prod term term | term term ; BNF
Screen 6 is a simple pattern recognition problem , to identify text having balanced left and right parentheses .
Several aspects of the parser are illustrated by this example :
a) Three tokens are defined on line 4 .
To avoid name conflicts , they are named with enclosing quotes .
< EOL > matches the end - of - line character in the fig -Forth Terminal Input Buffer .
b) Line 9 shows a recursive production , < S > .
During the definition of a production , its name is automatically unSMUDGEd .
c ) Line 9 also shows a null alternative .
This is often encountered in BNF .
The null alternative parses no tokens , and is always satisfied .
d ) Not all parsing words need be written as BNF productions .
Line 6 is Forth code to parse any ASCII character , excluding parentheses and nulls .
Note that BNF : and ;BNF are used , not to create a production , but as an easy way to create a conditionally - executing ( per SUCCESS )
Forth word .
e ) Line 11 shows how to invoke the parser : SUCCESS is initialized to " true , " and the " topmost " BNF production is executed .
on its return , SUCCESS is examined to determine the final result .
f ) Line 11 also shows how end - of - input is indicated to the BNF parser : the sequence is defined as the desired BNF production , followed by end - of - line .
Screens 7 and 8 parse algebraic expressions with precedence .
This grammar is directly from [ AH077 ] , p. 138 .
The use of the productions < T '> and < E ' > to avoid the problem of left - recursion is described on p. 178 of that book .
Note also :
a ) < DIGIT > is defined " the hard way . "
It would be better to do this with a Forth word .
b ) < ELEMENT > requires a forward reference to < EXPRESSION > .
We must patch this reference manually .
Screens 9 through 11 show how this algebraic parser can be modified to perform code generation , coincident with the parsing process .
Briefly : each alternative of a BNF production includes Forth code to compile the output which would result from that alternative .
If the alternative succeeds , that output is left in the dictionary .
If it fails , the dictionary pointer is " backtracked " to remove that output .
Thus , as the parser works its way , top - down , through the parse tree , it is constantly producing and discarding trial output .
This example produces Forth source code for the algebraic expression .
a) The word , " appends a text string to the output .
b ) We have chosen to output each digit of a number as it is parsed .
( DIGIT ) is a subsidiary word to parse a valid digit .
< DIGIT > picks up the character from the input stream before it is parsed , and then appends it to the output .
If it was not a digit , SUCCESS will be false and ; BNF will discard the appended character .
If we needed to compile numbers in binary , < NUMBER > would have to do the output .
< NUMBER > could start by placing a zero on the stack as the accumulator .
< DIGIT > could augment this value for each digit .
Then , at the end of < NUMBER > , the binary value on the stack could be output .
c ) After every complete number , we need a space .
We could factor < NUMBER > into two words , like < DIGIT > .
But since < NUMBER > only appears once , in < ELEMENT > , we append the space there .
d ) In < PRIMARY > , MINUS is appended after the argument is parsed .
In < FACTOR > , POWER is appended after its two arguments are parsed .
< T '> appends * or / after the two arguments , and likewise < E '> appends + or -.
In all of these cases , an argument may be a number or a sub-expression .
If the latter , the entire code to evaluate the sub- expression is output before the postfix operator is output .
( Try it .
It works . )
e ) PARSE has been modified to TYPE the output from the parser , and then to restore the dictionary pointer .
7. Cautions
This parser is susceptible to the Two Classic Mistakes of BNF expressions .
Both of these cautions can be illustrated with the production < NUMBER > :
BNF : < NUMBER > < DIGIT > < NUMBER > | < DIGIT > ;BNF
a) Order your alternatives carefully .
If < NUMBER > were written
BNF : < NUMBER > < DIGIT > | < DIGIT > < NUMBER > ;BNF
then all numbers would be parsed as one and only one digit !
This is because alternative # 1 -- which is a subset of alternative # 2 -- is always tested first .
In general , the alternative which is the subset or the " easier to - satisfy " should be tested last .
b) Avoid " left- recursion . "
If < NUMBER > were written
BNF : < NUMBER > < NUMBER > < DIGIT > | < DIGIT > ;BNF
then you will have an infinite recursive loop of < NUMBER > calling < NUMBER > !
To avoid this problem , do not make the first term in any alternative a recursive reference to the production being defined .
( This rule is somewhat simplified ; for a more detailed discussion of this problem , refer to [ AH077 ] , pp. 177 to 179 . )
8. Comparison to " traditional " work
In the jargon of compiler writers , this parser is a " top - down parser with backtracking . "
Another such parser , from ye olden days of Unix , was TMG .
Top - down parsers are among the most flexible of parsers ; this is especially so in this implementation , which allows Forth code to be intermixed with BNF expressions .
Top - down parsers are also notoriously inefficient .
Predictive parsers , which look ahead in the input stream , are better .
Bottom - up parsers , which move directly from state to state in the parse tree according to the input tokens , are better still .
Such a parser , YACC ( a table - driven LR parser ) , has entirely supplanted TMG in the Unix community .
Still , the minimal call - and - return overhead of Forth should alleviate the speed problem somewhat , and the simplicity and flexibility of the BNF Parser may make it the parser of choice for many applications .
9. Applications and Variations
Compilers .
The obvious application of a BNF parser is in writing translators for other languages .
( This should certainly strenghten Forth 's claim as a language to write other languages . )
Command interpreters .
Complex applications may have an operator interface sufficiently complex to merit a BNF description .
For example , this parser has been used in an experimental lighting control system ; the command language occupied 30 screens of BNF .
Pattern recognition .
Aho & Ullman [ AH077 ] note that any construct which can be described by a regular expression , can also be described by a context - free grammar , and thus in BNF .
[ AH077 ] identifies some uses of regular expressions for pattern recognition problems ; such problems could also be addressed by this parser .
An extension of these parsing techniques has been used to impement a Snobol4 - style pattern matcher [ ROD89a ] .
Goal directed evaluation .
The process of searching the parse tree for a successful result is essentially one of " goal - directed evaluation . "
Many problems can be solved by goal - directed techniques .
For example , a variation of this parser has been used to construct an expert system [ ROD89 b ] .

We ’re sad to report that Andy Hughes , the acclaimed British DJ and producer , tragically passed away on June 12th due to what is being described as a “ short illness .
” The Middlesex native was 44 - years - old .
His passing was formally announced today in a press release issued by WME Entertainment , the U.S. agency that represents
The Orb , a band Hughes was a member throughout the 1990s .
As a member of the UK electro outfit , Hughes was instrumental in the band ’s rise in popularity , especially following the release of 1997 ’s Orblivion and the single “ Toxygene ” , which reached number four in the UK charts .
In addition to his work with The Orb , Hughes also produced for produced and remixed music for artists such as Kovak , Basement Jaxx , The Cranberries and Tangerine Dream .
Hughes ’ funeral will take place on June 27th at West Norwood Crematorium in London .
It will be open to the public .

The message of this book is going to be :
you can do more or less " anything " in lisp , and here are some examples .
The message will not be :
here 's how to do everything .
As one of my reviewers has put it :
The book is not a reference , nor could it be .
Common Lisp alone is far too big to cover at reference detail in a book this size and whose subject extends far beyond the language itself .
It 's more of an informal look at how practical lisp is - as a tool for today 's programmer .
It will miss stuff out , it will skirt around tricky areas , it will allude sketchily and unevenly to fine details .
The reference material is already available - in the HyperSpec , in CLtL2 , in Graham and in Seibel , in the documentation with implementations .
This book will point to that material , but is n't going to try to reproduce it .
Each topic
I 've looked at so far could be made the subject of its own book .
( " Persistence in Common Lisp - the Definitive Guide " ; " Multi- tasking in Common Lisp - the Definitive Guide " ; " Memory Management in Common Lisp - the Definitive Guide " ; and so forth .
Dream on . )
In particular , there are going to be several libraries worthy on mention in each chapter , several different solutions to each problem , and it was never an option to give them all proper coverage .
I have to limit myself .
By and large I 'm choosing one solution under each heading and giving it some fresh air .
It 's right and proper to include a mix of proprietary and non-proprietary libraries , to show off a variety of lisp implementations , and to filter the candidates so that the book is balanced and " works " as a whole .
I 'm always grateful for suggestions received and I certainly intend to give mention to worthy alternatives , but I can not include everything .
Notes :
[ 1 ] Chapter overflow
There is n't even the space to fully document any single library within its chapter .
I give a flavour , an assurance that : if you commit your organisation to developing in lisp , you wo n't regret it later .
As an example : my original plan for Part 3 was some permutation of
Persistence Iteration Threads Memory
The iteration chapter was to include ( non exhaustive list ) : AllegroCache 's support for walking over instances of persistent classes ; and Richard Waters ' " series " package .
I was looking forward to having an excuse to finally get my head round that .
But I found while writing 13 that I had about 50 % more material than I could fit into my budget of about 4000 words per chapter .
So I took the decision to drop " Iteration " and merge the AC material for that chapter into the overflow from 13 to create a new chapter 14 ( " Further Persistence " ) .
This decision may have been a mistake - it 's unbalanced to devote two chapters to a single topic when overall space is under such contention - and I intend to revisit it at the end of first draft .
I 'll be guided then by how badly other chapters have overflowed .
So far : " Threads " is a couple of pages over budget ; " Memory " is bang on .
[ 2 ] Comprehensive Survey
I did toy early on with the idea of proposing to O'Reilly that the book should be a comprehensive directory of lisp libraries .
Let 's leave aside the questions of whether such a volume could ever sell enough copies to justify itself before it became out of date , and whether it would be bought by anyone who was n't already a committed lisper .
I suspect O'Reilly would have rejected such a proposal on both these grounds , but as a thought experiment let 's ignore that for now .
Under each heading in such a book we'd try to locate all the available libraries .
For example , under " Persistence " we would expect to be thorough about listing all the SQL clones as well as all the " in lisp " solutions : Elephant , Rucksack , AllegroCache , ....
We'd then want to list which libraries worked on which platforms , which ones were currently maintained , how to get them up and working , what license they ran under , what the pros and cons were for each , all that fine stuff .
Quite a research project in its own right .
I think it 's reasonably widely acknowledged that this is something the lisp community really needs to see done .
Indeed some efforts have been made to get this or similar off the ground .
I 've been wondering whether the solution is for the community to find a way to pay some individual to spend a year or so on this doing it properly .
But it really did n't feel like something I could just fit in as a background activity while getting a book written ( and still spending the odd hour on the side keeping myself fed ) .

Adam McKay interview , The Goods , Will Ferrell , Anchorman , Talladega Nights
Movies Home / Entertainment Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
Adam McKay and Will Ferrell first met on the day they were both hired for “ Saturday Night Live , ” and their friendship has been a decidedly fruitful one .
The two collaborated on numerous “ SNL ” sketches , and when Ferrell left the show for the bright lights of Hollywood , their bond was strong enough that Will invited Adam to continue their collaboration in the world of film .
Since then , McKay has directed Ferrell in such comedy classics as “ Anchorman , ” “ Talladega Nights , ” and “ Step Brothers , ” but the two have also formed a production company which has brought us HBO ’s “ Eastbound and Down , ” “ The Foot Fist Way , ” and , most recently , “ The Goods : Live Hard , Sell Hard . ”
Bullz - Eye spoke with McKay about how he and Ferrell found their way into “ The Goods ” and how the film evolved after their entry into the mix , but he also chatted about the status of “ Anchorman 2 , ” the upcoming Jon Heder series that he ’s producing , his favorite unheralded “ SNL ” sketches , and … what ’s this about “ Hansel & Gretel : Witch Hunters ” ?
Adam McKay : Hey , Will !
Bullz - Eye : Hey , Adam , how ’s it going ?
AM : Good , man !
How are you doing ?
BE : Not bad .
You know , I was in the audience for your TCA presentation back in January ( “ You ’re Welcome , America : A Final Night with George W. Bush ” ) , where you appeared to us via satellite .
So I ’m sure you remember me .
AM : ( Laughs ) Oh , yes , of course .
It was a very intimate experience .
BE : It was like you were right there with us .
So you ’re one of the producers of “ The Goods : Live Hard , Sell Hard . ”
How did you get involved with the film in the first place ?
On producing " The Goods " : " Will ( Ferrell ) and I had written a car - salesman script about five or six years before that , which Lorne Michaels tried to get made at Paramount , but it was a weird time over there , and we could n’t get it made , and it was very frustrating .
So we saw this script come through , and we thought , ' Well , this is perfect . ' "
AM : You know , Will ( Ferrell ) ’s and my production company , Gary Sanchez Productions , we had the script brought to us – with Jeremy ( Piven ) attached – by producer Kevin Messick , who actually now works with us in Gary Sanchez .
Will and I had written a car - salesman script about five or six years before that , which Lorne Michaels tried to get made at Paramount , but it was a weird time over there , and we could n’t get it made , and it was very frustrating .
So we saw this script come through , and we thought , “ Well , this is perfect . ”
And Jeremy…oh , my God , if there ’s ever a role that you ’re going to have him play coming off the success he ’s had as Ari Gold ( in “ Entourage ” ) , it ’s this role .
And we thought , “ Well , we can do a rewrite on this , kind of gussy this up , get people we like in it , and sort of approach it through improve . ”
And that ’s exactly what we did .
Chris and I did a big rewrite on it , we got Neal Brennan , a director we really liked , in there , we cast people from our circle , and kind of approached it the same way we approach any of our movies , like “ Anchorman ” : an ensemble , improv , absurdist comedy .
And we ended up being really happy with it .
BE : I ’m sure the huge shadow of “ Used Cars ” was looming over the picture .
AM : Yeah , although it ’s funny : I ’d say 8 out of 10 people walking down the street do n’t know about “ Used Cars . ”
It ’s a film - fan movie .
I love it , of course , and “ Used Cars ” was part of the reason that we were attracted to car - salesman movies , but it was so long ago .
It ’s kind of amazing that there really have n’t been many car - salesman movies since then .
There was “ Cadillac Man , ” but that was n’t really about car sales .
My favorite salesman movies are “ Tin Men ” and “ Glengarry Glen Ross , ” and that ’s really what got us excited about it .
If anything , “ Glengarry Glen Ross ” was a huge influence on this movie .
Even though this movie ’s raunchy and absurd and silly , that vibe is still very funny to us .
BE : Did Mamet come in and do a rewrite ?
AM : Yeah , Mamet did .
He did a two - week punch - up . ( Laughs )
BE : Had any of you guys seen the film “ Slasher ” before ?
AM : Oh , yeah , I love that movie , too .
I ’d say that one and “ Used Cars ” are the two best car - salesman movies out there .
BE : As soon as I saw the description of “ The Goods , ” I thought , “ This sounds like a fictionalized version of ‘ Slasher . ’ ”
AM : Yeah , I guess you could say that .
I did n’t think of that , but , yeah .
I mean , the whole way that character was portrayed and the kind of vibe of it was obviously much more real and gritty .
We wanted more of a sort of supposed superhero salesman , who ’s rock ‘ n ’ roll and , y’know , “ Oh , my God , they ’ve got the life ! ”
But it turns out that they ’re all a little bit sad , if you look a little bit closer , whereas with “ Slasher , ” within five minutes , you knew that guy had that dichotomy going on .
BE : So with the films you and Will produce , how do you go about selecting the soundtrack ?
Because there have been a lot of cases where the music has been really influential to the feel of the film .
AM : You know , I ’m really into music and movies , and one of my favorite things to do is pair songs with scenes , so I was pretty involved with this one .
I came in a lot , I brought a lot of songs in for Neal to listen to .
Lately , the last couple of movies we ’ve done , we ’ve just gotten a little bored with … like , it seems like the catalog of songs you can reference has gotten a little light from the movies that have gotten made , so we ’ve actually started writing our own songs and producing them like they ’re actual singles .
There are about four songs in “ The Goods ” that are original songs that we wrote .
There ’s the theme song , “ The Goods , ” which I wrote the lyrics for and Lyle Workman did the music for .
We ’ve got an R&B song , “ Let ’s Make A Baby , ” which I wrote the lyrics for and Erica Weis did the music for .
Then , there ’s a couple of songs by a band called The English Teeth , from Austin , where I would just kind of send him a couple of lyrics , tell him the sound I wanted , and he would record the singles .
So that ’s something I ’m really enjoying doing .
We did it … there are about three original songs we wrote in “ Step Brothers ” that ended up being in there that I did with Jon Brion .
That ’s my favorite thing now .
So , yeah , soundtracks to me are huge .
Anytime you can get a song like “ Fox on the Run ” in a movie … I mean , I always just operate off the premise that , if I went and saw a movie and it had “ Fox on the Run ” in it , you can only hate it so much .
( Laughs )
BE : I would say the same of any film which has songs co-written by Jon Brion .
AM : I would definitely , definitely say that as well .
He ’s the best , that guy .
BE : I know you mentioned your circle of comedic friends who are in the film , but you had someone in there who has n’t been in one of your films before : Jordana Spiro , from “ My Boys . ”
AM : You know , Jordana Spiro auditioned for me for “ Step Brothers , ” and I really liked her a lot .
It was for the role that Kathryn Hahn ended up playing – Alice – and she just stuck with me .
You always have that happen .
Sometimes you ’ll have roles where you have , like , three really good people , so I just made a mental note .
“ That girl ’s really good . ”
She just kind of went for it , and she ’s obviously really beautiful and very cool .
I just was a fan of hers .
So when Neal was looking to cast that role , I sent over the audition tape from “ Step Brothers , ” and right away he was , like , “ Wow , she is good . ”
So that ’s kind of how that happened .
BE : How did you go about casting the role of Stu Harding ?
AM : That was Neal Brennan , one hundred percent .
He said , “ I ’m thinking of casting Alan Thicke . ”
And I sort of went , “ Huh . ” And he said , “ Trust me .
It ’s gonna be good . ”
And the second we screened the movie , the crowd responded .
I was , like , “ Thank God you cast Alan Thicke . ”
He also turned out to be funny and a great guy , so that was a minor genius move on Neal Brennan ’s part .
BE : Did anyone ask James Brolin for Streisand stories , or were they too scared ?
AM : I do n’t know .
I certainly did n’t .
But , boy , he was a champ as well .
He just got the joke .
He was great .
BE : Do some actors find it difficult to get the joke when they come from outside your circle ?
AM : Well , if they did , then we would n’t cast them , basically .
That ’s what you ’re always looking to see .
You want to see the skill level , you want to see someone open to play and not necessarily be stuck on the words , who can play it a little loose and get the vibe .
And part of all that is getting the joke .
If someone does n’t , you can generally tell right away .
Occasionally you ’ll get a character actor or a type who ’s just so good that you go , “ Screw it , I ’m gonna put him in here and just feed him lines . ”
But even then , they ’ve at least got to be open to being fed those lines .
But , y’know , I do n’t think we ’ve ever really had that happen .
Everyone we ’ve cast tends to get the joke and is down with it .
So we ’ve been really lucky in that sense .
“ I ’m a producer on ( ' Eastbound and Down ' ) , and I ’ve directed episodes , and I ’m obviously involved with notes and whatever , but I honestly just watch that show as a fan .
I just love it .
I was bummed that there were only six last time .
I was , like , ' Come on !
Ca n’t we do twelve ? ”
But we got eight , so I was happy .
At least that ’s more than six . ”
BE : I see that David Koechner is going to be in “ Fully Loaded . ”
AM : Yeah , that ’s right !
( Surprised )
How do you know about “ Fully Loaded ” ?
BE : IMDb , man .
AM : Damn !
That ’s my wife ’s movie .
BE : Oh , yeah ?
I just saw that you were executive producing it .
AM : Yeah , it ’s an independent movie that they did , and it ’s really good , actually .
It ’s very cool .
BE : I saw Koechner at the TCA Tour a few days ago , actually , because he’s in the new Kelsey Grammer series , “ Hank . ”
AM : That ’s right , he was telling me about that .
Have you seen an episode of it yet ?
BE : I did , actually .
AM : How was it ?
Was it decent ?
BE : It ’s not bad .
I ’m looking forward to seeing how it evolves .
AM : Yeah , you ’re right .
You ca n’t really judge these shows off their pilots .
BE : But it ’s by one of the guys who was behind “ Everybody Loves Raymond ” ( Tucker Cawley ) , so that alone makes me want to see how it ’s going to go .
AM : I ’m with you on that .
Yeah , you ’ve got to wait until they ’re about five episodes in before you can see what ’s up with these shows .
BE : Well , as long as we ’re on TV , I understand a second season of “ Eastbound and Down ” is at least semi-imminent .
AM : I would go full - on “ imminent ” on that one .
We get going in … I believe it ’s January that it kicks into full pre-production , although they ’re writing away right now .
But , yeah , we ’ve got 8 episodes that we ’re doing for HBO , and they ’ve sort of given us the whole story arc for the next season , and it is fantastic .
It ’s funny : I ’m a producer on that show , and I ’ve directed episodes , and I ’m obviously involved with notes and whatever , but I honestly just watch that show as a fan .
I just love it .
I was bummed that there were only six last time .
I was , like , “ Come on ! ” I was trying to get them to do as many possible this time .
I ’m , like , “ Ca n’t we do twelve ? ”
But we got eight , so I was happy .
At least that ’s more than six .
BE : I live in Chesapeake , VA , about fifteen minutes from the Carolina border , so …
AM : Oh , sure .
So you know that world , then .
BE : Yeah , it definitely spoke to me .
AM : Oh , God , yeah .
BE : Can you give a clue at all about what we can expect in the new season ?
AM : ( Hesitates )
Let ’s see if I can give a clue without wrecking anything .
I ’d say the question for this season is , “ Will Kenny return ? ” I do n’t know , I do n’t want to say anything .
I do n’t want to wreck it , because they have some cool ideas .
BE : I can dig it .
So what ’s the status of “ Anchorman 2 ” ?
I know it keeps bouncing around as being forthcoming , but …
AM : We ’re doing it .
I mean , it ’s just all about the scheduling .
There are just so many actors to pull together .
We have a very clear idea for it , we want to do it , and we ’ve talked to everyone , and everyone has said that they ’re in – I Tweeted back and forth with ( Christina ) Applegate , who seems like she ’s into it – but everyone has schedules .
Like , Carell , obviously , has a really tough schedule .
Koechner now has a really tough schedule .
And Paul Rudd .
So it ’s all about the lining - up .
Sadly , the second part after I say , “ We ’ll do it , ” is that it could be two or three years away .
But the nice thing is that none of those characters are age - dependent .
I mean , literally , I feel like these actors could be as old as 50 or 55 , and it ’d still be fine .
But , yes , we ’re dying to do it , we have a great idea , and it ’s all gonna be about pulling a lot of schedules together .
It ’s nice that everyone from that movie has gone on to do really well , but now we just have to line everybody up .
BE : So how did you and Will first come to work together ?
I know you worked together on “ Saturday Night Live , ” but did you know each prior before that ?
On the status of " Anchorman 2 " : " We have a very clear idea for it , we want to do it , and we ’ve talked to everyone , and everyone has said that they ’re in , but everyone has schedules .
Sadly , the second part after I say , ' We ’ll do it , ' is that it could be two or three years away . "
AM : No , I ’d never met him .
We all met the same day we were hired .
Koechner got hired , Ferrell , myself , another writer named Tom Gianis , and Cheri Oteri , and we all went out for beers .
I always joke that Will , when you meet him , is pretty unassuming , and I figured , “ Oh , he must be the straight guy that they hired . ”
But then at the first read - through , it was , like , “ Oh , no , he ’s not the straight guy at all ! ” ( Laughs ) Even though Ferrell is a great straight man .
But , yeah , to say that it was just Ferrell and me that hit it off is n’t right , because everyone loved writing for Ferrell .
And he ’s a great writer himself , so in that sense , writers really get along with him , and he ’s very easy to collaborate with .
But we just started writing a particular type of scene together that was just kind of strange , and only Ferrell was kind of able to pull it off , performance - wise , in order to get it on the show .
And we just kept loving these scenes we were writing that were so crazy , like Bill Brasky , “ Insane OB / GYN , ” “ Neil Diamond : Storytellers , ” and that kind of stuff .
And , then , obviously , I wrote a lot of the Bush stuff , too .
So when he started doing movies , y’know , he had an option , and he was , like , “ Hey , you wanna write something with me ? ”
And that ’s when we wrote the car - salesman script , “ August Blowout , ” and from there we just kept writing , and we wrote “ Anchorman ” and this other stuff .
So , yeah , it ’s been a long time since we met in 1995 .
BE : Do you have a favorite sketch from the “ SNL ” era that did n’t take off as a huge hit but that you still have a fondness for ?
AM : Oh , plenty of those .
( Laughs )
We had one that he loved so much that he actually put it on his second DVD , “ The Best of Will Ferrell , ” and it had Ferrell as an airline pilot , Tobey Maguire as the co-pilot , and Chris Parnell as the navigator .
Basically , the premise is just them being really awful to the passengers on the P.A. I always loved that one .
And then we loved the crazy OB / GYN who would tell expectant mothers just these horrible things and take long phone calls in the middle of tense medical evaluations .
We wrote a bunch of those .
I think we only got two on the air , maybe , but we wrote , like , five .
We just loved them .
And , then , Bill Brasky was the other one .
We just thought that was the funniest thing .
It has a little bit of a cult following , but it never became a bit hit .
But , oh , there are many , many more .
BE : Were you happy with “ You ’re Welcome , America ” ?
AM : Oh , very much .
That was one of those great projects where you really walk in not at all caring about what the critics are going to say , caring only about the money in the sense that you want people to come see it , but not really being concerned about that , either .
I mean , that show was eight years in the making , and it just was …the word “ cathartic ” is overused , but that was really a case where , God , we were able to let a lot of bad feelings go after that rough , dark eight years we went through .
It just felt so good to get up there and laugh and put a frame around it .
You know , the only shame of it is that …the director of our special , Marty Callner , did an amazing job , but nothing ever matches the live experience .
The people who saw it live had a totally different reaction to it , because it was just …
I mean , he was addressing the audience .
It was such an intimate kind of feeling .
But , yeah , that was one of my favorite things that we ’ve done .
BE : You ’re part of the upcoming Jon Heder project , his TV series .
Can you tell me a little bit about what to expect from that ?
AM : Well , we ’re still sort of putting together the pieces .
We have a couple of casting ideas for it , and we ’re talking to show runners right now , but the idea … the premise came from two things .
One was a love of Jon Heder , a feeling that we could sort of all collaborate together really well , and I think that we really appreciate what he does well when he ’s at his best .
We ’re big fans of his , and we want to spotlight him in that sense .
And the second thing is that it came from a belief that …well , there ’s nothing wrong with the sitcom form .
Even the multiple camera / studio audience form , there ’s nothing wrong with it .
It ’s just that the network development process got so broken , and they sort of stubbornly refused to change it at all , even though year after year it fails to produce anything .
So the idea of this show was , “ Let ’s go sell a large amount of them and set up a deal so that we do n’t have to do the dial testing and all of the overtesting and the notes from the 20 different people . ”
I think that ’s the only thing wrong with the half - hour comedy .
So that ’s where we came from creatively .
And , obviously , the excitement of collaborating with Heder .
BE : Last question , since I know we ’re up against the wall .
I know you ’ve got “ The Other Guys ” as the next film on your slate …
AM : Yeah .
I ’m actually here at the pre-production offices right now .
BE : Even better .
Any idea what ’s going to be forthcoming after that ?
AM : Not exactly .
I ’ve got this project that I was supposed to do where this slot is , called “ Channel Three Billion , ” a sci - fi satirical comedy movie that I really like a lot , and I was all ready to get going on it , but then this one kind of came across , and it just seemed so appropriate to everything going on that I was , like , “ Okay , screw it , let ’s go do it . ”
So I ’d like to get back into that .
And I ’m always open to other ideas , but eventually … I think that , first , I ’ve got to make the jump from the style of comedies that we do to something a little different .
Which I think “ The Other Guys ” will do , because it ’s more of an action comedy that ’s way more grounded than our other stuff .
But it ’ll still have the same sort of flair .
The step after that , though , is to do something even outside of that , something different like the sci - fi satire or something like that .
But , y’know , I just love movies , so we always say that we ’d love to do horror films , we ’d love to do action movies .
I ’m game for anything .
My favorite director right now is Zack Snyder .
I just think that guy is phenomenal , and I love what he does .
Movies like “ 300 ” and “ Watchmen ” and “ Dawn of the Dead , ” and I thought “ Sin City ” was really great … although that was n’t Snyder .
But I ’m really interested in that technique that ’s sort of , like , painting with movies , where it ’s animated but with a style .
I ’m dying to try something like that .
BE : I saw that you ’re at least semi-attached to “ Hansel & Gretel : Witch Hunters . ”
AM : Oh , I love that movie .
That ’s exactly the kind of shit where , like , it almost veers a little more toward Sam Raimi Land .
Yeah , our production company , Gary Sanchez , is producing that .
We saw “ Dead Snow , ” the movie that Tommy ( Wirkola ) did first , and Kevin Messick , who works with us now , had Tommy come in , and he told us about this “ Hansel & Gretel ” idea , and we were instantly , like , “ Oh , my God , we ’re doing that . ”
And then he wrote an amazing script , so , yeah , I ’m as excited about that as anything we ’re doing .
BE : All right , Adam , it ’s been great talking to you .
Here ’s hoping that word of mouth will help out “ The Goods ” this weekend .
: Yeah , so am I .
But , regardless , we ’re either gonna be a small little box office surprise or we ’re gonna be a cult cable hit .
( Laughs )
It ’ll be one way or the other .
But it certainly makes us laugh , so we ’re happy about that .
Good talking to you , Will .
Thanks a lot !

How Did Life Change After the Spanish Flu ( And How Might Ours Change Post - COVID - 19 ) ?
Early in 2020 , the novel coronavirus moved beyond the boundaries of China and quickly turned into a health threat for the entire world .
While some of ...
I saw this pic before reading the context .
Apart from it being full of electricity , it also has a cinematic counterpart equally electric .
I ’m talking about Back to the Future , when Doc gets nimble and Marty hits the magic speed that sends him , well , back to the future .
This scene is ingrained in the spirit of our times :
Doc , the spitting image of a white - haired scientist , loses the plug for added suspense .
He zip - lines down to street level for the retrieval , but he has to be quick about it ; history , as he knows very well , will only gives him one try .
Meanwhile Marty , in his cool red vest , works the clutch and the flux capacitor .
The plug back in its outlet , the DeLorean at 88 mph , lightning strikes the courthouse at the precise moment necessary for time travel .
The stainless steel car disappears , leaving a spinning license plate and a skid mark of flames .
Doc does a loon dance in the street .
The pic at the top ( as opposed to the pic in the middle ) , however , is n’t from Universal Studios ; it is n’t a movie set , but rather a real - life snapshot of City Hall in Athens , Georgia as a series of storms straddled the area .
Fires were sparked and 4,000 people lost their power .
Kelly Lambert was there with her camera .

Reckless Formula
One drivers have been warned that the introduction of a ‘ football - style ’ penalty points system may lead to them facing race bans in future .
Discussions into the viability of a revised punishment system for dangerous or other irregular driving are expected to take place at next weekend ’s Spanish Grand Prix and could be introduced later this year .
ADVERTISEMENT
International Motoring Federation ( FIA ) race director Charlie Whiting is due to meet the teams at a meeting of the Sporting Working Group think - tank ahead of the Barcelona race to discuss potential future rule changes .
“ It ’s a complex question and we need to get the balance right because banning a driver is a serious issue , ” he said .
“ We need to make sure a driver genuinely deserves any ban .
“ We will be monitoring offences and running a ( hypothetical ) system in the background to see how it would all work if put into practice .
We need to do that for a while . ”
Although there has been some support for the new idea from a number of teams , there has not yet been the necessary unanimous approval required .
If this changes , a new rule could be drafted in this season .
Teams and drivers are anxious that a series of relatively minor infringements by a driver could lead to a ban .
ADVERTISEMENT
Whiting said that the FIA were mindful of this problem and that a ban could be out of context with a driver ’s general conduct and that is why he and his assistants were analysing and trialling the possible systems .
The drivers , in general , are understood to be keen for the system to be brought in to replace the existing unpredictable way of handling misdemeanours and using fines and grid penalties .
Last season , several serial offenders on the track emerged after a spate of first - lap accidents and later collisions and other incidents .
ADVERTISEMENT
These included Venezuelan Pastor Maldonado of Williams , who was involved in several crashes , and Frenchman Romain Grosjean of Lotus , who was in seven opening - lap crashes in 12 races .
The Grand Prix Drivers ’ Association ( GPDA ) had sought clarification from the FIA about why drivers were still being fined for speeding this year when a deal agreed for an increase in super - licence fees was supposed to have stopped financial penalties .
ADVERTISEMENT
Following discussions with the FIA , the GPDA has been happy to hold fire on the fines issue until the penalty points issue is resolved .

Three wonderful WPA tourism promotion posters , smoothly converted into pro-oil posters .
In case the WPA abbreviation is new to you , it stands for Works Progress Administration and was the largest of the American New Deal agencies during the Great Depression of the 1930's .
Mainly , it employed people who would otherwise have gone unemployed in building bridges , schools , parks and so on , but also had a host of talented artists on board , some of whom churned out one outstanding poster after another .
Like the originals these are based on , many promoted various US tourist sites to americans .
While I 'll be the first person to advocate a critical look at the motives behind wars , looking beyond the lofty ideals and rosy rhetoric modern leaders are so good at delivering nowadays ( liberty , democracy , peace etc. ) , the pedantic know - it - all in me must protest the suggestion that all wars today are fought for oil .
With recent kerfuffles in Iraq , Nigeria and Sudan in mind , it 's an easy assumption to make , but recent or ongoing wars in Colombia , Pakistan , Sri Lanka and the Gaza strip suggests otherwise .
But of course , I realize that 's probably taking this poster a bit too serious .
A cynic ( or a realist as he would call himself ) would not have much trouble arguing that this short maxim is what 's at the heard of US foreign policy .
You wo n't find the American president making such claims , nor the Pentagon or State Department , Americans have always been experts at expressing their foreign goals in purely idealistic terms .
I for my part do not believe that everything that country does abroad is power politics and cynicism , veiled in pretty words .
Instead of launching into a long , boring argument about what the United States are really up to abroad , I 'll quote British historian Arnold Toynbee to sum up some of the essence ; " America is a large , friendly dog in a very small room .
Every time it wags its tail , it knocks over a chair . "
Clever coupling of a message that at first glance seemingly has nothing to do with the imagery in the poster .
You get the feeling that it 's a puzzle ( albeit a simple one ) , waiting for you to solve it .
A simple , frivolous parody of an old Nazi poster , supporting the raising of funds for the construction of youth hostels .
A wonderful original poster looking nicely authoritarian , which coupled with an utterly trivial theme makes it wonderfully absurd .
The theme , to my understanding , is Kermit the Frog arguing with a t - shirt salesman , found in this Sesame Street scene , a classic according to those who understand such matters .
It 's the middle of the night outside of Berlin .
Dr. Goebbels sleeps fitfully , as if he knows something mean is lurking in the woods outside .
The window of his picturesque little cabin is open , nothing but the cold night air moving through .
A strong breeze beats through the forrest , trees creaking .
The man moving through the cloudy night casts no shadows , makes no noise .
Minutes later , he 's through the window and inside .
No lubrication , just two strong arms and one very long glove .
When it 's all over , the man vanishes into the night .
A note is left on the floor :
You just got served .
- The U.S. Proctological Corps
If there was one thing US propagandists during World War II loved making , it was homo - erotic posters showing sweaty , muscly men handling huge phallic objects .
This manly man , stroking a lumbering hunk of shiny brass and boom - boom - powder is a case in point .
How many times have we not heard of some bizarre , synthetic drug being invented by one country 's military or the other , not to mention villains in movies and games , such as Max Payne , always with the aim of creating the super - soldier .
Amphetamine and methamphetamine were particularly popular in most major forces of World War II , used to prevent fatigue .
Supposedly , Hitler was administered daily doses of meth .
Amphetamine was still in use among US forces as late as 2003 , when four Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan were killed by friendly fire served by two American pilots high on amphetamine , an event this poster aludes to .
A simple , stupid and hilarious parody of an exuberant Soviet poster promoting farm collectivization at the start of the 1930's .
Eat your Luftwaffles .
They are so light and fluffy !
Jamming in a crude waffle and making a rather obvious , cheap play on the name of Germany 's airforce , this parody is really to simple and silly , but I think it 's wonderful for just that reason .
I mean , just look at that waffle !
It 's huge !
The Soviet Union , being rather big and not swamped in transportation infrastructure , could use some good aircraft to reach remote areas .
Thus , it became the origin of some insane pieces of aviation design , stuff that would humble anything used by FedEx , or any other modern western airlines for that matter .
There 's the Mil V - 12 , the world 's largest helicoper , the Beriev Albatros jet - powered sea-plane , the Antonov 225 transport aircraft , heaviest airplane in the world , and of course , the fabulous Caspian Sea Monster .
Luckily for aviation geeks like myself , some present - day Russians retain that sense of brilliant madness which inspired these planes , and Beriev are now supposedly developing an heir to the Sea Monster , called the BE - 2500 , only it 'll be five times as heavy , if it 's ever built .
The Spoon ?
A real - life movement , perhaps inspired by The Wave ?
More likely , it 's some pointless , ironic Internet meme ( or upcoming meme ) , though it 's new to me .
Cool artwork in any case , with obvious Soviet propaganda styling .
Modern Drunkard Magazine is an actual American magazine which seems to love nothing more than ripping of old ads and propaganda posters as a source of effective and funny graphic material .
Their " Hate mail " section , with their own respons and commentary , is quite amusing ( " I was a little busy , so I lazily fell back on the classic You Remind Me of Hitler Defense " ) .
Parodies of the iPod silhouette adverts have been standard fare on the web for a while now , but happily , there are still good fun to be had from them , and it 's very necessary .
I 'm tired of having to explain that " no , it 's not an iPod , it 's an Mp3 - player " whenever someone spots my Sanza Fuze and start feeling that fond feeling of Apple brotherhood with me .
For the record , no , I 'm not advocating taking a Katana to any and all iPod users .
Seeing as I 've got quite a few misguided pod-bearing friends , that would be awfully bad manners of me .
Supposedly based on the poster of some French sci- fi movie .
I have no idea what it 's called , but by the looks of the poster , it 's about lumpy stormtroopers or Michelin Men in a Munch - esque landscape , which I 'd say is a good premise for any sci-fi .
Another two takes on the phallic ordnance theme .
For more of the same , see my earlier post on US propaganda posters .
Oh , hang on , this is n't a parody , it 's the real deal .
These posters appeared in London during October of 2002 , and are dead serious .
I feel fairly sure that if something like this had turned up in my neighborhood , it would have turned me into an instant vandal , leaving this rubbish up would not have been an option .
They 're so ridiculously big brother , you would n't even find this stuff in the Stalin - era Soviet Union .
What were they thinking ?!?
Those eyes floating in the sky should do a good job scaring the public shitless .
The fact that their pupils are made up of the London Buses logo does n't help , they 're red , evil and up to no good .
Stellar advice that everyone would do well to remember .
I 'm a young guy , but I feel old when I think back to when , for a short period between Beta versions 5 to 7 , I played Counterstrike .
That 's around 10 years ago , and every now and then , I hear that it 's still hugely popular , and I scratch my head and wonder why , I never really got it .
But of course , I still enjoy the original Colonization and Police Quest games , so who am I to question Counterstrikes continued popularity ?
An old joke that wo n't get old .
For the last 150 years , France 's military record is less than illustrious .
In the 1860 's the silly Emperor Napoleon III ( nephew of the original Bonaparte ) decided that invading Mexico would be a good idea .
It was n't .
Then , in 1870 , the infinitely brighter Prussian " iron chancellor " Otto von Bismarck tricked the same emperor into launching the Franco - Prussian war , in which France was thoroughly pummeled , and Napoleon III fled into exile .
Then the First World War came along , again pitting France against Germany , and while it was technically a french victory , that was only thanks to British and American assistance .
Determined not to suffer another humiliation at the hands of the Germans , the French constructed the impregnable Maginot defense line on their German border .
Unfortunately , the French had forgot about the existence of Belgium on their northern border , which the Germans used as a back - door into France in the summer of 1940 .
The post - war years were spent loosing guerilla wars against colonial insurgents in Algeria and Indo - China .
The most recent inspiration for this poster , I assume , was President Jaques Chirac 's opposition to the US attack on Iraq , which was popularly interpreted as a sign of French cowardice and defeatism .
All this of course overlooks the fact that France for more than 200 years up until the defeat of Napoleon I in 1814 was Europe 's most powerful nation , by far .
At its apex , under Napoleon I , France controlled half of continental Europe .
Another excellent WPA tourism poster .
The WPA posters really are a treasure trove of wonderful graphic material .
If you like this stuff , check out the Library of Congress ' 900 + collection of WPA posters .
The website might be a bit dull , and many posters look a tad faded , but there 's no mistaking the quality of these posters .
London seems to have a knack for weird security - related posters .
Again , this is an original , appearing around London in February of 2008 .
Keeping in mind that London is one of the foremost tourist - attracting cities in the world , attracting millions of camera - touting tourists each year , I 'm wondering what the various police agencies of London would regard as a successful response to this campaign .
After all , what 's an odd photographer ?
Brown skin or a good tan ?
Beards ?
Turbans ?
How can you realistically expect lay people to be able to spot suspect people with cameras scouting targets , without it turning into a massive source of irrelevant reports ?
Naturally , a rosary - toating fellow with a strange hat pushing a wheelbarrow of gunpowder kegs towards Parliament is suspect , but who would n't report that ?
A parody on the former poster , referring also to the horrific murder of electrician Jean Charles de Menezes at the hands of London Metropolitan Police officers at a tube station in July of 2005 .
Of Brazilian extraction , de Menezes apparently looked a bit too " terroristy " for his own good .
I 'd love to hear the background of the situation depicted , the guys expression seems to suggest he 's about to experience a summary execution , or the very least , being thrown in the dungeons for life , along with his entire family .
In our post on American propaganda , we included the Darth Vader - like original .
In part 1 of this mini-series , the menacing Jerry under the helmet had been replaced by a similarly spooky John Ashcroft , robbing your civil liberties .
To round off this post , we 've got the usually friendly childhood favourite Waldo , doing his usual hiding business , albeit dressed rather uncharacteristically and looking not - so - nice with bloodshot eyes .

Tragedy on the Moscow River as boaters hit high - voltage line A weekend outing quickly turned nightmarish when boaters became entangled in a low - hanging electrical wire spanning the Moscow River .
Brussels , 18 August 2009 : The ITUC , together with TUCA , and the CUTH , CTH and CGT , its Honduran affiliates , have denounced the repression , forced disappearances , extrajudicial executions and the use of firearms suffered by those taking part in peaceful demonstrations held to protest against the coup d’état and to demand the restitution of the constitutional president , Manuel Zelaya .
The international trade union mission , led by the Trade Union Confederation of the Americas ( TUCA / ITUC ) and the Global Union Federations ( GUFs ) , which visited Honduras between 5 and 8 August , called for , among other demands , an international day of solidarity with the Honduran people on 11 August as well as supporting the initiatives of the Honduran trade union movement to promote the construction of a new socio-political environment and the formulation of policy proposals to create a new future for the country .
On 12 August , tens of thousands of Hondurans took part in the national protest march against the coup , covering over 120 kilometres .
The march unfortunately met with brutal repression by the de facto government .
Several people trying to escape the police brutality during the march took refuge in the STIBYS trade union office in Tegucigalpa , which was surrounded by the police and military forces for over two hours until the international press intervened and the demonstrators managed to leave the building safely .
On the same day , after curfew , unknown assailants shot at the office of Vía Campesina of Honduras , an organisation led by campesino leader Rafael Alegría , in another clear attack against the social organisations and leaders heading the resistance against the coup d’état .
" These attacks are inadmissible .
Social and trade union organisations have an important role to play in the reconstruction of this country .
The reconstruction of Honduras depends on the immediate restitution of the constitutional president , Manuel Zelaya , " said Guy Ryder , general secretary of the ITUC .
Two crucial events are to take place in Honduras in the coming days : the visit of a mission from the Inter - American Commission on Human Rights and , shortly after , a mission of foreign ministers from the OAS and Secretary General Insulza , to promote the de facto government ’s approval of the San José Agreement .
In a letter ( in Spanich ) to the Secretary of State for Public Security the ITUC called for respect for demonstrators ’ rights , for the immediate , safe return of the almost 200 people who have been " disappeared " , the restoration of constitutional order and the achievement of national reconciliation .
The ITUC represents 170 million workers in 312 affiliated national organisations from 157 countries .

Let ’s see if we can have a reasoned discussion about end - of - life counseling .
We might start by asking Sarah Palin to leave the room .
I ’ve got nothing against her .
She ’s a remarkable political talent .
But there are no “ death panels ” in the Democratic health - care bills , and to say that there are is to debase the debate .
( Emphasis mine )
I came across this op - ed by Charles Krauthammer on some right wing site :
Quackhammer then proceeds to repeat the very meme he was to debunk , i.e. that ObamaCare will eat your grandmother .
Schizophrenic much ?
No , say the defenders .
It ’s just that we want the doctors to talk to you about putting in place a living will and other such instruments .
Really ?
Then consider the actual efficacy of a living will .
When you are old , infirm and lying in the ICU with pseudomonas pneumonia and deciding whether to ( a ) go through the long antibiotic treatment or ( b ) allow what used to be called “ the old man ’s friend ” to take you away , the doctor will ask you at that time what you want for yourself — no matter what piece of paper you signed five years earlier .
You are told constantly how very important it is to write your living will years in advance .
But the relevant question is what you desire at the end — when facing death — not what you felt sometime in the past when you were hale and hearty and sitting in your lawyer ’s office barely able to contemplate a life of pain and diminishment .
Well , as pain and diminishment enter your life as you age , your calculations change and your tolerance for suffering increases .
In the ICU , you might have a new way of looking at things .
Aha .
Health care reform will make you not want to spend another six months hooked to a machine , unable to leave your bed , while life goes on and your kids ’ inheritance gets drained and you watch your family ’s whispered arguments over who has to stay with you .
Sounds great — where do I sign up for this wonderful program ?
Death , like taxes , is inevitable ; this reality is slowly filtering into the minds of Medicare patients , so in the wake of his schizoid opening Quackhammer attempts another mixed message .
After arguing that living wills are bad , he admits he has nothing against them .
He even proceeds to offer a precis of his own living will — “ more a literary document , ” he claims — complete with baseball metaphors .
Because legal documents are well - known for their literary value to baseball fans .
There ’s no scenario in Quackhammer ’s mind where patients are no longer able to announce these decisions for themselves .
Furthermore , what he ’s denouncing is an amendment that would merely pay your doctor to have a conversation with you .
His Wacky ™ would only guarantee the poor do n’t have as much preparation as the “ literary . ”
But back to Teh Crazy™ .
Quackhammer drew fire from conservatives ; he was panned by Hot Air and Little Green Footballs .
But in the minds of the most rabid Palin supporters , he committed the ultimate sacrilege : implying that Miss Alaska is not smart .
Several blogs denounced him , and the comments were vicious .
But reading the blogs , I realized something : even on the right , belief in “ death panels ” is starting to peak as more and more media sources debunk the rumor .
In fact , it is just about the only rumor being consistently debunked .
Krauthammer is making an ill - advised attempt to eject Teh Crazy ™ and shock new life into a dead talking point — he ’s a witch doctor blowing powder and shouting buggidyboo to raise up some Zombie Outrage™ .
Someone should tell him that Sarah has a serious problem with witch doctors .

Bryan Singer is best known for the X - Men movies
Bryan Singer will direct and produce a film version of the TV series Battlestar Galactica , reports say .
Trade magazine Variety claims he has signed up to make the science fiction movie , despite unconfirmed reports that he was linked to another X - Men film .
Battlestar Galactica started as a TV mini series in the US in 1978 and the pilot was subsequently shown in UK cinemas .
It was revived in 2003 in a new version starring Edward James Olmos .

Meanwhile , Christopher McQuarrie , who wrote Singer 's 1994 movie The Usual Suspects , has signed up to write a Wolverine sequel , according to The Hollywood Reporter .
Australian actor Hugh Jackman is expected to return as the Marvel Comics character and will also co-produce the film .
The studio commissioned a sequel after the first movie , X - Men Origins : Wolverine , made $ 363 m ( £ 217 m ) worldwide .
Pam Spaulding happened upon this character named Steven Anderson , who preaches from the pulpit at Faithful Word Baptist Church in Tempe , Arizona .
I compiled some of the more , ah , interesting bits from the sermons I surveyed into the 20 - minute audio above .
As you can hear , this is pure eliminationism with a Biblical veneer .
First he demands that all gays and lesbians face the death penalty :
The same God who instituted the death penalty for murders is the same god who instituted the death penalty for rapists and for homosexuals , sodomites and queers !
That 's what it was instituted for , okay ?
That 's God , he has n't changed .
Oh , God does n't feel that way in the New Testament ...
God never " felt " anything about it , he commanded it and said they should be taken out and killed .
You know why God wanted the sodomites in the Old Testament to be killed ?
You know why every good king of Israel , the Bible says they got rid of the sodomites in the land ?
You know , the good kings that came after the bad kings who had allowed the sodomites to infest their land , they had infiltrated ...
King Asa got the sodomites out of the land , Jehoshaphat exterminated the sodomites that were left from the days of his father , Asa .
Why ?
Because the sodomites are infectious , that 's why .
Because they 're not reproducers , that goes without saying , they 're recruiters .
How are they multiplying ?
Do you not see that they 're multiplying ?
Are you that blind ?
Have you noticed that there 's more than there were last year and the year before , and the year before that ?
How are they multiplying ?
They 're reproducing right ?
No , here 's a biology lesson : they 're not reproducers , they 're recruiters !
And you know who they 're after ?
Your children .
Remember you dropped off your kids last week ?
That 's who they 're after .
You drop them off at some daycare , you drop them off at some school somewhere , you do n't know where they 're at .
I 'll tell you where they 're at : they 're being recruited by the sodomites .
They 're being molested by the sodomites .
I can tell you so many stories about people that I know being molested and recruited by the sodomites .
They recruit through rape .
They recruit through molestation .
They recruit through violation .
They are infecting our society .
They are spreading their disease .
It 's not a physical disease , it 's a sin disease , it 's a wicked , filthy sin disease and it 's spreading on a rampage .
Ca n't you see that it 's spreading on a rampage ?
I mean , can you not see that ?
Can you not see that it 's just exploding in growth ?
Why ?
Because each sodomite recruits far more than one other sodomite because his whole life is about recruiting other sodomites , his whole life is about violating and hurting people and molesting 'em .

Then he rips into Barney Frank , blaming him for the economic collapse :
I 'm here to preach the Bible .
And I 'm sick to death -- hey , let me tell you something .
Our country is run by faggots .
You know who wrote this 700 - billion - dollar bailout bill ?
You know who was the man who was the architect of the bailout ?
His name is Barney Franks , he is a pedophile , he has been arrested for uh , interacting with boys that are in their teenage years when he's in his 50s , it 's in the news , he 's been arrested for it .
He is a pedophile , he is a homosexual , he has stood up in the floor of the sacred halls of justice and said , ' I am gay , I am a sodomite . '
That 's Barney Frank , that 's who just sold our country into fascism .
That 's who just sold our corporations to the government .
That 's who sold out our country , a faggot !
And I 'm here to tell you something !
I 'm not going to stand for it , and let a faggot run the church !
It 's bad enough that we 've got a bunch of faggots running the government !
Most disturbing of all , you can hear him , in his Aug. 16 sermon titled " I Hate Barack Obama , " not only openly avow his complete and utter hatred of the president , but openly wish for his death -- because of his support for abortion rights and the " lewdness " he supposedly has brought to American society .
His key motif , inspired by one of King David 's imprecatory prayers against his enemies , is to compare Obama to a slug or snail and wishing he could pour salt on him :
Yeah , God appointed him to destroy this country for the wickedness of the United States of America .
God appointed him because that 's what our country has turned into .
That 's who we deserve as a president .
But let me tell you something : I do n't love Barack Obama .
I do n't respect Barack Obama .
I do n't obey Barack Obama .
And I 'd like Barack Obama to melt like a snail tonight .
Because he needs to recompense , he needs to reap what he 's sown .
You see , any Christian will tell you that someone who commits murder should get the death penalty .
Because that 's what it says in Genesis Chapter 9 , that 's what it says in the Mosaic Law , that 's what it teaches us throughout the Bible .
' Who so sheds man 's blood , by man shall his blood be shed . '
' From the image of God created he Man . '
And when Barack Obama is gonna push his partial birth abortion , his salty saline solution abortion , hey , he deserves to be punished for what he 's done .
I 'm not going to pray for God to bless Barack Obama .
This is my prayer tonight to Barack Obama .
... Now , look , if somebody wants me , it somebody twisted my arm and tells me to pray for Barack Obama , this is what I 'm going to pray , because this is the only prayer that applies to him : ' Break his teeth , O God , in his mouth .
You know , as a snail which melteth , let him pass away .
Like the untimely birth of a woman , that he thinks -- he calls it a woman 's right to choose , you know , he thinks it 's so wonderful .
He ought to be aborted .
It ought to be , ' Abort Obama . '
He goes on to equate Obama with Hitler , Stalin , and Jeffrey Dahmer .
Then he explains :
You say why are you preaching this , you know what ?
Because it makes me mad .
I 'm mad .
I do n't know about you , but I 'm fed up tonight .
I 'm angry tonight .
Because I 'm angered by a bunch of preachers who want to sit back , and let America go to hell , let our freedoms go to hell , let the souls of Americans go to hell , and we all just sit back and just , we 're comfortable , we 're lazy , we 're lukewarm , we 're neither cold nor hot , and we want to come to church and have our ears tickled .
Hey !
This is n't to tickle your ears , it 's to give you a swift kick in the pants tonight !
' Cuz that 's what you need every once in awhile ! ...
But I 'm here to tell you tonight , that God is a God of wrath and vengeance .
And that 's the message that oughta be thundering from every pulpit in America today .
People oughta be trembling today .
People in America oughta be scared to death and trembling !
And saying , ' Oh God !
What are you gonna do to our country ?!
Oh , God !
Are we gonna be able to survive ?!
Oh , God !
Are you gonna allow us to go into the depths of socialism , and communism with Barack Obama !?'
Anderson goes on to mangle Obama 's personal history , buying whole into the " birther " mythology that Obama was actually born in Kenya ( using a bevy of racist stereotypes along the way ) , and then says that people like Obama are " so wicked " that they become " animals " who are " not human " and " past feeling . "
That leads to this :
Let me tell you something : Barack Obama has wrought lewdness in America .
America has become lewd .
What does lewd mean ?
L-E - W - D? [ Pause ] Obscene .
Right ?
Dirty .
Filthy .
Homosexuality .
Promiscuity .
All of the -- everything that 's on the billboard , the TV .
Sensuality .
Lewdness !
We do n't even know what lewdness means anymore !
We 're just surrounded by it , inundated with it !
...
And yet you 're going to tell me that I 'm supposed to pray for the socialist devil , murderer , infanticide , who wants to see young children and he wants to see babies killed through abortion and partial - birth abortion and all these different things -- you 're gonna tell me I 'm supposed to pray for God to give him a good lunch tomorrow while he's in Phoenix , Arizona .
Nope .
I 'm not gonna pray for his good .
I 'm going to pray that he dies and goes to hell .
When I go to bed tonight , that 's what I 'm going to pray .
And you say , ' Are you just saying that ? '
No .
When I go to bed tonight , Steven L. Anderson is going to pray for Barack Obama to die and go to hell .
You say , ' Why would you do that ? '
That our country could be saved .

Luca Badoer says he is under no illusions that he needs to improve a lot after a troubled first day back in Formula 1 in Valencia on Friday .
As well as struggling for pace in his first race weekend since the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix , Badoer 's only notable achievement was getting caught speeding in the pit - lane a record four times in one session .
Those offences earned him a reprimand and three separate fines totalling 5,400 Euros and left onlookers joking that he was faster in the pit -lane than he was on the track .
AUTOSPORT understands that all the speeding offences were caused by Badoer readjusting from the 100 km / h he is used to in testing to the 60 km/h demanded in practice , which calls for different braking distances .
Despite the difficulties of the day , which he ended 18th overall and 1.3 seconds adrift of team - mate Kimi Raikkonen , Badoer felt that , considering the circumstances , it was not a total disaster .
However , he conceded that things would need to improve by a considerable margin especially if Ferrari was not going to reconsider its plan to keep him in the car until the injured Felipe Massa is ready to return .
" I did the programme that the team was expecting from me , " Badoer told reporters after the end of the opening day of practice for the European Grand Prix .
" We have to improve a lot and we have to work a lot .
But considering the situation that without driving in eight months and it's the first time for me on this track , I am very happy with the job I did today .
I made no mistakes , I did n't crash , I just drive to learn the track .
Finally , it was a positive day for me . "
Badoer felt that his showing had not been helped by the fact that his return to F1 came on a track that he did not know .
" I have a double difficulty because the track is new , " he said .
" It 's difficult in F1 to find the limit .
You can arrive immediately at one second , but the last second is very difficult to bring it down , especially if you have a new circuit .
" So for me it was really difficult today but it was on the programme to arrive at this level .
The difference with Kimi in lap time was not so big , so I think that we did a great job .
" Obviously we have a lot of work to do this afternoon and tomorrow because I want to be in a better position tomorrow . "
With Badoer 's day having turned out far from ideal , the Italian also admitted that his own feelings on his F1 return had changed since the morning following the excitement , interest and goodwill that had pervade since it was announced he would be used instead of Michael Schumacher .
" Until last night I was dreaming and flying and thinking I 'm very happy , but this morning I brought myself down to earth and thought that now it is the day I have to work , " he said .
" I worked a lot with my engineer and this is the future .
The dreaming is finished and now I need the result . "
And although Kimi Raikkonen made it clear his focus would be on his own racing rather than helping Badoer , the Italian at least had some help in the form of Schumacher .
" In every way he is supporting me on both the morale and the technical side , " said Badoer about Schumacher .
" I 'm very happy that he 's here for me . "

Nonverbal Behaviour
Nonverbal behaviour is an area of psychology that receives stacks of media attention .
There are endless popular psychology pieces claiming to teach you how to tell if someone is lying or whether they like you or not .
All well and good , these things are really useful to know .
But where popular accounts often fail is they tend to be simplistic .
This series takes a look at some of the more novel and sophisticated approaches to research in non-verbal communication .
We start with a study on the ‘ temporal dynamics of smiling ’ followed by an investigation of gender differences in reading nonverbal behaviour .
A Slow Smile Attracts
“ Some of the best known research on smiling is about how people judge an authentic smile – the so - called ‘ Duchenne smile ’ or the ‘ crinkly - eyed smile ’ .
What this research asks , though , is how does a smile ’s speed in combination with head - tilt and gender affect its perception . ”
Gender Differences in Reading Nonverbal Behaviour
“ Some psychologists , in testing understanding of nonverbal behaviour , have found that women fare better than men .
While this might be explained by some experiential , or even intrinsic , failing in men , new research suggests it might have more to do with interpersonal goals . ”
How do Emoticons and Capitalisation Affect Perception of Email ?
“ Psychologists have theorised our motivation for generating meaning is reducing levels of uncertainty and helping predict other people ’s behaviour .
This might explain how , in emails , even two simple things like capitalisation and emoticons can have important effects on reader ’s perceptions . ”
The Nonverbal Symphony of Attraction
“ Glossy magazine articles on the body language of attraction often quote two vital nonverbal factors : posture mirroring and movement echo .
While they both play a role , research suggests it ’s not the individual movements that tell the story of attraction between two people , but the emerging patterns . ”
Busting The Myth 93 % of Communication is Nonverbal
“ The idea the vast majority of communication occurs nonverbally is quoted everywhere from advertising to popular psychology articles .
In fact the original experiments from which these findings derive have been seriously questioned . ”
Meaning and Memory in Gesture
“ A strange thing happens when talking we usually do n’t notice – our hands move .
They draw precise shapes , caress invisible objects , punch the air and quiver .
What is the point of all this hand waving ? ”
Detecting Lies : Top 3 Myths , Top 5 Proven Factors
“ Lies are extremely difficult to detect .
Research shows the average person barely does any better than chance .
Part of the reason may be there ’s so much misinformation about how to detect lies floating around . ”
Which Culture Most Controls Their Facial Emotions ?
“ According to some research it ’s Russians !
And the least control over facial emotions ?
Americans .
These are just two relatively new findings to emerge from studying cultural differences in nonverbal behaviour . ”
Frown and the Net Frowns With You , But Smile and You Smile Alone
“ That ’s according to a study which assessed the effects of smileys :) and frownies :( as I ’m now calling them .
Walther and D’Addario ( 2001 ) found that while smileys had no effect on the way a message was interpreted , frowns did reduce the positivity of positive messages . ”
Achieving Rapport : Expressivity , Coordination and Flow
“ There are any number of reasons why rapport is important : we need rapport to influence others , to teach and learn , to achieve difficult tasks in groups and even to mate .
The latest research reveals gaining rapport is not just about matching body language and being positive … ”
Education Reduces Cross -Cultural Misunderstanding of Nonverbal Behaviour
“ When nonverbal behaviour varies across cultures , it ’s easy to misunderstand someone from a different culture to your own .
Despite this , when learning a foreign language , there ’s not much focus on nonverbal behaviour .
Perhaps there should be . ”

The South Bay of Los Angeles in its broadest definition includes all cities south of the 105 freeway and places west of Long Beach .
It includes places like Manhattan Beach , Hermosa Beach , and today ’s Real Home of Genius city Redondo Beach .
Now I know today people are jumping up left and right like a kid juiced up on sugary drinks because existing home sales have increased .
This headline is plastered all over the mainstream media .
But did you also know that the median sales price fell 15.1 percent last year to the current median sale price of $ 178,400 ?
Oh , and distressed sales accounted for 31 percent of all existing homes sold .
What you should get from this is simple .
Cheaper prices will drive sales even with conventional 30 year mortgages .
It ’s all about price .
Nationwide it is likely we have bottomed in terms of sales .
But as we have discussed many times there will be two bottoms and one of those may have been reached :
The other bottom comes in the form of price and that still has a way to go .
The shadow inventory will keep pressure on housing prices especially in shady regions like California .
There seems to be a growing divide in terms of how things are now going to play out .
Some are arguing that the Alt - A and option ARM products are a tiny event and those waiting for a second flood of foreclosures will be surprised .
Their argument is banks will simply keep these homes off their books and will slowly trickle inventory into the market like some form of intravenous medicine drip .
They may be right but so much shadow inventory is building that at a certain point , something will have to give .
The only thing we can do at this point is look at the data and try to come up with an estimate of where we are heading .
My take on why something will have to give is this .
In Southern California we concluded that there were 40,000 REO properties in the dark shadows .
These are homes with no mortgage payment coming in .
As we all know , many of these notes are chopped up like hamburger and are beholden to various contractual agreements with investors .
Do you think investors are happy receiving no income stream ?
My take is many of these banks are playing financial brinkmanship and are trying to hold their breath long enough to dump this stuff off to the government ( aka public ) and the public private investment program ( PPIP ) is one of those vehicles to perform this transaction .
In fact , that is why I have heard numerous stories of people not getting a notice of default from 6 to 12 months !
We already know that foreclosures are at record highs and rising :
The assumption that banks can hold this stuff indefinitely is wrong for a variety of reasons including banks have extremely low capital .
This will drain them further .
But they ca n’t sell because they will collapse since the market is moving with cheaper prices ( i.e. , see Friday ’s existing home sales ) .
If we allow this to go on we have learned absolutely nothing from Japan and will repeat a lost decade here in the U.S .
And the proof is already occurring !
If we leave it up to the banks to determine policy , they would hold this stuff off forever while coming back to the government cheese each and every year until this is all worked out .
As you can see on a nationwide basis , if you set the price right people will buy .
Yet banks have no incentive to sell because they will implode as they should .
Even now , as the FDIC reaches a breaking point with its reserve insurance fees are going higher across the board and good banks are now subsidizing weak and irresponsible banks .
This story I ’m sure is sounding very familiar to most of you .
At a certain point , there will need to be transparency in this market .
Just because it happens does n’t mean they will flood the market with these properties but the public will be flooded with data .
Some think that the argument means that one day , a banking CEO is going to say , “ hey , today is a nice sunny day .
I ’m going to put 6,000 REOs on the MLS before I go eat some tacos . ”
It does n’t work that way .
But you ca n’t have no cash flow from properties and hold them off indefinitely .
That is how banks imploded in the first place !
The cash flow ran out .
People stopped paying .
Now assume the government assumes all the Alt - A and option ARM products on to their books .
Then what ?
All you did was shifted the risk .
You still have over valued assets and the only thing that happened is you passed the hot potato to the public .
At a certain point there will need to be price discovery .
You can only have price discovery by putting these homes on the market .
Otherwise you follow Japan down the path of a lost decade because you will have these zombie banks and loans just eating tax brains forever .
Yes , I know we are n’t like Japan because we do n’t save , we are n’t homogenous , and every other pretext .
But we are like them in this regard if this is the path we follow .
Is there a different result if a Japanese and American man jump off the Grand Canyon ?
Let us now focus on our overpriced home .
Today we salute you Redondo Beach with our Real Home of Genius Award .
Redondo Beach – 668 Square Feet 1 Bedroom Home for $ 539,000 ?
Is this 2006 ?
The South Bay is one of those regions where people think nothing can happen to housing prices .
They assume every city is somehow Manhattan Beach or Rancho Palos Verdes .
They are not .
Redondo Beach is one of those areas .
Depending on which zip code of the two you focus on , Redondo Beach is either doing well or contracting :
90277 : Median Price ( $ 989,000 ) Up 16.4 % year over year
90278 : Median Price ( $ 686,00 ) Down 7.7 % year over year
Our home today is in the 90277 zip code .
If you are wondering what a million dollar neighborhood looks like in an inflated market , this is a perfect example .
But before I dig deeper into the data on this home , I want to focus on the monthly nut phenomenon .
This also helps to explain why people were so willing to take on Alt - A and option ARM loans even though the principal was simply a ridiculous amount .
What people are missing is that the monthly Southern California buyer is now taking on a monthly mortgage amount that is now resembling the average amount from a decade ago !
Did you get ?
The average monthly nut now looks like the monthly nut from 2000 .
Let us look at two sample months and what you will see is a clear indication of where we are heading :
This chart probably tells you everything you need to know .
Riverside and San Bernardino Counties , the Inland Empire , are now at prices that date back one decade .
If you are buying in these areas , you probably will find good deals .
However , if you look at the other counties they are still largely overpriced .
Los Angeles is up 58 % from a decade ago , OC is up 47 % , and the other counties of San Diego and Ventura are overpriced as well .
Yet if we look at the total sales for the region , we are virtually at the same point as in October of 2000 .
And the irony is the typical monthly payment is now even with that from 10 years ago .
So something has to give here .
Either prices in the higher priced regions decline to meet the monthly nut or the monthly payment will have to jump .
And just take a look at what Southern Californians were taking out on a monthly average during the bubble :
At the height of the insanity , Southern Californians were taking out an average $ 2,500 mortgage payment .
No taxes , insurance , or maintenance either .
Just your principal and interest ( assuming you paid interest which many did n’t on option ARMs ) .
Now that we are actually checking for income and using debt - to - income ratios people can’t afford gigantic mortgages .
Remember during this decade incomes have been stagnant .
And now , if you did n’t notice on Friday California released the unemployment rate and in another stunner , the unemployment rate jumped up to another record of 11.9 percent putting the U - 6 rate over 22 percent :
Hard to buy a home without an income .
But this home in Redondo Beach brings back memories of those 500 square foot shacks going for $ 500,000 .
This home has a housing bubble history like you would n’t believe .
Let us look at what a 668 square foot home can do during a bubble :
Sales History
3/31/2000 : $ 273,000
7/20/2006 : $ 680,000
12/23/2008 : $ 431,000
And the current list price is get this …$ 539,000 !
Bwahahahahaha !
Someone is trying to flip in California even with an unemployment rate of approximately 12 percent and housing imploding !
Real Home of Genius quality indeed .
I love this part in the ad :
“ Sunny property surrounded by million dollar homes .
Perfect second home , first home or private home .
Walk to the beach , shopping and restaurants .
It is darling , very special and can grow . ”
Surrounded by “ million ” dollar homes ?
Let us take a look :
Zillow does n’t seem to think so and their pricing algorithm has been generous in California .
That $ 1.3 million home is 4 bedrooms and 3 baths on 2,614 square feet by the way , in Redondo Beach .
You are at least six blocks away from the beach .
Let us look at some of the pricing action here :
Price Reduced : 06/11/09 — $ 569,900 to $ 550,000
Price Reduced : 07/29/09 — $ 550,000 to $ 539,000
Now think about this .
$ 539,000 for a 1 bedroom 668 square foot home that was originally built in 1920 !
Before the Great Depression !
One thing is for sure , your monthly nut is going to be much more than the current average of $ 1,180 for Southern California .
Today we salute you Redondo Beach with our Real Homes of Genius Award .

Opinion 101 : The Newly launched Journal Rejecta Mathematica IS a JOKE ( but so are all math journals ! )
By Doron Zeilberger
Written : July 31 , 2009
Michael Wakin , Christopher Rozell , Mark Davenport and Jason Laska have finally launched the first issue of the long - awaited ( E-) journal Rejecta Mathematica .
In their letter from the editors they clearly state that this is not a joke .
It sure is !
But not because of its name , or mission , or agenda .
It is a great funny joke , because it is yet another math journal , and all of them , from the Annals of Math all the way " down " to the Fibonacci Quarterly , are fast becoming as funny , and utterly useless , as a neck tie .
The original goal of scientific and scholarly journals was the dissemination of knowledge .
This is nowadays accomplished much more efficiently via preprint archives and personal websites .
As for the formal - correctness , we all know that nowadays you can't trust human referees to go through all the details , and there are lots of inaccurate and even erroneous material published in " peer - reviewed " journals .
But mathematical official journals do serve a purpose !
They make some people feel superior at the expense of other people by using inclusion - exclusion , and thereby help maintain the status - quo in the hierarchy of mathematics .
One may argue that this is a human ( in fact , mammalian ) necessity , and hence peer - reviewed journals do serve an evolutionary purpose .
They also help the math departments ' committees , and deans , decide whom to grant tenure to and whom to promote .
The tenure committee would be much more impressed by a paper in the Annals of Mathematics than by a paper in the Fibonacci Quarterly .
By this argument , Rejecta Mathematica is really superfluous , since it is unlikely to impress any committee or any dean .
Also , let me tell you a secret !
Rejecta Mathematica is not the only journal that publishes previuosly - rejected papers .
Many ( perhaps most ! ) articles , in all journals , even the very snobbish ones , have been previosly rejected by other journals .
The only difference is that the journals do n't know it ( or do not want to know ) .
Acceptance / Rejection of paper X to journal Y is a random variable , with a given probability distribution .
By the law of large numbers , any paper will be accepted a.s. in some journal .
In this business it helps to be thick - skinned .
If you submit 10 papers to a journal whose acceptance rate is % 10 , then you should expect to get one paper published .
Of course , you should learn from your mistakes , and try to optimize your expected prestige by various stochastic strategies .
In the above - mentioned letter , the editors of Rejecta mention several reasons why worthy papers get rejected by journals , but they failed to mention the most common one : incompetence of both referees and editors .
Neither editors nor referees are what they used to be , and many of them are plain incompetent .
This is definitely the cause of the original rejection , by Journal of Combinatorial Theory ( Ser. A ) of my own paper featured in the first issue of Rejecta .
The referee , in his ( or her ) report , asked such dumb questions , and raised such inane objections , that showed that they did n't understand at all what is going on .
Also the editor , Helene Barcelo , showed great incompetence by agreeing with the referee , and refusing to reconsider my case , even though I felt so strongly about it .
Let me conclude with a revolutionary proposal to save paper , and disk - space , by making all math journals virtual .
Only keep the arxiv , but for each paper , just mention what journal it got accepted to .
Then in the search - form , they should add a new " field " : journal , and by searching , say , for " South Dakota J. of Applied Bioinformatics " and " 2008 " , one would immediately get the list of papers " published " by the former journal in the latter year .
This would be the journal !
No need to waste paper , or disk - space for a website for the journal .
Journals will become abstract entities , just like money .
The most efficient way would be to use the Gale - Shapely algorithm of stable marriage that can handle it painlessly and automatically .
Every submission to the arxiv will contain a ranked list of journals by the submitters , and the editors of the journal can rank all the papers ( this too can be automated , by using buzzwords , searching for names of Fields medalists etc. ) , and the algorithm will assign papers to journals , in a stable way , and no author will be tempted to dump the journal it got accepted to , even though it would have preferred to be published in the Annals , and the journal that " published " my paper , will not be tempted to dump it , even though it would have much rather published a paper by Andrew Wiles .
With this system , a journal will be just a subset of the set of all articles , the " global set " being the set of all articles posted in the arxiv .
One can even cater further to the human predilection for ranking and linear - ordering , and each journal will be allowed to rank its own papers .
Then again , this part is already superflous , since this task is very ably performed by google scholar , and anyone can see their article 's " worth " , and their own personal " worth " by google - scholaring themsevles ( and comparing their score to the google - scholar score of their friends and colleagues ) .
This makes even the " virtual " journals , suggested in the previous paragraph , unneccessary , and google - scholar suffices to satiate the human need for linear ranking , and feeling superior at the expense of your fellow persons .

Here at Mises Daily , we often poke fun at left - liberal Democrats for their Keynesian ways .
To prove that this is about ideas , not parties , today we 'll focus on a recent blog post in which Republican economist Larry Kudlow came out in favor of extending the " cash - for - clunkers " program .
As we 'll see , Kudlow 's arguments are pure Keynesian nonsense .
Sadly , many of today 's ostensibly radical , " free - market " economists basically look at the economy in the same way as Paul Krugman .
They just have a slight technical disagreement over the best way to prod people to spend money .
Only the Austrian approach offers a different paradigm and allows us to see just what is wrong with the " aggregate demand " view of the economy .
Kudlow Taking a Cue From The Juice ?
Right out of the gate , Kudlow 's column is impressive in its internal contradictions and utter prevarication :
As a free - market capitalist who does not believe in artificial spending and pump - priming from Uncle Sam , I 'm going to eat a little crow with the following statement :
At this moment in history , if we 're going to use fiscal stimulus as Washington insists , I favor extending the cash - for - clunkers car - rebate program .
The above quote is truly breathtaking .
It 's a bit like saying , " As a self - professed vegan , I 'm going to get a lot of ribbing from my associates when I declare that , if we 're going to pig out on meat the way American society tells us to , then I favor barbecued pork sandwiches at my next birthday party . "
Not only is Kudlow 's opening paragraph nonsensical , it also provides him with a blank check for the rest of the post .
He is going to take it as a given that " we 're " going to use fiscal stimulus .
The last time I was this stunned by such a self - serving setup was when O.J. Simpson agreed to write a book titled If I Did It .
Channeling Maynard
Now that we 've recovered from the shock of Kudlow 's announcement , let 's at least give him a chance to explain :
In virtually no time , the clunker program has become a national pastime .
It has captured the public 's imagination in a way that no other federal stimulus has .
Everyone is talking about it .
And I truly believe that consumer spirits have been buoyed by the prospect of going out and buying a new car — even with federal assistance , and even under the duress of federal mileage standards .
Is anyone else a little concerned that Kudlow wants to spend $ 2 billion of our tax money in order to buoy consumer spirits ?
When you stop doing economics and instead wander into mass psychology , anything goes .
In fact , throwing virgins into a volcano might boost GDP , depending on what the public believes .
And if so , Kudlow would be giving suggestions on how to pick the unlucky girl .
At this point , the reader might be tempted to dismiss Kudlow with a reductio ad absurdum .
Yet the author anticipates that move :
Now , I would n't want the government to pass out free money for everything .
But in this particular case , the cash - for - clunkers rebate program is working .
It 's working so well that it 's running way ahead of the computers that are administering it at the Transportation Department and Citibank .
Well , sure .
That 's government for you .
But unlike most of the rest of the fiscal - stimulus plan , this program actually works because the federal cash rebate actually contributes to a consumer purchase .
It 's not just another welfare - type transfer program .
Again , it 's difficult to know how to begin .
What Kudlow writes is so patently ridiculous that piercing the shell of his errors is a formidable task .
For starters , what does it mean when Kudlow says that this program of passing out free money for cars is " working " ?
Does it mean , " People are taking the free money " ?
If so , does Kudlow think this would n't work if the money applied to DVDs , computers , and restaurant dinners ?
Furthermore , in contrast to the very successful cash - for - clunkers program , what would " another welfare - type transfer program " do ?
Does Kudlow mean to suggest that welfare recipients are saving up their food stamps and WIC checks , rather than spending them on groceries ?
It 's true that most of the $ 787 billion " stimulus " package has n't been spent yet , but that 's not due to government incompetence .
No , the politicians quite deliberately designed the program so that its maximum seduction of the voters kicks in shortly before the 2010 midterm elections .
There 's no point in buying votes too early ; people have short memories .
Later on in the article , Kudlow again anticipates an obvious objection to his discussion :
Right about now you 're probably saying , " Well , why not just spend another $ 100 billion and give consumers checks for everything ? "
Or , " Why not spend another trillion ? "
Well , I do n't want to go there .
Just this one cash - for - clunker program — that 's all I want .
Fund it again for a couple of billion dollars more .
Nice .
I 'll have to remember that line .
The next time someone brings up a slippery - slope argument against me , I 'll just declare , " I do n't want to go there . "
Bastiat Who ?
Yet it gets even worse .
After endorsing Keynesian pump priming , Kudlow decides to become a protectionist too :
The biggest trade out there seems to be selling the Ford Explorer and buying the Ford Focus .
Of the top - five - purchased higher - mileage cars that qualify , Toyota has three , the Corolla , Prius , and Camry .
The Prius is made overseas , but the other two are manufactured mostly in the United States .
The number - three trade , the Honda Civic , is made in Indiana , while the Dodge Caliber and Chevrolet Cobalt rank in the top ten .
Now in fairness , Kudlow does n't explicitly say , " Really they ought to restrict the program to ' cash - for - clunkers - as - long - as - you - buy - domestic . ' "
But in the context of the rest of his post , it sure sounds as if he is lamenting the fact that only some of the clunky transactions will fuel US job creation , since some of the sales will regrettably leak to foreigners .
It surprised me when Paul Krugman — who won his Nobel Memorial award for work on trade theory — so quickly abandoned free trade because of the recession .
I guess it should n't surprise me that Larry Kudlow has done the same .
Conclusion
The true defender of the free market needs to learn more than a quick lesson about incentives and tax cuts .
He or she must really understand how the market economy works , including its complex capital structure .
Only the Austrian School can explain how the central bank causes boom – bust cycles , and why " stimulus " deficit spending only makes things worse .
It 's bad enough when a self - professed " progressive " spouts Keynesian nonsense .
But when one of the most visible cheerleaders of capitalism does the same — and proudly — it 's really disappointing .
Phelps has recently returned from a three - month ban
Olympic superstar Michael Phelps has broken the 100 m butterfly world record .
The 24 - year - old American , who has won 14 Olympic gold medals , lowered countryman Ian Crocker 's four - year - old mark of 50.40 seconds , clocking 50.22 .
The win at the US trials in Indianapolis secures Phelps a place in the 100 m butterfly at the World Championships in Rome later this month .
" I really wanted to break 50 seconds but that is something to shoot for , " said Phelps .
" Ian Crocker texted me after prelims .
He wished me all the luck .
That really meant a lot to me as a competitor and as a friend . "
Phelps has recently served a three - month ban after he was pictured apparently smoking cannabis .
Thursday 's success takes his current tally of world records to five , along with the 200 m freestyle , 200 m butterfly and the 200 m and 400 m individual medley .
He won the 100 m butterfly at both the 2004 and 2008 Olympics , but had been unable to snatch Crocker 's record .
Phelps became the most successful Olympian in history when he won eight gold medals in Beijing last August to add to the six he claimed in Athens four years previously .

" If classical liberalism spells individualism , fascism spells government . " ~ Benito Mussolini , Fascism : Doctrines and Institutions , p. 10
The two worst scourges of humanity in the twentieth century were socialism and fascism .
Together , they wrecked much of the world economy because of their shared " fatal conceit " ( F.A. Hayek ’s term ) that government central planners were superior to private property and free markets .
Fascist and socialist governments ( not that there ’s much difference between them ) murdered over 100 million of their own citizens , as the sociologist R.J. Rummel has documented ( See his book , Death by Government ) , and instigated wars that caused the deaths of millions more .
Incredibly , the two - party duopoly that has long ruled America has adopted both fascism and socialism as the defining characteristics of our economic system .
Call it Fascialism .
It is a recipe for national economic suicide .
Economic Fascism
Economic fascism as practiced by Italy and Germany in the 1920s and ’30s allowed private property and private enterprise to exist , but only if it was strictly controlled and regimented by the state so that it would serve " the public interest " and not private interests .
The philosophy of German fascism was expressed in the slogan Gemeinnutz geht vor Eigennutz , which means " the common good comes before the private good . "
" The Aryan , " Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf , " willingly subordinates his own ego to the community and , if the hour demands , even sacrifices it . "
This sounds a lot like John McCain ’s campaign theme of " Country First " ( before self - interest ) , does n’t it ?
Death by Government : G... R. J. Rummel Best Price : $ 43.32 Buy New $ 42.99 ( as of 08:10 EST - Details )
Of course , it is the government that decides what constitutes " the common good . "
Is there any doubt that government will now define what constitutes " the common good " in the banking and automobile industries — and in health care once it is fully nationalized ?
The philosophy behind Italian fascism was virtually identical .
" The fascist conception of life , " Mussolini wrote in Fascism : Doctrines and Institutions , " stresses the importance of the State and accepts the individual only in so far as his interests coincide with the State . "
It is remarkable how contemporary economic policy pronouncements are so often identical to those made by early twentieth - century European fascists .
Mussolini complained in 1935 , for example , that government intervention in the Italian economy was " too diverse , varied contrasting .
There has been . . . intervention , case by case , as the need arises . "
His advisor , Fausto Pitigliani , explained that under fascism government regulation would achieve a certain " unity of aim " instead .
This is exactly how the powers that be in Washington , D.C. have diagnosed the current financial crisis :
There ’s been too little financial market regulation , they tell us , and it has been too , well , diverse and contrasting .
Thus , they have recommended a Super Regulatory Authority that will supposedly regulate , regiment , and control all " systemic risk taking " in the entire economy .
The only debate is whether an entirely new agency should be created to achieve this " unity of aim , " or if the Fed — which caused the current economic crisis in the first place — should be given the responsibility .
Under The Axe Of Fascism Salvemini , Gaetano Best Price : $ 69.88 Buy New $ 44.50 ( as of 03:00 EST - Details )
Government - business " partnerships " were a hallmark of both Italian and German fascism .
As Ayn Rand once noted , however , in such " partnerships " government is always the " senior partner .
" Government - business " collaboration " was supposedly needed in fascist Italy , explained Fausto Pitigliani in his 1934 book , The Italian Corporatist State , because " the principle of private initiative could only be useful in the service of the national interest . "
It is this " service of the national interest " that is the intended work of the newly appointed " Car Czar " in the Obama administration ( along with twenty or so other " czars " so far ) .
It is inevitable that the end product will be the world ’s worst cars , endless subsidies and bailouts , and mind - boggling debt piled onto the backs of the taxpayers .
All to pay off a campaign debt to the United Autoworkers Union , which bears most of the responsibility for the destruction of General Motors and Chrysler in the first place .
The hallmark of the Obama administration ’s economic policy thus far is a forced " partnerships " with dozens of large banks along with General Motors and Chrysler .
It is threatening hundreds of other " partnerships " in the name of environmental regulation .
And that ’s just in the first five months .
Mussolini would be envious .
Italian fascism created one gigantic bailout economy .
Italian social critic Gaetano Salvemini wrote in his 1936 book , Under the Axe of Fascism , that " It is the state , i.e. , the taxpayer , who has become responsible to private enterprise .
In Fascist Italy the state pays for the blunders of private enterprise . "
" Profit remained to private initiative , " Salvemini wrote , but " the government added the losses to the taxpayers ’ burden .
Profit is private and individual .
Loss is public and social . "
Sound familiar ?
Mussolini himself boasted in 1934 that " three quarters of the Italian economic system had been subsidized by government , " Salvemini wrote .
The Obama administration ( with a jump start by the Bush administration ) is on a path to exceed this level of plunder .
Socialism
In the preface to the 1976 edition of his famous book , The Road to Serfdom , F.A. Hayek wrote ( p. xxiii ) that when the book was first published in 1944 , socialism meant " unambiguously the nationalization of the means of production and the central economic planning which made this necessary . "
But by the 1970s " socialism has come to mean chiefly the extensive redistribution of incomes through taxation and the institutions of the welfare state . "
Thus , ever since the 1930s the Democratic Party in America has been the party of socialism , with the Republican Party either providing little or no effective opposition or , as with the administration of President George W. Bush , serving as accomplices .
The Bush administration vastly expanded the welfare state , while Obama intends to expand it much faster , especially if he succeeds in implementing health care socialism and imposing even more punitive levels of income taxation on the most productive citizens .
Obama promises the worst of all economic worlds : A vast expansion of the welfare state form of socialism , as defined by Hayek , along with a heavy dose of old - fashioned , early twentieth - century , Stalinist socialism with the nationalization of banks , automobile companies , the health care industries , and whatever else he can get away with .
The Mussolini - like cult of personality that has developed around him will facilitate this disastrous path to national economic suicide .

" Creo que el Procampo es un programa que lleg� a M�xico para motivar e incentivar el uso correcto de nuestro sector agr�cola .
En ese sentido como yo veo al Procampo no es un programa social , no es un programa de apoyo a la gente m�s humilde , sino es un programa para incentivar precisamente la autonom�a alimentaria que requiere el pa�s " , respondi� .
Hern�ndez dijo que Tamaulipas es el estado que m�s recursos del Procampo aterriza , " quiero decirles que es muy importante que este programa siga vigente , que este programa siga apoyando a todo tipo de productores " .
Reiter� que no es un programa social , y que debe permanecer para que M�xico pueda aspirar a lograr la autonom�a alimentaria .
" Es un programa que llega a muchos sectores sociales , y ha sido un programa que ha hecho que Tamaulipas sea el estado m�s productivo en algunos renglones " , mencion� .

Ford has a new advertising campaign that consists of a special web - based video series called ’ 10 Unleashed .
Essentially , the Company is covering the ultimate Mustang experiences of ten diehard fans .
However , this is no ordinary marketing ploy .
Each of these individuals has a compelling story to tell and Ford is making real dreams come true .
The first edition features Roger Keeney , a native of Athens , GA , who has been blind for twenty years following a terrible accident .
His application was selected for the program and the rest is history .
Ford artistically chronicles Keeney ’s life history and his experience stepping into a 2010 Ford Mustang Convertible and taking the ride of his life .
This is really a great human interest story and one that is definitely worth checking out .
The trailer and first segment are provided after the jump .
Press Release :
DEARBORN , Mich. , June 23 , 2009 – With the warm Arizona wind pelting his forehead and his entire body vibrating from the mighty roar of the engine , Roger Keeney took a brand new 2010 Ford Mustang convertible on an amazing ride , doing donuts on the pavement and amassing speeds of up to 90 mph .
This would be a thrill for anybody but what makes this truly remarkable is that fact that Keeney has been blind for the past 20 years .
Sixty - two - year - old Keeney , who lives in Athens , Ga. , won the chance to drive the new 2010 Mustang by participating in “ The ’ 10 Unleashed ” promotion , which asked people to describe their ultimate Mustang dream experience in 250 words or less .
A video diary chronicling his extraordinary ride will be featured starting today at www.the2010mustang.com.
“ When I got the phone call from Ford saying that I had won , I thought someone was playing a joke on me , ” said Keeney , who lost his sight in a farming accident .
It was definitely not a joke , says Ford Car Communications Manager Patricia Piedrahita .
“ Without a doubt , his essay caught our attention , ” she said .
“ His submission hinted that he may be blind , so we had to talk to him to learn more .
Upon speaking to him we knew he would help us see the Mustang from a different point of view . ”
On May 7 , 2009 , Ford flew Keeney down to the expansive Ford Proving Grounds just outside of Phoenix , Ariz .
With safety their number one concern , the Mustang team arranged for former professional racer Tommy Kendall to ride shotgun in the car .
“ Tommy said , ‘ When you were a teenager , did you ever do donuts ? ’
And I said , ‘ Yeah . ’
So I got it rolling a bit in first gear , cranked it hard to the left and revved it up and popped it and did three donuts before we stopped .
When we stopped , we could hear the camera crew cheering from clear across the field .
I was in awe of both the car and the experience , it was truly a dream come true . ”
“ The most life - changing thing you can do for folks with disabilities is put them in a situation that everyone else has told them is impossible .
The experience for me in the Mustang with Tommy Kendall next to me and driving that wonderful automobile was really great , ” Keeney added .
The rush and exhilaration of Keeney ’s dream come true is brought to life through the video chapters available for viewing at www.the2010mustang.com.

My wife is a devout catholic and she finds the presence of all of these pope hats all over the house to be blasphemous .
I have pope hats in every closet , pope hats under the sing , pope hats full of other pope hats .
She will not stop talking to me about getting rid of the pope hats and has started lighting candles all over the house for my soul but these pope hats are extremely flammable so its a problem in my house ( there are pope hats everywhere ) I payed 10 x what I 'm asking for when I bought these pope hats .
I still think there is a market for them maybe when the economy turns around .
Act NOW !
Do n't miss this great deal !
I have 1,325 total ( I counted this morning ) .
3 of them have some dog bites and one of them is burnt to a crisp , but you can take that one or leave it .

Mr Obama was forced to address the issue head on , saying that no one would " pull the plug on Grandma because we 've decided that it's too expensive to let her live anymore " and adding : " Somehow , it has got spun into this idea of death panels , I am not in favour of that , I want to clear the air here .

WASHINGTON ( IPS ) - A new documentary from a shadowy non-profit , the Clarion Fund , has ties to groups widely accused of Islamophobia .
The Third Jihad purports to educate US citizens about the threat of a “ cultural Jihad ” by the country ’s own Muslim - American population .
The film goes to great lengths to define itself as an expose of radical Muslim elements , not the faith at large .
But a group called the International Free Press Society ( IFPS ) , which attended the Washington premiere of the film and documented the screening on behalf of the production company on a social media website , has some dubious affiliations .
Two months ago , IFPS heavily promoted Dutch parliamentarian Geert Wilders , a widely - known Islamophobe who has been tied to far - right European political parties .
An IPS investigation linked both Wilders and some of his US and international supporters , including members of IFPS , with the Vlaams Belang ( VB ) , or Flemish Interest .
Vlaams Belang is a nationalist Flemish party that has demanded amnesty for Nazi collaborators in Belgium .
Wilders is known for campaigning to ban the Quran , Islamic attire and Islamic schools from the Netherlands , and for proclaiming that “ moderate Islam does not exist . ”
His views have even drawn fire from the strongly pro-Israel Anti-Defamation League , which described Wilders ’s rhetoric as “ inflammatory , divisive and antithetical to American democratic ideals . ”
Wilders has been brought up on charges in the Netherlands and banned from Britain on the grounds that he incites hate .
That view does n’t jibe with the slickly produced Third Jihad film .
The movie starts with a disclaimer that it is not an assault on all Muslims : “ This is not a film about Islam .
It is about the threat of radical Islam .
Only a small percentage of the world ’s 1.3 billion Muslims are radicals .
This film is about them . ”
The narrative of the movie is strung together with commentary from a “ moderate ” Muslim , Zuhdi Jasser , a physician from Arizona who heads the American Islamic Forum for Democracy ( AIFD ) .
AIFD , according to its website , is a non-profit which seeks to “ intellectually stand against the religious fanatics who exploit the religion of Islam for a nihilistic , anti-American anti-Western war . ”
Unlike most commentators who regularly use the term “ Islamofascist , ” Jasser is a practicing and devoted Muslim .
But he thinks the faith has no role in politics or government .
He derides political Islam as part of the subversive , quiet Jihad being waged within the boundaries of the West , a central tenet of the movie .
Radical Muslims , by having children , spreading their faith , and ensuring their ability to practice Islam as they see fit , are working a “ demographic jihad ” in which they see themselves emerging as a majority and making Islam the dominant religion of the US — eventually to take over the nation altogether — contend Jasser and the films creators .
But that prospect seems unlikely in the US , where Muslim Americans are generally regarded as well - assimilated and not radicalized .
The film itself also contains inconsistencies in terms of differentiating between Islam and radical Islam .
For example , the graphic that the film used to demonstrate the spread of an Islamic state across the Middle East , North Africa , and Europe used a tiled picture of a green crescent with a star between its points .
The crescent and star are the symbol of Islam in general .
The documentary was produced by the Clarion Fund , a US - based non-profit that was embroiled in controversy last year when it distributed its last movie , Obsession : Radical Islam ’s War Against the West , to nearly 30 million homes in the “ swing states ” that normally decide US presidential elections .
Its 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) status as non-profit means the group is legally exempt from paying taxes and is prohibited from involvement in electoral politics .
IPS investigations also tied the production and distribution of Obsession to right - wing Israeli groups and US - based neoconservatives .
In addition to an endorsement of Republican presidential candidate John McCain posted on Clarion ’s website , questions were raised about Clarion ’s ties to foreign groups , such as Aish Hatorah , an Israeli - based organization dedicated to educating young Jews about their heritage .
The Clarion Fund and Aish Hatorah are headed by Israeli - Canadian twin brothers Raphael and Ephraim Shore , respectively .
The two groups appear to be connected as Clarion is incorporated in Delaware to the New York offices of Aish Hatorah .
Federal law prohibits campaigns and political candidates from taking money from foreign organizations .
Last September , the Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) asking that Clarion be investigated for allegedly violating their tax - exempt apolitical status and using foreign funds in an electoral push .
Last week , the FEC ruled that there was “ no reason to believe Respondents [ Clarion Fund ] violated the Act , because the DVD failed to identify a federal candidate , lacked express advocacy , and there was no evidence the DVD was distributed in connection with a federal election . ”
Still , the group strikes back at CAIR in the new film , accusing it of being part of a grand Muslim conspiracy to take over the West and the United States .
“ The Third Jihad ” is largely based on a document the producers say the Federal Bureau of Investigation discovered in 2003 .
The film ’s creators purport the document is a “ Grand Jihad Manifesto ” authored by the Muslim Brotherhood in North America , according to the promotional materials .
“ The 15 - page document outlines goals and strategies for the infiltration and domination of America from within , ” says the release .
“ Among the strategies discussed is the establishment of ‘ moderate ’ groups , mosques and Islamic centers across North America in an effort to strategically position Islam so that it might weaken western culture and promote the implementation of Sharia Law . ”
Sharia , or Islamic law , has come into the spotlight as one of the principal goals of radical Islamists .
“ Sharia is no different than Jewish law or Christian law , ” said CAIR communications director Ibrahim Hooper .
“ When he prays , Jasser is following Sharia ; when he does n’t drink alcohol , he ’s following Sharia . ”
In the film , Clarion says that the Islamic Association of Palestine ( IAP ) was one of several Muslim organizations listed in the document as potential allies .
The film claims that IAP helped form CAIR .
Despite its alleged nefarious ties , CAIR was invited to screenings of the film , insisted Clarion executive director Peter Connors .
“ Our invitations were declined , ” he said .
In protest of a screening of The Third Jihad in Los Angeles ’s Simon Wiesenthal Center on Saturday night , CAIR sent a letter to the center ’s dean and founder , Rabbi Marvin Hier .
“ The film disingenuously claims it is only targeting ‘ radical Islam , ’ yet a Twitter account of the Washington , DC , screening on Wednesday night stated : “ ‘ The 1,400 - hundred year war ’ has been going on since the beginning of Islam , ” CAIR wrote .
Indeed , a member of IFPS was authoring the Twitter feed , which allows someone to post short updates to the web in real time .
“ Thanks to the Clarion Fund for the opportunity to twitter tonight .
Be sure to visit the International Free Press Society online ! ” said the last post charting the press conference and screening .
“ Clarion thanks the International Free Press Society … for their Twitter mastery at last night ’s event , ” said the next post , from the following morning , which included a shortcut link to IFPS ’s website .
Both tweets , as the short messages are called , came from “ No2 RadicalIslam , ” which is Clarion ’s name on Twitter .
Some of Clarion ’s supporters , including Jewish groups that have promoted its films as well as “ moderate ” Muslims like Jasser , appear unaware of IFPS ’s association with the nationalist Flemish party Vlaams Belang , which has been deemed neo -Nazi and neo - fascist by critics .
In December 2008 , senior VB leader Roeland Raes was convicted on charges of Holocaust denial .
But Jasser , who did n’t know about VB , said he was n’t concerned about potential connections with Wilders , debating the characterization of Wilders as an Islamophobe .
“ I do think the test of the West , and the test of us Muslims in the West , is whether we will defend Mr. Wilders and his right to say whatever he wants to say , ” he told IPS .
“ At AIFP we endorse their free speech , and the aspect of free speech is important to the war of ideas .
But we disagree with their view of Islam . ”
“ I think as a Muslim , the test of our character is how we respond to people that may not hold opinions of our faith that we agree with , ” he said .
“ And I truly think that the cartoons … demonstrated many Muslims did n’t give groups the right to criticize our faith . ”
Jasser was referring to an incendiary cartoon published in the Danish newspaper Jyllands - Posten that portrayed the Muslim prophet Mohammed ’s head - covering as a bomb inscribed with the Islamic declaration of faith , which set off worldwide protests in 2005 .
The IFPS website sells “ exclusive cop[ies ] of the famous Mohammed cartoon ” for 250 dollars a piece .

The office of President Obama ’s “ science czar ” John Holdren has responded to concerns Holdren co-authored a book which allegedly contained comments supporting coercive population control measures .
A spokesman for the department said that Holdren disavowed such policies at his confirmation hearing .
Holdren is currently Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy , Assistant to the President for Science and Technology , and Co-Chair of the President 's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology .
In 1977 , he co-authored the 1,000 page book “ Ecoscience ” with Paul and Anne Ehrlich .
The book included several descriptions of possible population control measures , including the addition of “ sterilants ” to the water supply to prevent human conception .
One section , titled “ Population Law , ” cited the radical group Zero Population Growth and said “ it has been concluded that compulsory population - control laws , even including laws requiring compulsory abortion , could be sustained under the existing Constitution if the population crisis became sufficiently severe to endanger the society . ”
“ Few today consider the situation in the United States serious enough to justify compulsion , however . ”
Another section discussed a “ planetary regime ” that might be given responsibility for “ determining the optimum population for the world and for each region and for arbitrating various countries ' shares within their regional limits . ”
In Tuesday e-mails to CNA , Rick Weiss , the Office of Science and Technology Policy ’s Director of Strategic Communications , said the material at issue was from “ a three - decade - old , three - author textbook used in colleges to teach energy policy . ”
He could “ easily dismiss ” fears that Dr. Holdren favors government control over population growth .
“ He made that quite clear in his confirmation hearing , ” Weiss said .
He then quoted a section of the confirmation transcript in which Sen. David Vitter ( R - LA ) asked Holdren whether he thinks “ determining optimal population is a proper role of government . ”
“ No , Senator , I do not , ” was Holdren ’s reply , according to Weiss and a transcript of the proceedings .
In other remarks at the confirmation hearing , not cited by Weiss , Holdren told Sen .
Vitter he no longer thinks it is “ productive ” to focus on the “ optimum population ” for the United States .
“ I do n't think any of us know what the right answer is . ”
According to Weiss , Holdren “ made clear that he did not believe in coercive means of population control ” and is not an advocate for measures expressed in the book “ and they are certainly not endorsed by this administration in any way . ”
Weiss also provided CNA with a statement from the book 's other two authors , Paul and Anne Ehrlich .
The Ehrlichs said they had been “ shocked ” at what they called the “ serious misrepresentation ” of their and Holdren ’s views .
“ We were not then , never have been , and are not now ' advocates ' of the Draconian measures for population limitation described -- but not recommended -- in the book 's 60 - plus small - type pages cataloging the full spectrum of population policies that , at the time , had either been tried in some country or analyzed by some commentator . ”
Describing “ Ecoscience ” as a “ textbook , ” they said its descriptions can be “ misrepresented as endorsement . ”
Paul Ehrlich was the author of the 1968 bestselling book The Population Bomb , which predicted that massive famines in the 1970s would kill “ hundreds of millions , ” including Americans .
Coercive population control measures , including forced sterilizations and abortions , have been used in China ’s one - child policy .
In Peru in the 1990s , the U.S. Agency for International Development and the United Nations Population Fund provided support for what became an involuntary sterilization program which victimized an estimated 300,000 women .
Palm oil is an inescapable part of everyday life .
As the new research from the Independent shows , it is now virtually impossible to avoid buying products that contain palm oil in every supermarket , chemist and sweet shop in Britain .
Considering the fact that this commodity is now one of the most environmentally damaging on earth , this can seem like a gloomy prospect - but there are a few reasons for hope .
In Indonesia , the picture is extremely worrying .
In the last two decades , millions of hectares of rainforest have been destroyed to make way for new plantations .
Peat forests and swamps which have stood for centuries are being chopped down , drained and burned , to be replaced with gigantic monoculture crops .
This systematic destruction is now responsible for an astonishing four percent of the world ’s total greenhouse gas emissions , and the orang - utan , perhaps the most potent symbol of man ’s kinship with nature , could be less than ten years from extinction .
This crisis stems from the failure of the industry to grasp the consequences of explosive , unrestrained growth .
It was not until 2003 that attempts were made to slow the destruction by creating the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm oil ( RSPO ) , a body which brought together growers , transporters and consumers of palm oil .
It set criteria for companies who wished to claim that their oil was “ sustainable ” , allowing them to benefit from the good PR that this kind of initiative can bring .
Yet six years later only a trickle of certified palm oil has entered the marketplace , and some RSPO members freely admit that it is failing to achieve its objectives .
Meanwhile RSPO member companies operating in Indonesia are able to use the organisation to burnish their green credentials whilst simultaneously destroying rainforests with impunity .

British companies have a key role to play here .
Some are rightly frustrated by the slow progress of the Roundtable and are looking to do more , by engaging with their suppliers and supporting campaigns for an end to rainforest clearance for palm oil .
Others insist that their influence is limited , but Greenpeace believes that all UK retailers and manufacturers have powerful tools at their disposal .
If these companies were to cancel their purchasing contracts with the worst offending palm oil producers , it would reverberate through the industry .
This kind of financial signal would enable those producers who are committed to sustainability to come to the fore , offering the British consumer the chance to support environmentally responsible palm oil for the very first time .
The sheer number of products that contain palm oil can seem daunting .
But with consumer pressure , industry leadership and political incentives these tropical rainforests can be placed off limits - for good .
HONG KONG ( Reuters ) -
Flu viruses that sparked the three worst pandemics in the last century circulated in their near - complete forms for years before the catastrophes occurred , researchers in Hong Kong and the United States have found .

The H1N1 virus that sparked the Spanish flu of 1918 - 1919 circulated in swine and humans well before the pandemic started , and it did not come directly from birds as previously thought , they added .
Instead , it was probably generated by genetic exchanges between flu viruses from swine and humans .
This contrasts sharply with previous studies which suggested that the H1N1 virus of 1918 was a mutant that jumped direct from birds to human and ended up killing as many as 50 million people .
The findings are considered important because of the lack of studies of the virus in animals before the current outbreak of H1N1 .
Through understanding the natural history of viruses , monitoring of current viruses can be fine - tuned , the team from the University of Hong Kong and St Jude Children ’s Hospital in the United States wrote .
Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the study also involved two other pandemic viruses
--
the H2N2 responsible for the Asian flu of 1957 , and the H3N2 which sparked the Hong Kong flu of 1968 .
Guan
Yi , microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong and member of the research team , said the viruses of 1918 and 1957 went through at least two rounds of reassortments before the pandemics occurred .
Reassortments happen when flu viruses swap genetic material , which happens when an animal or person is infected with two strains at the same time .
“ Before , people did not know how pandemic viruses came about ... this study gives us a deeper understanding into the evolution and emerging process of pandemic viruses , ” Guan said .
Another finding was that the H1N1 pandemic virus of 1918 , the seasonal H1N1 virus of today and the classical H1N1 swine virus may have been co-circulating in the 1918 - 1919 period .
“ All three are different viruses but related ... which would explain why some waves of the ( 1918 - 1919 ) pandemic were more deadly than others , ” Guan said .
The team analyzed and compared the genes of the 1918 , 1957 , and 1968 viruses and their close relatives to determine their ancestry and the gene exchanges that created them .
The genes of the 1918 virus likely circulated in swine and humans from as early as 1911 , and the virus was unlikely to have been transmitted directly from birds to humans , Guan said .
“ It is very difficult for viruses to jump directly from bird to human ( and cause a pandemic ) , which may explain why the H5N1 virus has n’t caused a pandemic so far ( by making that direct jump from bird to human ) , ” Guan said .
The H2N2 ( 1957 ) and H3N2 ( 1968 ) reassortant viruses formed similarly , through exchanges with unknown mammalian hosts and input from bird viruses .
“ Because of a lack of sequence data for swine influenza from these periods , the involvement of swine in the generation of these pandemic strains cannot be precluded , ” the paper said .

I live near Fort Myers Florida – Thomas Edison and Henry Ford had vacation homes right next to each other here in Fort Myers Florida .
Many stories and quotes are attributed to these successful men .
The above quote – “ I have not failed .
Ive found 10,000 ways that wont work ” –
To me addresses the trials and tribulations of a small business owner or entrepreneur .
Failure in start ups happens .
It can happen again and again , and will happen .
Failure does n’t get dealt with as a defeat , rather is viewed as a setback .
Many failures turn into policy and / or procedure to avoid similar future problems .
If you buy a business you can have a pretty good feel on what to expect assuming you ’ve performed adequate due diligence .
Ive been part of many discussion revolving around starting up a company and how many years to either break even or make a profit .
Some people say it is one year others say 2 years , others 3 - 5 years .
For every business reaching this milestone of “ break even ” or “ profit ” is different .
The measuring stick used and the timeline expected should be considered .
Arbitrary goals and time frames should not be set .
There are many unknowns in a start up .
You can only do so much due diligence on something that has yet to happen – “ You dont know what you dont know ” - this quote may or may not be from Thomas Edison , - but applies .
I think that many people have a certain entrepreneur spirit within .
Only a certain percentage act on that spirit .
And the successful ones I believe are the ones that are successful at understanding failures will happen , and are resilient enough to accept the many failures that will come your way .
Failing 100’s and or 1000 ’s of times and then coming up with the light bulb is a prophecy most any small business owner / entrepreneur would accept .

The New York Times and Time Magazine have recently posted interesting articles about two new books that discuss consumer behavior : Chris Anderson ’s Free and Ellen Ruppel Shell ’s Cheap ( see links in The New York Times and Time Magazine ) .
Both books reference our Hershey ’s Kiss experiment that is described in Chapter 3 of Predictably Irrational .
If you recall , in one trial of one study we offered students a Lindt Truffle for 26 cents and a Hershey ’s Kiss for 1 cent and observed the buying behavior : 40 percent went with the truffle and 40 percent with the Kiss .
When we dropped the price of both chocolates by just 1 cent , we observed that suddenly 90 percent of participants opted for the free Kiss , even though the relative price between the two was the same .
We concluded that FREE ! is indeed a very powerful force .
It ’s important to note that we have carried out lots and lots of studies on the effect of FREE ! , many of which are detailed in Predictably Irrational .
Describing them all , however , would be too much for those who are trying to make just one point abut this effect , so naturally we see authors making choices about which experiments to describe and which ones to leave in footnotes , or not to mention at all .
But , some kinds of omissions are made as well — ones that are important for understanding the complexity of the effect .
For example , in one study of FREE ! , we tried lowering the price from 2 cents to one cent on the Kiss to see if we observed that same level of increase in demand in the Kiss .
We did n’t .
In another study we also tried seeing what would happen if we lowered the price from FREE !
to negative one cent , and we also did n’t see a difference in behavior .
We also tried the experiment on a broad demographic–not just college students , but also on children and older adults .
Personally , I think it is perfectly fine for people to take the main point from some experiments and build on it , but as readers ( and writers ) we should realize that often there is more complexity to the picture and that before criticizing particular findings , or citing them as supporting evidence , we should keep in mind the nuances .

XENIX -- Microsoft Short - lived Love Affair with Unix
" Microsoft announces Microsoft Xenix OS , a portable operating system for 16 - bit microprocessors .
It is an interactive , multiuser , multitasking system that will run on Intel 8086 , Zilog Z8000 , Motorola M68000 , and DEC PDP - 11 series .
All of Microsoft 's existing system software ( Cobol , Pascal , Basic , and DBMS ) will be adapted to run under the Xenix system , and all existing software written for Unix OS will be compatible as well .
" -- from a Microsoft press release , 1980
Long before Linus Torvalds was able to write anything useful in C , there was a version of Unix from Microsoft called XENIX that was based on the seventh edition and BSD 4.1 with some interesting enhancements ( multiple virtual consoles accessible via Alt - F1 , Alt - F2 , ... Alt - F10 -- later inherited by Linux , record - locking facilities for database programming , etc ) and an amazing level of PC friendliness that Linus will try emulate much later by essentially replicating all major design decisions that Microsoft put into XENIX for PC but using an independent codebase .
Microsoft licensed UNIX from AT&T in 1979 .
That was an interesting year in Unix history : at the June 1979 USENIX meeting in Toronto , AT&T announced an big price hike ( from $ 1000 to $ 7500 for educational institutions ; from $ 5000 to $ 40,000 for full commercial open source ; license was per CPU , which at the time meant per each computer in the orgnization that runs Unix ) .
Essentially AT&T decided to commercialize Unix using simple " make money fast " approach , which quite predictably backfired .
Bill Gates instantly realized that such move opens the door for third party Unix distributors and jumped on this opportunity .
There were rumors that licensing of Unix from AT&T by Microsoft was partially stimulated by behavior of Digital Research which in 1979 broke implicit agreement with Microsoft to concentrate on OS and moved into compiler space by packaging CP / M with CBasic developed by one of Kildall student Gordon Eubanks ( future founder of Symantec ) .
This was the area which Microsoft considered its own : at this time Microsoft was the languages compiler / interpreter development company , selling mainly several compilers and first of all Microsoft Basic which was microcomputer standard of the time .
At the same time Microsoft behaved in quite gentleman matter with Digital Research .
Not only there was no attempt to encroach into Digital Research turf , Microsoft served as a powerful implicit marketing agent for Digital Research .
As for the language company supporting multiple operating systems was a nightmare , Microsoft was strong promoter of CP/M , helping Digital Research to generate revenue by sending to them the customers of their compilers and interpreters .
So Microsoft rightly considered this move of Digital Research as a knife in his back .
It was after that unfortunate episode Bill Gates turned to AT&T and in February 1980 licensed Unix operating system .
So when in September 1980 Gill Gates picked up the phone and called Kindall to inform him that IBM want to talk to him about creating OS for their new microcomputer , it was more then a gesture of good will -- he was sending business to the competitor to tried to steal his share of Basic interpreters market .
This historical meeting happened just six month after Microsoft got into Xenix business so in a way Microsoft hands were full .
The same year SCO was founded and Microsoft XENIX development was outsourced to SCO ( which at a time was a two man operation ) expecting them to perform the bulk of technical work connected with porting of AT&T codebase to various microprocessors :
XENIX was originally developed on a DEC Virtual Address Extension ( VAX ) running the Virtual Memory System ( VMS ) and a PDP - 11 running UNIX V7 , albeit now using Microsoft 's own in - house minicomputers , and then converted into assembly language specific to the new 16 - bit Motorola 68000 and Intel 8086 microprocessors .
This put XENIX at the high end of the microcomputer market , which was still dominated by 8 - bit machines , but well below the lowest end of the minicomputer market .
In 1979 , brothers Doug and Larry Michels [ they were actually father and son -- NNB ] founded the Santa Cruz Operation ( SCO ) as a UNIX porting and consulting company using venture capital from Microsoft , which handed over all further development of Microsoft XENIX to SCO .
Doug Michels recalled that the company ’s name was a bit of “ social engineering ” to obscure the fact that it was essentially a two - man operation .
“ I ’d call up and say , ‘ This is Doug from the Santa Cruz Operation ’ and be pretty sure they would n’t catch that the ‘ O ’ was capitalized and think I was from another branch of their company . ”
By 1980 , the UNIX family tree had split into three distinct major branches : AT&T UNIX System III from Bell Labs ’ UNIX Support Group ( USG ) .
Berkeley Standard Distribution 4.1 from UCB .
XENIX 3.0 from Microsoft and SCO .
Microsoft XENIX was initially an Intel 8086 port of AT&T UNIX Version 7 with some BSD - like enhancements .
This became Microsoft / SCO XENIX 3.0 a year or so later .
SCO XENIX 5.0 was updated to conform to AT&T UNIX System V Release 0 ( SVR0 ) in 1983 , for which SCO brought its own rights to the UNIX source code .
By then , XENIX had the largest installed base of any UNIX system during the early 1980s .
Microsoft acquired a 25 percent share of SCO , which at the time gave it a controlling interest .
While SCO handled the actual development and added some enhancements of its own , Microsoft handled the marketing of the product , which it touted as the “ Microcomputer Operating System of the Future ! ” A 1980 issue of Microsoft Quarterly stated , “ The XENIX system ’s inherent flexibility … will make the XENIX OS the standard operating system for the computers of the ’ 80s . ”
The 1983 XENIX Users ’ Manual declared , “ Microsoft announces the XENIX Operating System , a 16 bit adaptation of Bell Laboratories UNIX ™ Operating System .
We have enhanced the UNIX software for our commercial customer base , and ported it to popular 16 - bit microprocessors .
We ’ve put the XENIX OS on the DEC ® PDP - 11™ , Intel® 8086 , Zilog® Z8000 and Motorola® 68000 . ”
It went on to warn against “ so - called UNIX - like ” products .
Similar sentiments were echoed in ads for Microsoft XENIX in the UNIX Review and UNIX World magazines as late as 1984 .
That ’s when Microsoft and SCO had a parting of the ways .
What changed ?
On August 12 , 1981 , the IBM Model 5150 Personal Computer changed everything .
Then , on January 24 , 1984 , the Apple Macintosh changed everything … again !
In August 1980 , ten years before Linus was even a idea in Linux in his head , Microsoft announced XENIX OS : its port of Unix for various 16 - bit microprocessors .
with Zilog as the major platform .
Here is how Surviving the Solaris x86 Wars 2004 - 2006 recollected the events :
Xenix - there was a lot of excitement in the market in the mid 1980s when 16 bit processors got enough disk space and memory to start running Unix .
Systems based on Motorola 's 68020 32 bit processor got a head start in the market because they were binary compatible with the 16 bit 68000 - which already had a bigger memory addressing range than the Intel chips at the time .
And the 68020 also had hardware support for virtual memory management .
Sun Microsystems ' own Sun - 3 workstations originally used Motorola chips .
But most IHVs had big investments in Intel .
So where could they turn to source a multi-user operating system ?
The surprising answer was Microsoft .
I joined an ISV and VAR called Databix in 1986 which was using Zilog boxes running Xenix as its main Unix development platform .
That was a problem because the Zilog Z8000 was a hardware dead end .
( Within a year I had switched our Unix platform to Sun .
But not the Sun platform you might think - see later . )
Microsoft stopped developing and supporting Xenix which later got transferred to SCO .
BTW one of the first Microsoft customers for Xenix was 3COM Corporation which had been founded in 1979 by Bob Metcalfe in Santa Clara .
He wanted to use Xenix for the development of TCP stack .
Soon after the initial port to Zilog , Microsoft started warming to Xenix port to 8086 .
That was also outsourced to SCO and proved to be very shrewd decision like many other moves of Bill Gates made .
PC 286 was around the corner and it provided real opportunity to Unix on microcomputer .
386 was a little bit father but was pretty adequate microprocessor for full Unix implementation .
Historically Microsoft XENIX became the first successful , in certain aspects groundbreaking , PC - based Unix .
At the time it was the only PC - friendly Unix in existence and can be considered to be the first Unix with a decent customer support service ;-) .

Later in 1980 I drove up to Bellevue with the Codata box with a Z8000 processor board in it for MicroSoft to port Version 7 onto .
To the best of my knowledge , that was MicroSoft 's first port of Xenix off of the PDP - 11 to any microprocessor .
This all took place around middle to end of 1980 , when MC68000 processors were not exactly ubiquitous .
You 'll maybe recall that the first outfit to announce MC68000 processor boards were MicroDaSys , and they went bankrupt [ taking a lot of forward financing with them ] without ever shipping anything .
Onyx also failed to produce an MC68000 based system .
And Sage microcomputers had a MC68000 based system that did n't last long , as did Fortune Systems and the rest of the herd .
After I 'd delivered the Codata / Z8000 box to MicroSoft , Clint Hurd , who was on the spot up there , supported the MicroSoft people who were porting .
I got out of the loop and lost track of what happened to the Xenix port .

Microsoft did n't sell XENIX directly to end users .
Instead , it licensed XENIX trademark and codebase to companies such as SCO , Tandy , and Intel , who sold a branded XENIX to users .
The most closely associated with XENIX was SCO -- an offshoot of TRW / Vidar ( a telecom company ) .
MS owned a controlling part of SCO during the mid 80's ( 25 % ) and had a single seat ( out of 5 ) on the board of directors ( correction [ Mar 9 , 2003 ] , thanks to Steve Finney - NNB ) .
So SCO served two distinct roles :
Porter of Xenix to various microprocessors , with the results sold to Microsoft and all intellectual property rights fully owned by Microsoft ( here SCO served as Microsoft contractor or even subsidiary )
, with the results sold to Microsoft and all intellectual property rights fully owned by Microsoft ( here SCO served as Microsoft contractor or even subsidiary )
Reseller like Intel , Tandy , etc , which licensed back XENIX codebase from Microsoft and produced its own branded version of Unix : SCO XENIX .
SCO like all other resellers licensed the name XENIX from Microsoft because they sold their trade name DYNIX to Sequent .
PC DOS saga of Microsoft was by - and large parallel development to Xenix saga : one year after Microsoft licensed Xenix from AT&T , it purchased all rights to 86 - DOS .
That happened in July 1981 .
Microsoft's " IBM Personal Computer DOS 1.0 " was ready for the introduction of the IBM PC in October 1981 .
That means that DOS happened just one year after Microsoft licensed XENIX from AT&T ..
Initially , Microsoft had big plans for XENIX and tried to insure DOS compatibility .
That has tremendously positive influence on MS DOS which in versions 2 and 3 acquired several Unix based innovations like hierarchical file system , pipes , redirections , etc , moving father and father from original CP/M .
Please remember that in 1981 Microsoft was young , ambitious and innovative company .
Here is a quote from the 3rd issue of PC Magazine , June / July 1982 from Paul Allen , Microsoft co-founder :
" It 's important to realize that MS - DOS is part of a family of operating systems .... Providing the user with a family of operating system capabilities means a clear migration path from MS - DOS to XENIX .
That means compatibility for both the terminal end user and the systems programmer .
A standard library for XENIX - 86 C will allow compilation of a program on XENIX system and then execution on MS - DOS .... XENIX systems will be able to function as network file servers . "
There were rumors that Gates even tried to sell XENIX to IBM in 1981 as the ultimate PC OS but unfortunately IBM brass was afraid of what a post - breakup AT&T could do to their markets .
Because of that IBM wanted nothing to do with Unix .
Later they were more accommodating and , in fact , IBM had planned to offer Xenix as an option for its AT computers in 1984 with Dumb Terminals hooked up to it for multi-user access .
Six year later ( 1986 ) they realized that this was a blunder and introduced AIX ( which , as the most bastardatized flavor of Unix , was another blunder ;-) .
From the timeline above its clear that work on XENIX and DOS proceed largely in parallel and some cross-pollination : XENIX greatly influenced DOS design .
For example Microsoft Press ' " MS - DOS Encyclopedia " shows a reproduction of a late DOS 1.25 OEM brochure which mention such future enhancements to DOS 1.25 as XENIX - compatible pipes , process forks , and multitasking , as well as " graphics and cursor positioning " .
That shows that Microsoft certainly tried to bring those two OSes closer , but the forks , multitasking , and multi-user support never materialized .
Oddly , the flyer claims :
" MS - DOS has no practical limit on disk size .
MS - DOS uses 4 - byte XENIX OS compatible pointers for file and disk capacity up to 4 gigabytes . "
Later XENIX became dominant Unix for Intel 286 PCs and was widely used in the industry , including of course Microsoft itself .
In July 1982 Microsoft 's Local Area Network ( MILAN ) , is up and running .
MILAN linked many computers running XENIX and made the transfer of e-mail easier .
People who worked in Microsoft back in the mid 80's can attest that everybody in the company from Bill Gates down to the secretaries had a access to XENIX and used it daily for email .
That also means that everybody used vi and should know vi before they could request vacation time .
That lasted until early 90th .
The last XENIX server on the MS corporate backbone was removed in late 96 -- early 1997 .
Primarily , they were used as Internet gateways , running Sendmail .
Also , they functioned as internal gateways between MSMail and Exchange while the company converted everyone over to having personal mailboxes on an Exchange server :
what developers at Microsoft ran ( Score : 5 , Informative )
by AdamBa ( 64128 ) on Saturday March 23 , @ 11:38 AM ( #3212973 )
When I arrived in early 1990 people were using OS / 2 for development .
For example the early development work for NT was done on OS / 2 and then cross-compiled for NT .
Keep in mind that up until September 1990 , NT * was * the next version of OS / 2 so this made perfect sense ... even after the " divorce " with IBM , OS / 2 1.2 was still the best development environment .
There was a push to self - host on NT which I recall became feasible in early 1992 .
Eventually more and more of the group switched over to it .
I think the rest of the company probably did n't switch until after the first version of NT shipped in July 1993 .
But it is indeed true that the standard email terminal in 1990 was connected to a XENIX machine , and there was a card handed out " how to use vi to edit email " or some such .
Actually I used vi for writing code for a while ... someone inside Microsoft had hacked up a version that supported multiple windows ... but eventually I switched to slick like most of the NT team .
Basically the incremental search in slick was cooler than the .
command in vi .
That means that in mid-80th the Microsoft love affair with Unix was company - wide .
Microsoft was the major Unix company at this time .
In late 80th there were more computers running Microsoft XENIX than all other versions of Unix combined ...

Around 1983 Microsoft realized that with the advent of the Intel 80286 in the mid-1980's , DOS was quickly becoming obsolete .
In 1984 , IBM introduced the PC - AT which was the first ( IBM ) PC to use then new Intel 80286 processor .
So the work on XENIX was intensified and in August of 1984 Microsoft released a really impressive PC - based version of Unix : XENIX 3 or XENIX 286 .
I remember that it was capable of dual booting from a partition with MS DOS on the other partition ( one of my university labs bought such a PC ; it was really cool ) .
It included new features from 4.1BSD and from AT&T's System III and instantly became a huge hit among Unix enthusiasts : it required just 512 K ( yes kilobytes ) of memory and 10 M harddrive and can run on $ 5000 IBM AT ( and AT clones ) PC : the cheapest Unix workstation of this time .
The PC - AT was supposed to be able to do multitasking , and some IBM publicity photos even showed it connected to two dumb terminals .
It was definitely possible but primarily Xenix was used as personal Unix or as a server .
May retailers and fast food chains , for example McDonalds , used to run their point of sales terminals on Xenix .
Anyway , for our subsequent discussion it is important to understand that XENIX was that first successful multi-user systems for Intel x86 microprocessor ( AT&T also sold something , but they cannot complete with Microsoft neither in quality nor in volume , and definitely not in marketing ) .
Here is an interesting recollection :
When I went to work in 1984 for the US Army European Headquarters in Heidelberg , Germany , I was delighted to discover that our office had a number of brand new Intel 8088 PCs , each with a whopping 10 MB hard drive .
Not long after I started work there , I discovered an unused area of the building that was being used for storage , and there were dozens of boxes of new computer equipment stacked in a corner ..
When I inquired about these , I was told that they came with the PCs , but nobody knew what they were for .
I discovered that these were " network file servers " , but I still was n't sure what they were designed to do .
" These must be the mainframes ! " I thought , falling back on my experience for an analogy .
I asked for permission to open the boxes and see what was inside .
" Sure " , I was told , " if you 're willing to do it on your own time . "
I began spending all my free time in this catacomb , uncrating the machines , identifying the function of each , and attempting to set them up according to the " Hardware Installation Guide " .
In fact , I opened the entire documentation set , placing the pages in the provided three ring binders , and began reading the manuals from the beginning .
I worked my way through the hardware manuals , then the installation of the operating system software ( Microsoft XENIX 286 ) and began studying the manuals on system administration , setting up user accounts , learning the multitude of XENIX utilities .
It was n’t until later , actually , that I realized this arcane little operating system was actually a port of a serious OS called UNIX , used by a variety of midrange systems , including workstations from a strange little company called Sun Microsystems .
Duh , I ’d learned UNIX by accident .
Microsoft XENIX enjoyed a huge success on PC AT .
In 1984 Fortune wrote that 750 universities around the world , about 80 % of those offering computer science degrees , have UNIX licenses .
Considerable part of those where XENIX licenses simply because Microsoft XENIX was the first cheap large volume commercial Unix .
For six years ( approximately from 1984 till 1990 ) Microsoft was one of the leading Unix vendors , the provider of the first cheap large volume commercial Unix and , simultaneously , owner of a major branch of Unix -- Xenix
Many early ISPs run their Usenet mail / news systems on XENIX , especially in Europe :
Yes , our e-mail system was started back in 1986 in Almviks Gård , Sweden , by the former Harikesa Swami , whose purpose was to improve communications within the BBT and his zone .
Prsnigarbha das had adapted existing Swedish BBS software and soon " COM " , as it was called , was up and running on a DEC PDP 11/45 , a big and ancient 16 - bit computer with 192 KB of memory and a 14 inch 160 MB Winchester harddisk .
The telephone lines in Almviks Gård were lousy , and calling in from other countries was difficult .
So , in 1987 COM moved to Korsnäs Gård , the headquarters of the NE - BBT , where it got a total of five login modems plus about fifteen direct ( serial ) lines connected to terminals in the BBT offices .
Soon the PDP computer was replaced by an Intel 386 PC with a 300 MB harddisk ( which was a monster capacity in those days ) , running XENIX as operating system .
Three Datapak lines ( X.25 packet switching network ) were added .
At the end of 1989 , COM got its own Internet domain ( bbt.se ) , and the software got adapted so that messages could be sent to and received from outside e-mail addresses .
COM would dial up the Internet provider a few times a day and exchanged mail using the UUPC protocol .
In those days , very few devotees had Internet access .
The worldwide Internet big bang would come only about two years later .
The last Microsoft version of XENIX , XENIX 5.0 was released in 1996 .
This version was result of joint AT&T and Microsoft efforts to bring Xenix into conformance with Unix System V Release 2 released in 1995 .
It was one of the most complete *nix environments and was widely used :
XENIX in 1989 ( Score : 3 , Insightful )

( http://cime.net | Last Journal : Wednesday March 06 , @03:16AM )
I deployed a number of XENIX installations in the mid- to late 1980's , the last one in either 1989 or 1990 .
We were competing against Novell Netware networks ( back when TeleVideo made that hideous Novell dedicated hardware with the 286 and the Z - 80 and all the way to the IBM PS / 2 model 80 days ) and usually beat them hands down for an inventory and POS application .
Our customers were medium - size enterprises ( up to 200 employees , up to five physical locations ) .
The configuration : HP Vectra 286 with 1 MB RAM (!!!) and 60 MB HD
12 RS - 232C port expansion ( for terminals )
Up to 12 TTY
App developed by my company
SCO XENIX ( ca n't remember the version )
The advantages of using this : Cost
Ease of maintenance
Rich tool set for the sys admins
High ROI ( return on investment ) for our customers
Higher profits for my company NCR * nix , XENIX , Minix , and AIX 3.0 were the first * nix OSs I was involved with , back in 1985 and forward .
I went from Apple 's Applesoft / ProDOS / MacOS / UCSD
Pascal to * nix , then to Microsoft 's world .
All in all , I remember XENIX being one of the most complete * nix environments I played with .
Only AIX running on RS / 6000 ( I was working on them prior to the announcement in March 1990 ) was more complete in its blend of SV and BSD tools .
SCO occasionally facilitated SCO
Unix to us but it was a PIA to install and configure , and lacked * lots * of driver support .
The interesting thing to us was that , while XENIX was an MS product , MS had a very hands off approach towards it .
All customer relationships were handled by SCO .
The only time I ever remember Bill G. saying something about it was when he was asked about branching NT away from OS / 2 and whether he was afraid of losing market share to * nix .
His reply ( I'm paraphrasing ) :
We have DOS , Windows , OS / 2 , XENIX , and NT .
It 's Microsoft against Microsoft against Microsoft against Microsoft .
Later in 1987 Microsoft became worried that AT&T 's newly - developed personal computer version of Unix might not run software applications originally written to run under Microsoft XENIX , so they asked AT&T to add some XENIX code to AT&T Unix in order to assure future compatibility .
A deal was struck between the companies : AT&T agreed to include the Microsoft code , and to pay Microsoft a royalty for its use .
The resulting version , UNIX System V/386 , release 3.l2 , incorporated all the functionality of traditional UNIX System V and XENIX .
It was released in August 1988 for 80386 - based computers .
Novell , and then SCO , inherited these terms when they purchased AT&T Unix .
Only in September of 1996 , SCO formally requested that Microsoft release them from the terms of the old contract .
All that means that XENIX was historically important flavor of Unix and to some extent can be considered ( along with AT&T and BSD ) to be the third branch of Unix that was merged into System V .
In the spring of 1988 , AT&T and Sun Microsystems signed a joint development agreement to merge their respective versions of UNIX into new version which later was called System V Release 4 ( SVR4 ) .
It merged the best features of System V and Berkeley UNIX and was compatible with programs written for either .
Sun abandoned its SunOS operating system in favor of this newly minted SVR4 - based branch and quickly released a SVR4 - compatible version called Solaris .
Despite fierce user resistance ( first Solaris versions were rather flaky , but starting from 2.5 they stabilized ) , they gradually moved users to new OS .
Approximately the same time IBM and Microsoft started developing a Unix alternative called OS / 2 .
For Microsoft that was a clear possibility to get rid of ( rather high ) AT&T licensing fees .
Released in December , 1987 , OS / 2 1.00 was text mode only and allowed only one program to be on the screen at a time , even though other programs could be running in the background .
It also allowed one very limited session in which DOS programs could be run .
The maximum disk size supported was 32 MB .
Release of OS / 2 ended Microsoft Unix history and we can clearly see IBM - role as a " Trojan horse " in the driving Microsoft from Unix market .
Which might mean that IBM love for Linux may be is connected with an inferiority complex of some IBM executives ;-) .
IBM can definitely own Unix instead of Novell if they understood the situation and played their cards right .
Or they could arrange selling Unix rights to Microsoft , and preserve close relationships that were broken due to OS / 2 vs. Windows wars .
Bill Gates speaking at Unix Expo in 1996 noted :
If we go way back in time , Microsoft was actually the first one to go to AT&T and beg to get a nice high - volume commercial license for Unix .
And for many , many years we were the highest volume licensee , not only for our own Xenix products , but Siemens with theirs , Santa Cruz with theirs , and dozens and dozens of sub-licensees .
I have to admit , it was fairly difficult to work with AT&T back then .
They simply did n't understand what they had .
They did n't understand how to manage the asset , either in terms of promoting it properly or in terms of making sure that there was n't fragmentation in how different implementations were put together .
And so that vacuum in leadership created a bit of a dilemma for everybody who was involved in Unix .
Well , Microsoft stepped back and looked at that situation and said that the best thing for us might be to start from scratch : build a new system , focus on having a lot of the great things about Unix , a lot of the great things about Windows , and also being a file - sharing server that would have the same kind of performance that , up until that point , had been unique to Novell 's Netware .
I think SCO until approximately 1987 was a Microsoft subsidiary or Microsoft owed a substantial part of the company ( 25 % ) and their importance to software world essentially comes from their early association with Microsoft .
Anyway here is an SCO - biased timeline of Xenix development ( the quote below is from SCO History ; please replace SCO with Microsoft for all years until 1987 ) :
1983 - SCO delivers the first packaged UNIX System ( called SCO ® XENIX ® System V ) for Intel® 8086 and 8088 processor - based PCs .
It provides small businesses with the first affordable business - critical computing system .
1985 - SCO delivers SCO XENIX 286 for Intel 80286 processor - based systems .
SCO XENIX 286 delivers on SCO 's commitment to " upward compatibility , " the ability of an operating system to run applications developed on earlier versions ( in this case , SCO XENIX System V ) .
1987 - SCO ships SCO XENIX 386 , the first 32 - bit operating system ( and first UNIX System ) for Intel 386 processor - based systems .
1989 - SCO ships SCO ® UNIX ® System V/386 , the first volume commercial product licensed by AT&T to use the UNIX System trademark .
In late 80th early 90th XENIX had became a major version of Unix for hobbyists , BBS operators and Usenet ( for example almost all USSR Usenet was running on XENIX ) .
Here is a typical quote from this period :
Summer 1990 ...
Scott and I discover some common interests and become friends .
We are united in our thought that there should be a more modern KAOS with all the fixin's : multiple phone lines , sysops who actually fix things and advertise the system 's presence , et cetera .
We decide to make a project of it .
He buys a load of hardware with some money that he'd made by doing consulting work .
We set the system up in Scott 's cellar .
He has gotten an illicit copy of SCO Xenix from a friend who works in SCO tech support , and somehow we load the machine and get it running .
We start coding , thinking that we 'll write our own BBS .
( For programmers , this was an all - too - common thought back then -- and generally a futile one . )
Eventually I find the Waffle BBS software through Usenet , and the list of features include everything we would have written into our own system .
We buy a copy and find out that it 's excellent -- almost exactly what we would have written .
It appears to have lineage common to our own ; its interface is similar to WWIV , a messaging - oriented , DOS - based BBS package .
Oddly enough , there are even some hints of GBBS , the Apple II BBS system that KAOS was built upon .
And it 'll run under Xenix - which is , roughly speaking , the major Unix variant that ran on x86 - based systems ( i.e. , PCs ! ) .
Nowadays , if you want to run Unix on a PC , you run Linux ( for the most part ) , but back in the day Linux had n't even been written yet .
Here is another typical quote :
After graduating high school in 1985 I went on to attend University of Delaware as an undergraduate in the Electrical Engineering department .
Since I had already taken UDel 's intro to computer science class in high school I got put into a special intro to computer science class that used FORTRAN rather than Pascal .
This was somewhat of a waste since I already knew all the topics covered in this class , however , I did manage to learn FORTRAN in the process .
Learning FORTRAN was n't as fun as learning COBOL because FORTRAN was n't all that different from Pascal and BASIC - PLUS .
I believe I used the " f77 " compiler on a VAX running 4.2BSD Unix .
Although I had used UDel 's Unix systems before ( via friend 's accounts ) this was my first real Unix account .
One of the positive features of UDel is that it has a one month " winter session " between fall and spring semester .
Taking a winter session class allows you to better enjoy living on campus while taking a light course load .
I had been playing with the Unix systems at UDel , but I found that my lack of knowledge of C was preventing me from learning what I wanted to fast enough .
So , during the winter session of my freshman year I took " CIS - 135 : C " and finally learned C. I really enjoyed this class .
Learning C helped me better understand Unix .
Also during this time I started playing / usr / games / hack frequently ( I used my newly learned C skills to examine and understand hack 's source code ) .
Also during my first winter session I started undergraduate research with Professor David J. Farber .
As part of Farber 's group ( F - Troup ) I got access to IBM - PC / AT 's running SCO 's Xenix operating system .
This was my first chance to learn about " root " access to a Unix - like system .
I was involved in several projects in this group .
I ported the MMDF electronic mail system to Xenix ( MMDF is still in use on SCO Unix systems today ) .
I wrote software for a PAL programmer that was used by Gary Delp to program PALs in his Memnet system .
And I worked with Ron Minnich to port ISODE ( the ISO network protocol development environment ) to Xenix ( painful ) .
We also attempted to write a device driver with Dave Crocker for an ISA Ethernet card , but Dave 's company never provided enough programming information for us to complete the driver .
In 1987 Farber left UDel to join UPenn , so I was out of work for a while .
Microsoft never released XENIX for 386 because of his work on OS / 2 which was essentially a Unix replacement on desktop .
Later Microsoft sold all rights for XENIX to SCO and completely disengaged itself from Unix market .
Despite the fact that Microsoft love affair with Unix was short lived it left a profound effect on PC Unixes look &feel .
Due to its quality and popularity XENIX became de-facto standard of what one should expect from PC Unix .
It also created a compatibility infrastructure that other developers can emulate including dual booting Dos and Unix and access to DOS partitions from Unix .
As we will see later most of enhancement Microsoft introduced ( multiple virtual consoles accessible via Alt - F1 , Alt - F2 , dual booting with MS - DOS , etc ) were later diligently copied by Linux .
See Slashdot discussion for some additional information .
But what is more important is that Microsoft actually significantly contributed to the creation of the development community behind Linux .
And not only with Xenix , although Xenix was Mecca of PC Unix enthusiasts in the Eastern Europe ( including former USSR ) .
That happened due to the fact that PCs were the most available and the most reliable hardware in this region , especially in universities .
Essentially Microsoft created the platform that made Linux possible .
Up to 1995 ( the start of Windows 95 vs. OS / 2 wars ) Microsoft was seen as the underdog ( compared to the still - evil IBM ) and MS DOS was the primary platform of computer enthusiasts .
There was entire cottage industries that catered to the nerd contingent e.g.
Borland , Norton ( famous Norton Commander as well as Norton Utilities with amazing disk editor ) , Xtree , etc .
Many enthusiasts would sit at home any try to construct something on their DOS computers , or push the performance of their 386sx hardware .
Level of sharing was fantastic as Symtel and Garbo collection of this time can attest .
All GNU work was just a tiny fraction of Symtel and Garbo content .
I used to run a PC user group from 1989 till 1994 and I know from my personal experience how energetic and dedicated was the first generation of PC enthusiasts .
Many people spent countless hours studying BIOS , disassembling DOS and trying to understand what a particular interrupt is doing or to replace standard DOS utility with their own , better variant or to write their own driver ( in non-English speaking countries almost any programmer worth the name has his / her own keyboard driver ;-) .
Talented DOS programmers wrote amazingly rich applications that in many ways superseded the limitations of DOS , which was essentially a simple program loader .
And some of those applications became a huge commercial success .
Applications like Lotus 123 , DB2 , Borland Turbo Pascal , Norton Commander , QuattroPro , Microsoft Word 4 and 5 , MultiEdit etc were higher quality and better engineered than many hugely expensive applications that I used to see on mainframes and mini-computers .
PC games was another explosive area which pushed the envelope of what is possible in graphic very quickly .
They also contributed to the continuing improvement of hardware , especially graphic capabilities of PCs .
Few people know that Microsoft devoted tremendous amount of technological and marketing talent into creating a unified hardware platform for DOS and then Windows .
It also paid tremendous attention to the developers .
PC was the first " poor man " development platform and as such it produced a powerful , dedicated development community .
To a certain extent with the growth of PC power Unix became more and more attractive and at some point some forking was inevitable .
But at the same time this would never be the same Unix , because all those developers have had strong DOS roots .
After DOS application experience Unix tools ( but not an OS itself ) looks pretty bland and people who returned or joined newly formed Unix - on - PC movement tried their best to reproduce best features of the DOS environment they were used to , and , especially , DOS development tools and applications .
And believe me , DOS application development tool chain were really , really slick ( I especially liked Borland compilers and applications ) and in user - friendliness surpassed Unix development tool chain by a wide margin despite the fact that Unix was much better OS then essentially a simple program loader which is what DOS was about .
Late version of DOS " pseudo - GUI " programs like MultiEdit and Slickedit were really more slick then , say , Emacs .
Quattro Pro and Fox Pro were examples of amazingly powerful applications for DOS environment .
Both have an extremely sophisticated pseudo - GUI interface ...
Also " early " Microsoft was charging reasonable prices for their products ( in the USA only , not so in Europe and especially Eastern Europe were prices were simply exorbitant ) , and DOS plus several other software products ( depending on the PC manufacturer ) arrived with your PC " free of charge " ( bundled product ) .
I would like to stress that the early - day Microsoft was often a pretty reasonable solution in terms of price .
For example , WordPerfect was very expensive and if you wanted spellchecker , that alone would cost you extra $ 300 .
Then Microsoft came around with more elegant Word , which was as functional as WordPerfect and way cheaper ( less then $ 200 ) .
Moreover MS
Word has styles and outlining from version 4 ( 1987 ) or may be even earlier .
It took almost a decade for the truth to come out but in approximately 1994 WordPerfect was pushed out of mainstream to the niche product .
The same was true for networking .
Windows NT kicked Novell ass in file and print services so badly that it later out of desperation Novell jumped into the Linux bandwagon just to survive .
NT instantly made Novell Netware to look like an over - priced , obscure OS , without any sexual appeal whatsoever ;-) .
Moreover NT got better with each release and Novell became just the bottom - feeder .
The bottom line is that in many areas Microsoft originally succeeded on it's merits and due to its ability to withstand initial failures and turn them into later success .
Bill Gates perfected the art of making better and cheaper software deposing competitor after competitor from important niches and creating standard de-facto out of Microsoft applications .
It was a brutal war and it's amazing that with such an intensity of the struggle Bill Gates did not undermined his health .
Gates often would do a whole day of negotiating deals , then return to the office work all night and go to the meeting the next morning .
His secretary sometime have found him sleeping on the floor of his office when she came to work .
But he " recharged " pretty fast .
It would just take a cup of coffee and he was ready for the next meeting .
Paradoxically despite becoming a real 300 pound Gorilla of PC space Microsoft was selling many of its applications cheaper then competitors .
In no way Bill Gates was charging " whoever market can bear " which was typical practice for the most software companies as the marketplace was brutal and you never can be sure that you will be around in a year or two .
People forget that IBM tried to charge $ 325 for OS / 2 .
Despite this uncertainty , salaries in Microsoft were pretty low .
In 1985 Gates had salary of $ 133 K and Ballmer $ 88 K .
By solving all the problems connected with creating of PC Unix and then withdrawing yourself from the huge market it created , Microsoft created extremely favorable conditions for a new " piggiback " PC Unix .
Just think about how many books written about Xenix were printed due to the Microsoft entrance to the field .
And they were printed in numbers that were far bigger than for any other platform .
You can buy them even now , 20 years after .
It is interesting to note that the 1985 - 1989 Xenix book explosion was bigger then later 1993 - 1999 Linux book explosion .
Here is a small sample of what is still available on Amazon.com 20 years later :
The second important fact that is often overlooked by naive or crooked Linux zealots is that Microsoft was essentially a software company that controls and extends the PC hardware standard .
Without huge Microsoft investments in PC hardware standard there can be no any substantial base for Linux at all because price of hardware is discounted due to the volume of Microsoft software sells .
In this sense Linux is a side effect of Microsoft dominance , a bastard child of DOS and Windows and no number of Linus Torvalds interviews can change the fact that he just replicated Microsoft 's abandoned effort with Xenix .
Paradoxically with less innovation and quality : Linux kernel was first and foremost about " premature optimization " , not so much about new architectural features which can expand the Unix capabilities envelope .

In recent years , more and more evidence has emerged , showing that certain chemicals are causing damage to the endocrine system of both wildlife and humans .
Male infertility , in particular , is on the rise , and about 250,000 fewer boys have been born in the last 30 years in the U.S. and Japan .
Scientists are linking these phenomena to an accumulation of “ gender - bending ” toxins called endocrine disruptors .
Based on the initial evidence , Congress passed the Food Quality Protection Act in 1996 , which required the EPA to initiate the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program ( EDSP ) [ 1 ] to screen pesticide chemicals and environmental contaminants for their potential to affect the endocrine systems of both animals and humans .
However , despite the fact that more than a decade has passed since the beginning of the program , the market is literally flooded with chemicals that have the potential to wreak havoc with your health .
Especially when you ’re exposed to them in a myriad of untested combinations .
Says CHEM
Trust [ 2 ] director , Elizabeth Salter Green :
“ Chemicals that have been shown to act together to affect male reproductive health should have their risks assessed together .
Currently that is not the case , and unfortunately chemicals are looked at on an individual basis .
Therefore , government assurances that exposures are too low to have any effect just do not hold water because regulators do not take into account the additive actions of hormone disrupting chemicals . ”
Why it ’s critical to protect your endocrine system
Your endocrine system is a complex network of glands , hormones and receptors , which works in tandem with your nervous system to control all your bodily functions and processes .
The glands of your endocrine system and the hormones they release influence almost every cell , organ , and function of your body .
It is instrumental in regulating mood , growth and development , tissue function , metabolism , as well as sexual function and reproductive processes .
Endocrine disrupters are substances or mixtures that alter the functions of your endocrine system and consequently cause adverse health effects , either in your body or in your offspring .
These types of chemicals can exert their effects by :
Mimicking the biological activity of your hormones by binding to a cellular receptor .
This can initiate your cell ’s normal response to the naturally occurring hormone at the wrong time or to an excessive extent ( agonistic effect ) .
Binding to the receptor but not activating it .
Instead the presence of the chemical on the receptor prevents binding of the natural hormone ( antagonistic effect ) .
Binding to transport proteins in your blood , thus altering the amounts of natural hormones that are present in your blood circulation .
Interfering with the metabolic processes in your body , affecting the synthesis or breakdown rates of your natural hormones .
So far , the main areas of scientific study have focused on disruption to the hormones that play a major part in development and reproduction , mainly estrogens and androgens .
These hormones also influence your immune system and general metabolism .
The strongest evidence showing that exposure to environmental chemicals can lead to disruption of endocrine function comes from the bizarre changes seen in a number of wildlife species , such as male fish transforming into females ; frogs developing a variety of defects like multiple testes or ovaries ; and hermaphrodite bears , just to name a few .
The Dirty Dozen potential endocrine disrupters to avoid
Endocrine disrupting chemicals are everywhere these days .
You are exposed to them from a variety of sources , including countless common household products , toys , personal care products , and cosmetics .
Here ’s a list of twelve common agents with hormonal activity , i.e. potential endocrine disrupters :
1. Phthalates :
Exposure to phthalates can lead to incomplete testicular descent in fetuses .
Phthalates are found in vinyl flooring , detergents , automotive plastics , soap , shampoo , deodorants , fragrances , hair spray , nail polish , plastic bags , food packaging , garden hoses , inflatable toys , blood - storage bags , and intravenous medical tubing .
2. Bisphenol A :
A common ingredient in many plastics , including those in reusable water bottles and resins lining some food cans and dental sealants , can change the course of fetal development in a way that increases your risk of breast cancer .
3. Perfluorooctanoic acid ( PFOA ) :
Found in grease - and water - resistant coatings like Teflon and Gore - Tex , is a likely carcinogen .
4. Methoxychlor and Vinclozin :
An insecticide and a fungicide respectively , have been found to cause changes to male mice born for as many as four subsequent generations after the initial exposure .
5. Nonylphenol ethoxylates ( NPEs ) :
Known to be potent endocrine disrupters , these chemicals affect gene expression by turning on or off certain genes , and interfere with the way your glandular system works .
They mimic the female hormone estrogen , and have been implicated as one reason behind some marine species switching from male to female .
6 . Bovine growth hormones :
Commonly added to commercial dairy have been implicated as a contributor to premature adolescence .
7 . Soy products :
Soy products are loaded with hormone - like substances .
8. MSG :
A food additive that ’s been linked to reduced fertility .
9. Fluoride :
This chemical in the U.S. water supply has been linked to lower fertility rates , hormone disruption and low sperm counts .
10 . Synthetically produced pharmaceuticals :
Drugs that are intended to be highly hormonally active , such as contraceptive pills and treatments for hormone - responsive cancers .
Your body is not designed to be exposed to these synthetic hormones , and long - term use will invariably increase your risk of developing serious chronic illness .
11 . Other natural chemicals :
This includes toxins produced by components of plants ( the so - called phytoestrogens , such as genistein or coumestrol ) and certain fungi .
12 . Other man -made chemicals and by - products released into the environment :
These include some pesticides ( such as pyrethroids , linuron , vinclozolin , fenitrothion , DDT and other chlorinated compounds ) , and a number of industrial chemicals like polychlorinated biphenols ( PCBs ) and dioxins .
How these chemicals affect your health
Certain health patterns over recent decades suggest that endocrine disrupting chemicals are quietly at work .
These include :
declining sperm counts
increased incidences of male children born with genital malformations
increased incidences of certain hormone - sensitive types of cancer
impaired neural development , causing memory problems and lower IQ
impaired sexual behavior
precocious puberty
delayed sexual development

There is little to no evidence that circumcision protects men who have sex with men from infection .
Another reason circumcision would have less of an impact in the United States is that some 79 percent of adult American men are already circumcised , public health officials say .
But newborn circumcision rates have dropped in recent decades , to about 65 percent of newborns in 1999 from a high of about 80 percent after World War II , according to C.D.C. figures .
And blacks and Hispanics , who have been affected disproportionately by AIDS , are less likely than whites to circumcise their baby boys , according to the agency .
Circumcision rates have fallen in part because the American Academy of Pediatrics , which sets the guidelines for infant care , does not endorse routine circumcision .
Its policy says that circumcision is “ not essential to the child ’s current well - being , ” and as a result , many state Medicaid programs do not cover the operation .
The academy is revising its guidelines , however , and is likely to do away with the neutral tone in favor of a more encouraging policy stating that circumcision has health benefits even beyond H.I.V. prevention , like reducing urinary tract infections for baby boys , said Dr. Michael Brady , a consultant to the American Academy of Pediatrics .
He said the academy would probably stop short of recommending routine surgery , however .
“ We do have evidence to suggest there are health benefits , and families should be given an opportunity to know what they are , ” he said .
But , he said , the value of circumcision for H.I.V. protection in the United States is difficult to assess , adding , “ Our biggest struggle is trying to figure out how to understand the true value for Americans . ”
Circumcision will be discussed this week at the C.D.C. ’s National H.I.V.
Prevention Conference in Atlanta , which will be attended by thousands of health professionals and H.I.V. service providers .
Among the speakers is a physician from Operation Abraham , an organization based in Israel and named after the biblical figure who was circumcised at an advanced age , according to the book of Genesis .
The group trains doctors in Africa to perform circumcisions on adult men to reduce the spread of H.I.V .
The tantalizing question about William Gibson 's ideas in his novel Neuromancer involves their relationship with the course that the Web took and continues to take as Neuromancer 's publication date -- July 1 , 1984 , 25 years ago today - - recedes farther into the past .
In his afterword to the 2000 re-release of the book , novelist Jack Womack suggests that Neuromancer may have directly influenced the way the Web developed -- that it may have provided a blueprint that developers who grew up with the book consciously or subconsciously followed .
Womack asks " what if the act of writing it down , in fact , brought it about ? "
I 'll take a stab at discussing Neuromancer 's major tech inventions , including the ones that are already coming true , as well as some that seem unlikely to happen anytime soon .
First , a little background .
Neuromancer tells the story of Case , once a hot and high - paid cyberspace cowboy who could infiltrate and rip off corporate databases .
But he stole from his employer , who took revenge by crippling Case 's nervous system with a mycotoxin , rendering him unable to hack .
Alone and suicidal , Case is scooped off the street and given a second chance by a shadowy group of people who have big ( and scary ) plans .
In exchange for curing Case 's nervous system , they want him to help them infiltrate the core of a huge and powerful AI ( artificial intelligence ) called Wintermute .
If you have n't already read Neuromancer , consult the ( nicely done ) plot summary on the Neuromancer Wiki page , which includes a handy character index and a glossary of terms .
The novel is widely credited with popularizing the term " Cyberspace , " with presenting a thoroughly developed idea of virtual reality , and with introducing the idea of the World Wide Web .
Neuromancer also gave rise to a whole new genre in literature : cyberpunk .
The World Wide Web
The prognostication in Neuromancer that rings most true today is the novel 's idea of a World Wide Web .
The concept of an Internet already existed when Gibson wrote Neuromancer in 1984 :
In the early eighties , several universities had strung together various systems of servers via a telecom link .
What Gibson introduced was the idea of a global network of millions of computers , which he described in astonishing detail -- though the World Wide Web , as we know it today , was still more than a decade away .
Imagine the novelty of that idea in 1984 when the personal computer was still a fairly new idea .
Of course , things start getting really interesting only in the nineties , when technology linked all of those computers together .
Cyberspace / Virtual Reality
But Gibson took the World Wide Web much further .
By introducing the concept of cyberspace , he made the Web a habitable place , with all the world 's data stores represented as visual , even palpable , structures arranged in an endless matrix .
Gibson 's cyberspace also turned computing into an experience that involved all of the senses .
Instead of interacting with the network visually by using a computer monitor , Gibson 's characters " jack in " and navigate an enveloping 3D world .
Each user is " connected " to the computer via a system of electrodes and neural interfaces emerging from a laptop - type thing called a " deck . "
Once hooked up and inside cyberspace , the user can experience intense beauty , such as the sight of the huge , shining cities of data that Gibson describes .
Here 's how Gibson describes it in the early pages of Neuromancer : " Cyberspace .
A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators , in every nation , by children being taught mathematical concepts ...
A graphic representation of data abstracted from banks of every computer in the human system .
Unthinkable complexity .
Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind , clusters and constellations of data .
Like city lights , receding . "
On the other hand , if something goes wrong , as during Case 's risky hacks of corporate databases , the user can feel actual pain and even die ( or " flatline , " to use Gibson term ) .
Think that idea of " jacking in " is far - fetched ?
Check out this ScienceDaily news account from way back on March 14 , 2002 : " Researchers at Brown University have used a tiny array of electrodes to record , interpret , and reconstruct the brain activity that controls hand movement -- and they have demonstrated that thoughts alone can move a cursor across a computer screen to hit a target . "
The virtual worlds that we have today are a long way from the " consensual hallucination " of cyberspace as imagined by Gibson .
But we can see some very promising beginnings .
Linden Lab's Second Life captures many people 's imagination because it adds the next layer of experience to the Internet .
Second Life builds a visual , aural , participatory world on top of -- and as an expression of -- the dead network of computers that forms the Web .
Of course , Second Life involves no direct hookup to the user 's frontal lobes , as Gibson 's cyberspace does .
And Second Life differs in another key way :
It seeks to replicate the real world that we 're already familiar with .
Though still in rudimentary form , Second Life seems to strive toward the model put forth in The Matrix , in which the virtual world is an exact , full - sensory " simulation " of what its inhabitants know ( or remember ) as real life .
Gibson 's cyberspace similarly engages all of your senses , but it is nothing like the real world and does n't purport to be .
But whereas in The Matrix technology functions primarily as a means of control , in Neuromancer its role is more complicated :
At times technology is benevolent , and at other times it 's malevolent .
Many of the inhabitants of Neuromancer 's near - future world see technology as a liberating force , a way to escape from the ravages of pollution , disease , and war .
Fixation on Technology
Ultimately Neuromancer is a book about the increasing presence of technology in the life of human beings .
This may well be the dominant story line of the 21st century .
People in Neuromancer constantly use , wear , think about , and talk about technology in its various forms .
Case uses a deck , goggles , electrodes , and other gear to jack into cyberspace .
Others insert tiny chips called " microsofts " ( no relation to Bill Gates 's company ) into slots behind their ears .
Microsofts form a direct neural link with the brain and can deliver anything from raw data to games to various forms of entertainment ( such as " simstim , " described below ) .
Here 's Gibson introducing the idea of microsofts in chapter 4 : " Booths lined a central hall .
The clientele were young [... ] .
They all seemed to have carbon sockets planted behind the left ear [... ] .
Behind the counter a boy with a shaven head stared vacantly into space , a dozen spikes of Microsoft protruding from the socket behind his ear . "
Another character in Neuromancer , an art dealer , leaves seven microsofts inserted behind his ear to make him a walking encyclopedia of art history .
Gibson 's view of tech culture in the future is starting to look a lot less exotic .
Despite its advances , we tend to experience technology as a slow , creeping force in life -- with effects so gradual that we do n't really notice .
But look around ; it 's everywhere .
If it all suddenly shut down , we'd be helpless .
And if Gibson is right , technology will play an even bigger part in life and culture over the next 25 years .
Prosthetics and Plastic Surgery
Gibson was fascinated with plastic surgery , the physical integration of human and man-made tissues , and the logical limits that they might evolve toward in a not - so - distant future .
Almost everybody in Neuromancer has some kind of physical enhancement .
One cybercowboy has a Russian - made computerized heart .
Case 's friend Molly has mirrored cybernetic eyes built into her sockets that constantly show her the time and other data , and enable her to see in the dark .
A bartender has a cybernetic arm that buzzes quietly when it moves .
Joeboys ( bodyguards ) show up with huge " vat - grown " muscles grafted onto their arms .
The goal of plastic surgery in Neuromancer is not so much to enhance beauty as to serve anonymity .
Gibson 's characters wear their altered skin like masks .
In chapter 4 Gibson describes the face of a local gangster in Chiba City : " His [ Angelo ] face was a simple graft grown on collagen and shark - cartilage polysaccharides , smooth and hideous . "
The same character might show up a year later with a completely different face , the novel suggests .
Just this year , the science of plastic surgery achieved its first full - face transplant .
Plastic surgeons routinely enhance biceps , chest , and butt muscles .
When science perfects the growth of human tissue to predetermined specifications , the industry will likely mushroom again .
Twenty - five years after Neuromancer , Gibson 's vision of the , uh , " beauty image " is closer than you might think .
Not Gonna Happen Soon
On the other hand , some of Neuromancer 's ideas are unlikely to happen for a long , long time , if they happen at all .
Here are a few that fall into the do n't - hold - your - breath column .
Simstim
Again riffing on the human / computer integration theme , Gibson identifies the major form of entertainment in the world of Neuromancer as simstim ( Simulation / Stimulation ) .
Simstim is a recording ( or live broadcast ) of the sensory experience of one person that , with the help of a simstim deck , can be re-created exactly in the brain of another .
To the person experiencing the simstim , it 's like viewing the world through another person 's eyes , hearing with their ears , feeling with their skin , smelling with their nose .
It 's the full sensory stimulation of another person .
In Neuromancer ( and later , more thoroughly , in Mona Lisa Overdrive ) , simstim conjures up the way we think of popular recording artists or film stars today .
In Neuromancer , the simstim star of the day is a young girl named Tally Isham .
Kids line up and wait for hours just to catch a glimpse of her .
She 's the Britney Spears of simstim .
" The commercial stuff was edited , of course , so that if Tally Isham got a headache in the course of a segment , you did n't feel it , " Gibson explains .
Neuromancer 's main character , Case , can jump inside the body of his partner in crime , ninja girl Molly , by running her live simstim feed through the electrodes attached to his head .
Here 's Gibson describing the sensation : " Then he keyed the new switch .
The abrupt jolt into other flesh .
Matrix gone , a wave of sound and colour ... She was moving through a crowded street , past stalls vending discount software , prices feltpenned on sheets of plastic , fragments of music from countless speakers .
Smells of urine , free monomers , perfume , patties of frying krill .
For a few frightened seconds he fought helplessly to control her body .
Then he willed himself into passivity , became the passenger behind her eyes . "
Far - fetched , far out , and far off , but pretty damn cool .
Rogue AIs
If there is a " bad guy " in Neuromancer it is an AI called Wintermute .
The collective intelligence of a massive network of computers , Wintermute has the ability to think , learn , communicate , and control the actions of any piece of technology connected to it .
Wintermute , we find out , has been craftily controlling the characters in Neuromancer to do its bidding , to free it from real - world limitations on its ability to learn more and grow stronger .
As far as I know , we are still a long , long way from facing this sort of entity .
Sure we use massive computer systems to manage huge amounts of data .
And we have even used that data , in some instances , to target and do harm to specific individuals of groups .
Moreover , to some extent , our computer systems can think and reason .
But existing computer systems are not self - aware and self - determined like the ones in Neuromancer .
That could change .
Some people in the AI community believe that once we succeed in building a machine smart enough to build still smarter machines without human assistance , the machines will quickly grow smarter and more powerful by orders of magnitude .
Check out the first segment of the Animatrix series for a poignant anime speculation / dramatization of how this might happen .
Constructs
Neuromancer tells of famous hacker , McCoy Pauley , who originally taught Case how to hack and later died of heart failure during an especially dangerous assault in cyberspace .
But before Pauley died ( in the clinical sense ) , some people hooked his brain up to a computer and dumped the contents -- his hacking expertise , memories , habits , idiosyncrasies , everything -- out onto a ROM cassette , creating a " construct " of the former hacker .
Long after the flesh - and - bone Pauley 's death , Case and Molly steal the construct , which can think and talk , so that Pauley can help them complete their mission .
The conversations between Case and " the flatline " as he calls the construct , are priceless .
The construct is n't quite sure whether he 's alive or dead , and when he learns that he is just data on a disk he is n't very happy about the situation .
Pauley eventually asks Case to erase the ROM , effectively putting his mind to rest for good .
Can a person 's consciousness -- the whole neurological operating system -- be recorded and preserved even as the physical body expires ?
This prospect raises a lot of messy ethical , philosophical , spiritual , and legal questions that neither I nor my children will likely have to wrestle with .
Very good reading , for sure , but very future - tense technology .
Neuromancer is important because of its astounding predictive power .
Gibson 's core idea in the novel is the direct integration of man and computer , with all the possibilities ( and horrors ) that such a union entails .
The book eventually sold more than 160 million copies , but bringing the book to popular attention took a long time and a lot of word - of - mouth .
The sci - fi , community , however , was acutely aware of the novel 's importance when it came out : Neuromancer ran the table on sci-fi's big three awards in 1984 , winning the Hugo Award , the Philip K. Dick Memorial Award , and the Nebula Award .
This story , " Neuromancer turns 25 :
What it got right , what it got wrong " was originally published by PCWorld .
WASHINGTON  The Senate on Wednesday turned aside the latest effort by gun advocates to expand the rights of gun owners , narrowly voting down a provision that would have allowed gun owners with valid permits from one state to carry concealed weapons in other states .
A group comprising mostly Republicans , along with some influential Democrats , had tried to attach the gun amendment to the annual military authorization bill , a must - pass piece of legislation .
But the provision got only 58 votes , two short of the 60 needed under Senate rules .
Two Republicans , Senators Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and George V. Voinovich of Ohio , joined with 35 Democrats and 2 independents to reject the amendment , which was bitterly opposed by a number of big-city mayors , including Michael R. Bloomberg of New York .
The debate forced senators to wrestle with issues of states rights , sometimes in ways that seemed to clash with the general philosophies of their parties .
Many Republicans , who typically favor limiting the ability of the federal government to dictate to states on social issues , voted in this case to limit the ability of states to insist on their own rules for concealed weapons carried by people from other states .
__ 1877 : __The U.S. Patent Office grants German engineer Nicolaus August Otto a patent for an " improvement in gas - motor engines . "
Internal combustion 's time — and timing — have come .
More than a century - and - a - quarter later , we have whole economies , musical subgenres and sports based around what Herr Otto , he of the macaronically ironic name , created .
The first engines ( as we know the term today ) were steam engines .
Boil some water , make some steam , and use that to move a piston back and forth .
It worked great for trains ( with trained engineers and firemen ) and for the stationary engines of the industrial revolution .
For personal mobility , however , the steam engine lacked some crucial refinements .
For one , it was an external combustion engine :
The fire was applied to the outside .
Belgian inventor Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir produced a gas - fired internal combustion engine in 1860 .
Introduce ignitable gas and air into a cylinder , add a spark ... and BOOM , the piston moves .
Maybe not very efficiently , yet it moves .
The original two - stroke design was less than optimal , until along came Nicolaus Otto , who was that most dangerous of men : a tinkerer .
His official business was being a traveling salesman , but he started poking around with these newfangled power sources in the 1860s .
Otto invented a whole new scheme for the inner workings of an internal combustion engine .
He created an engine that used a four - stroke cycle .
Instead of just putting the fuel into the cylinder with the piston at the top of its travel , Otto 's engine sucked the fuel - air mixture in on the downstroke , closed the valves , and ingeniously used the piston 's own upstroke to compress the mixture before igniting it .
This is the suck - squeeze - bang - blow design that all motorheads , grease monkeys , knucklebusters and the like worship to this day .
Otto 's big contribution was in the " squeeze " portion of the cycle .
Compressing the mixture of fuel and air made his engine much more efficient than its predecessors .
He had a tabletop model of the thing running by 1862 , but did n't get it thrumming to his Teutonic satisfaction until 1876 .
Otto was awarded U.S. Patent No. 194,047 on Aug. 14 , 1877 .
And the next thing you know , there were highways and drive-ins and necker knobs and Beach Boys songs and the Indy 500 .
Getting from point A to point B was no longer dependent on a finicky horse or a predetermined train schedule .
It was when you wanted to go , and as far as you wanted to go .

Sonst droht das großartige Internet ein rechtsfreier Chaosraum zu werden , in dem man hemmungslos mobben , beleidigen und betrügen kann . “
Von der Leyen betonte : „ Wo die Würde eines anderen verletzt wird , endet die eigene Freiheit .
Welche Schritte für den Schutz dieser Grenzen notwendig sind , ist Teil einer unverzichtbaren Debatte , um die die Gesellschaft nicht herumkommt . “
Die Ministerin trat Spekulationen über eine Verzögerung der geplanten Sperrung kinderpornographischer Seiten entgegen .
„ Die Sperrungen beginnen spätestens Mitte Oktober “ , sagte sie .
„ Dazu haben sich die fünf wichtigsten Provider , die 75 Prozent des Marktes beherrschen , vertraglich verpflichtet .
Bis dahin müssen sie die technischen Voraussetzungen geschaffen haben . “
Ihren Kritikern hielt von der Leyen entgegen , selbst kein Rezept gegen Kinderpornographie im Internet zu haben .
Sie wüssten „ auch keine Lösung " , sagte sie .
„ An diesem Punkt kann ein Staat aber nicht stehen bleiben , sondern die Gesellschaft muss miteinander einen Ausweg finden . “
Die Gefahr , junge Unionswähler könnten etwa zur Piratenpartei abwandern , sehe sie „ überhaupt nicht “ .
Nach Protesten gegen den Vorstoß betonte der Sprecher von der Leyens , die Ministerin plane keine weiteren Sperren von Internetseiten , sondern plädiere für eine gesellschaftliche Debatte über „ die Freiheit und Grenzen im Internet “ .
Das Interview im Wortlaut :
abendblatt.de : Frau Ministerin , im vergangenen Herbst haben Sie im Hamburger Abendblatt Ihre Pläne zur Sperrung kinderpornografischer Internet - Seiten angekündigt .
Wann wird die erste Seite gesperrt ?
Ursula von der Leyen : Die Sperrungen beginnen spätestens Mitte Oktober .
Dazu haben sich die fünf wichtigsten Provider , die 75 Prozent des Marktes beherrschen , vertraglich verpflichtet .
Bis dahin müssen sie die technischen Voraussetzungen geschaffen haben .
abendblatt.de : Sie argumentieren , Grundregeln unserer Gesellschaft müssten online wie offline gelten .
Warum sperren
Sie dann nicht auch Internetseiten , die Nazipropaganda verbreiten oder Gewalt gegen Frauen verherrlichen ?
Von der Leyen :
Mir geht es jetzt um den Kampf gegen die ungehinderte Verbreitung von Bildern vergewaltigter Kinder .
Der Straftatbestand Kinderpornografie ist klar abgrenzbar .20
Doch wir werden weiter Diskussionen führen , wie wir Meinungsfreiheit , Demokratie und Menschenwürde im Internet im richtigen Maß erhalten .
Sonst droht das großar tige Internet ein rechtsfreier Chaosraum zu werden , in dem man hemmungslos mobben , beleidigen und betrügen kann .
Wo die Würde eines anderen verletzt wird , endet die eigene Freiheit .
Welche Schritte für den Schutz dieser Grenzen notwendig sind , ist Teil einer unverzichtbaren Debatte , um die die Gesellschaft nicht herumkommt .
abendblatt.de Diese Debatte hat bereits eine neue politische Kraft hervorgebracht .
Haben Sie die Sorge , dass die Piratenpartei auch für junge Unionswähler eine große Anziehungskraft entwickelt ?
Von der Leyen : Überhaupt nicht .
Aber ich finde es toll , dass diese jungen Menschen sich politisch engagieren , sich einmischen und mitmachen .
Das ist der Anfang dafür , dass man auf eine jugendlich - forsche
Art über den richtigen
Weg ringt .
Wenn ich die jungen Menschen aber frage , was sie vorschlagen , wenn die Server , die die Kinderpornografie verbreiten , unerreichbar für die Strafverfolgungsbehörden in fernen Ländern stehen , dann wissen sie auch keine Lösung .
An diesem Punkt kann ein Staat aber nicht stehen bleiben , sondern die Gesellschaft muss miteinander einen Ausweg finden .
abendblatt.de : Sie werden auch persönlich angegriffen .
Macht Sie das nachdenklich ?
Von der Leyen :
Wenn sie meinen Spitznamen Zensursula meinen , ist das in Ordnung .
Ich find e das pfiffig .
Es zeigt Humor und Kreativität .
abendblatt.de : Die Piratenpartei hat den ehemaligen SPD - Politiker Jörg Tauss aufgenommen , der20 wegen des Besitzes von Kinderpornografie angeklagt ist .
Wie kommt Ihnen das vor ?
Von der Leyen : Das Verhalten von jemandem , der in einem laufenden Strafverfahren steht , kann ich nicht kommentieren .
Aber ich habe erlebt , wie Jörg Tauss als Abgeordneter die SPD am Anfang die Debatte über den Umgang mit der Kinderpornografie dominiert hat .
Er wollte jegliche Form von Regulierung im Internet verhindern .
Dann wurde das Strafverfahren gegen ihn eröffnet .
Inzwischen sind viele in der SPD nachdenklich geworden .
I was recently aware of this problem when I noticed I was n’t getting visual voicemail for the past several weeks .
I dialed and held the # 1 on my keypad to see if I missed any voicemail .
Turns out I had over 20 business and personal messages .
So I Googled only to find out this problem has been going on for weeks and has appeared on both CNET and TechCrunch .
This leads to my rant on why the Visual Voicemail issue is n’t even the worst part .
What really bothered me was AT&T ’s lack of responsibility to notifying and informing their customers of this issue so people could manually check their voicemail until this issue has been resolved .
AT&T is aware of this problem and has been supposedly working on a fix for several weeks now .
Therefore , it is absolutely inexcusable for AT&T not to publicize this failure .
Voicemail is an integral to our lives as email .
I contacted AT&T Tech Support twice and both customer service representatives were not aware of this problem .
How can a system wide issue not be communicated to even their own support staff ?
My real estate agent was also missing my voicemail until I told her about this issue .
She ’s had several dozen messages that were missed .
Another friend of mine missed over 40 messages .
How much loss in business do you think could have been prevented if AT&T advised their customers to check their voicemail manually ?
What has changed ?
There were not any new features in Visual Voicemail that could have broken it !
Our GadgetMETER writer , Jay Chang , made a wonderful suggestion : switch to Google Voice .
Which is exactly what HE did .
Here is our laundry list of complaints with the Death Star known as AT &T …. and yes , I cannot wait for the Class Action Lawsuit .
Maybe George Lucas will make another Star Wars Trilogy .
AT&T did not notify customers about a known issue with visual voicemail causing loss of business and life disruptions .
Poor 3G service in New York City and San Fransisco .
Would you bother upgrading to 3GS knowing you would get shady service in these cities ?
Long term contracts .
I get it .
The contracts help subsidize the iPhone purchase .
However , AT&T has taken advantage of this by overcharging because Verizon is not in the iPhone game .
Once Verizon is , I ’m giving AT&T a two fingered salute goodbye !
Still no official 3G tethering .
I ’ve heard they are planning to charge more .
Why does AT&T plan to rape their customers ?
We already paid for the data plan , it should n’t matter what devices use it .
Comcast Internet does n’t charge me extra for additional devices I use on my Wi-Fi connection at home .
If you want to do a simple hack to tether the iPhone 3.0 , check out our post here .
Telecom companies have never been known to innovate and move technology forward .
It ’s always been Silicon Valley .
Once we move to Wi-Max and Google offers its own low cost or free universal Internet Access , I would excpect to see low cost data and voice plans .
If you are having iPhone visual voicemail problems , try these steps from CNET .
It did n’t work for me but apparently it worked for others .
I cannot imagine all the problems in people ’s lives this has caused .

Ben Stein Watch , the world 's worst financial columnist has finally been fired from the New York Times .

And I could n’t be happier .
The reason was his appearance in commercials for ( and on the homepage of ) freescore.com , a sleazy company which exists only to extract large sums of money from those who can least afford it .
NYT spokeswoman Catherine Mathis confirmed this , telling Gawker that “ Ben Stein ’s fine work for us as a columnist for Sunday Business had to end , we told him , after we learned that he had become a commercial spokesman for FreeScore , a financial services company . ”

Gaza has been reduced to a state of abject destitution .
( Wissam Nassar / MaanImages )
US
US
US
Gaza is an example of a society that has been deliberately reduced to a state of abject destitution , its once productive population transformed into one of aid - dependent paupers .
This context is undeniably one of mass suffering , created largely by Israel but with the active complicity of the international community , especially the US and European Union , and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank .
Gaza ’s subjection began long before Israel ’s recent war against it .
The Israeli occupation — now largely forgotten or denied by the international community — has devastated Gaza ’s economy and people , especially since 2006 .
Although economic restrictions actually increased before Hamas ’ electoral victory in January 2006 , the deepened sanction regime and siege subsequently imposed by Israel and the international community , and later intensified in June 2007 when Hamas seized control of Gaza , has all but destroyed the local economy .
If there has been a pronounced theme among the many Palestinians , Israelis and internationals who I have interviewed in the last three years , it was the fear of damage to Gaza ’s society and economy so profound that billions of dollars and generations of people would be required to address it — a fear that has now been realized .
After Israel ’s December assault , Gaza ’s already compromised conditions have become virtually unlivable .
Livelihoods , homes and public infrastructure have been damaged or destroyed on a scale that even the Israeli army admitted was indefensible .
In Gaza today , there is no private sector to speak of and no industry .
Eighty percent of Gaza ’s agricultural crops were destroyed and Israel continues to snipe at farmers attempting to plant and tend fields near the well - fenced and patrolled border .
Most productive activity has been extinguished .
One powerful expression of Gaza ’s economic demise — and the Gazans ’ indomitable will to provide for themselves and their families — is its burgeoning tunnel economy that emerged long ago in response to the siege .
Thousands of Palestinians are now employed digging tunnels into Egypt — around 1,000 tunnels are reported to exist although not all are operational .
According to local economists , 90 percent of economic activity in Gaza — once considered a lower middle - income economy ( along with the West Bank ) — is presently devoted to smuggling .
Today , 96 percent of Gaza ’s population of 1.4 million is dependent on humanitarian aid for basic needs .
According to the World Food Program , the Gaza Strip requires a minimum of 400 trucks of food every day just to meet the basic nutritional needs of the population .
Yet , despite a 22 March decision by the Israeli cabinet to lift all restrictions on foodstuffs entering Gaza , only 653 trucks of food and other supplies were allowed entry during the week of 10 May , for example , at best meeting 23 percent of required need .
Israel now allows only 30 to 40 commercial items to enter Gaza compared to 4,000 approved products prior to June 2006 .
According to the Israeli journalist Amira Hass , Gazans still are denied many commodities ( a policy in effect long before the December assault ) : building materials ( including wood for windows and doors ) , electrical appliances ( such as refrigerators and washing machines ) , spare parts for cars and machines , fabrics , threads , needles , candles , matches , mattresses , sheets , blankets , cutlery , crockery , cups , glasses , musical instruments , books , tea , coffee , sausages , semolina , chocolate , sesame seeds , nuts , milk products in large packages , most baking products , light bulbs , crayons , clothing and shoes .
Given these constraints , among many others — including the internal disarray of the Palestinian leadership — one wonders how the reconstruction to which Obama referred will be possible .
There is no question that people must be helped immediately .
Programs aimed at alleviating suffering and reinstating some semblance of normalcy are ongoing , but at a scale shaped entirely by the extreme limitations on the availability of goods .
In this context of repressive occupation and heightened restriction , what does it mean to reconstruct Gaza ?
How is it possible under such conditions to empower people and build sustainable and resilient institutions able to withstand expected external shocks ?
Without an immediate end to Israel ’s blockade and the resumption of trade and the movement of people outside the prison that Gaza has long been , the current crisis will grow massively more acute .
Unless the US administration is willing to exert real pressure on Israel for implementation — and the indications thus far suggest they are not — little will change .
Not surprisingly , despite international pledges of $ 5.2 billion for Gaza ’s reconstruction , Palestinians there are now rebuilding their homes using mud .
Recently , I spoke with some friends in Gaza and the conversations were profoundly disturbing .
My friends spoke of the deeply - felt absence of any source of protection — personal , communal or institutional .
There is little in society that possesses legitimacy and there is a fading consensus on rules and an eroding understanding of what they are for .
Trauma and grief overwhelm the landscape despite expressions of resilience .
The feeling of abandonment among people appears complete , understood perhaps in their growing inability to identify with any sense of possibility .
The most striking was this comment : “ It is no longer the occupation or even the war that consumes us but the realization of our own irrelevance . ”
What possible benefit can be derived from an increasingly impoverished , unhealthy , densely crowded and furious Gaza alongside Israel ?
Gaza ’s terrible injustice not only threatens Israeli and regional security , but it undermines America ’s credibility , alienating our claim to democratic practice and the rule of law .
If Palestinians are continually denied what we want and demand for ourselves — an ordinary life , dignity , livelihood , safety and a place where they can raise their children — and are forced , yet again , to face the destruction of their families , then the inevitable outcome will be greater and more extreme violence across all factions , both old and increasingly new .
What looms is no less than the loss of entire generation of Palestinians .
And if this happens — perhaps it already has — we shall all bear the cost .

Jaedong NOT picked up by any team
Source : -
Reason :
Mainly regarding Jaedong 's strong desire to remain in Hwaseung Oz , as well as issues with Jaedong 's salary .
One team who was not mentioned in the article said that " even until right before the end of the deadline , ( they ) strongly considered bringing in Jaedong , but gave up in the end because Jaedong consistently expressed his strong desire to remain in Hwaseung . "
Another team mentioned that the main issue was Jaedong 's salary .
They said that it would be better to use the money for more areas instead of just on one player .
Jaedong now has two options : 1 ) to retire or 2 ) to give up his contract , become a semi-pro and wait for another year until the new FA season starts .
Hwaseung says they will reveal the final details on the 26th .
Update
Jaedong to get more time to negotiate with Hwaseung from the 28th to the 31st .
- Final decision seems to be in the hands of Jaedong 's parents
- Jaedong 's dad said that if negotiations fail , Jaedong will probably retire and go to the US to study
- But Jaedong given more time ( 28th to 31st ) to negotiate further with Hwaseung
- Hwaseung team shows no desire to let Jaedong retire

What about Shine , Midas and Hyun ?

It is revealed that for them ( all three whom nobody signed a contract with them ) , they have the final option of choosing to negotiate with their original teams ( KT , SKT1 and MBC respectively ) from the 28th to 31st for a re-contract , retaining their progamer status .
Or else , they will be forced to become semi-pros and wait til the next season of FA .
All three teams revealed that they will negotiate further with the players , but no specific details can be mentioned at the moment .
Netizens rage over FA

Text reads : ( from top left to btm left , top right to btm right )
E -Sports , let 's protect it with our own hands once again .
E -Sports for 10 years .
Is the association ( KeSPA ) still just a kid ?
If the players can't stand up for themselves , we will stand up for them .
JUST SAY NO - Just say what is the fact .
When a place that should exist does n't exist - we want to watch true professional sports .
A rather renowned site called ' The Eyes watching over E - Sports ' ( http://eznoon.tistory.com) community decided to protest against the FA issue .
They revealed 5 points that were going against the core principles of Free Agency .
1 ) Players do not have the freedom of choice over their career .
2 ) It was more like a slavery contract .
3 ) Imposed an unfair negotiation field / table on the players .
4 ) The players ' annual salary is confidential .
5 ) The intial stages are untimely , but there are n't any protective measures or punishments that could be dealt out appropriately .
( Might be worded better )
So they are saying there will be 3 courses of action ; 1 ) that they will seek legal methods to resolve this issue , 2 ) asking for a quick change in the FA deals and asking for a meeting with those involved with the FA deal or 3 ) they will announce all the problems with the FA and related issues to the entire country .
There are lots of legal terms and stuff here so I may have made a mistake here or there , but this is the rough gist of it .

The Daily WTF maliciously infringes Programming Praxis trademark August 13 , 2009
The Daily WTF , a web site that chronicles “ curious perversions in information technology , ” recently introduced a new feature called Programming Praxis in which simple programming exercises are assigned to readers who post their solutions and discuss the exercise in the comments .
Alex Papadimoulis runs The Daily WTF .
On June 23rd , Programming Praxis published an exercise based on one of the stories at The Daily WTF .
That was done only after consulting with The Daily WTF to ensure there was no copyright violation , and credited The Daily WTF as the source of the exercise , even providing a link back to the original The Daily WTF article .
Papadimoulis liked what he saw at Programming Praxis , and began discussing with me some kind of collaboration between the two web sites .
After some discussion , on July 22nd The Daily WTF published a programming exercise of its own , based on the Russian peasant multiplication algorithm .
That article used the phrase “ Programming Praxis ” in its title , and credited me with the idea , but did not refer to the Programming Praxis web site .
That article was a success , generating over seven hundred comments with a high signal - to - noise ratio , and Papadimoulis and I began seriously discussing a collaboration .
While we were discussing how a collaboration would work , on July 29th The Daily WTF published a second programming exercise second article that also used the phrase “ Programming Praxis ” in its title , and borrowed the exercise from one previously discussed at Programming Praxis , but did not credit me or refer to the Programming Praxis web site .
At that point discussions about collaboration broke down .
The problem was that the two sites had different goals :
The Daily WTF is primarily entertainment , and Programming Praxis is primarily educational .
The difference was highlighted by the decision to use the Josephus problem ; Papadimoulis selected that problem because he thought of a neat way to use an animated gif to show how the soldiers die .
I notified Papadimoulis that no collaboration was possible , and asked him not to use the name “ Programming Praxis ” in any future exercises he might publish .
Papadimoulis never responded to my email , but did respond on The Daily WTF by publishing on August 5th another exercise based on a common mathematical problem .
The problem used the phrase “ Programming Praxis ” in its title , and Papadimoulis wrote , in the first comment , that “ Programming Praxis ” now had its own category on The Daily WTF ; he also asked readers to submit tips for future “ Programming Praxis ” articles .
The name “ Programming Praxis ” belongs to me , not Papadimoulis .
I have been publishing under that name twice a week for six months , and own the programmingpraxis.com domain .
Papadimoulis is using the name without my permission , and against my expressed wishes .
Papadimoulis ’ improper use of the name has already caused confusion in the marketplace of ideas .
At proggit ( http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/95o33/programming_praxis_josephus_circle/), a reader named “ bhrgunatha ” says “ I think the real WTF here is they are taking these exercises from the actual programming praxis site apparently against the license . ”
After publication of the third exercise , I sent an email demanding that Papadimoulis cease and desist from using the phrase “ Programming Praxis ” to describe his weekly programming exercises .
After four days , Papadimoulis responded that it is now too late to change the name , and that we would have to be happy to share it .
I am not happy to share my name , and on Monday I sent a registered letter for next - day delivery demanding that Papadimoulis cease and desist from using the phrase “ Programming Praxis . ”
However , The Daily WTF continues to use the phrase “ Programming Praxis , ” publishing yet another exercise under that name today .
A log of emails between Papadimoulis and me , complete except for a few emails arranging the time of our telephone conversation , appears on the next page .
The emails show the history of the situation as it transpired .
I must defend my name .
Thus , I am publishing this account of what happened .
I will also explore trademark protection for my name , and such other legal action as may be required .
Thank you to all my regular readers for listening to my story .
If you wish to help , you may act to provide wide attention to this situation in the blogosphere ; feel free to post a link to this blog entry to your favorite forum , and add your comments .
Your code , your comments and your private emails inspire me to continue publishing Programming Praxis .
I apologize that I must engage you in this ugliness .

This monsoon season has brought 29 % less rainfall than normal
India will import food to make up for shortages caused by a drought thought to be affecting 700 million people , the finance minister has said .
The minister , Pranab Mukherjee , did not specify what would be imported and when , saying he wanted to avoid speculation on prices .
The drought is affecting almost half of India 's districts .
Food prices have risen by 10 % after poor monsoon rains hit sowing .
Monsoon rains are critical to India 's farmers .
' Grim situation '
Mr Mukherjee said any commodity that was in short supply would be imported to boost domestic stocks .
He said details of the imports were not being revealed , though reports said lentils , edible oils and other staples might be among the foods to be brought in .
The summer rains are crucial to crops such as rice , soybean , sugarcane and cotton .
Concern is also growing in India that international prices of many items such as sugar are increasing in anticipation of its need to import , the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder reports from the capital , Delhi .
The farm minister , Sharad Pawar , said the government would take action to ensure prices remained stable .
He added : " [ The ] situation is grim , not just for the crop sowing and the crop health but also for sustaining animal health , providing drinking water , livelihood and food , particularly for the small and marginal farmers and landless labourers . "
Up to 70 % of Indians are dependent on farm incomes , and about 60 % of India 's farms depend on rains .
Irrigation networks are dismissed by critics as inadequate .
By contrast , in the Dallas - Fort Worth area , 18 percent of economic activity was in real estate and construction at the peak of the housing bubble .
In Charlotte , N.C. , it was just 15 percent .
Those cities have suffered during the recession , but not as much as the former boomtowns .
Home prices in Charlotte are down only 11 percent from their peak , compared with 54 percent in Phoenix .
And Charlotte ’s job losses , while severe , are also spread almost evenly across several sectors .
That is unlike Phoenix and Las Vegas , where job losses in construction have far outstripped those in other industries  down by 45 percent from their peak in Phoenix , for instance .
In Arizona , the construction job losses helped drive the unemployment rate to 9.2 percent this July , up from 3.7 percent the same month two years ago .
Florida and Nevada , with unemployment at 10.7 percent and 12.5 percent respectively , are also struggling with high rates of joblessness .
While central Arizona has other economic pillars , including a substantial technology and aerospace industry , some experts say only a revival in residential construction can provide enough employment to return the region to strong growth .
“ I really think we have to start building houses again to get the economy rolling , ” said Marshall Vest , a University of Arizona economist who has written closely watched economic forecasts of the state for more than 30 years .
A strong housing recovery faces serious obstacles in all the former Sun Belt hot spots , however .
Among them is the prospect that the population growth to which they have long been accustomed is stagnating , or even beginning to reverse .
Florida ’s population shrank recently , for the first time since 1946 .
According to estimates by the University of Florida ’s Bureau of Economic and Business Research , the state lost more than 58,000 residents in the year leading up to April 2009 .

President Obama says government will make health care cheaper and better .
But there 's no free lunch .
In England , health care is " free " -- as long as you do n't mind waiting .
People wait so long for dentist appointments that some pull their own teeth .
At any one time , half a million people are waiting to get into a British hospital .
A British paper reports that one hospital tried to save money by not changing bedsheets .
Instead of washing sheets , the staff was encouraged to just turn them over .
Obama insists he is not " trying to bring about government - run healthcare " .
" But government management does the same thing , " says Sally Pipes of the Pacific Research Institute .
" To reduce costs they 'll have to ration -- deny -- care . "
" People line up for care , some of them die .
That 's what happens , " says Canadian doctor David Gratzer , author of " The Cure " .
He liked Canada 's government health care until he started treating patients .
" The more time I spent in the Canadian system , the more I came across people waiting for radiation therapy , waiting for the knee replacement so they could finally walk up to the second floor of their house . "
" You want to see your neurologist because of your stress headache ?
No problem !
Just wait six months .
You want an MRI ?
No problem !
Free as the air !
Just wait six months . "
Polls show most Canadians like their free health care , but most people are n't sick when the poll - taker calls .
Canadian doctors told us the system is cracking .
One complained that he can't get heart - attack victims into the ICU .
In America , people wait in emergency rooms , too , but it 's much worse in Canada .
If you 're sick enough to be admitted , the average wait is 23 hours .
" We can't send these patients to other hospitals .
Dr. Eric Letovsky told us .
" Every other emergency department in the country is just as packed as we are . "
More than a million and a half Canadians say they can't find a family doctor .
Some towns hold lotteries to determine who gets a doctor .
In Norwood , Ontario , " 20/20 " videotaped a town clerk pulling the names of the lucky winners out of a lottery box .
The losers must wait to see a doctor .
Shirley Healy , like many sick Canadians , came to America for surgery .
Her doctor in British Columbia told her she had only a few weeks to live because a blocked artery kept her from digesting food .
Yet Canadian officials called her surgery " elective . "
" The only thing elective about this surgery was I elected to live , " she said .
It 's true that America 's partly profit - driven , partly bureaucratic system is expensive , and sometimes wasteful , but the pursuit of profit reduces waste and costs and gives the world the improvements in medicine that ease pain and save lives .
" [ America ] is the country of medical innovation .
This is where people come when they need treatment , " Dr. Gratzer says .
" Literally we 're surrounded by medical miracles .
Death by cardiovascular disease has dropped by two - thirds in the last 50 years .
You 've got to pay a price for that type of advancement . "
Canada and England do n't pay the price because they freeload off American innovation .
If America adopted their systems , we could worry less about paying for health care , but we'd get 2009 - level care -- forever .
Government monopolies do n't innovate .
Profit seekers do .
We saw this in Canada , where we did find one area of medicine that offers easy access to cutting - edge technology -- CT scan , endoscopy , thoracoscopy , laparoscopy , etc .
It was open 24/ 7 .
Patients did n't have to wait .
But you have to bark or meow to get that kind of treatment .
Animal care is the one area of medicine that has n't been taken over by the government .
Dogs can get a CT scan in one day .
For people , the waiting list is a month .

Zeitgeist - Introduction
Author : Edward L Winston
Added : November 29th , 2007
Peter Joseph ( creator of Zeitgeist ) believes that I 'm mentally ill because I disagree with him .
You can read all about it on his forums ( linked from this forum post ) , with a blog - based rebuttal here .
You better not disagree with him , or you 'll be labeled insane next .
Perhaps I 'm crazy for pointing out his forum post ?
Zeitgeist ,
The Movie is a film that was released on Google Video in the spring of 2007 and was created by Peter Joseph .
Essentially the video covers three areas of Interest : Part I , entitled " The Greatest Story Ever Told " evaluates Christian beliefs and asserts that it was all taken from pre-existing myths , primarily Egyptian mythology .
In Part II , entitled " All The World 's a Stage " it goes on to talk about how the US Government knew about the attacks on September 11th , 2001 before hand and that it was a large conspiracy and cover up -- essentially an it was an inside job .
Lastly we are told in Part III , entitled " Do n't Mind The Men Behind The Curtain " , that powerful bankers and world leaders are conspiring for world domination and consolidation of power .

On the left side you can navigate each part ( put here because some people did not notice )
A little back story
This video has recently ( early 2008 now ) spread through the Internet like wild fire .
I cannot go to a forum on the Internet without someone mentioning how this is the " truth " and it has " opened [ their ] eyes " .
Nearly always , they also claim that they know these things are true because of their " own research " .
The interesting part of all this is , you rarely see any engineers , scientists , or anyone else making such claims .
I decided to sit down and watch the film , I honestly began watching it thinking it may have some interesting information .
When it was all over , I realized that many things were completely wrong , misquoted , or had already been disproven by many other people long ago .
The problem was that when I tried to Google more information about it , nobody had made a complete guide discussing all the inaccuracies of the film .
So , here I am .
If you do n't want to read the whole site , you can read my conclusion page for a general overview -- be sure to read the actual analysis for sourced information .
The movie rarely cites sources , and when it does , it fails to provide page numbers , dates , and other information .
Sourced information listed on their web site is primarily from books which are sometimes hard to obtain -- trust me , I tried -- making fact checking near impossible .
So , in my work , I am going to source all my claims and exactly where I find them .
If it is in a book , I will do my best to find an online version of the book , and if I cannot , I will link to where the book can be purchased .
For the most part , however , I wanted to use web sites and online information so it is easier for everyone to read -- I have received several complaints about this , somehow a book is more authoritative than a web site , I 'm not sure where that logic comes from considering the crazy books that are in circulation these days .
Question the Conspiracy Theorists
I am not naïve , and you should not be either ; the information here will be considered controversial to many of those who see Zeitgeist , the movie as the truth .
That said , do not be surprised if they refuse to believe anything written in these pages .
I personally have tried to show people before , generally they reply " you should n't believe everything you read on the Internet " ( ironic , is n't it ? ) and / or that they " just have an open mind " .
Note that these are not answers to the skeptics ' questions , these are just ways to avoid facing something that disproves what they believe .
Readers have also reported that conspiracy theorists who read my site , if they have one problem with anything on it , they automatically throw out the whole thing without reading the site in its entirety .
One of the biggest rebuttals I receive is that the film " is n't meant to be true , just to open your mind to other possibilities . "
The problem with this logic is that there are better ways to show someone alternative view points other than blatantly lying to them .
Most importantly , most people that like this movie do believe it , they do n't see it as just some metaphorical mind - opening experience .
My question to these people who refute me this way is this : if I am wrong and / or lying on my web site , then why are n't I also just trying to open peoples minds ?
Why am I the liar ?
Is it because I do n't make outrageous and impossible claims about the world and believe you to be an idiot ?
They say I have " missed the entire point of the film " , but have I really ?
If the film is lying to me about everything , then what is the point ?
It ca n't be to open my mind , that really does n't make sense , because if that is the case , all liars are really just trying to open your mind .
The film's web site makes a big deal that if you find anything incorrect , then it was n't supposed to be correct -- however , I imagine if you do believe something in it , they 'll tell you that it 's true as well .
Good luck to anyone using this information to try to talk sense into someone .
Methodology
The movie talks about things such as " the sun was worshipped by the ancients " and I do not dispute this .
Information that has been widely known for countless years I will not mention .
My goal is to only debate the new ideas they put forth that challenge older ones .
That said , a lot of people claim that " I do not believe everything in the movie , but this thing seems true to me , so you should watch it . "
Just because something of substance might be found , does not make it a good / factual movie .
For example , if I have a pie , and I fill it with dirt and put a slice of apple in it , it does not make it an apple pie -- though some would claim so .
If I can't find any information in the film to be true , I will say so , however sometimes people who criticize me say that if I " ca n't prove it is n't true , then it must be true " .
I 'm sorry , that is n't how science works .
In these pages I will state their claim intended and in a slightly different color , and below it I will have a sourced rebuttal .
I may also separate them into sections to make it easier to find things , these will be noted by larger headers .
I also want to avoid explaining things more than once , so a large section may not have every problem brought forth , but these problems are instead addressed later .
A consent decree settled a 2008 lawsuit by the Sierra Club , Florida Wildlife Federation and others against the Environmental Protection Agency seeking to get the E.P.A. to set numeric standards for runoff like fertilizers and animal waste .
The settlement is the first time the agency has forced numeric limits on nutrient runoff on a state .
Environmentalists say rain sends the runoff into rivers and lakes , nourishing algae blooms that poison ecosystems .
Under the settlement , the agency has until Jan. 14 to propose the new pollution limits for Florida ’s lakes , rivers and creeks , and until October 2010 to make the rules final .

The global internet censorship debate landed in the home of the free Sunday with news that AT&T has censored the popular 4 chan /b/ image board .
The censorship was first reported on Reddit , where users confirmed with AT&T that the site had indeed been censored , and was not being blocked due to a technical issue .
4 chan owner Moot later confirmed the news , saying that the /r9k / was also blocked and that AT&T users should “ call or write [ to ] customer support and [ AT&T ] corporate immediately . ”
The censorship at this time extended only to AT&T DSL customers , with wireless ( 3G ) customers believed to be unaffected .
Erling Løken Andersen notes that 15.5 % of all US internet users use AT&T DSL , meaning that /b/ is now blocked somewhere around 40 - 60 million people in the United States .
There is no official word from AT&T on the decision yet , and given that it ’s Sunday still in the US none is likely until business hours Monday .
4 chan users though are n’t particularly happy about the decision , with /b/ tards currently discussing ways to fight back against the imposition of censorship .
The decision by AT&T to censor /b/ may also further spark further debate around net neutrality ; love or hate 4 chan , the decision by a provider to start censoring sites is the beginning of a slippery slope to unaccountable corporate imposed draconian censorship that should have no place in allegedly free democratic societies .
There is also the question of why censor /b/ now and not previously ?
Could a third party such as Scientology have lobbied for the decision ?
Tearyan Brown became a father when he was 16 .
He did what a lot of inner-city kids desperate to make money do .
He sold drugs .
He was arrested and sent to jail three years later for dealing marijuana and PCP on the streets of Trenton , N.J. , mostly to white kids driving in from the suburbs .
It was a job which saw him robbed at gunpoint and stabbed in the chest .
But it made him about $ 1,400 a week .
Brown , when he got out after three and a half years , was done with street life .
He got a job as a security guard and then as a fork lift operator .
He eventually made about $ 30,000 a year .
He shepherded his son through high school , then college and a master ’s degree .
His boy , now 24 , is a high school teacher in Texas .
Brown would not leave the streets of Trenton but his son would .
It made him proud .
It gave him hope .
And then one morning in 2005 when he was visiting his mother ’s house the cops showed up .
He saw the cruiser and the officers standing on his mother ’s porch .
He hurried down the block toward the home to see what was wrong .
What was wrong was him .
On the basis of a police photograph , he had been identified by an 82 - year - old woman as the man who had robbed her of $ 9 at gunpoint a few hours earlier .
The only other witness to the crime insisted the elderly victim was confused .
The witness told the police Brown was innocent .
Brown ’s friends said Brown was with them when the robbery took place .
“ Why would I rob a woman for $ 9 , ” he asks me .
“ I had been paid the day before .
I had not committed a crime in 20 years .
It did n’t make any sense . ”
He was again sent to jail .
But this time he was charged with armed robbery .
If convicted , he would be locked away for many years .
His grown son and his three young boys would live , as he had , without the presence of a father .
The little ones — 11 - year - old twins and a 10 - year - old — would be adults when he got out .
When he met with his state - appointed attorney , the lawyer , like most state - appointed attorneys , pushed for accepting a plea bargain , one that would see him behind bars for at least the next decade .
Brown pulled the pictures of his children out of his wallet , laid the pictures carefully on the table in front of the lawyer , looked at the faces of his children and broke down in tears .
He shook and sobbed .
It was a hard thing to do for a man who stands nearly 6 feet tall and weights 210 pounds and has coped with a lot in his life .
“ I did n’t do nothing , ” he choked out to the lawyer .
He refused the plea bargain offer .
He sat in jail for the next two years before getting a trial .
It was a time of deep despair .
Jail had changed since he had last been incarcerated .
The facilities were overcrowded , with inmates sleeping in corridors and on the floor .
The gangs taunted those who , like Brown , were not affiliated with a gang .
Gang members knocked trays of food to the floor .
They pissed on mattresses .
They stole canteen items and commissary orders .
And there was nothing the victims could do about it .
“ See this , ” he says to me in a dimly lit coffee shop in downtown Trenton as he rolls up the right sleeve of his T - shirt .
“ It ’s the grim reaper .
I got it in jail .
I was so scared .
I was scared I would n’t get out this time .
I was scared I would not see my kids grow up .
They make their own tattoo guns in jail with a toothbrush , a staple and the motor of a Walkman .
It cost me $ 15 , well , not really dollars .
I had to give him about 10 soups and a package of cigarettes .
On the street this would be three or four hundred dollars . ”
Under the tattoo of the scythe - wielding , hooded figure are the words “ Death Awaits . ”
He had a trial after two years in jail and was found not guilty .
The sheriff ’s deputies in the courtroom said as he was walking out that they “ had never seen anything like this . ”
He reaches into his baggy jeans and pulls out his thin brown wallet .
He opens it to show me a folded piece of paper .
The paper says , “ Verdict : Defendant found not guilty on all charges . ”
It is dated Jan. 31 , 2008 .
But innocence and guilt are funny things in America .
If you are rich and guilty , if you have defrauded banks and customers and investment firms of billions of dollars , as AIG or Citibank has , if you wear fancy suits and have degrees from elite universities that cost more per year than Brown used to make , you get taxpayer money .
You get lots of it .
You maintain the lavish lifestyle of jets and spas and million - dollar bonuses .
You live a life of unchecked greed and have too much in a world where most have too little .
If you are moral scum in America we take care of you .
But if you are poor , if you are , say , Tearyan Brown and African - American and 39 years old with four kids and no job and you live in the inner city , you are in trouble .
No one comes to help you .
You do n’t get a second chance .
This is what being poor means .
Brown found that life had changed when he got out .
He had lost his job as a fork lift operator .
And there were no new jobs to be found .
He had faithfully paid child support until his arrest but , with no income , he could not pay from jail and now he was being hauled into court by the state every few weeks for being in arrears for $ 13,000 .
The mother of his three youngest boys goes to court with him .
She explains that he paid regularly while he had work .
She explains that when she works on the weekends Brown takes the kids .
She asks that he be forgiven until he can get a job and begin paying again .
But there are no jobs .
“ I would not be in arrears in child support if I had not been incarcerated for something I did n’t do , ” he says .
“ I will never get above ground owing $ 13,000 .
How can I pay $ 120 a week when I do n’t have a job ? ”
Brown lives on $ 200 a month in food stamps and $ 40 in cash .
Welfare will pay his apartment for another four months .
He is barely making it .
I ask him what he will do when he loses the rent subsidy .
“ I ’ll be homeless , ” he says .
“ My son says come down to Texas , ” he adds .
“ Start a new life with me .
But what about my three little boys ?
I ca n’t leave them .
I ca n’t leave them in Trenton .
They need a father . ”
Brown works out every day .
He does calisthenics .
He is a vegetarian .
He volunteers at a food pantry .
He attends the Jerusalem Baptist Church with his little boys .
“ They are church kids , ” he tells me proudly .
“ They are pretty much raised by the church . ”
He is trying to keep himself together .
But he lives in a world that is falling apart .
The gangs on the streets of Trenton carry Glock 9 - millimeter pistols and AK - 47 assault rifles .
When the Trenton police stop a car or raid a house filled with suspected gang members , they approach with loaded M - 16s .
A local newspaper , The Trentonian , reports the daily chronicle of crime , decay and neglect .
The lead story in the day ’s paper , which Brown has with him , is about a young man named James Deonte James , whose street name is “ Lurch . ”
James was charged in the death of a 13 - year - old girl during a gang shooting .
He is reputed to be a “ five star general in the Sex Money Murder set of the Bloods street gang . ”
In another story , an ex-con and reputed mobster , Michael “ Mickey Rome ” Dimattia , was arrested in his car after a woman behind the wheel was seen driving erratically .
“ Mickey Rome , ” dressed in a black bathrobe with a red scarf around his neck , was found to be wearing a bulletproof vest , with three guns stuck in his waistband , and had a crack pipe , crack cocaine and prescription pills in his pockets .
He had been convicted in 1990 of killing a 17 - year - old boy with a shotgun blast to the head .
He served less than three years for the murder .
A feature story on Page 4 of the paper is about a man with AIDS who raped his girlfriend ’s son 55 times and infected the boy with the virus .
The boy was 9 when the rapes took place .
“ There are thousands more guns out there than when I was on the street , ” Brown says .
“ It is easier to buy a gun than get liquor from a liquor store . ”
He says he rarely goes out at night , even to the corner store .
It is too dangerous .
The desperation is palpable .
People do n’t know where to turn .
Benefits are running out .
More and more people are out of work .
“ You see things getting worse and worse , ” he says .
“ You see people who wonder how they are going to eat and take care of themselves and their kids .
You see people starting to do anything to get food , to hustle or rob , to go back to doing things they do not want to do .
Good people start doin ’ bad things .
People are getting eviler . ”
He pauses .
“ All things are better with God , ” he says softly , looking down at the tabletop .
He is reading a book about the Bible .
It is about Jesus and God .
It is about learning to trust in God ’s help .
In America that is about all the poor have left .
And when God fails them , they are on their own .
News Corporation will begin charging readers of online versions of its newspapers in the coming year in a move that Chairman Rupert Murdoch says could spur a shift away from free news content on the Internet .
Britain 's Sunday Times newspaper will be the testing ground for News Corporation 's new policy of charging for Internet content , a report said .
Britain's Sunday Times newspaper will be the testing ground for News Corporation 's new policy of charging for Internet content , a report said Friday citing industry sources .
News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch said this week that the group , owners of the The Sunday Times , The Times and The Wall Street Journal amongst others , would end its policy of free access to online editions , with the exception of the Journal which already charges .
The Sunday Times , which currently shares a website with The Times daily , would have its own standalone site by the end of November as part of the new strategy , the report in The Guardian newspaper added .
The Sunday Times currently sells more than one million copies each week and profits have offset losses at its daily stablemate .
Murdoch 's holdings also include the New York Post , The Sun and The Australian .

A 14 - year - old girl disclosed live on air this morning that she was raped at 12 , during 2 Day FM ’s Kyle and Jackie O breakfast show .

Sandilands ’ nemeses , the “ fun police ” Media Watch , gave us a run down of 2 Day FM ’s form on lie detectors last year .
According to MediaWatch , “ contestants have had their honesty tested on subjects like STDs ; masturbation ; anal sex ; threesomes ; and eating faeces during sex . ”
After one particularly controversial episode , Jackie O said :
JACKIE O : I , I apologise to anybody out there who has been offended with this segment that we ’ve done all week , I know it ’s probably gone too far and I do apologise about that .
KYLE SANDILANDS :
What sort of a dork have you turned into overnight ?

MICHELLE : … I think she might have had sex before .

KYLE : How are you Rachel ?

MICHELLE : Have you had sex ?
Rachael , sounding uncomfortable and resentful about the line of questioning , answered :
RACHEL : I ’ve already told you about this and do n’t look at me and smile because it ’s not funny !
[ PAUSE ]
Oh , OK !
I got raped when I was 12 - years - old !
** SILENCE ** KYLE : …. right .
And is that the only experience you ’ve had ?
MICHELLE : I only found out about that a couple of months ago .
Yes , I knew about that .
RACHEL : And yet you still asked me the question .
MICHELLE : The question was , have you had sex , other than that ?
JACKIE O : Rachel , I ’m really sorry , we did n’t actually know that that was the case , and I think we might actually abort this segment , I had no idea that you ’ve been through that , so I ’m really sorry , and we ’ll just let you off the hook , I think , I think it ’s best not to continue .
Are you all right ?
It ’s okay , you just take a breather , it ’s fine .
We always have counselling services here , Rachel , if you need that .
Have you had any counselling over this issue ?
MICHELLE : No , she has n’t .
JACKIE O : Okay , well we have all of the right people in place , if you need any help or support in regards to that , which it sounds like you might .
I ’m really sorry , I had no idea that this had happened to you .
I do n’t think we would have gone ahead with that , had we known .
Okay , honey , we ’ll just let you go for a while .
I ’m sorry , I did n’t realise that was …
KYLE : Okay , mum , sorry , we needed to — that ’s something we should have probably known before we started this .
JACKIE O : Yeah , definitely .
KYLE : So let ’s do that , let ’s get you — if you guys have n’t had any counselling , or anyone to talk to about that , we ’re happy to pick up the bill for that , we ’ve got them here .
Do you want that , mum ?
MICHELLE : Yes , that ’d be good , that ’ll be good .
JACKIE O : Yes , okay .
KYLE : And that might — you know , that might — going through that , might answer some of the questions that , you know , you guys are having difficulty communicating with .
MICHELLE : Okay , yes .
KYLE : Okay , Rach , thanks for coming in , darl , sorry about that .
Okay , we ’re out , everyone .
Jenny Parkes , 2Day FM General Manager , told Crikey this morning :
Kyle and Jackie and 2Day FM were saddened by the turn of events this morning .
In the normal course of preparing the segment all due care and consideration was given to the family and clearly we did n’t know anything about this traumatic incident .
The moment we became aware of it was live on air and we brought it to an end as soon as we possibly could .
As is only appropriate , we are offering all the assistance we can to the family , including counselling , in what is of course an extraordinarily difficult situation .
Crikey also put in a call to ACMA but they did n’t get back to us before deadline .
An unknown number of detainees are being held at Bagram , Afghanistan
The US military has begun notifying the Red Cross of the identities of terror suspects being held at secret camps in Iraq and Afghanistan , reports say .
The Red Cross , which has lobbied the Pentagon for years to give its staff access to all detention facilities , declined to confirm the changes .
The policy reportedly took effect this month with no public announcement .
Correspondents say that the move represents a victory for human rights groups seeking more US transparency .
The new approach is said to be part of a broad review of US detention and interrogation practice launched by the Obama administration .
Further scrutiny Dozens of suspected foreign fighters captured in Iraq and Afghanistan are being held at so - called " temporary screening camps " run by US special forces at secret locations in Balad in Iraq and Bagram in Afghanistan .
Despite the change in policy , Red Cross officials are still not getting access to the highly secretive sites - something they do get at most other US military detention centres .
The Pentagon has previously said that providing information about these detainees could jeopardize counter - terrorism efforts .
It has refused to comment on the latest reports .
A spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Geneva told the BBC she could not comment on the reported changes , saying discussions about detention issues are always confidential .
This week , the detention policies of the former Bush administration are likely to come under further scrutiny with the publication of a CIA report dating from 2004 into its interrogation practices at that time .
It describes the physical and psychological abuse of detainees inside US - run facilities , including mock execution and , in one case , threatening a prisoner with a gun and a power drill .

Papua 's police chief has denied bullets were removed from the body of murdered Australian Drew Grant before an autopsy was performed in Jakarta .
Mr Grant , 29 , was shot in Papua on a road to the Freeport Mine on Saturday .
Yesterday Dr Abdul Mun'im
Idries said it was possible bullets were removed before an autopsy 16 hours after the Australian engineer was murdered .
Papua 's police chief , Bagus Ekodanto , has rejected this suggestion .
" No such thing .
All was done according to procedure .
Nothing was changed , so this statement should clear those rumours , " he said .
National police spokesman Nanan Soekarna says only Mr Grant 's outer body was examined in Papua .
Yesterday Dr Mun'im told the ABC Mr Grant was killed by four bullets and not five , and all were fired from a distance and from above , except for one which possibly ricocheted from below .
The forensic specialist said he found no intact bullets or exit wounds , only fragmentation .
He could not say with certainty whether the bullets came from military - grade weapons , but he said all of the fragments were from bullets with metal casings , which would be consistent with bullets of a military grade , but also other bullets .
Dr Mun'im said there could have been more than one shooter , as Mr Grant had been shot from two different directions .
Andreas Harsono of Human Rights
Watch , who spent two - and - a - half years investigating the ambush killings of two American teachers on the Freeport road in 2002 , says without intact bullets it would be impossible to tell precisely which weapon was used .
Meanwhile , a local rebel leader in Papua says his forces were not responsible for shooting Mr Grant .
The death toll from the bloody weekend in the region is now three , after Indonesian police said a policeman who fled an ambush had been found dead .
The local commander of the Free Papua Movement , Kelly Kwalik , has denied any role in the attack which killed Mr Grant .
Insert the spoon into the holder and voila , you are finished .
Load up the catapult and fire away .
It may take several tries to get your desired settings .
Your shots will depend on three things .
1 ) the size and weight of your ammo 2 ) the tension in the rubber band and 3 ) the length of the catapult 's arm .
I got some pretty good distance after playing with it for a while , and it is good fun .
I also made some small targets that fit inside the lid for when I can't find anyone to shoot mints at .
Have fun , and please make or suggest improvements and post your pics .
Be careful not to hurt anyone or give them fresh breath .
Todd and Sarah Palin to divorce
Affairs on both sides
See also - Palin lawyer threatens to serve papers to blogger at kindergarten , then chickens out
AlaskaReport has learned that Todd Palin and former Alaska governor Sarah Palin are to divorce .
Multiple sources in Wasilla and Anchorage ( including a former Palin staffer ) have confirmed the split .
The sources preferred to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions from the Palins and their co-workers .
A National Enquirer story exposing previous affairs on both sides led to a deterioration of their marriage and the stress from that led to Palin 's resignation as governor of Alaska last week .
The Palins were noticeably not speaking to each other for most of last Sunday 's resignation speech in Fairbanks .
Sarah ditched Todd ( MSNBC ) right after the speech and left without him .
Sarah removed her wedding ring a couple of weeks ago .
According to the ImmoralMinority blog Sarah has recently purchased land in Montana and is considering moving the family there .
Sarah Palin is originally from Idaho .
Todd Palin told Fox News last week that he was heading back to his job in the oil fields of Alaska , yet Sarah recently signed a book deal reportedly worth $ 11 million .
Editor 's note : AlaskaReport was the first website to report that Sarah Palin was running for governor of Alaska and the first website to report that Sarah was picked as John McCain 's VP candidate .

Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin says politicians need to have thick skin " just as I 've got "
Which of course is hilarious since she quit as Alaska 's governor complaining about her hurt feelings from Alaska 's bloggers reporting on her 21 ethics violations .

Fact – we all have two choices in life ; to live to a ripe old age , or to die .
Wait , that 's not true .
In this country we do NOT have a legal choice to die .
In fact , doctors and hospitals will do whatever they can to keep human bodies “ alive ” for years , even if they have to be plugged into machines with tubes plugged into every orifice to do so .
There is a huge difference between quality of life and quantity of life , but since we have the medical knowledge and capacity to use machines to simulate body organs , keeping a person animated long after they would without these intrusive machines has become the norm .
With Sarah Palin terrorizing the elderly with claims of “ death panels ” and town hall meeting turning into panic events , the new debate regarding Obama 's heath care bill has turned into his plan to “ kill grandma ” , when the cost to keep grandma alive becomes too high .
Well , maybe that 's not such a bad idea .
Just because we can do something , that does not necessarily mean that we must .
Pulling the plug , so to speak , is never an easy decision for family members to make .
Coma patients have been hooked up to machines for decades because the family holds on to some unrealistic fantasy that their loved one will miraculously wake up one day and be the same person they were before .
“ Miracle ” recovery television shows do n't help the delusion , but try telling a grieving mother or daughter that the show they watched on Lifetime was a script and the patient who miraculously recovered was an actor who was never sick in the first place , and they 'll cry over their rosary and insist that God will someone answer their prayers .
Meanwhile , the only ones who prayers are being answered are the hospitals , the nursing homes and the doctors who make millions off the false hopes of these desperate families .
Life is precious , but it is not eternal .
We are mortal .
We get sick , and we die .
Sometimes the brain ages faster than the other organs and once it outlives its time , dementia overtakes the body .
So , who decides when to say the final good - bye ?
And at what cost ?
No one wants to put a price tag on a life , but it is a fact that the longer one lives , the more medical services they are going to need and the more expensive it is going to be .
The longer we use medical technology to keep bodies alive , the more the bills are going to pile up , so the medical community wants to keep those bodies alive until the very last drop of cash is drained from the family 's bank account .
Let 's keep the sick and elderly locked away in nursing homes , slumped over a wheelchair , drooling and urinating uncontrollably , and keep pumping them full of expensive drugs , especially if their insurance or the government pays the bill .
So , why not have a cut - off point ?
Let 's pick an age to cut off insurance payments , maybe 84 , 94 , 101 ?
Is it really more merciful to keep these nearly dead bodies alive then it is to let them die
We can't keep sick people on the public toll forever , can we ?
The insurance companies do n't seem to think so when they decide which claim they 'll pay for and which one they 'll deny , or which prescription drug will be covered and which one wo n't .
I do n't know of any insurance company that pays for Viagra .
Doctors swear an oath to do no harm , maybe it 's time we force the insurance companies to do the same .
Or maybe we should just kill grandma .

Opening the road could boost trade with China ( Pictures : Subhamoy Bhattacharjee ) India has abandoned plans to reopen a World War Two road that could connect its remote north - eastern states to China 's Yunnan province through Burma .
Lawmakers from India 's Assam state have been informed of the Indian decision by its ministry for the development of the north - eastern region .
This comes days after the 13th round of talks between India and China to resolve their border dispute .
The talks failed to break the impasse and both sides agreed to keep talking .
The 1,079 - mile - long Stillwell Road was built by American general Joe " Vinegar " Stillwell to supply Kuomintang forces in the war against Japan .
The road begins from Ledo in Assam and ends in China 's Yunnan after traversing through Burma 's Kachin state province .
Assam 's Power Minister Pradyut Bordoloi , who represents a constituency around Ledo in the Assam state assembly , has been a strong advocate of reopening the road .
' Good for trade ' " This road could easily handle a substantial part of India 's growing bilateral trade with China because of cost and time benefits , " Mr Bordoloi , who is from India 's ruling Congress party , said .
" Both sides would save much in transport costs in exporting and importing goods meant for India 's eastern and north - eastern region and China 's remote southwest . "
The road , built at the cost of $ 137 m in 1944 , handled up to 65,000 tonnes of cargo during World War Two .
The road has fallen into disrepair because of a lack of use Many war historians say this road kept Kuomintang in the war .
" This road will be capable of handling between 15 % and 20 % of the Sino - Indian bilateral trade , " says Nazeeb Arif , a former secretary - general of the Indian Chamber of Commerce who hails from Assam .
Mr Arif says he has done an extensive survey on the potential of the Stillwell Road .
" If this road was opened , it would have encouraged Indian industry to invest in production hubs in our under - developed north - eastern states to make goods meant for export to China .
Our economies would have thrived , " Mr Arif said .
Nagaland 's Chief Minister Neiphue Rio echoed a similar sentiment .
" That is what Delhi does not very often understand .
Border trade can be very good for states like ours , " he said .
India reopened the 15,000 - foot - high Nathu La pass in the Himalayan state of Sikkim for border trade with China in July 2006 .
But trade has been poor because the pass is under snow for a few months during the winter and cannot take heavy container traffic .
Stillwell Road does not suffer freezing because its passes are much lower than Nathu La. Burma , however , has not been very keen on reopening the road because it passes through the Kachin state , which its army has barely controlled since Independence .
Large parts of the Kachin state were controlled by the separatist Kachin Independence Army ( KIA ) since the 1960s .
Though the KIA has been maintaining a ceasefire with the Burmese army since 1994 , it continues to control border trade in gems , timber and other precious stones like jade .

Beck Just Referred to " Birthers " as Idiots
Posted on by Man50D
I was watching the opening of Glenn Beck 's TV show a short time ago .
He was talking about the DNC ad claiming the Republican party sending mobs to town hall meetings to oppose BO 's socialist health care plan .
One clip from the ad showed a woman at a town hall meeting in Delaware showing her birth certificate and asking why BO can't do the same to prove he is a natural born citizen .
Beck then made the observation they had to use a clip of a " birther Idiot " .
The term birther could n't be more misleading since it refers to people who simply demand BO abide by Article II Section I of the Constitution but somehow this fundamental point is lost on Beck .
I immediately turned off the TV .
I wo n't watch him again .

Nothing idiotic about it .
God bless that woman for having the courage to simply ask .
This is a simple thing to put to rest .
I have a passport and a birth certificate .
I can produce them at my house in a matter of minutes .
I have not spent a million dollars to either acquire them ... or to hide them .
This is not a unreasonable thing to ask for since being a " natural born citizen " of the US is a constitutional requirement for the job of President .
It 's not hateful , and it 's not racist .
Proving that you are should be an honor .
Yet Obama cannot and will not produce either .
Why ?
The following document is a Certified Copy of Registration of Birth , puporting to be from Kenya .
It has gotten a lot of press .
It has a number of issues which means , IMHO , that in all probability that it is not authentic .
Yet , it looks more authentic than the electronic Certificate of Live Birth ( COLB , not the long form Birth Certificate which has never been offered ) that the Obama administration has shown on their web site .
The point is , this supposed document is out there and is being analyzed to death and will ultimately be certified one way or the other by experts .
Obama 's long form birth certificate is not ... it is getting no such review .
The longer it is absent , the more insistent the demands will be for it to be made public .
A number of military Officers are now suing for Obama to prove and show his " bonafides " before deploying , because for them , it becomes a life or death issue to follow their Commander in Chief .
The same applies in principle to all citizens .
In the end , Obama will not be able to forever hide from proving the constitutional qualification .

If these so called " birthers " are proven right , it 'll be interesting to see what Beck will say .
In my opinion , with regards to the " birther " thing .
It would be best to be observant , but also open to anything that may come up .
And most of all , do n't jump to conclusions and claim them as fact unless fact comes about .
Who knows what tomorrow will bring .
Stay safe .

It would appear that Mr. Beck has overstayed his gig at Fox .
He keeps beating a dead horse .
The Donks are running the show and the Republicans are milling around like a herd of lost horses .
Sort of sickening ai n't it .

He is a self admitted libertarian .
He 's not even as much of a libertarian as Bob Barr , who is also not a libertarian .
Neil Boortz is not a libertarian , and neither is Bill Mayer .
The media is full of Republicans and Democrats who see some opportunity to claim that they are n't to give themselves more credibility and to refute the party shill tag .
It does n't hold water .
Beck , Boortz , and Barr are Republicans no matter what they claim , and Maher is a dem .

You compound your tantrum with the false assumptions I consider him a conservative Idol , accept what the OP says on face value and fail to understand conservatism is being assaulted .
Do n't pretend for a second you know me .
I would n't have been at this website for more than four years if anyone of your ludicrous claims had one iota of truth .
You 're pulling a Glenn Beck by speaking on an issue without any facts .

Today is officially the first day of Summer here in the United States , and in some areas of the country , it ’s really starting to heat up .
This time of year always reminds us of great music .
In fact , Summer itself has really garnered itself quite a soundtrack over the years .
Certain songs that play on the radio , or that you hear in movies , or are even in your own personal collections , really have that significant ring to them that brings you back to long days of freedom , and long nights of fun and exploration .
Yeah , ‘ exploration ’… know what we mean ?
* wink - wink - nudge- nudge *?
Anyway , close your eyes , relax , and listen to the wonderful sounds of Summer .
Sickos !
15 . Summer Song – Joe Satriani
Why this amazing example of a guitar God ’s ode to a season is n’t featured more heavily in films focused on Summer , we ’ll never know .
What we do know :
We know what we like , and this is Summer in six strings .
14 . Summer – WAR
A different flavor from a band more well - known for such hits as ‘ Low Rider ’ and ‘ The Cisco Kid ’ , Summer came as a reprise from an exhaustive touring schedule and really set War on to a longer trail of fame .
13 . Cruel Summer – Bananarama
Bananarama ’s Cruel Summer was a Top Ten hit back in 1984 and received heavy radio play throughout the decade thanks to its inclusion on The Karate Kid soundtrack .
The song is a look at the darker side of summer , focusing on the oppressive heat and misery of being alone .
12 . Summer Nights - Travolta & NewtonJohn
If you have n’t heard this one , ask your wife or girlfriend , we guarantee it ’s among her favorites .
Olivia Newton John and John Travolta sing about each other in the movie Grease .
Cheesy , but too important not to include .
11 . Sunny Afternoon – The Kinks
An absolute classic , who does n’t have fond memories of lazing on a sunny afternoon ?
This tune is n’t as bright and cheery as other summer songs , but they ca n’t all be cheerful songs .
10 . Hot Fun in the Summertime – Sly …
Sly and the Family Stone released this tune in 1969 and it peaked at Number 2 on the Billboard charts .
The song is a dedication to the fun and games to be had during the summer .
9. Summer Breeze – Seals & Croft
This # 1
Hit from 1972 is a staple of soft rock stations during the summer , and there is just something about the tune that has stood the test of time .
It ’s light and easy , just like a summer breeze .
8. Sublime – Doin’ Time ( Summertime )
Who knew that a song , borrowing heavily from the Gershwin classic ‘ Porgy and Bess ’ , would go on to become one of Sublime ’s finest recordings .
And boy oh boy does it scream Summer .
7. Under the Boardwalk – The Drifters
For those of you who have been to an honest - to - goodness boardwalk on the coast of an ocean can recall almost instantly the smells ( taffy , kettle corn ) , the sounds ( calliopes , barkers ) , and the sights ( endless vendors and treats ) this song brings to mind .
6. Summer of ’ 69 – Bryan Adams
A song about the hits , bunts , and strike - outs of life during early adulthood that , regardless of whether or not you were even around in 1969 , steals home for every one of us .
Now that ’s some nice baseball puns , son !
5. Margaritaville – Jimmy Buffett
There are several Buffett songs that could make this list , but this one will have to represent the Parrot Head Nation .
Regardless of how you feel about the song , it ’s nearly impossible not to admit that it stirs up lots of great feelings of Summer .
You know darn well you , too , got drunk to a Buffett song a time or two .
4. Summertime – Jazzy Jeff & Fresh Prince
This is another of those ‘ either you like it or you do n’t ’ jams that this uber - popular duo released at the tail end of their illustrious career .
What we remember is listening to the hell out of it our senior year and following Summer from High School .
Still good stuff .
3. Summer in the City – Lovin’ Spoonful
The general consensus is that this is , indeed , an indelible part of Summer ’s musical bounty and we are more than inclined to agree wholeheartedly .
Just the vocals alone make you smile and long for those warm nights .
2. In The Summertime – Mungo Jerry
With lyrics like this : “ If her daddy ’s rich , take her out for a meal ;
If her daddy ’s poor , just do as you feel ” it ’s hard not to dig this song regardless of the season .
But with it ’s banjo and jug , for some reason - despite the title - it just perspires with hot Summer soul .
1. The Beach Boys – Surfin ’ USA
Absolutely , without a shadow of a doubt , the quintessential Summer band , hands down .
We ’re huge Beach Boys fan and we believe ‘ The Warmth of the Sun ” , more than any other song , spells out Summer and its long , sweltering nights .
However , since the Beach Boys have such a massive catalog of hits , we figured we might as well go with something a bit more recognizable to people to represent them on the list .
Here ’s ‘ Surfin ’ USA ’.
Here ’s the dirty secret behind Washington ’s health - care “ fight ” : Democrats won everything in last year ’s election .
You would n’t know it from the way President Barack Obama is blaming the GOP for his flagging health agenda .
“ There are those [ read the GOP ] who are advocating delay just as a desperation move to try to kill it , ” complained White House budget director Peter Orszag .
Republicans are working to “ block health - care reform , ” groused the president .
“ Republicans should immediately put an end ...
Lord Turner said the FSA would push banks to defer more bonuses and to pay more in shares , not cash .
There will remain four or five global financial centres , and it is almost certain that one will be London , " he said .
In order to get at you individually , I must talk in the first person .
I have to get you to drop modesty and say to yourself , ``Yes , I would like to do first - class work . ''
Our society frowns on people who set out to do really good work .
You 're not supposed to ; luck is supposed to descend on you and you do great things by chance .
Well , that 's a kind of dumb thing to say .
I say , why should n't you set out to do something significant .
You do n't have to tell other people , but should n't you say to yourself , ``Yes , I would like to do something significant . ''
But I 'm forty - two going on forty - three ...
Richard Hamming on solving important problems
This , in my experience , is the whole story .
Everything else falls out of this personal commitment .
It 's a commitment to try .
To strive .
To sweat .
To make the effort .
To care .
Without this commitment , you have made a de facto decision to be on the receiving end of life .
To float down the river like a leaf , now hither , now thither , carried by currents and wind .
Drop the modesty .
There 's nothing wrong with wanting to do something great , even insanely great .
Age is another factor which the physicists particularly worry about .
They always are saying that you have got to do it when you are young or you will never do it .
Einstein did things very early , and all the quantum mechanic fellows were disgustingly young when they did their best work .
Most mathematicians , theoretical physicists , and astrophysicists do what we consider their best work when they are young .
It is not that they do n't do good work in their old age but what we value most is often what they did early .
On the other hand , in music , politics and literature , often what we consider their best work was done late .
I do n't know how whatever field you are in fits this scale , but age has some effect .
But let me say why age seems to have the effect it does .
In the first place if you do some good work you will find yourself on all kinds of committees and unable to do any more work ...
When you are famous it is hard to work on small problems .
This is what did Shannon in .
After information theory , what do you do for an encore ?
The great scientists often make this error .
They fail to continue to plant the little acorns from which the mighty oak trees grow .
They try to get the big thing right off .
And that is n't the way things go .
So that is another reason why you find that when you get early recognition it seems to sterilize you .
Todd Proebsting
Over on the other side of the dining hall was a chemistry table .
I had worked with one of the fellows , Dave McCall ; furthermore he was courting our secretary at the time .
I went over and said , ``Do you mind if I join you ? ''
They can't say no , so I started eating with them for a while .
And I started asking , `` What are the important problems of your field ? ''
And after a week or so , `` What important problems are you working on ? ''
And after some more time I came in one day and said , `` If what you are doing is not important , and if you do n't think it is going to lead to something important , why are you at Bell Labs working on it ? ''
I was n't welcomed after that ; I had to find somebody else to eat with !
That was in the spring .
What is the most important problem in your area of interest ?
What are you working on ?
Why are n't they the same ?
In my own experience , having some modest success early opens doors .
But do they lead in the right direction ?
Sometimes not .
I am constantly getting offers to manage teams of programmers working on uninteresting applications .
I have taken such jobs , and I can say with certainty that while I have been successful most of the time and unsuccessful some of the time , uninteresting projects have never magically transformed themselves into important work .
It 's hard to plant acorns when you 've grown an oak .
But it 's necessary , very necessary .
You can't get buried in management meetings and UML diagrams and presentations to resellers ( you especially can't even get buried in writing about software development ) .
A few years ago I went to a conference at MIT called " Lightweight Languages 2 . "
All sorts of very bright people were there .
Joe Armstrong gave a talk on Erlang .
Matz gave a talk on Ruby .
And a charismatic speaker from Microsoft named Todd Proebsting gave a talk about Disruptive Language Technologies .
In his talk , he gave a story about Richard Hamming .
And here 's the same story , in Richard 's own words :

How to get started using the SciPy library for scientific computing in Python .
Introduction
SciPy is an enormous Python library for scientific computing .
This article will explain how to get started with SciPy , survey what the library has to offer , and give some examples of how to use it for common tasks .
First steps with SciPy
The SciPy download page has links to the SourceForge download sites for SciPy and NumPy .
( SciPy depends on NumPy and so both packages must be installed in order to use SciPy . )
The version of SciPy ( and NumPy ) must be compatible with your version of Python .
At the time of this writing , SciPy is available for Python 2.6 and earlier .
In particular , Python 3.0 is not yet supported .
IronPython cannot use SciPy directly because much of SciPy is implemented in C and at this time IronPython can only directly import modules implemented in Python .
However , the Ironclad package enables IronPython to use SciPy .
See Numerical computing in IronPython with Ironclad for details .
To start using SciPy , import the scipy package .
By convention , the scipy package is often imported with the sp abbreviation for ease of use .
>>> import scipy as sp
There is some functionality at the root of the scipy hierarchy , but most functionality is located in sub-packages that must be imported separately .
For example , the erf function is located in the special sub - package for special functions .
To call the erf function , you need to first import the special sub -package .
>>> from scipy import special >>> special.erf ( 2.0 ) 0.99532226501895271
Getting help
The SciPy documentation page has links to extensive documentation available in HTML , PDF , and CHM ( HTML help ) formats .
As with any Python package , you can also find help for SciPy objects using Python 's help ( ) function from the command line .
However , sometimes help is unhelpful when it comes to SciPy .
The function scipy.info( ) is analogous to the standard help ( ) function but specialized to give better documentation for SciPy objects .
When scipy .info( ) is given a string argument , it does a search for matching objects .
When scipy .info( ) is given an object , it returns documentation specific to that object .
For example , if scipy was imported as sp , then :
>>> sp.info( " gamma " )
returns documentation on both the gamma probability distribution and the gamma function .
But ,
>>> sp.info(special.gamma )
only returns documentation for the gamma function .
Library overview
The following table lists the sub - packages of scipy along with a brief description of each .
The next section will give examples using some of the more common sub-packages .
Sub - package Description cluster Clustering algorithms constants Mathematical and physical constants fftpack Fourier transforms integrate Numerical integration interpolate Interpolation io Input and output linalg Linear algebra maxentropy Maximum entropy models misc Miscellaneous ndimage Multi- dimensional image processing odr Orthogonal distance regression optimize Optimization signal Signal processing sparse Sparse matrices spatial Spatial algorithms and data structures special Special functions stats Statistical functions stsci Image processing weave C/C++ integration
Examples
SciPy is huge .
The draft SciPy Reference Guide is currently 632 pages .
This article will only illustrate a tiny sampling of what you can do with SciPy , focusing on some of the more common applications .
Special functions
The special sub - package contains mathematical functions beyond those included in the standard Python math package .
The most commonly used special function is probably the gamma function , Γ( x ) .
The following example shows how to access it from SciPy .
>>> from scipy .special import gamma >>> gamma( 0.5 ) 1.7724538509055159
SciPy contains a dozen functions related to the gamma function .
For example , there is a separate function gammaln just to return the logarithm of the gamma function .
This may seem redundant , but it is very practical .
Since the gamma function grows very quickly , it can easily overflow , and so the logarithm of the gamma function is often more useful than the gamma function itself .
Some of the other gamma- related functions in SciPy include the incomplete gamma function gammainc , the beta function beta , and the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function psi .
Gamma functions are far from the only special functions included in SciPy .
All the most commonly used special functions are included : Bessel functions , Fresnel integrals , etc .
Some of the functions in special would not be classified as “ special ” in a mathematical sense .
These are elementary functions that are included because they present numerical difficulties .
For example , scipy .
special contains a function log1p that evaluates log ( 1 + x ) .
This function may seem useless at first : why not just use math.log ( 1 + x ) instead of log1 p ?
The problem is that in applications , you often need to evaluate log ( 1 + x ) for small values of x .
If x is sufficiently small ( e.g. , less than 10 - 16 ) , then math. log ( 1 + x ) will return 0 because 1 + x will equal x to machine precision and math.
log ( 1 + x ) will simply return log ( 1 ) which equals 0 . The function log1p evaluates log ( 1 + x ) indirectly without first computing 1 + x .
Constants
The constants sub - package contains a wide variety of physical constants .
The following code will display a few common constants :
>>> from scipy import constants >>> constants .c # speed of light 299792458.0 >>> constants.h # Plank ’s constant 6.6260693000000002e-034 >>> constants .
N_A # Avogadro ’s number 6.0221415000000003e+023
The dictionary physical_constants has descriptive strings as keys .
The values are triples containing a constant 's value , its units of measurement , and the uncertainty in the value .
For example , the dictionary gives this information on the mass of an electron .
>>> constants.physical_constants [" electron mass " ] ( 9.1093825999999998e-031 , ‘kg ’ , 1.5999999999999999e-037 )
In addition to physical constants , constants contains information on units .
For example , constants.nautical_mile equals 1852 , the number of meters in a nautical mile .
And , in case you ever wondered , constants .
troy_ounce equals 0.0311034768 , the number of kilograms in a troy ounce .
There is also support for SI and binary unit prefixes .
For example , the SI prefix constants .
kilo equals 103 = 1000.0 , and the binary prefix constants .
kibi = 210 = 1024 .
Integration
The integrate sub - package contains several routines for numerical integration .
The most commonly used routine is quad ( named for “ quadrature ” , an old - fashioned name for integration ) .
The first argument to quad is a function of one variable to integrate .
For simple functions , it is convenient to use lambda to define the function inline , though of course integrands can be defined elsewhere using def .
The quad function returns a pair : the value of the integral and an estimate of the error in the value .
The following code integrates cos( ex ) between the limits of 2 and 3 .
>>> from scipy import integrate >>> integrate.quad( lambda x : math.cos(math.exp( x ) ) , 2 , 3 ) ( - 0.063708480528704675 , 2.4175070627010321e-014 )
To specify infinite limits of integration in quad , use the constant scipy.inf for ∞ , as in the following example :
>>> from scipy import inf integrate.quad ( lambda x : math.exp ( - x*x ) , - inf , inf ) ( 1.7724538509055159 , 1.4202636780944923e-008 )
The integrate sub - package contains other integration routines , such as dblquad for double integrals and tplquad for triple integrals .
It also contains odeint for numerically evaluating systems of ordinary differential equations .
Probability and statistics
The stats sub - package contains a wealth of functions for probability and statistics .
The library currently features 81 continuous distributions and 12 discrete distributions .
The following example shows how to compute the probability that a normal ( Gaussian ) random variable with mean 0 and standard deviation 3 takes on a value less than 5 .
It also shows how to generate five random samples from the same distribution .
>>> from scipy.stats import norm >>> norm.cdf ( 5 , 0 , 3 ) 0.9522096477271853 >>> norm.rvs(0 , 3 , size=5 ) array ( [ 4.85229537 , 3.0104119 , 1.13189841 , 5.19688369 , -2.97970912 ] )
See Probability distributions in SciPy for more examples of working with probability distributions .
The stats sub - package has simple functions such as std for computing the sample standard deviation of an array of numbers .
It has more sophisticated functions such as glm for working with linear regression , analysis of variance , etc .
It also contains functions for numerous statistical tests and common chores such as producing histograms .
Note that some statistical functionality is located outside the stats sub-package .
For example , orthogonal distance regression support is contained in its own sub - package odr .
Also , you might use the linalg sub - package in conjunction with stats .
Further resources
The SciPy.org website has links to further documentation , including tutorials and cookbook examples .
The Mathesaurus is a sort of Rosetta stone for comparing mathematical environments such as SciPy , Matlab , R , etc .
The resources on that site are useful even if you do not know one of the other packages and just want a cheat sheet for doing various tasks in Python ( especially SciPy ) .
The IPython shell is a popular environment for working interactively with SciPy .
Also , many SciPy users use matplotlib to create plots from either the standard Python command line for from IPython .
AFP Interviews Man Who Exposed Madoff To SEC Back in 2000
By Pat Shannan
When Bernard Madoff was finally arrested and exposed to the world as a charlatan , the one person who was not shocked by it was Harry Markopolos , the amateur fraud investigator who had been screaming to the SEC for nearly a decade .
Had SEC officials listened to him from the beginning , Madoff ’s stolen take would not have reached half of the estimated $ 65 billion that it finally did .
As a portfolio manager for a large equity derivatives asset management firm in Boston , Markopolos had sharpened his insight in this venue far beyond that of any ordinary detective .
When his firm ’s partners returned with literature from a New York conference where they had learned of Madoff ’s remarkable success , they asked him to reverse - engineer this high performing strategy in order that the Boston firm might offer this successful product to their own customers .
Speaking to a crowd of more than 2,000 at the American Certified Fraud Examiner ’s conference in Las Vegas in July , Harrry Markopolos explained how it took him but a few minutes to determine that “ Madoff did n’t know the first thing about portfolio construction mathematics ” and that he could not have been using this described strategy to earn the returns he was advertising .
When he reported what he suspected to his superiors in early 2000 , they deep - sixed the whole plan , but Harry did not .
There were too many red flags .
His sleuthing had just begun , and his eventual team was made up of “ four ordinary men ” who were not paid for their after - hours endeavor but whose persistence finally paid off with the public exposure of a ponzi scheme magnified far beyond the imagination of even Charles Ponzi himself .
The Social Security system , legalized by government sanction , is the only ponzi scheme known to have expanded larger than that of Madoff .
In 1920 , in Boston also , Italian immigrant Charles Ponzi advertised that he could double an investor ’s money in only 90 days and immediately had throngs flocking to his office door .
Word got out that had delivered exactly what he promised , and exactly 90 days later , the dozens of investors turned into hundreds .
Soon it was thousands .
Ponzi , of course , was paying off the old investors with the funds from the new ones .
He was eventually caught , prosecuted and jailed ; and his name still lives in notoriety .
Markopolos knew at first glance that Madoff was not doing what he claimed and began to see Madoff as a brilliant con artist who , much like Ponzi , knew how to prey on the depravity of man and his greed .
He says , “ Under existing securities law , if you tell clients that you are using Strategy A to invest their money but , in fact , you use an undisclosed Strategy B , you ’ve committed fraud . ”
From that point on for Madoff , it was only a matter of watching the stock boards closely and publishing his imaginary investments after they had increased in value .
He created an illusion of an investment strategy that was not ostentatious enough to attract suspicion but sufficient to reflect a small but steady profit return every month .
And while his naïve investors remained satisfied , the discerning eyes of Markopolos were opening wider .
In May of 2000 , he submitted an 8 - page report to the Boston Regional Office of the Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) listing red flags and mathematical proof of a major fraud but got no reply .
He re-submitted his evidence to the Boston and other SEC offices in 2001 , 2005 , 2007 and 2008 , to no avail .
By this time , Markopolos was realizing that Madoff had been operating with protection from the inside .
In late 2008 , when the stock market crumbled and investors rushed in to redeem their investments , Madoff ran out of cash , turned himself in to authorities , and pleaded guilty in federal court last March 12th .
Markopolos said that all the members of his team feared for their lives during the long investigation and he for more reason than any of the others because of his visibility .
He was the one who was submitting all the complaints each year , and he knew that any leak from the SEC could make him a marked man .
He explained that the “ offshore feeder funds ” were only one step removed from organized crime .
“ If organized crime knew that Madoff was stealing their money , he would have been killed .
Therefore , if Madoff had ever found out that we had a team tracking him through Europe and North America and that he risked getting exposed , it was a good bet that he would have had several billion reasons to want us silenced first .
To compartmentalize the damage , I was the only one who went to the SEC . ”
No one there knew Markopolos had an assisting team in the field .
But Markopolos has proof that the SEC was culpable , too , and says publicly that he has tremendous anger at the agency and sadness for the victims .
He says that there were SEC lawyers who were “ in bed with Madoff ” and helped destroy lives .
“ Madoff paid people to look the other way , ” says Markopolos and reminds us that there is a federal report scheduled to come out by the end of the year .
He emphasizes that unless there is a cover - up , “ the SEC will cease to exist . ”
Harry sounds like he must have read the 9 - 11 Commission ’s Final Report and other government balderdash .
Both he and we are watching and anxiously waiting for the report , but we do not expect it to be seriously detrimental to the SEC .
The likely conclusion will include finger - pointing and the firing of a very few scapegoats .
It ’s the bureaucratic way .
If the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks can completely ignore the collapse of a 47 - story building at the World Trade Center , we cannot foresee the government dismantling one of the giants in its controlling bureaucracy just because a lot of lawyers lied , cheated and broke the law .
Nothing new here .

Sexy ESPN sportscaster Erin Andrews was the target of a peephole pervert who surreptitiously shot a video of her walking around her hotel room naked — and posted it on the Internet .

Cora Takes Out Frustration on Andrews
The sideline siren wants the creepy cameraman brought to justice , both for herself and to keep other victims from having to go through the same nightmare .
Andrews ’ lawyer , Marshall B. Grossman , confirmed yesterday she was “ surreptitiously videotaped ” while “ in the privacy of her hotel room . ”
“ Although the perpetrators of this criminal act have not yet been identified , when they are identified , she intends to bring both civil and criminal charges against them and against anyone who has published the material , ” Grossman said .
In the video , Andrews is seen primping her hair and putting on her makeup .
The video and screen grabs first surfaced on the Internet under the title “ Hot naked blonde who looks a lot like a sports blogger favorite in her hotel room , ” according to the sports - and - gossip Web site Deadspin .
The site on which the images first appeared did n’t identify the woman as Andrews , whom Playboy calls “ America ’s Sexiest Sportscaster . ”
But ESPN believes she was the victim of the crime .
It quickly got the video yanked by warning that it was taken by a peeping Tom — and that anyone circulating the film could be convicted as an accessory .
ESPN said Andrews “ has been grievously wronged ” and pledged to help with the investigation .
“ Our people and resources are in full support of her as she deals with this abhorrent act , ” a spokesman said yesterday .
At least one more version of the video , on YouTube , was also removed .
It ’s been speculated that the video was taken in Omaha , Neb. , last month while Andrews was covering the College World Series .
But the local police department and US Attorney ’s Office said no reports had been filed with them .
Meanwhile , voyeurs who tried to access the pictures after they were taken down were directed to sites that showed a blurry video of a naked , attractive blonde , touted as Andrews .
And when they clicked on the video , they got a computer virus .
“ There are lots more sites out there pretending to host the Erin Andrews peephole but really hosting malicious software , ” wrote Graham Cluley , of the anti-virus firm Sophos .
He said hackers took advantage of the instant celebrity status of the original video to circulate a fake .
“ And — surprise , surprise — if you visit those Web pages you could be putting the security of your computer at real risk , ” he said .
Meanwhile , Andrews is n’t talking about the horrifying incident .
“ We request respect of Erin ’s privacy at this time , while she and her representatives are working with the authorities , ” Grossman said .

Last Friday a cute new coffee shop opened in Seattle , dubbed “ 15th Avenue E Coffee and Tea ” –it ’s one of those unique places that are being beaten out of business by big nasty Starbucks .
Wait a second , it is a Starbucks .
And it ’s right there on the front window –the olde worlde - looking painted store sign says “ 15th Ave E Coffee and Tea… Inspired by STARBUCKS . ”
It is , in fact , a low - profile , camouflaged stealth Starbucks store .
And it ’s part of a new Starbucks business model that will see stores without the trademark global styling , and interiors that are more of a return to the traditional coffeehouse .
Some of them may even , astonishingly , sell wine or beer and host live music and poetry readings .
Indeed , 15 Ave E does live up to that idea–its decor looks much more old - fashioned , the espressos dribble out of a hand - operated machine .
On one hand , this is a great move by the global coffee machine that is Starbucks to buck the globalization trend , and give the consumer a more unique experience .
But can it be authentic ?
Great independent coffee shops have surfaced across the world for centuries .
They tend to serve different coffee blends , because they ’re truly local they feel more personal , and they sometimes act as a social hub for a neighborhood .
What these new Starbucks stores are doing is ditching the corporate brand so they can pretend to be one of those genuine mom-and - pop stores , while still earning money to feed the global enterprise .
It ’s a bit like finding out that your favorite small - label French champagne is actually made by Coca Cola , and bottled in St. Louis .
If these stealth stores manage to deliver a genuinely local experience , and integrate themselves a bit more into local communities then perhaps we ’ll let Starbucks off the hook .
But it ’s a big “ if ” .

[ New Scientist ]
Britain's army of unemployed number almost 2.5 million , the highest in almost 15 years , with almost one million younger people out of work .
While shocking by many standards , the figures released by the official statisticians yesterday were , if anything , slightly better than had been expected .
The unemployment rate stands at 7.8 per cent , up from 5.4 per cent this time last year , or around 750,000 more out of work .
A more worrying trend is the emergence of an increasingly large group of the hidden unemployed – totalling more than 1.6 million – who are being pushed into taking shorter hours , temping or going into part - time work in an attempt to avoid the dole queues .

Data released by the Office for National Statistics yesterday showed that another 220,000 joined the ranks of the unemployed in the three months to June 2009 , taking the total to 2.4 million .
However , the number of people claiming unemployment benefits , the " claimant count " has shown a moderating trend ; still upwards , but at a slower pace than in recent months , suggesting that the rate of growth in joblessness is moderating , at least for now .
An extra 25,000 people claimed job seeker 's allowance in June , taking the total claimant count to 1.6 million .
The news came as the Governor of the Bank of England , Mervyn King , indicated that the economic recovery , which may already be under way , will be so feeble that few people will notice the difference between the coming upturn and the previous recession .
He said the challenge of fixing the " fragile " banking system meant that Britain is condemned to a " slow and protracted recovery " he said .
There are now 928,000 jobless young people , and 472,100 18 to 24 - year - olds claiming jobseeker 's allowance .
Martina Milburn , chief executive of The Prince 's Trust , commented : " Youth unemployment now costs the state £ 3.4 m per day in jobseeker 's allowance .
But this is just the start of a long and downward spiral , which all too often leads to crime , homelessness or worse . "
Millions of school leavers and graduates will inflate the total still further over the summer .
Most economists expect the unemployment total to rise to over three million by the time of the next election .
Figures released by the bank of England and the ONS yesterday indicated a growing number of what might be dubbed the " shadow unemployed , " backing anecdotal evidence that the UK 's liberalised labour market has both helped keep the official jobless totals low , while pushing many into a twilight world between traditional jobs and casual , insecure and poorly paid work .
Pay rises in this recession , for example , are much lower than in previous ones , which Mr King said yesterday had helped save jobs , at least temporarily : " There is some evidence that real pay has been more flexible and that has enabled employment to stay stronger than would have been the case had we been back in the days of the late 1970s and early 1980s . "
The Bank of England also estimates , for example , that some 223,000 people are working short hours at the moment " for economic reasons , " that excludes those choosing to do so to bring up a family , say , or care for someone .
That number has been greatly inflated by the recession , almost doubling since 2008 .
The ONS ' labour market statistics also reveal that there are 426,000 people currently temping because they cannot find a permanent position , up by a quarter on this time last year ; and a further 964,000 working part - time who say they are seeking full time posts – up 40 per cent on a year ago .
There has also been an increase in the number of people declaring themselves students and self - employed , some of whom may , in reality , be practically speaking unemployed .
The fact that none of these groups are eligible for benefits also means that they remain away from the claimant count numbers , which have generally been more optimistic .
There is also the professional made redundant who finds themselves in casual bar or café work , for example – a sort of " barrister to barista " phenomenon – to consider .
Susan Yallop , a director of Adecco , the employment agency , explained : " As the job market continues to alter , so too must candidates , their expectations and their approach to seeking employment ; the key is flexibility .
This means that candidates might need to be willing to broaden their horizons and consider jobs that may fall outside of their original target . "

' I was even turned down for a job at McDonalds '
The lawyer who can't find work as a temp : Paul Singh
Paul Singh , a 35 - year - old Londoner , got a law degree from Queen Mary 's University and later trained as a barrister .
He was made redundant from his £ 60,000 a year job at a London recruitment firm six months ago and has since been too " over - qualified " to find a new job , even at McDonald's .
" In my last job , I managed three junior consultants and was answerable to the managing director .
Now prospective employers tell me I 'm too senior to employ .
I used to earn £ 40,000 per year minimum .
That made £ 60,000 after bonuses .
Now I am looking at temporary jobs which are offering £ 6.50 per hour .
I even applied to McDonald 's and they turned me down .
But I am optimistic .
From what I hear , things could be starting to turn .
Companies have seemed reluctant to release any cash they had because they were worried about the wider economic situation .
" Somebody must require staff somewhere , the problem is that there is so much competition and firms are looking for very specific types of experience .
Even then , many are employing the cheapest option , regardless of experience . "
' My earnings have halved but I wo n't go on the dole '
The manager who became a temp : Maureen Yole
Maureen
Yole was once responsible for outsourcing more than 200 temporary jobs to employment agencies , now she is struggling to get work through one herself .
The 51 - year - old , from Manchester , was earning about £ 30,000 a year before she took a voluntary redundancy package .
Now , she said , she is willing to accept work for less than half of that figure .
" My salary , after bonuses were added , was more than double of some of the pay cheques I am willing to look at now – around £ 9 per hour , " she said .
" I hope Adecco will be able to place me in a similar position to my old job but I am realistic and I do n't think it will happen .
The most important thing for me is not to go on to benefits .
" I was employed by a large American firm in December 2007 when they decided they needed a presence in the UK .
I was given a building site and told they needed a fully functioning office .
" I was responsible for recruitment of staff .
I used to use Adecco to find temporary staff , now I am signed up with them myself . "
' It 's monotonous work and the pay is far lower '
The engineer who became a temp : Jessica Burke
Equipped with two engineering degrees , Jessica Burke graduated with a £ 28,000 job offer designing IT systems and programming robotic arms on car production lines .
Six years later , she is temping for less than £ 14,000 a year .
" My generation entered into a buoyant job market .
My peers were able to land jobs where we could earn up to £ 35,000 a year .
" The economic boom allowed me to move quickly into a project management role , eventually starting my own business as an IT and engineering consultant .
" I could earn anything up to – and even above – £ 50,000 .
But towards the end of last year you could sense the downturn .
Work started drying up and there was a notable lack in start - up businesses that required my services .
" Now I 'm doing a fairly monotonous admin and data - entry role .
The pay is far lower than when I first temped 13 years ago .
When I 'm interviewed for temp roles , people are quick to judge me as overqualified or unsuited .
That said , there are few experiences that build character and make you truly understand the value of money . "

Fresh population projections put the number of humans over seven billion in 2011 , just 12 years after humanity passed the six billion mark .
What ’s most notable in the new analysis is confirmation that while fertility rates are dropping in many places , some of the world ’s most turbulent and poverty - stricken regions are seeing explosive population growth leading to enormous numbers of teenagers and children .
( More evidence that puberty rules planet Earth at the moment ? )
Such a youth bulge can be an asset if education and economic activity are there to build a work force .
But without prospects , the result can be higher risks of conflict .
Look at the population projection for Uganda , showing that country heading to a population of 96 million in 2050 from 31 million today .
How does a country like Uganda build schools fast enough , train teachers fast enough and improve sanitation fast enough to harness the potential in its youth ?
Ideas welcome .

As a web designer , I ’d say that more than 80 % of all my recent work has been WordPress - related … from creating original WordPress themes , to heavily customizing existing ones .
Which is why I ’m so pleased every time I come across a bare - bones WordPress theme , something plain I can “ build on ” .
I ’m very grateful to the designers who ’ve created these - here are my current five ( free ! ) favorites :
Whiteboard
If you ’re the type of designer who likes to code up a regular HTML site before chopping everything up into WordPress templates , Whiteboard will make your life much , much easier .
It ’s a WordPress framework at its most basic , with necessary templates all set up and ready for you to paste your design bits into .
It also includes some goodies like “ Socialization Links ” , with links to Technorati , Digg , StumbleUpon , etc .
Very simple , and a joy to have .
WP Framework
Looking for something a bit more powerful ?
I daresay that WP Framework belongs in every WordPress theme designer ’s toolbox - especially those who want to release their own themes to the public .
The Theme Options API , for example , is a set of functions that makes it easy for you to create your very own “ theme options ” page ( and do n’t we all love options ? )
Great accompanying documentation , too .
Hybrid Skeleton
There are quite a few WordPress theme frameworks with accompanying child themes out there , and Hybrid is a particularly good one .
The authors are n’t joking when they describe Hybrid as “ user - friendly ” , and their child themes are beautifully designed and easy to tweak .
What I ’ve linked to here , though , is their Skeleton child theme , which allows you to build your own child theme on Hybrid .
Thematic
Just like Hybrid , Thematic is a framework that has some gorgeous child themes … but the truth is , Thematic is glorious on its own as a clean , minimalistic theme .
Of course , it really shines when in the hands of talented designers .
The lovely Gallery theme , for example , which is perhaps one of the most beautiful themes for a WP - powered photo gallery or portfolio , is a Thematic child theme .
Sandbox
This list would n’t be complete without mentioning Sandbox , which was perhaps the first “ bare - bones ” WordPress theme I ever used , and was crucial to me in the early days of learning how to create WordPress themes , when just looking through the code of Kubrick made my head spin .
Do you use theme frameworks ?
Are there any bare - bones WordPress themes you recommend ?
Busting the myths : what Graphic Design ISN’T
by Tracey Grady
in Graphic Design
posted May 27 , 2009
For a bit of fun I ’ve put together a list of things that Graphic Design Is n’t , based on my own experiences and those of others .
I hope this will be helpful for designers and clients alike .
Design is n’t free
Asking a designer for a few concepts before committing to hire them is like asking a clothing boutique if you can take a garment home and wear it for a while before deciding if you ’ll pay for it .
No store would agree to it , and with good reason : there ’s no guarantee you ’d ever return to pay for the goods .
A designer who provides design concepts without a signed contract is at risk of losing their ideas : the prospective client could easily take those concepts elsewhere .
Always get a signed contract first , and better still get a down payment too .
Design is n’t copying
It ’s reasonable ( and often very helpful ) when a client gives examples of designs they like and which have a similar feel to what they ’re seeking for their design brief .
It ’s not reasonable when a client provides a design and asks for a designer to create exactly the same thing for them .
Do n’t ever be tempted to lift another designer ’s work , whether you ’ve been asked to or not .
Design is n’t random
Every time a prospective client approaches a designer , it ’s because they have a problem which needs a solution .
This statement underpins all professional design work .
Working out the right design is n’t a matter of going with your favourite colour , or some fashionable patterns you found last week .
It takes research into the client ’s field , their target market and how the design is to be viewed .
The right design may not necessarily be beautiful , but it does have to be effective at getting the message across .
Design is n’t IT
This one may not surface very often , but it has for me .
A few years ago I worked on a design brief for a group of people who referred to me as the “ IT person ” throughout .
I found them great to work with : very communicative and cooperative , except that my explanations that I was a graphic designer ( with no IT training ) went unheard .
I ’ve also occasionally encountered a client who , in the course of a meeting , asks me to help sort out the problems with their email program or their internet connection .
Usually these requests come from someone who , again , does n’t understand where the designer ’s role starts and ends , only that you ’re a person who is “ good with computers ” .
It ’s best to politely decline , and explain that your role does n’t extend to technical support for their software or hardware .
Design is n’t web hosting
For that matter , design also is n’t printing , marketing , internet security , SEO , or other services which naturally follow on from design .
Some designers do offer one or more of these as a supplementary service .
However , for the most part , these services will be referred to a third party ( e.g. a printing house , web hosting company or SEO firm ) and no responsibility for these falls on the designer .
Design is n’t copywriting
Designers rely on their clients to provide any text required for the design brief .
The text may be drafted by the client themselves or by a professional copywriter .
Unless otherwise negotiated , the designer does n’t provide copywriting or proofreading services .
It may be prudent to include this in the contract or Terms of Service signed at the beginning of the design job .
Design is n’t a hobby
This is n’t to say that aspects of design may not be a hobby for some people .
My point is that graphic design is a profession , with a skill set that requires training , and a good understanding of established techniques and rules .
It deserves respect and should be treated accordingly .
Design is n’t neat software
Photoshop is a very popular piece of software .
It ’s also easy to pick up the basics through night classes , books or tutorials online .
Having a grasp on some powerful graphics software ( I mention Photoshop simply as an example ) is n’t enough to qualify someone as a fully fledged designer , though .
Professional designers make use of a range of graphics programs , and know which is / are appropriate for a given design job ; they understand how to take a design concept and prepare it for publication ( print or screen ) ; and very often the major conceptual work for a design is carried out well away from a computer , using a pencil and sketchbook .
These days graphic designers are trained in the use of software programs , but these are just one component in the many tools of the profession .
Design is n’t clip art
If you ’re skimming this article , I ’ll cut to the chase : do n’t ever use clip art in a professional design .
If you ’re a client , do n’t accept the use of clip art in a design .
Design uses a whole range of different materials from varying sources .
In some cases , photography or illustrations may be commissioned specially for a design brief .
In other instances , stock images may be used ( I will be talking more about this in an upcoming post ) .
Stock images are photographs or illustrations obtained from a stock library .
There are many stock libraries to be found online , offering a broad range of licensing arrangements for their images .
Clip art images may come bundled with software you already own , but in design terms they represent the lowest common denominator of image use .
There are so many sources of images which are far superior , even for a low budget , that there ’s no reason to use clip art .
In particular , the use of clip art to create a logo is fraudulent ; it ’s certainly not original design work .
Design is n’t filling up all of the space
One of the fundamentals of good design is balance , and a key aspect of balance in design is working with negative space .
This means leaving an empty space or spaces in the design , in order to emphasise other details elsewhere .
Negative space is also important for making a design easier to read and take in .
It ’s visually powerful and utilised in graphic design everywhere you look : from packaging to magazines , billboards and television advertising .
If a client asks for all of the space to be filled up , ask them why .
Sometimes it ’s unavoidable ( this is usually when there is a lot of content to be placed in a small space , like on a toothpaste tube ) .
Otherwise , if it can be avoided it should be .
Design is n’t an afterthought
The value of good design cannot be understated .
It can get a company noticed , make them stand out from the competition , provide professional credibility , or it can be one of the foundations of their brand identity .
Good design is a legitimate investment in a company ’s future .
The best clients are the ones who understand the value that a well - researched and well - executed design brings them .
What else would you add to the list of Design Isn’ts ?
Ask any group of mad scientists how they plan to take over the world , and one of the answers that you just might hear is “ With giant monsters ! ”
And rightly so .
Mucking with the workings of life itselfis one of the key skills in the mad scientist ’s arsenal .
Of course , we need to start small .
The easiest way to begin is by experimenting on plants .
Not only is it much less expensive , but your laboratory will remain more pleasant to work at , since PETP protestors tend to be fewer in number than those from PETA .
Plant growth , in all of its different aspects , is regulated by a complex system of hormones ( signal chemicals ) that are responsible for phenomena as complex as geotropism and phototropism , rooting and branching , dwarfism , and seed dormancy .
It turns out that many of these chemicals are actually used in horticulture and are relatively easy to obtain .
One of the most interesting chemicals to play with is Gibberellic acid , a well - known and easily available plant hormone that can be used to stimulate growth .
It is available in liquid form from United Nuclear , and can induce frankly absurdgrowth in many types of plants .
In order to see results quickly , it ’s nice to start with a plant that grows quickly .
We chose to experiment with mung been sprouts , which ordinarily reach maturity ( from a particular salad - eater ’s perspective ) in about five days .
The technique we are using is based on guidelines from the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences , University of Florida .
We tested the method prior to experimentation , and found the results to be tasty .
We had assisted with an earlier experiment ( shown above ) comparing various concentrations of Gibberellic acid where 100 ppm was a clear standout , so we ’ll be using 100 ppm for our experimental sample .
For the control sample ( marked Kontrol ) we soaked one tablespoon of washed and sorted beans in water for twelve to eighteen hours .
We then rinsed the beans and poured off the excess water twice a day .
For the experimental sample ( marked Kaos ) we did the initial soak in our 100 ppm Gibberellic acid solution .
Twice a day we rinsed , first in water which was drained off , then in the Gibberellic acid solution , pouring off the excess .
Both jars were capped with cheesecloth and stored in a dark cabinet when not being rinsed or photographed .
After a day , there is n’t much visible difference between the groups .
It looks like fewer of the control group ( on the left ) are showing signs of sprouting , which is n’t surprising , as Gibberellic acid improves germination .
On day three , there are more and longer sprouts in the experimental group ( on the right ) .
By day four , the volume of the control group is only half that of the experimental group .
On day five , the experimental sprouts are definitely trying to escape .
Sprouts are normally eaten on the fourth or fifth day , but we do n’t recommend eating the sprouts treated with Gibberellic acid ( see MSDS ) .
From here , it ’s only a hop skip and a jump to making your very own giant monster .
( Which is good bonus points if you live in New York or Japan . )
What if we passed a bill that made it so we , the people , vote on how much Senators and House Representatives get paid .
If we are going to be paying them out of our tax dollars , why should n't we be able to regulate their salary .
If they do a shitty job , they do n't get paid .
Simple .
It would create a competitive environment where the person would actually be trying to do what the majority wanted , because making them happy gets him a raise .
As of right now , the senate votes on their own raises ; that money comes out of taxes .
Now and then :
Sex still sells
After witnessing Calvin Klein's now infamous ‘ orgy ’ billboard in New York City , and the controversy surrounding it , contributing writer Josh Smith looks into the history of sex in advertising .
A few weeks ago , while rushing in the morning commute , I noticed a new Calvin Klein billboard in Manhattan ’s SoHo district .
The suggestive poses and bare skin seemed pretty typical for a fashion ad .
In fact , I might not have even noticed it , except that it seemed unusual to show such intimacy between one girl and three guys .
I carried on my way though , without too much thought .
Later that day , the public outcry broke to major news outlets .
Had I been witness to a newsworthy event ?
It was odd .
Was everyone suddenly realizing there is sex in media ?
Was a billboard in SoHo really the most offensive culprit ?
Was broadcasting photos of it all across the nation the best way to curb this trend and keep it away from tender , innocent , young eyes ?
Did they think this attention would keep it from happening again ?
Perhaps I ’m cynical , but the reaction seemed a bit overblown to me .
Seen here from Associated Press :
All of it got me a bit curious about the whole notion of sex in advertising .
Had n’t we seen this a zillion times before ?
Have we arrived on some hedonistic time and not noticed , or have we always been confronted with ads that pushed our sexual buttons ?
We seem to be going through a period of nostalgia , and everyone seems to think yesterday was better than today .
I do n't think it was , and I would advise you not to wait ten years before admitting today was great .
If you 're hung up on nostalgia , pretend today is yesterday and just go out and have one hell of a time .
- Art Buchwald , Pulitzer Prize - winning author
So , inspired , I started digging up some vintage ads :
Witness this Ivory Soap ad from the 1910 ’s in which a bunch of naked sailors get lathered up in the bath together while their friend hoses them off .
Try putting a picture of that in an ad these days .
Even better is the copy , which reads :
“ We all had a bath … about 25 being under the hose at one time …
It certainly seemed like home to rub in the mild Ivory lather from head to foot and then feel the delightful exhilaration following a brisk rub down . ”
Throughout the 40's Springmaid sheets ran a campaign using ' girly ' pictures and infusing their copy with double - entendre 's , which are confusing to decipher these days “ ... now available to the fals bottom and bust bucket business as ' springmaid perker '...
And dont be caught buying ' flat , stale ' coffee in the 50's or your husband will beat you , as this Chase & Sanborn coffee ad will attest . ”
This In - Sink - Erator really is an “ everlasting gift . ”
You need only buy it once and your wife will be moved to show her ' thanks ' three times a day !
I wonder if there was a money - back guarantee on that product benefit ?
This Tiparillo ad campaign of 1967 goes down as some of the most overt copywriting I 've seen anywhere , anytime .
The series investigated the burning question “ Should a gentleman offer a Tiparillo to : a librarian , a violinist and a lab technician ? ”
“ After a tough evening with the Beethoven crowd , she loves to relax an listen to her folk - rock records .
Preferably , on your stereo .
She 's open - minded .
So maybe tonight you offer her a Tiparillo .
She might like it — the slim cigar with a white tip .
Elegant .
And , you dog , you 've got both on hand .
Tiparello Regular and new Timparillo M with menthol — her choice of mild smoke or cold smoke .
Well ?
Should you offer ?
After all , if she likes the offer , she might start to play .
No strings attached . ”
The copy speaks for itself :
” After one look at Mr Leggs slacks she was ready to have him walk all over her . ”
“ Blow in her face and she 'll follow you anywhere . ”
I find it hard to believe that no one was grossed out by this double page spread for Chanel moisture balm to “ attend to the needs of modern man . ”
In the 80's the notion that sex sells really had traction .
With powerful marketing agencies in full swing and a track record of affecting the bottom line , sex was everywhere .
Cotler 's pants promise the right stance for ... whatever it is they are doing , and the first thing he noticed was her Big Mouth , although the photographer seemed to notice other parts .
In the last decade , sexual boundaries continue to be pushed .
From American Apparel encouraging shoppers to ' google ' a porn star modeling their socks , to Tom Ford 's conveniently placed perfume bottles , to a naughty nun selling gelato ( now banned in the UK ) , the limits of good taste and sexuality seem transitional .
Some of the ads found were too obscene or strange to even show in this post , see the whole gallery here .
By European standards , North America may be tame in its acceptance of sexuality .
The debate is whether this modesty is in the interest of good taste or of sexual immaturity .
In some ways it 's hard to compare the CK billboard to the rest .
It does stand fifty feet in the air and is overtly sexual , but was artistic and celebratory of sexuality in a way that the Axe campaign and others are not .
There were no vulgar slogans and there did not appear to be dominance or exploitation .
Though I would not choose to have it there , the outcry seems misplaced in light of the latest Burger King ad , among others .
Regardless of our opinions on good taste and sexuality .
The reality is sex has always been a part of our common experience and will continue to be .
Sex is here to stay .
In advertising and everywhere .
Last week , Calvin Klein 's controversial billboard was taken down and replaced with a new ad featuring a dripping - wet , bikini - clad model .
Interestingly , much more publically acceptable .
[ Some images sourced from All American Ads and Found in Mom 's Basement . ]
It ’s been a confusing few months for Microsoft ’s European customers :
The ongoing EU spat has resulted in a marketing muddle for Microsoft .
It ’s not possible to order upgrade versions of Windows 7 in Europe — you must purchase the full version .
However , it ’s been attractively priced because , originally , no browser would be provided :
Yes , you read that correctly .
The UK price of Windows 7 is significantly less than the US price !
EU residents can also choose their default browser , whereas US users must install one manually !
I ’m stunned .
UK and European residents normally accept they ’ll be ripped off owing to various undisclosed shipping and currency conversion ‘ costs ’ .
It looks as though the EU investigation has done us a big favor ( it ’s about time ! )

Voter fraud is not a non-existent problem , and it's about to become a much , MUCH bigger problem , in a different permutation than people have been conceptualizing .
Several pushes for election system changes are converging to make wholesale " voter fraud " highly likely .
1 ) Push to eliminate physical signatures on voter registration .
Instead , we will be ( and already are , in some locations ) registering voters on the Internet and out in the community on little Etch - a - Sketch electronic tablets .
2 ) Push to permanent absentee voting and forced absentee voting , and no - fault absentee voting , depending on what will be approved by the state .
There is also a federal bill for no - fault absentee voting .
All forms of absentee voting are almost entirely dependent on signature verification for authentication of the voter .
By eliminating the physical signature , door swings WIDE open for wholesale electronic signature comparison fraud .
4 ) In other words : Combination of mail - in voting and signature elimination will enable wholesale bogus votes by insiders .
In addition to votes by dead people and non-existent people , and in my mind a bigger and more imminent risk : stuffing lists with thousands of actual people who are unlikely to vote .
Then , having an insider pre-vote them .
This would constitute wholesale " voter fraud " ( though actually votes being cast by insiders using the space created by dumping infrequent or non-voting persons into the lists ) .
Now , as to the emphasis on blaming the world 's ills on Rove : Interesting article , important article , Brad , but some of the efforts to shift all blame to Rove seem to me to displace culpability from the ultimate insiders , the election officials .
Think about it .
Ohio , 2004 .
While people chase Rove around the planet , absolutely no one ( including Jennifer Bruner ) has shown any interest whatsoever in investigating and prosecuting the election officials that enabled the problems of 2004 to take place .

I 'll disagree with you respectfully there , AJ .
I know some of the folks in the " back room " at judiciary , and they are neither slouches nor " wink - winkers " .
They mean business .
And yes , the oath does n't mean much , considering that lying to Congress is illegal either way .
Also , I 've heard from one source , that he actually * was * sworn in .
But that 's a second hand source that I can't confirm in any way at this time .
And with all of * that * in mind , whether the folks in back are great or not , it does n't necessarily mean that the folks in front will bother to do anything with any of it .
Particularly if Steny , Rahm and friends order otherwise .
But we 'll see .
Suffice to say , I 'm not * quite * as certain in their perfidy as you are , even as I share your frustration with the entire mess .
In spades .

Bev -
Thanks for filling in some holes there .
As the coverage of the " voter fraud " aspect was largely secondary in this article , I used quite a bit of shorthand .
I should have at least noted that it was in person voter fraud at the polling place which is the red herring here , as it 's incredibly rare .
( May add a word or two to the original article to clarify there . )
Beyond that , thanks for the additional thoughts , on which I agree with you here , of course .

Brad - sure , lying to congress is against the law , but so was thumbing your nose and not showing up for 2 other subpoenas .
We will see how it plays out , but if they were serious about any of this , we would n't even be bloggin ' about it as summer 2009 melts into the final " dog days " .
I do n't base my pessimism on the fact he was not sworn in - its the fact that this has been dragged out for years , subpoenas have been ignored , dem leaders took impeachment " off the table " ( despite running on " accountability " , and now the administration sells out his base by proclaiming he is " looking forward . "
They got away with too much , too long , to assume that this is a diligent , honest effort .
No oath is just demonstrating where this is going .

Bev - if your point is that rove is not the " evil genius " that many claim and that he is really just a political hack that stands in front of the microphones and cameras creating distractions , your point is well - taken .
The whole " bush 's brain " thing was always counterproductive and actually enabled much of the criminality because attention was deflected .
And yes , the theft in OH deserves much more attention , but then so does FL , and other local elections ( are any other state results this badly manipulated ? )
Election officials may have " enabled the problems of 2004 to take place " , but they are just working on behalf of much more powerful interests - powerful elite that certainly are well - beyond rove 's status .
To the end that going after them might get them to tell us who they took their marching orders from , it could be productive .
But let 's not kid ourselves either - to orchestrate the theft of 2 presidential elections and " catapult the propaganda " to get away with it could only have been done by a limited group of people .
Follow the money - I prefer to call them the folks behind the military - industrial / media complex .

To " Another Joe " - you say : " Election officials may have " enabled the problems of 2004 to take place " , but they are just working on behalf of much more powerful interests "
We need to stop envisioning election theft as just about a presidential election .
Coshocton County , Ohio had a staggering 6,800 write in votes for a sheriff --- oh , about a thousand percent increase in what 's normal --- and these were in the same hand , in the same writing instrument , but from different polling places .
An inside job .
No investigation , no enforcement .
Yes , I say , if necessary go after the low hanging fruit and take out the crooked election officials .
Without that enabling patchwork , the master plan suddenly gets more expensive , more risky , more difficult to achieve .

I do n't think you acknowledge what we are up against .
Sure - all for going after fraudulent elections at ALL levels .
But most people are not hearing the evidence about stolen NATIONAL ( presidential ) elections and certainly are not hearing anything about local elections , even when in their communities .
Virtually no one hears about fraudulent local elections .
Crooked election officials ?
For some , its the main prerequisite for the job .
Sure , they are " low hanging fruit " that might lead to higher ups .
The " master plan " is not contingent on who the compromised people are that fill the role of the " crooked election official . "
Nor is it contingent on which moron stands in front of the cameras as candidates .

Yes it is .
To some of us , the emphasis on Rove the bogie - man is beginning to look like a strategy to take the heat off the election officials .
It makes no sense to protect the election officials who were perps .
Grab them , flip them , sure .
Or just grab them .
I have some perspective on how crooked election officials get into office in the first place .
The perps are developing their own little farm teams and recruiting each other .
Busting them down will deplete their pool of recruits and will get the more inept members of the farm teams in .
By the way , is Rove even a named defendant in the Ohio case ?

bev - and just how to you come to the conclusion that there is such a limited pool of folks that can be compromised by various means to do the dirty work on the front lines of election fraud ?
No one is claiming to " protect " criminals .
My point is that we need to go after them , but it will only change things if we can work up the chain of command .
And that will not be possible without having a wider dialog that acknowledges that : * systematic vote fraud is orchastrated much higher up than the local election people .
* the mainstream media " catapults the propaganda " before the election ( with fraudulent polls and dishonest talking points ) and then uses that propaganda to shift attention from the stolen elections to justifying the results .
* the folks that do this are smart enough to " compartmentalize " the operations , breaking it down into tasks where the front - line perpetrators do not have knowledge of the larger picture .
Yes - rove is the bogey man , always have been .
But he likely knows much more , which is why he has been rewarded as a mainstream media pundit now .
All I am saying is that real change involves beginning a dialog of what we are up against and I do n't see that happening .
Until we start building that dialog , nothing else matters and any action just continues to hide the truth because it does n't begin to address the fundamental issues .

The country can walk and chew gum at the same time .
Throw rove in prison and throw crooked election officials in prison .
Since elections are fundamental to the existence of this country , try them all for treason .
Treason , remember , is punishable by the death penalty .
If they 're found guilty , sentence them to death .
I 'm guessing that the actual killing a few crooked election officials by electrocution would put a damper on future election tampering .

As to Rove 's minor role in fixing elections , I 'd like to agree and forget that he exists but Ohio anecdotes tell a different story : how Bush , Cheney , and Rove were in Columbus meeting on Nov. 4 , 2008 ; how on Nov. 3 in the evening Rove predicted Obama 's victory after his IT operative , Jim Connell was deposed in court in what was to become a series of hearings in which Connell planned to tell all ; however , Connell died in a plane crash two weeks later .
Evidently the valiant attorneys did enough to stay Connell 's hand on Election Day , to take Rove 's finger out of the dike and allow the swell of public affirmation to sweep the nation .
Connell was in charge of maintaining the websites of the GOP , which were located somewhere in Tennessee , where also , I read , the machinery that could invade and defile electronic machines was located .
Connell was quite the religious guy .
Reminds me how the Iranian power mavens justified the outcome of the recent election by means of passages from the Holy Qu'ran .
How much we might have learned from him .
He was warned not to fly his plane -- that it was quite possible that it was being tampered with .
I was writing a book about this when I was stricken with Bell 's Palsy .
I 'm recovering now and hope to get back to it soon .
Just goes to show you that GOP ingenuity is limitless -- how they are running the show even now .
It 's excruciating .

You know , this strengthens the case for American fascism ... that some prefer to call " corporatism " ... this ceaseless privileging of high government officials and their friends , the regularity with which they elude Rule of Law accountability for crimes like treason and trashing Constitutional guarantees and wars of aggression and torture and election rigging ....
Rove is a one - man coup d'ètat , and his big accountability moment is a little private chat with the Judiciary Committee and all the spin he wants in the MSM .
That 's fascism .
The whole " some of us are more equal than others " bit is fascism ... an elite above the law , with a general population whose rights are abused or nonexistent , with a constabulary that [ mostly ] knows the difference , defers to the elite and is free to treat others roughly and without regard for consequences .
Take the jerk who arrested Professor Gates .
He is caught LYING on his report , and he gets a beer at the White House instead of a suspension or demotion or fired ....
I guess they just do n't want to break his spirit , even though it was miss - applied in that case ... and this mercy soothes the ire of the plutocrats who do n't want the president damping the authority of their goons .
No wonder people are gouging each other 's eyes out to get public office .
No wonder people are devising ways to sell those seats to the highest bidder rather than lose that profit opportunity to the hopelessly prole voters .

" I call it the Norman Rockwell approach to medicine , " says Arena , who , with Denny , opened the practice over a year ago in Barrington , Rhode Island .
They 're part of a national group of doctors called Ideal Medical Practice , a concept these two physicians adapted to offer higher quality health care to a smaller number of patients .
Arena points out that in a traditional medical office , 50 percent to 60 percent of the costs can go toward overhead , such as office and medical staff .
By relying on computer technology for things like prescriptions and referrals , Denny and Arena are not only able to run the practice themselves , but offer an hour - per - patient visit .
Watch the doctors inside and outside the office »
" Having fewer patients allows you to spend more time with them , " says Arena , and it also means they do n't have people waiting in that reception area with the large flower arrangement .
" We made a system that allows patients to be known and feel like they have access to their doctor and be heard , " says Denny .
She thinks that this is what medicine was like around 60 years ago , when doctor and patient really got to know each other .
Their patients agree .
" It 's really the way medicine should be practiced , " says Adi Goldstein .
She 's been coming to Barrington Family Medicine since it started .
The medical care here , she believes , is similar to what she had growing up in Israel .
" You have a relationship with your physician , so it 's wonderful . "
Another patient , Jennifer Hess , agrees .
" I love this practice , " says Hess .
In addition to being able to reach her doctor by phone and getting appointments promptly , she also enjoys exams that are thorough .
" They do n't miss anything , " she says .
" They go over everything . "
The lack of time doctors have with patients , Arena feels , is part of a systemic problem with modern primary care medicine .
It stems , she says , from practices needing to see large volumes of patients in a day to keep up with their costs .
Arena and Denny both worked in more traditional medical practices before starting this small office of their own .
" You need to see patients quickly in a traditional setting , " Arena says .
" If I had a fifteen - minute visit with a patient , I do n't really have time to know if something else is bothering them .
That 's , I think , where you have the doctor holding onto the door handle saying , ' Everything else OK ?
Right ?
Nothing else is a problem ? '
Because you do n't have time to address it if you get a positive answer . "
Denny has similar feelings .
" That was us before , " she says .
" You can't see a patient every ten minutes , so you 're going to end up being late . "
She says she would spend her entire day apologizing to patients for keeping them waiting .
Denny and Arena feel what they offer their patients now is a better quality of care .
Both doctors also live in the same community as the practice .
Arena will frequently use the adjacent bike path , not only for her commute but for home visits , too .
" Not many people do house calls , " she says on her way to a checkup on a 2 - week old boy -- a visit she is making by car rather than bicycle because it 's raining .
Because most of their patients live fairly close by , it 's generally not a problem to do a home exam and get back to the office in the hour that is scheduled for an appointment .
" You can learn a lot by going to people 's homes , " Arena says , because you might notice something like a rug that could trip and injure the elderly person who lives there .
Naomi Malik , the mother of the newborn Arena has come to see , is thrilled she does n't have to pack the car up with all of her children and head to the doctor 's office .
" It 's hard to get out the door with a newborn , " she says , " so it 's nice to have them come to you . "
Working by themselves means doing other jobs in the office , but Denny points out that by not having to pay someone to scan an insurance card , she gets the tradeoff of getting to spend an hour with her patients .
" We could n't have done this ten years ago , " she says , and that 's because their computers use software that takes care of referrals , sends prescriptions to the pharmacy and generates the bills that go to the insurance companies .
The software even automatically e-mails appointment reminders to patients .
The result is good for both patients and the doctors .
Denny and Arena job share because they both have their own families .
Andrea usually works in the morning while Lisa takes the afternoons .
" We wanted a balance of being moms and being doctors , " says Denny , " and we wanted to be the kind of doctors we were trained to be . "
She added that this type of medical practice has allowed them to spend more time with their patients and more time with their own kids .
" It 's not a stressful work environment , " she says .
" It 's kind of fun . "

The same day the Los Angeles City Council took its first votes to shut down rogue medical marijuana dispensaries , the chamber roiled with city workers who denounced plans to balance the budget with furloughs and layoffs .
When medical marijuana advocates had their chance to talk , they seized on the coincidence and startled the council with their message .
Do n’t ban us , they said , tax us .
Last week , Councilwoman Janice
Hahn proposed to do just that .
“ They have suggested it , so I just decided let ’s do it , ” she said , noting that the city is drafting rules for its hundreds of dispensaries .
“ To me , the next logical step was , hey , wait a minute , we should be able to benefit from the sales and the revenues . ”
Hahn ’s proposal , which she hopes could raise tens of millions of dollars , comes as lawmakers across California , anxious for new revenues , have started to focus on one of the state ’s most lucrative and least - taxed businesses .

The state ’s first vote on the issue will be counted Tuesday in Oakland , where voters have been casting mail - in ballots on a proposal to levy a business tax on medical marijuana dispensaries .
The initiative , backed by the dispensaries and with no organized opposition , could spur copycat tax measures in fiscally stressed cities around the state .
“ Oakland is really just the beginning , ” said James Anthony , a lawyer who represents dispensaries .
“ I think a lot of local governments are ready , where they were n’t ready five or even three years ago . ”
On a statewide level , Assemblyman Tom Ammiano ( D - San Francisco ) introduced a bill earlier this year to legalize and tax pot , which drew widespread attention to the issue .
Although Sacramento faces a $ 26.3 - billion shortfall , the bill is on hold as the assemblyman works to build support .

Estimates of how much money could be raised by taxing marijuana vary widely .
Last week , the state Board of Equalization calculated that Ammiano ’s bill , which would place a $ 50 - an - ounce levy and sales taxes on all marijuana purchases , would raise $ 1.4 billion a year .
The tax board ’s researchers cite academic and federal studies , including estimates that the state grows $ 13.8 billion worth of marijuana a year and Californians consume about a million pounds a year .
“ Because it ’s an underground business at the moment , there are n’t hard data , ” said Robert Ingenito , chief of the research section at the Board of Equalization .
Mark Kleiman , a professor of public policy at UCLA who studies drug policy , scoffed at the estimate .
“ That raises the question in my mind of what the Board of Equalization has been smoking , ” he said .
“ That ’s an insane estimate . ”

He believes that marijuana sales in California total about $ 1 billion a year and that Ammiano ’s bill would raise perhaps $ 250 million .
Dispensaries are currently required to pay sales taxes .
The tax board estimates that they pay $ 18 million a year , but two pro-marijuana organizations , which independently surveyed collectives and patients , both arrived at $ 100 million .
In Oakland , the city auditor estimates that the proposed business tax would bring in $ 315,000 a year , but Councilwoman Rebecca Kaplan believes the take could be closer to $ 1 million .
The city ’s four dispensaries reported that they took in $ 19.7 million in the last fiscal year .
Although the amounts of tax revenue are in doubt , the politics are clear : Advocates of legalizing marijuana are confident that taxing their product will advance their cause .
The Marijuana Policy Project recently ran a television commercial in Los Angeles and other California cities encouraging lawmakers to tax pot .

“ Like it or not , this is a very large industry , ” said Bruce Mirken , spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project .
“ At a certain point , it just makes no sense to have such an industry operating in the shadow , unregulated , untaxed , not answerable to anyone . ”
Ammiano does not take credit for the pot tax idea .
But he does take credit for recognizing that it was an auspicious time to introduce a bill .
“ I was just anticipating a perfect storm : political will , populism , economic stress , federal policy looking as if it is going to become more liberalized and enlightened , ” he said .
The month after he introduced the bill , President Obama ’s administration indicated that it would end federal prosecution of medical marijuana dispensaries that adhere to state law .
In April , the Field Poll found that 56 % of the state ’s voters want to legalize and tax marijuana .
In Los Angeles County , 60 % of the voters were pro-pot .

“ That was certainly a first in this state , ” said Mark DiCamillo , the poll ’s director .
Despite the state ’s dire economic situation , Ammiano ’s bill has played little role in the budget debate .
The assemblyman has not pushed for a quick vote , realizing he would have to persuade cautious colleagues .
As drafted , Ammiano ’s bill to sell pot like alcohol depends on repeal of the federal law that criminalizes marijuana .
But he thinks it ’s possible that California could press ahead without federal approval , as it did with medical marijuana .
“ Absolutely , that ’s on the table , ” he said .

Ammiano said lawmakers often buttonhole him to ask for information to share with constituents at town halls .
“ A lot of them in the hallways are saying , ‘ I ’d love to vote for this , ’ ” he said .
Mirken believes it will take politicians a while to catch up with public opinion .
“ By and large this is something about which politicians are a bit gun-shy , ” he said .
“ A lot of them are still living in a state of fear that , if they are labeled soft on drugs , they are going to be in trouble . ”
But Mirken , who is based in San Francisco , noted that Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has said it is time to have the debate .
“ What you ’re seeing now is more sort of middle - of - the - road political figures , and that ’s a sea change , ” Mirken said .
Ultimately , he thinks the attraction of a largely untapped revenue source could be too much for lawmakers to resist .
“ I ’m old - fashioned enough to think that a billion dollars is not insignificant , ” he said .

Oakland ’s measure , one of four on the ballot to help close the city ’s $ 83 - million shortfall , will be the first test of public sentiment .
It would substantially increase the business tax on marijuana dispensaries , from $ 1.20 per $ 1,000 in gross receipts to $ 18 .
The city ’s dispensaries proposed the tax .
“ We support the city , but really the thinking behind it is we ’re not just dispensaries , we are movement activists , ” said dispensary lawyer Anthony , who represents Harborside Health Center .
“ It ’s part of a whole argument to other cities that they should consider permitting and regulating medical cannabis dispensaries . ”
In Los Angeles , which has struggled with a $ 530 - million shortfall , it ’s unclear how many of the hundreds of medical marijuana dispensaries currently pay the city ’s business tax .
Hahn plans to ask city officials to recommend a higher rate for medical marijuana dispensaries .
Based on Oakland ’s tax , she did a quick - and - dirty calculation and believes the city might raise $ 16 million to $ 32 million .

“ The dispensaries are not objecting to this .
They , in fact , kind of have suggested it , ” Hahn said .
“ They want to be legitimized .
They want to be part of the city family . ”

Hothouse of financial innovation
FIRE insurance was not given much thought until the Great Fire of London alerted people to the danger of combining dozy bakers and wooden houses .
It took two world wars for life insurance to take root .
Some think that the housing meltdown is poised to be a similar catalyst for derivatives that allow investors to hedge against movements in the price of residential property .
Housing derivatives first appeared in 2006 as futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange but were only available to sophisticated investors .
In the euphoria of the bubble , builders and developers showed little interest in the idea .
Smart investors preferred to make bearish bets via more bespoke instruments .
But in June , Robert Shiller and Karl Case , two economists responsible for a widely used gauge of American house - price movements , opened up the market to retail investors with the launch of a product called MacroShares .
Derivatives have a bad name at the moment , but this sort is tame enough .
MacroShares are securities that reflect the value of the S&P / Case - Shiller home - price index in ten large urban centres .
The securities are issued in pairs , one for investors who wish to bet on the upward movement of house prices , and one for those who think prices will fall .
That means every bet has an offsetting investment .
Investors must also pay for their interest upfront , eliminating counterparty risks .
And unlike actual homes , MacroShares are traded on public exchanges and are therefore liquid .
The idea has merit .
For most people , their homes are their largest single investment .
Finding a way to hedge that investment makes sense .
Falling prices are accentuated in illiquid markets such as residential property .
Having some protection against price falls should reduce concerns over paper losses .
The next step is to tie derivatives more tightly to the interests of individual homeowners .
MacroShares is already mulling a product tied to specific locations , rather than national house - price movements .
A homebuyer in Miami , say , could offset the risk of price decline in the local area with a housing derivative .
Lenders could end up wrapping these derivatives into mortgage contracts as a form of home - equity insurance .
That would be an improvement over some of their recent offerings .
Although trading in MacroShares has been light so far , Mr Shiller thinks the only obstacle to widespread adoption is a deep - rooted belief that home prices always increase .
If ever there were a time for that to weaken , it is now .
Straight from the horse ’s mouth :
Apple® today announced that Dr. Eric Schmidt , chief executive officer of Google , is resigning from Apple ’s Board of Directors , a position he has held since August 2006 .
“ Eric has been an excellent Board member for Apple , investing his valuable time , talent , passion and wisdom to help make Apple successful , ” said Steve Jobs , Apple ’s CEO .
“ Unfortunately , as Google enters more of Apple ’s core businesses , with Android and now Chrome OS , Eric ’s effectiveness as an Apple Board member will be significantly diminished , since he will have to recuse himself from even larger portions of our meetings due to potential conflicts of interest .
Therefore , we have mutually decided that now is the right time for Eric to resign his position on Apple ’s Board . ”
On the board for two years ?
I ca n’t imagine how uncomfortable Dr. Schmidt must have been on the board , especially taking into consideration Android and the upcoming Chrome OS .
Granted , I have decided come up with a few plausible reasons for his staying on the board , in spite of the ( inferred ) awkwardness .
No supplementary Photoshopped images or anything – I ’d just much do this than answer hundreds of e-mails at work .
Also , you ’ll notice that I was not afraid to dodge Occam ’s Razor :
(1) Shareholders .
Shareholders .
Shareholders .
(2) Dr. Schmidt and Steve Jobs are actually brothers and they must unite for the inevitable rise of the machines .
Little did Jobs know that Schmidt – after all of this time – is the creator of the machine .
Bill Gates shakes his head in disappointment .
(3) The “ Board of Directors ” is actually a contraption developed by Nikola Tesla .
And though it appeared to be the prestigious Dr. Eric Schmidt on the Board the entire time , it was actually his unknown twin brother , Mr. Derek Schmidt .
Everything was going fine until now .
Now , it ’s simply a magic trick gone wrong .
(4) After the announcement of Chrome OS , Jobs discovered that Dr. Schmidt was also planning to create a new video game .
Jobs then miraculously found a way to trap Dr. Schmidt in said game .
In an attempt to not shed any light on the matter , Apple tried their best to avoid jumping into any news cycles .
(5) Eric .
I am your father .
After he had searched his feelings , he knew it to be true .
Any other ideas ?
In the wake of the failure of the Icelandic banks Messrs Brown , Barroso and Strauss - Kahn prove that they have understood nothing
From G8 to G20 , many heads of state and government seem to delight in repeating that nothing will ever be the same again .
The world is changing , to the point of being turned on its head by the crisis ; the way we think and act in terms of financial regulation , international relations and development aid must therefore , according to them , change too .
However , numerous examples contradict all this big talk .
The situation in which Iceland now finds itself following the implosion of its banking system and the emergency nationalisation of its three main banks ( Kaupthing , Landsbanki and Glitnir ) is undoubtedly one of the most significant of these examples .
This small country of 320,000 inhabitants is now reeling under the weight of billions of Euros of debt , which has absolutely nothing to do with the vast majority of its population and which Iceland cannot afford to pay .
I became interested in Iceland through my role as an adviser to the criminal investigation into the causes of the failure of its banks , which is at the root of its difficulties .
However , I am not going to talk about that investigation , but something that goes far beyond it .
In any case , I am by no means a spokesperson for the Icelandic authorities , whose responsibility in all this is clearly not insignificant .
The previous government had even been dissolved due to public dissent over cronyism and the clannish running of institutions , which were seen as the cause of all of its problems .
Moved by the fate of Iceland ’s deserving and likeable people , and the complete absence of discussion in the European media about what the future holds for them , I simply want to draw the attention of public opinion to the issues at stake in this case – major challenges that are not confined to the shores of this island .
The irresponsible attitude of certain countries , the EU and the IMF to the collapse of the Icelandic economy demonstrates their inability to learn from the dramatic undermining of the model that it embodied : one of excessive deregulation of markets , particularly financial markets , that the majority of those same key players contributed to shaping .
Let us look , first of all , at the demands of the UK and the Netherlands .
These countries are concerned by the failure of the Icelandic banks because they had welcomed their subsidiaries and branches with open arms , even though their authorities had been at least partially alerted to the risks hanging over those banks .
They are now demanding that Iceland pay them astronomical sums ( more than € 2.7 billion to the UK and over € 1.3 billion to the Netherlands ) , plus interest at 5.5 % .
They consider that Iceland was responsible for guaranteeing the funds deposited with Icesave , the internet arm of Landsbanki that was offering unbeatable rates .
The British and the Dutch decided to set that guarantee not at around € 20,000 per deposit , as provided for in European and Icelandic legislation– which would already have been impossible for the Icelandic government , who quickly announced after nationalising its banks that it could only guarantee deposits made in Iceland itself – but at € 50,000 to € 100,000 per deposit , or even higher .
Moreover , the measures that they are taking to get their way are scandalous .
Indeed , at the very start of October , the UK began with a measure of extreme retaliation : freezing of the assets of not only Landsbanki but also Kaupthing Bank , which was totally unconnected to Icesave , using its anti-terrorism legislation .
In doing so , the UK lumped the Icelandic people , their allies in NATO , together with the likes of organisations such as al - Qaeda …
And since then , it seems to be using all of its influence to ensure that no international aid is really given to Iceland until its demands have been met .
Indeed , Gordon Brown told his parliament that he is working “ with the IMF ” to establish how much it considered the UK was entitled to claim from Iceland .
The IMF itself , meanwhile , not content with putting off making its loans available to Iceland , attached conditions to them that would seem outrageous , even in fiction .
One example of this is the objective of bringing Iceland ’s public deficit down to zero by 2013 , a target that is impossible to achieve but that will nevertheless lead to huge cuts in the most essential areas of spending such as education , public health , social security , etc .
Finally , on the whole , the attitude of the EU and other European countries has hardly been more commendable .
The European Commission has clearly sided with the UK , as its President announced in November that there would be no European aid until the Icesave case had been resolved .
It is true that Mr Barroso – too busy with his own campaign and terrified of upsetting his main source of support , London – is , as is often the case , in over his head .
Even the Scandinavian countries , which heralded international solidarity , are conspicuous by their lack of reaction to the blackmailing of Iceland – which certainly puts the generosity of the loans they have promised into perspective .
Mr Brown is wrong when he says that he and his government have no responsibility in the matter .
Firstly , Mr Brown has a moral responsibility , having been one of the main proponents of this model which we can now see has gone up the spout .
But he also has a responsibility in the sense that he cannot really hide behind the legal status of Icesave – which made it formally dependent on the Icelandic banking authorities – and say that the UK had neither the means nor the legitimacy to supervise its activities .
Could anyone realistically think that a handful of people in Reykjavik could effectively control the activities of a bank in the heart of the City ?
Moreover , it should be noted that the European directives concerning financial conglomerates seem to suggest that EU member states that allow such establishments into their territories from third countries must ensure that they are subject to the same level of control by the authorities of the country of origin as that provided for by European legislation .
So , was there perhaps a failure on the part of the British authorities on this point , which would not be particularly surprising considering the ‘ performance ’ of other English banks ( which were in no way related to Iceland ) during the financial crisis ?
If so , Mr Brown ’s activism in relation to this small country might be motivated by a wish to appear powerful in the eyes of his electorate and taxpayers , whose own losses cannot be played down .
Of course , the Icelandic institutions have a great deal of responsibility in this matter .
But does that necessarily mean that the – also considerable – responsibility of the British authorities should be overlooked , dumping it all on the Icelandic people alone ?
Iceland , whose only remaining source of income is its exports , will certainly not be able to pay off those debts .
The Icesave agreement , that the Icelandic parliament is expected to vote on soon , would burden Iceland with a debt equivalent to £ 700 billion for the UK or $ 5.6 trillion for the US .
Nor will Iceland be able to clear its deficit in less than five years , when national deficits are rising more quickly than ever , even for the great powers – with the UK and the US once again providing two very good examples .
Unless a radical new approach is adopted , Europe and the IMF are about to perform a major feat : reducing a country whose HDI had , in just a few decades , reached the highest level in the world , to the rank of a poor country …
The consequence of this is that the Icelandic people , the majority of whom are highly qualified and multilingual and have strong work relationships with the Nordic countries where they can assimilate easily , are already starting to emigrate .
In the end , neither the IMF , nor England or the Netherlands will be able to be reimbursed .
Just a few tens of thousands of retired fishermen will be left in Iceland , along with its natural resources and a key geostrategic position at the mercy of the highest bidder – Russia , for example , might well find it attractive .
Even so , there are alternative solutions .
Indeed , the countries of the European Union could have devised a mechanism that would allow them to consider their own responsibilities in this situation , to improve the regulation of financial markets and even take on at least part of the debt – which European legislation in no way prohibits – for having failed in their banking supervision role .
They could have offered to help Iceland , which obviously has no experience in the matter , with the investigation that it is seeking to conduct to try to understand what really happened and to thoroughly analyse the causes of this disaster .
They could even have taken the opportunity to start their own debate about a European public prosecution service in charge of matters concerning transnational crime , particularly financial crime , which , once again , European legislation in no way precludes .
The IMF and its Managing Director could also have taken this opportunity to thoroughly review the nature of the conditions that they attach to their loans .
They could have made them more realistic , more focused on the long term , and made it possible to incorporate at least some social considerations .
That would have been a first step towards true reform of multilateral institutions of this type and international solidarity procedures – and for Mr Strauss - Kahn himself , a chance to finally make his mark at the head of the IMF .
Engaging in this debate would obviously require a lot of time and energy , and a great deal of vigilance , particularly in the European Parliament , where discussions should be organised over the coming months .
However , the Swedish presidency of the EU does not seem to be in a hurry to improve regulation of the financial sectors , and the committees with an economic focus in the Parliament are , more than ever , dominated by liberals , particularly British liberals .
Yet the tools and levers for real progress are there ; a catastrophe like that in Iceland could finally raise a meaningful international response , instead of the irresponsible and cynical pressures that we can still see today .

By Grant Brookes
Unity , May 2009 -- Comparisons now abound between the global economic crisis of 2009 and the Great Depression of the 1930s .
Naturally , there are similarities and differences .
The following bleak assessment of the role of trade unions in the early 1930s comes from the best - known book by one of New Zealand ’s foremost social historians of the 20th century :
When their interests were attacked in 1931 , they [ the trade unions ] passed resolutions .
In March 1932 , after a second civil service wages cut , a 10 percent reduction in all Arbitration Court awards , and the abolition of compulsory arbitration to bring wages down more rapidly , a conference of the Alliance of Labour , the Trades and Labour Councils , and the civil service again sidetracked a strike proposal and spent a good deal of time in discussing forms of organization .
The unions had been wet - nursed by an anaemic Arbitration Court , and now that this had gone their weakness was apparent .
Union secretaries had become advocates before a court rather than militant leaders in collective bargaining with the strike weapon in the background and the organization experience and rank and file discipline that this entails ...
Union membership dropped to lower levels , for trade unions seemed to offer little protection .
First published in 1942 , The Quest for Security in New Zealand by W.B. Sutch was still in use as a history textbook at my high school in the 1980s .
The vital questions today are whether the role of unions in 2009 will be similar to Sutch ’s authoritative assessment or different , and what union and radical activists can do about it .
Sutch highlights how the union response to the Great Depression was shaped by the trade unions ’ prevailing policy of the previous decade .
The years before World War I had seen a string of successful strikes and rapid growth for the small “ Red ” Federation of Labour .
The Red Feds were founded on a militant policy of direct wage bargaining with employers and a rejection of the Arbitration Court .
But the crushing defeat of the Red Feds in the 1913 general strike tipped the balance back .
By the 1920s , although some dissent remained inside the newly formed Alliance of Labour , the prevailing policy of the larger union grouping , organised through the more conservative trades and labour councils , was one which downplayed direct action and relied on the Arbitration Court to resolve wage disputes .
The partnership debate
In the first decade of the 21st century , the prevailing policy of the union movement has been one of “ social partnership ” .
The front - line battles of the near future will probably be sparked by job losses and pay cuts .
But the partnership policy , and the debates around it , will very likely shape the mainstream union response to these battles and to all other aspects of the growing economic crisis today .
Partnership began in 1998 , with a local deal between the Public Service Association ( PSA ) and the Manukau City Council .
The first major Partnership Agreement embracing a union , employers and government was signed at the Public Service Association biennial congress two years later , in 2000 .
Ross Wilson , president of the Council of Trade Unions ( CTU ) , gave a keynote speech which outlined where the policy had come from :
“ The last 15 years in New Zealand we have witnessed debates in the union movement about the proposed Compact , the Growth Agreement , ` Nissan Way ’ , ` Workplace New Zealand ’ and [ now ] `partnership ’. ’’
Partnership is an elastic concept .
When presented to union delegates and activists , it is portrayed as a strategy for stronger worker participation in decision making at workplace , industry and national levels .
And in a few workplaces , for a while at least , small groups of worker representatives have achieved just enough input to sustain this view .
For other audiences , however , what is stressed is union willingness to cooperate in boosting business profitability .
Under a picture of workers and employers united behind the NZ flag , a 2004 CTU leaflet declared :
A happy , motivated , high - skill , high - wage workforce is an important part of business success .
That ’s what the CTU wants for everyone ...
We want businesses to succeed .
That ’s right ... we ’re pro-growth ...
We ’re not trying to create “ a hostile business environment ” .
Why would we ?
We ’re interested in people being in work and leading productive lives .
As in earlier times , today ’s prevailing union policy of partnership has been contested .
As a delegate to the PSA congress , I challenged Ross Wilson from the floor about social partnership .
I said it reflected , and reinforced , a self - limiting mindset which had grown under the anti-union National Party governments of the 1990s .
Partnership was a policy of defeat .
It was based on a loss of confidence that unions had the power to achieve their objectives through independent action .
Significant dissent over social partnership emerged at the 2003 CTU biennial conference .
The re-affiliation two years earlier of the 18,000 - strong National Distribution Union ( NDU ) , which opposed social partnership , led to a formal debate on the conference floor .
As an official observer at the conference for my current union , I witnessed a rarely seen challenge to the top union leadership .
The case for partnership was made by PSA secretary Richard Wagstaff and Rosalie Webster , assistant secretary of the Engineering , Printing and Manufacturing Union ( EPMU ) .
A defensive Wagstaff conceded that “ partnership and engagement have been tainted words ” .
Webster admitted : “ It can create disillusionment with members when they see the union being pulled around by the nose by the boss . ”
Wagstaff gave the tri-partite forum on Auckland ’s health system as an example that partnership works .
But a nurse from North Shore Hospital stood up from the floor and said , “ I have been fortunate , or unfortunate , enough to be involved in the tri-partite forum .
The outcome has been very dismal so far . ”
NDU president Bill Anderson expressed the mood of many conference delegates .
“ Our union is opposed to the social partnership ” , he said .
“ Of course we have to have a relationship with the employer .
Is it a partnership ?
A partnership is a common interest .
When it comes to the employee and employer , it is a conflict relationship ...
The union movement grew up on the basis of struggle .
We used to be stronger when we struggled harder , and our future lies in the same direction . ”
Not a single delegate spoke in favour of partnership .
When the CTU president put a resolution reaffirming support for social partnership , it passed narrowly by a show of hands .
The forerunners of social partnership mentioned by Ross Wilson at the PSA biennial congress – the proposed Compact ( 1988 -90 ) , the Growth Agreement ( 1990 ) , “ Nissan Way ” ( from 1987 ) , “ Workplace New Zealand ” ( 1992 - 94 ) – never won majority backing inside the trade union movement .
Mainstream acceptance of social partnership over the last decade was made possible by four things .
Firstly , the election of the 1999 Labour - led government and the incorporation of the Alliance Party as a junior coalition partner .
This in turn helped to sideline the Business Roundtable , with its extreme free - market policies , and allowed the more pragmatic Business NZ to become the recognised voice for business .
Labour - aligned top union leaders could then overcome opposition to partnership with “ reasonable ” employers and with “ their ” government .
Finally , a decade of unusually strong economic growth allowed employers to make small concessions in the name of partnership .
Now that social partnership is entrenched , however , some union leaders are carrying it further .
Nurses Organisation chief executive Geoff Annals , for example , wrote on the election result in the December / January issue of the union ’s journal :
During the election campaign , the lack of policies from National fitting neatly into the ‘ right end ’ of the traditional ‘ right - left ’ political spectrum was assumed by many to be a strategy to dupe voters , fearful of any return to ‘ 90s policies ...
But perhaps what is happening in politics is more complex than that , and more hopeful ...
Political parties , and particularly the National Party , seem to be coming to understand that they must genuinely attempt to represent all New Zealanders , if they are to be in Government .
This belief in the possibility of union partnership not just with a Labour - led government in good economic times , but with today ’s National Party - led government too , shaped the CTU position going into the high - profile “ Jobs Summit ” called by Prime Minister John Key in February .
On the eve of the summit , CTU president Helen Kelly wrote in her column in the Dominion Post Business Day , “ This is a scary time to be a worker ...
It is also a scary time for many business owners .
Both groups have an interest in each other ’s survival through these unusual economic circumstances ...
The Council of Trade Unions does not object to support for businesses at this time ...
We are actively participating in the Government ’s programmes for economic stimulus . ”
The CTU discussion document , presented at the summit a few days later , called for a “ social consensus ” about measures to tackle the economic crisis .
“ It is not an opportunity to relitigate longer term policy settings ... Stabilisation policies should be reversible ” .
A centrifugal force
The problems with this union approach run deep .
As the lessons of the 1930s should tell us , the growing economic crisis now sweeping the globe will create a centrifugal political force which shatters any “ social consensus ” .
That decade saw the growth of right - wing extremism worldwide , and a corresponding wave of social revolts , militant trade unionism and growth of the radical left – including , in this country , the election of the most left - wing government New Zealand has yet seen .
No one – least of all those running the system – can claim to be able to reliably predict the future .
But whatever tactical moves a National - led government may be forced to take in the short term , in order to shore up support and prevent rapid economic collapse , the current crisis will almost certainly lead ( at the very least ) to irreversible changes in longer term policy settings lasting for decades to come .
Even the traditionally conservative International Trade Union Confederation , which the CTU belongs to , understands this .
Energised by the more advanced stage of the crisis overseas , its declaration to the G20 Summit in April vowed , “ there can be no return to ‘ business as usual . ”
Already , the National Party - led government has signalled its rightward direction .
The rushed passage of the 90 - day “ Sack - at - Will Bill ” has received a lot of coverage .
So have moves to undermine four weeks ’ holiday for all and time - and - half pay on statutory holidays , reductions in entitlements , tax cuts for top income earners , privatisation of prisons , removing the few restrictions on wealthy overseas investors buying up New Zealand assets and public service spending cuts .
Finance minister Bill English left no doubt about the irreversible nature of the spending cuts .
After telling TV3
News that the effects of the recession could last for 15 years , he said he ’d advised government department heads that “ restraint is permanent .
For the rest of their careers , there is n’t going to be more money or more people . ”
Other far - reaching policy changes , like strengthening the free - trade agenda and its international “ race to the bottom ” in pay and conditions , are promised in response to the economic crisis .
Signing a new free - trade deal in Thailand in March , foreign affairs minister Tim Groser said it “ sends the message ” that free trade , “ not protectionism , is the best way to bring us through the most serious international economic crisis we have faced since the Great Depression ” .
As NZ Herald commentator John Armstrong has observed , “ So the National Government is variously inching , shifting , drifting , veering or lurching to the right , depending on where you stand on the political spectrum .
Surprise , surprise ...
John Key may have portrayed himself as a moderate pragmatist in Opposition – indeed he is still doing exactly that as Prime Minister – but he is still the leader of a party , the fundamental ethos of which is firmly centre - right . ”
Employers who talked about saving jobs at the Jobs Summit are busy axing them at their own firms .
Warehouse founder and “ socially responsible ” business leader Stephen Tindall led one of the six discussion groups at the summit .
At the same time , his senior managers were finalising plans to lay off as many as 1000 workers .
Air NZ chief executive Rob Fyffe , who ’s slashing at least another 200 staff this year , led another group , while John Bongard of Fisher and Paykel ( which has shed 900 jobs in the last two years ) led a third .
Employer representatives at Business NZ , meanwhile , are pushing for drastic anti-union laws to shut unions out of workplaces and return to individual employment contracts .
How could it be otherwise ?
The economic crisis of 2009 is at root a crisis of business profitability .
Profit is the lifeblood of a market economy .
Without it , there is nothing to re-invest in the company , or to return to shareholders to attract their capital .
Many employers , like those at the Jobs Summit , understand that a widespread collapse in consumer spending through job losses and pay cuts threatens their livelihoods .
But to boost profits for their individual firm , they are driven by market imperatives to make these cuts themselves .
For parties of the market , like the National Party , reviving the economy means restoring business profitability .
In today ’s deep crisis , this means emergency measures to cushion consumer spending and prevent economic collapse .
But it also has to mean helping businesses to cut costs – including wage costs and tax payments – over the longer term .
When Sealord announced , less than a week after the Jobs Summit , that it was laying off 160 staff , Prime Minister John Key told TV3 ’s Sunrise , “ I think in the case of Sealord they ’re actually restructuring their business .
One thing we have to be realistic about is the recession will ultimately drive some of those changes , it ’s not to say we ’re not hugely sympathetic to those who have lost their job , we understand that there will be change ” .
The government ’s economic stimulus package – praised by pro-partnership union leaders – is being partly funded by borrowing .
It ’s fairly certain that the National Party government wo n’t repay this debt through higher taxes on companies and top income earners .
The burden is likely to fall , sooner or later , on working people .
The alternative – pouring all government efforts into protecting the people from the crisis – would weaken corporate power and undermine the central pillars of the market .
This is something that parties of the market can never do .
Just as worrying as the CTU ’s talk of ongoing partnership with the National Party government and employers is what is not being said by top union leaders .
So far , there is no discussion in the CTU about the kind of large - scale , cross-union campaign , which could ensure the burden of the economic crisis is not borne by workers .
In effect , by persevering with social partnership , the CTU is continuing to express a lack of confidence in independent union action and is pinning its hopes instead on action by the National - led government .
In return , as its discussion paper humbly promises , the CTU will help implement “ the more creative changes in a way that secures worker agreement to the changes and avoids the liabilities that unilateral changes can create ” .
The higher stakes of today ’s growing economic crisis are elevating this lack of top - level commitment to independent action into a major problem .
Undercurrents
Even during the current “ partnership decade ” , however , when unions have been formally committed to cooperation for “ business success ” , a number of unions have effectively managed to work around the policy and secure major gains in the teeth of employer and government opposition – beginning with the Nurses Organisation in 2002 - 3 .
In each case , it was the sudden entry of the mass of grassroots union members onto the political stage which delivered the victory .
Most of the time , the views of grassroots union members and activists are invisible , hidden away in conversations in the workplace tearoom .
While the views of union leaders are important – not least because of the influence they can have with members – they are often not wholly representative of the union movement .
Typically , these officials in full - time union positions are on salaries considerably higher than the average union member .
They are much closer to government and spend more time mixing with officials and employers .
Particularly at higher levels , they do n’t experience the same daily hassles with the boss .
And because their incomes come from membership fees , they are not directly affected by changes in the pay and conditions of members on the job .
They are the managers of sometimes sizeable union - owned assets .
Because of all this , full - time union officials tend towards conservatism – both maintaining necessary union organisation and expertise , but also shying away from radical action .
While the views of grassroots union members and activists are usually hidden , in times of change they can break through and lead unions in new directions .
When a union leader manages to connect with grassroots members and activists and express their mood for change , then union power is unleashed .
This is what happened in 2003 , when newly appointed Nurses Organisation strategist Laila Harré went directly to members in the union ’s first series of nationwide stopwork meetings in over a decade .
The meetings solidified the mood to fight for a NZ$ 300 million fair pay claim .
As a nurse from Hawkes Bay Regional Hospital put it in an interview with the forerunner to Unity journal , “ In the last few months we ’ve gone from ‘ no , we can ’t , we care for our patients too much ’ to ‘ sod you , who cares for us ? ’ ”
Business NZ chief executive Anne Knowles described the nurses ’ pay claim as “ completely unacceptable ” due to its “ flow - on effect ” for private sector pay .
Treasury advised , “ The Minister of Health has indicated to DHBs that the outcome of these negotiations must be met within their three - year Health Funding Paths . ”
But in 2004 nurses secured extra government funding and won their pay claim , without trade - offs .
Key to the victory was nurses ’ preparedness , built up over 18 months of active leadership and mounting grassroots campaigning , to take independent action .
As the nurses ’ union journal explained after a settlement was reached , “ members ’ determination to take strike action in support of the NZNO pay claim was crucial ” .
In 2005 , the EPMU spearheaded a cross-union push for big pay rises of five per cent and more .
EPMU national secretary Andrew Little , too , went directly to members in that union ’s first series of nationwide stopworks in over a decade .
His militant message met the grassroots mood .
A worker who attended the 1500 - strong Wellington meeting told Unity , “ I got a feeling of confidence from those around me .
I have n’t seen anything like it for 15 years . ”
Andrew Little described the meeting as “ unbelievable ” .
“ It was like a festival , with workers from one company getting together with workers from rival companies in a show of solidarity .
There ’s a new union movement emerging , and it ’s coming from the members themselves ” .
The surge of grassroots union power , oblivious to any official policy of “ social partnership ” , strengthened the whole union movement .
When Progressive Enterprises locked out 500 supermarket workers in 2006 , unionists had the confidence and organisation to rally round and help them win .
During the six - week struggle , an army of grassroots activists collected $ 250,000 and food donations to sustain the locked - out workers and their families .
Community boycotts of Progressive supermarkets were organised .
And crucially , groups of workers had the confidence to defy the anti-strike laws in the Labour Party government ’s Employment Relations
Act and take small - scale industrial action targeting Progressive ’s supply chains – with bigger action threatened .
A similar grassroots mobilisation defeated a shorter lockout of 800 hospital cleaners by Spotless Services in 2007 .
It ’s impossible to tell in advance how the slow - motion collision between the top - level commitment to partnership , and the mood of grassroots union members , will be resolved as the economic crisis deepens .
But collide they will , and not only through sudden and unexpected eruptions of grassroots anger and desperation at job losses or pay cuts .
It may be that union passivity and demoralisation win out , as they did in the early 1930s .
But there are hopeful signs to the contrary .
Speaking at a union forum in late March , Prime Minister John Key commented , “ It ’s an interesting thing when you come from being a Centre - Right government and you start saying , ‘ I ’m building great relationships with the Council of Trade Unions ’ ” .
He quickly added , “ I do n’t want to get Helen [ Kelly , the CTU president ] off side with her delegates . ”
Key knows that many trade unionists oppose “ social partnership ” with his government .
The opposition is being voiced by some union leaders .
In the March 2009 issue of the Service and Food Workers Union journal , for instance , national secretary John Ryall wrote : “ The Government is preaching inclusiveness but has already signalled its intent with its rush into pre-Christmas urgency of the 90 - day sack - at - will legislation for small workplaces ...
The National Government and the employers can’t have it both ways .
If they want a united front to deal with the economic crisis then they have to get rid of their anti-worker agenda . ”
But it ’s left to the general secretary of one of the smaller unions to say many of the things that really need to be said .
In the post-election issue of the Maritime Union journal , Trevor Hanson wrote :
The main goal of the new Government will be to ensure profit levels for employers are kept up .
Their stated commitment to public services and limited changes to employment laws will soon take second place to ensuring that big business and the wealthy elite are protected from the recession ...
Comparisons of the current crash to the great depression are being proliferated widely , but none of us were around to feel the effect .
I can recall my father telling me that as a boy in the Great Depression on the 1930s he had no shoes , and they used to follow the cows to school and warm their feet in the cow pats .
He also told us about coming home to a stew made of the family pet goat , and depending on trapped rabbits for food ...
Right now we have many financially stretched and in poor living conditions , and a resurgence in the kind of problems we see in recessions and depressions .
Thousands of New Zealanders have lost their life savings ...
It would be foolish for any Union movement to rely on a friendly government .
Unions must be in a position to fight effectively for their members and for the working class at all times regardless of the Government .
Ironically , the questioning of social partnership by union leaders is not just coming from traditionally left - wing unions like the Maritime Union , the National Distribution Union and Unite .
It is also coming from mainstream unions like the EPMU , which pushed for the policy in the first place .
In December 2008 EPMU national secretary Andrew Little wrote a strongly worded letter to the unions ’ “ social partner ” , Business NZ chief executive Phil O’Reilly :
[ Your ] briefing on employment relations is a disgrace in this day and age ...
The stance adopted by Business NZ in its recommendations to the government are deeply disappointing when , as an organisation , it stood out under the previous government as demonstrating a constructive approach to employment relations ...
It appears that this approach is now at an end ...
Business NZ has undergone an apparent reversion to type .
Radicals and activists
Despite these voices of opposition , however , no alternative policy for the union movement as a whole is yet visible .
A positive alternative is only likely to emerge out of mass struggles by grassroots members .
These mass struggles will begin small , in unforeseen places .
If this is the situation confronting radicals and union activists now , then our first task is clear .
We must continue to foster the conditions for small struggles to grow .
Activists should spread solidarity for unionists whenever they appeal for support during an industrial dispute – as we did during the lockouts of 2006 and 2007 .
The difference being that in today ’s economic turmoil , a small spark of determined resistance is more likely to ignite wider struggle .
Activists should also support grassroots political campaigns initiated by unions .
These can energise a broad movement extending beyond a particular workplace , industry or union in the absence of a rallying point around an industrial dispute .
The Unite union ’s national secretary Matt McCarten has proposed a petition for a citizens ’- initiated referendum on raising the minimum wage – first to $ 15 an hour and then to two - thirds of the average wage .
“ The economic crisis facing the world is the toxic product of insatiable greed at the top and the free - market policies of governments that removed all controls ” , he says .
“ Restoring the minimum wage would be an important step towards replacing the greed and inequality of the past three decades with policies that protect jobs by enhancing the purchasing power of those at the bottom of the economic ladder . ”
It ’s significant that Unite has gone it alone in initiating this petition , without waiting for the CTU to take it up .
The Maritime Union has pledged support .
But it will take all the help radical activists can deliver to gather the 300,000 petition signatures needed to trigger a referendum .
Radical activists also need to understand that in times like these , the best instinct of all grassroots people is to put aside differences and band together in self - defence .
So we must work cooperatively with people of all political persuasions who publicly advance unity to protect the people from the market crisis .
This will include trade union leaders from outside the traditional left , as well as Labour Party figures , and members and office holders in the Maori Party , the Greens , the Alliance and the Workers Party .
But even as we unite , we must also recognise that the Labour Party - aligned union leaders , who make up the dominant bloc , will only be able to take the struggle so far .
Chris Trotter has more inside knowledge and more loyalty when it comes to the Labour Party than any other commentator .
Even he bluntly describes the party in 2009 as “ at serious risk of imploding under the weight of its own extraordinary timidity ” .
But ties to the Labour Party wo n’t hold the movement back just because it is currently unable to mount any serious opposition to the National Party government .
The problem is deeper .
Labour loyalists in the unions ultimately can’t protect the people from the market because Labour , like the Nationals , is a party of the market .
So the second task for radical and union activists is equally clear .
The success and strength of unions in today ’s crisis is also linked to the creation of a political alternative dedicated to breaking the stranglehold of the market over New Zealand society .
Across the decades
What kind of political alternative ?
There are two main strategies on offer on the New Zealand radical left today .
On the one hand , some see the way forward as building a “ narrow party ” , made up exclusively of revolutionaries committed to the overthrow of capitalism .
Advocates of this approach establish their identity by denouncing trade union “ bureaucrats ” and left “ reformists ” belonging to other parties , more or less indiscriminately .
Others are pursuing a “ broad left ” strategy , creating a grassroots political movement embracing the tiny revolutionary forces as well as a wide range of others not ( yet ) convinced about the particular models of “ revolution ” they ’ve been presented with .
In the 1930s , the Communist Party of New Zealand tried both narrower and broader approaches .
Formed in 1921 , the CPNZ is the forerunner of Socialist Worker , the organisation which publishes the Unity journal .
It was a young party finding its feet when the Great Depression appeared on the horizon in the late 1920s .
At the same time , unbeknownst to communists Downunder , the Russian Revolution , which was their guiding light , was being strangled under the dictatorship of Joseph Stalin .
Not surprisingly , therefore , the CPNZ veered left and right .
From 1924 to 1926 it had even placed itself under the direction of the Communist Party of Australia ( CPA ) in a bid to stabilise its political orientation .
In the late 1920s , following examples overseas , the CPNZ attempted to build a Militant Minority Movement ( MMM ) as a cross-union grouping of militant trade unionists .
The party kept tight control over the MMM and proclaimed it an explicitly “ revolutionary ” organisation , with high expectations of union activists wanting to join .
The theory – seldom stated in public – was that the MMM could be used to create breakaway “ red unions ” , separate from the mainstream trade union movement .
In the same book which provides the opening quote for this article , social historian Bill Sutch described the CPNZ at this time as “ narrowly sectarian ” .
“ Trade union secretaries were regarded as ‘ reformist bureaucrats ’ . ”
Labour historian Bert Roth adds , “ The Communists at that time attacked Labour Party and Alliance [ of Labour ] [ trade union ] leaders indiscriminately as traitors , fakirs and social fascists . ”
“ [ The ] party expected unreasonable feats of militancy from their members .
Communist attempts to form a Militant Minority Movement on the British [ and Australian ] model met with little response , and the party virtually lost all influence in the trade unions at the very beginning of the depression . ”
The Communist Party strategy of bringing together activists to oppose the market on an exclusively revolutionary basis failed so comprehensively during the Great Depression that even its leading proponents drew the lesson .
According to Australian labour historian Stuart MacIntyre , CPA general secretary J.B. Miles concluded in 1934 that “ the Minority Movement was too narrow and sectarian ” .
But from 1931 , the CPNZ took a different approach – on the ground , if not always in the theories coming out of the central executive – when it helped to launch the Unemployed Workers Movement ( UWM ) .
By comparison with the Minority Movement , local UWM branches were not exclusively revolutionary – indeed the great bulk of their activists were Labour Party supporters .
This breadth of participation was possible because local CP activists – sometimes to the disquiet of party headquarters in Wellington – did not make it a point of honour to routinely denounce union leaders and other leftists .
Bill Sutch observed that the UWM is “ historically of great interest ” because of its “ mildness ” and its pluralism .
“ It contained ideas surviving from the earlier Socialist and Social Democratic Parties . ”
While it was “ looked on with suspicion ” , particularly by conservative union leaders who were shying away from radical action and presiding over declining union organisations , the UWM was seen as “ reasonable enough , and contained elements supported by the trade union [ leaders ] ” .
UWM activists in Auckland , in particular , actively sought opportunities to unite with local Labour leaders , independent leftists and trade union officials in common campaigns – like the 1934 Free Speech Campaign .
At its best , the UWM represented a broad left grassroots movement which met the needs , and matched the popular mood , of grassroots people .
Tens of thousands of the unemployed rallied round the UWM ’s banner .
It organised successful mass protests against the “ slave camps ” for unemployed men , forced the government to raise relief payments and “ gave the tiny Communist Party much more influence ” .
The CPNZ , agreed Roth , “ became the leading organisation in the field ” .
On the back of this movement , the Communist Party was able to rebuild support inside the trade unions after the late 1930s .
Socialist Worker is learning from the historical experience of the CPNZ , but drawing conclusions that our Communist forbears were unable to reach .
In the 1930s , the Labour Party was committed to preserving the “ intricate and delicate machinery ” ( as deputy leader Peter Fraser put it ) of a market in crisis .
But it was also a mass workers party .
This presented an historical obstacle to the creation of a mass broad left political party , opposed to the rule of the market , to activate and represent broad grassroots movements like the UWM .
At the same time , loyalty to Stalin ’s regime in Russia was eroding the CPNZ ’s socialism from within .
Socialist Worker , as a Marxist organisation , is also guided by theoretical insights of Karl Marx and fellow thinkers who followed .
“ The Communists ” , said Marx , “ have no interests separate and apart from those of the working class as a whole ” .
Like Marx , we oppose the narrow strategy of the sect , which “ sees the justification for its existence and its ‘ point of honour ’ – not in what it has in common with the class movement but in the particular shibboleth [ identifying mark ] which distinguishes it from it ” .
Seeing that Labour today is neither a mass party nor a workers party , Socialist Worker has embraced a broad left strategy to create a political alternative to the parties of the market .
In 2003 , Auckland Socialist Worker members were involved in setting up Residents Action Movement ( RAM ) as a political movement dedicated to grassroots campaigning and fielding candidates in local body elections .
Standing for the Auckland Regional Council in 2004 , RAM won 87,000 votes and one ARC seat .
In 2007 , standing for a wider range of seats , RAM polled 117,000 votes .
In 2008 , RAM went nationwide and initiated a broad , grassroots campaign to remove the goods and services tax from food .
The campaign attracted mass support – though sadly this was not reflected in our poor vote in the general election .
Dave Gibbons , the man who co-created Watchmen in 1986 with the writer Alan Moore , is in demand .
Interest in the world 's best graphic novel – described as the Citizen Kane of comic books – has been given a fresh boost by the appearance of a movie adaptation directed by Zack Snyder , and by Watching the Watchmen , Gibbons 's new book about its creation .
Gibbons also co-created Rogue Trooper for the comic 2000 AD , and in a 30 - year career , his credits include Superman , Batman , Doctor Who , Dan Dare and Green Lantern , to name but a few .
Time magazine called him " a genius – one of the major comic book artists of the 21st century , or the 20th , or really any other century you care to name " .
I joke with him about his superstar status , but he 's well aware of the limitations of his fame .
" I 've just got back from being a superstar at Comic - Con in San Diego , " he says .
" Then I went down the gaming end [ of the convention ] to sign something I 'd done for a games company , and people were walking right past and ignoring me .
" At a convention in Australia , I was talking to some of the voiceover people , who did the voices for anime and computer games .
They , in their field , were as much superstars as us , but we 'd never heard of them , and they 'd never heard of any of us .
So it 's quite a localised kind of fame , but it 's nice , because if I feel like being famous , I know where to go , and if I do n't , I just do n't go there ! "
Force for good
Gibbons is now using his fame to help raise the profile of what is , after all , one of the UK 's core creative industries : he 's promoting the Digital Artist 2009 awards , backed by Intel and Future Publishing .
Gibbons is a judge in the competition to find the digital artist of the year , and has contributed a masterclass video on how he uses digital media .
" There are 13 categories , but the thing that I 'm most excited about is called Intel Stars of Tomorrow .
There are two awards , one for people aged 16 and younger , and one for 17 - 25 .
The hardest thing [ for young graphic artists ] is to just to get the ball rolling , and it 's a way for young people to get their work seen , " says Gibbons .
" And if they 're lucky , exhibited . "
Traditionally , graphic artists crafted things by hand and were extremely fussy about pens , pencils , papers and so on , but Gibbons says : " I 'm known for being very enthusiastic about using technology .
A lot of the attraction is the way that it streamlines the process and takes a lot of the drudgery out of it .
" You can draw on different layers , move things around , scale them , rotate them … it becomes very fluid .
With lettering , you can input it on a keyboard , and then at the end of the day , rather than having to parcel up a lot of fragile artwork , you can send it electronically almost anywhere in the world , instantaneously .
It 's made it extremely simple to collaborate with people in other countries .
When I was doing Watchmen , the writer used to send me pages of script in a taxi at £ 50 a time ! "
Gibbons uses Photoshop software on his Mac , and Manga Studio , from Japan : " It 's tailor - made for doing comics : it 's got some wonderful drawing tools in it .
I use a Wacom Cintiq tablet , which has an LCD so you 're drawing on what you 're drawing , not looking away at a screen .
That 's my weapon of choice , now , for professional work .
You can get different nibs for the pens , with different degrees of resistance .
You can also swivel it round , and so on . "
I apologise in advance for asking Gibbons what he thinks of Comic Sans , a Microsoft typeface partly derived from his Watchmen lettering .
It was only intended for Microsoft 's cartoon dog , Rover .
However , as a free Windows 95 font , it has been used everywhere from product packaging to vehicles to official notices .
It 's the only thing that , temporarily , clouds his blokey geniality .
" It 's just a shame they could n't have used just the original font , because it 's a real mess .
I think it 's a particularly ugly letter form , " he says .
" The other thing that really bugs me that they 've used an upper case I with bars on it : it looks completely wrong to the comic eye .
And when you see store fronts done in it , it 's horrible .
" There are people who specialise in lettering , and I 've had my hand lettering made into a digital font .
I picked up a copy of the Dandy the other week , and I was amazed to see that it was completely lettered in my hand - lettering font .
It was quite a thrill , really , having been a Dandy reader years and years ago . "
Virtual library
One of the less obvious but very powerful effects of computers on graphic arts is that it provides vast amounts of reference material .
Growing up in England , Gibbons had been an avid reader of US comics – his grandad bought him his first Superman comic when he was seven – and was fascinated by things that were boringly ordinary to Americans but strange to him .
" When I first came to New York City , what I was thrilled about was not the Empire State Building , or the Statue of Liberty , it was the fireplugs in the street .
These things that Jack Kirby had drawn .
Or these cylindrical water towers on top of buildings that Steve Ditko's Spider - Man fights used to happen in and around .
So it 's always been this kind of exotic Babylon , " he told Time magazine .
He says : " One of the things you have to be able to do , as a comic strip artist , is to draw things repeatedly from a variety of angles , so you need references , and you find the best picture you can .
Nowadays you can go on the internet and find several million pictures of New York City , you can use Google Street View , you can use Google Earth and have a three - dimensional model of New York … to me , there 's an enhanced richness with comics , because artists can get their hands on reference and give it that texture that relates to reality . "
It shows how computers are now used throughout the cartoon 's process , from research and execution to delivery .
" The problem used to be that the people who knew how to do computer graphics were techies , and artists did n't know how to do computer graphics .
Now that is n't the case , " says Gibbons .
" Computers have become much more artist - friendly in terms of software , and artists have become much more familiar with computers in their everyday life .
So it is really turning into a tool that depends on the talent of the user , rather than the technological knowledge of the user .
" Now when I look back at my work , I can't always tell what I drew with what : your style overrides it .
If you 're using a computer as an artist and expressing your personal vision , I think your personal vision comes through . "
WASHINGTON , D.C. --
The Gallup - Healthways Well - Being Index reveals that currently 29.0 % of adult Americans who have health insurance get their coverage through the government , a percentage which has increased since early 2008 .
More than half of insured Americans ( 56.5 % ) rely on an employer - based program and another 13.3 % of the insured obtain their healthcare coverage through some other means , which includes purchasing it privately for themselves .
The percentage of insured American adults who report getting their insurance through a government program , including Medicaid , Medicare , or military / veterans ' coverage , has increased over the last year and a half , to an average of 29.3 % in 2009 from 27.5 % in 2008 .
While still a majority , the percentage of insured Americans who have health coverage through an employer or union has decreased to an average of 56.2 % in the first half of 2009 from the 2008 average of 57.9 % .
In June 2009 , 56.5 % said they were covered through their employer or union versus 58.9 % in January 2008 .
Currently , 29.0 % of insured Americans have coverage through a government program , compared to 26.5 % in January 2008 .
The 29.0 % with government insurance in June is the sum total of the 20.4 % of adults who have health insurance through Medicare , 4.7 % through Medicaid , and 3.9 % through military / veterans ' coverage .
The percent of insured who say their health insurance is through some other source has remained fairly steady -- averaging 13.1 % in 2009 and 13.5 % in 2008 .
These estimates are based on over 470,000 interviews , including approximately 26,000 per month with adults who have health insurance .
While the changes are small in absolute terms , they are statistically meaningful based on the large sample sizes .
Older Americans vs. Working - Age Population
As would be expected , insured Americans who are between the ages of 18 and 64 are much more likely than those 65 and older ( and thus eligible for Medicare ) to be covered through employer - based insurance .
In turn , older Americans are more likely than their younger counterparts to be covered through a government program .
In June , 77.2 % of those aged 65 and older report getting health insurance coverage through a government plan versus 15.0 % of those ages 18 to 64 .
The trend over time in the percentage of insured Americans aged 65 and older reporting they have health coverage through the government shows some fluctuation month to month , but no significant increase from year to year .
There has , however , been a measurable increase in the percentage of insured 18 - to 64 - year - olds who have health insurance through a government program , averaging 15.7 % in the first six months of 2009 versus 14.5 % in 2008 .
Bottom Line
Previous Gallup research has shown that the overall percentage of adult Americans without health insurance has edged upward over the last year and a half to 16.0 % in June 2009 from 14.8 % in January 2008 .
The current data suggest that many of those who have dropped out of the ranks of the insured had employer - based insurance , leaving a larger percentage of the insured pool covered by a government program .
Older Americans , as well as those between the ages of 18 and 64 , have become less likely to have employer - based health insurance on average in 2009 compared with 2008 .
At the same time , government health coverage in both age groups has been increasing , pushing the current total percentage of Americans aged 18 and older with health insurance through a government program to 29.0 % in June .
Survey Methods
For the Gallup - Healthways Well - Being Index , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day .
Monthly results comprise roughly 26,000 interviews .
For results based on these samples , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±1 percentage point .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

One of 12 Australians on board a small cruise ship robbed by pirates on the Amazon River says she is only now coming to terms with what happened .
Melbourne woman Christina Ibbotson , 60 , was on board MV Aqua when the boat was ransacked by pirates in Peru last week .
Speaking from Peru , Ms Ibbotson says for nearly half an hour she did not know if the other passengers had been killed or if they had been taken hostage .
" It was just a terrifying , terrifying experience , " she said .
Ms Ibbotson says the worst thing was not being told that there had been a similar attack on the same boat in the same place the week before .
She says the boat 's owner and the police have been slow to react and that tourism will suffer .
" I do n't know what measures they can put in place going forward , " she said .
" Having the boat shadowed by the military and guns and all sorts of things on board ... would make people confident . "
Ms Ibbotson says she is angry that passengers were not warned of the danger .
" We know that it 's causing consternation in Peru just by talking to people because they rely on tourism , " she said .
" The communique that we got just two hours ago from Aqua says they [ are ] very disappointed , they 're very sorry . "
The Department of Foreign Affairs says travellers should exercise a high degree of caution in Peru .
The New York City tabloids would n’t know what to make of the Anarchist Bookfair , which happened this past spring .
If the Post attended , its reporters would probably have been disappointed that there was no sign of bicycle bombers .
The Daily News would have been shocked that nobody plotted mass destruction for the next political convention .
These anarchists were mostly interested in reading books , attending lectures , and sometimes networking with activists involved in nonviolent dissent .
Unfortunately , everybody knows that harmony and civic involvement make bland newspaper copy .
But there was still hope for hell - raising because a group called The Bad Egg Collective planned to stage a protest .
They argued that the event betrayed the ideals of anarchism because the vendors sold their books for profit ; the lectures created a hierarchy between the speaker and the spectator ; and the format encouraged consumption over creativity .
In short , the Anarchist Bookfair was insufficiently anarchic .
To express his dissent , the leader of this group planned to bring a photocopier and pass out flyers .
This was something that I could scoop the tabloids on : anarchist in - fighting .
As I approached the book fair at Judson Memorial Church , friendly Trotskyites passed out pamphlets from the Partisan Defense Committee and Workers Vanguard about the fight to free Mumia Abu - Jamal from death row .
One woman invited me to participate in the upcoming protest in Philadelphia .
While I sympathized with the cause of a man who was framed for shooting a cop , the demonstration was planned for the first night of Passover , and I already had plans to attend my family ’s Seder .
Between my religious and familial loyalties , I found out early on that I would make a poor radical activist .
I picked up some newsletters and made a modest donation instead .
I entered the main hall where over forty vendors were proudly hawking subversive literature , but the protest was nowhere in sight .
Eventually , I found it on a corner , where there was a strange handmade wooden structure with a red cardboard sign that had “ COPY BOOKS HERE ! ” badly stenciled in black magic marker .
It looked like a lemonade stand from a left - wing Peanuts comic strip , but the contraption was more sophisticated than it appeared .
The wood was hand - cut with a rotary saw , and it held a digital camera pointed at a pane of glass that enclosed a book .
The copier worked by photographing the pages one by one and sending the images to a laptop computer .
Its inventor Andrew Cady estimated that he only paid about $ 15 for the materials .
He bought the wood , glass , and hinges at Home Depot , and he already owned the electronic equipment .
His friend Steve , who was standing next to him , managed to program the software that made it function while stoned the morning of the event .
It took about a week to conceptualize and build the machine , and it stood before the room as a work of shabby ingenuity .
( Andrew later told me that an inventor from Japan made one out of LEGO bricks .
You have to admire Japanese craftsmanship . )
In any event , one man was so impressed with Andrew ’s invention that he handed them his business card to shoot ideas off each other about spreading the technology .
I never expected the protest to have such a warm reception .
For hours , the two of them had taken books they wanted to read from vendors and digitized them onto CD - ROMs , and not once did anyone try to stop them .
Instead , they got free books and a potential business opportunity .
Something had to be done .
I thought that maybe the vendors never noticed the books being taken , and I offered to ask each vendor to photocopy one of their books to see how they responded .
My first stop was the stand of the publishing house Seven Stories Press , where I picked up the collection of repressed journalism Censored 2008 .
“ Excuse me .
Do you mind if I photocopy this book at that table at the corner ? ”
I asked an attractive twenty - something who was manning the booth .
“ Sure , ” she replied , as if I just asked her to borrow a pen .
“ We do n’t mind if it ’s you guys doing it . ”
I later found out that Seven Stories Press has four separate offices across three countries .
Its New York branch is located in Tribeca , one of New York ’s most expensive neighborhoods .
I was beginning to see Andy ’s point about anarchist - industrial - complex .
Keeping up radical bona - fides can be a matter of sound business policy .
In any event , I loved this particular journalism anthology , and I owned it on disc after about five minutes of photographing the pages .
I thanked her when I gave it back , and she thanked me for returning it .
She might have thought I would pull an Abbie Hoffman .
The next table was run by an anarchist collective called “ A New World in Our Hearts ” that runs direct action campaigns like urban gardening and food aid throughout Brooklyn .
It had a book about Mumia called Dead Blossoms that got me intrigued , and they also had no problem with my asking to copy it .
Still , it was one thing not to pay an international publishing house for a book and another to do the same thing with a charitable activist collective .
I offered them a donation when I returned it .
At Autonomedia ’s table , I picked up the book The Art of Free Cooperation , which appealed to my sense of irony .
Again , the vendor had no problem when I asked to digitize the book , and she added , “ We ’re anti-copyright .
It would be ridiculous of us to refuse you . ”
Everyone so far smiled as I calmly explained that I wanted to take the goods they were selling .
Of the vendors , only the saleswoman at AK Press looked even mildly annoyed by my request , but she grudgingly let me take the book Introduction to Anarchism .
It was a small soft - cover that was difficult not to bend while photocopying , and I tried my best not to damage it under the glass .
“ Do n’t worry , ” urged Steve from behind the machine .
“ It ’s already dead . ” I figured that I was probably too polite to be a proper anarchist , and I brought the book back in more or less the same condition in which I found it .
Concerned that this anarchist melee was not turning out according to plan , I decided to take matters into my own hands .
“ Photocopy your books here ! ” I belted out like a sideshow barker across the room , hoping that would cause more of a stir .
Nobody took offense or even responded , except for one girl who was interested in the offer .
“ Was that obnoxious ? ” I asked Andrew .
“ Yes , it was . ”
“ I guess that ’s part of the role of the journalist – to be obnoxious , ” I rationalized .
“ That ’s an unhappy way of looking at your profession , ” Andrew philosophized .
Maybe he was right .
I decided to take it easy for the rest of the demonstration .
I looked for more free books at Red Emma ’s Bookstore , which was visiting from Baltimore , but by then , the line for the machine had gotten too long .
I decided to quit while I was ahead , and I helped Andrew pass out fliers agitating against profit - making from radical literature .
“ Is n’t this crossing the line of my journalistic objectivity ? ” I worried .
“ Do n’t worry , ” he said .
“ It ’s gonzo . ”
To celebrate their work , his friend planned to buy falafels , and they got an extra one for me .
I came into the event hoping to cover revolution , but I was happy settling for CD - ROM books , new story ideas , and dinner .
As I was about to leave , one young woman looked appalled about the stand .
“ Wo n’t that machine bend the covers ? ” she complained , and the organizers of the protest shrugged .
She explained that it bothered her because she worked at the radical Lower East Side bookstore Bluestockings .
“ That ’s where we ’re going next , ” Andrew said defiantly .
She looked upset and angry before she quietly walked away .
That was about as heated as the protest got .

The deaths of no fewer than four people after being trampled by cows in the past two months has prompted Britain ’s main farming union to issue a warning about the dangers of provoking the normally docile animals .

Cows can become aggressive and charge , especially when calves are present and walkers are accompanied by dogs , said the National Farmers Union ( NFU ) .
The union and the Ramblers ’ Association both advise that walkers release dogs from their leads when passing through a field of cows .
“ The cattle are interested in the dog , not the walker , ” said Robert Sheasby , Rural Surveyor at the NFU .
“ As the cattle try to get the dog , there ’s a high chance they will get the walker too . ”
Britain has 7.5 million cows but in the past eight years there have only been 18 deaths involving cattle , including bulls whose dangers are well - known .
The current spate of attacks by cows began on the Pennine Hills on June 21 , when Liz Crowsley , a veterinary surgeon from Warrington , was crushed against a wall and then trampled underfoot while out walking with her two dogs .
On July 15 , another attack took place in Derbyshire , when Barry Pilgrim , a 65 - year old from the area , was trampled to death by a cow as his wife looked on .
Three days later , Anita Hinchey , a 63 - year - old , was walking her dog near Cardiff when a cow attacked her and trampled her to death .
The fourth fatal attack claimed the life of Harold Lee , a 75 - year - old farmer from Burtle in the West Country .
He was killed by his own herd , which may have been made nervous by the siren of a passing ambulance .
The risk is especially high in the spring when many of the calves are only a month or two old and the mothers are therefore especially protective , the NFU said .
“ It ’s to do with spring and autumn calving , ” said Sheasby .
“ In the autumn , cattle will be coming into winter housing but in spring you want them out grazing the grass . ”
Cow - charging incidents received extended coverage when former Home Secretary David Blunkett was attacked by one in June as his guide dog led him across a field in England ’s Peak District .
Blunkett broke a rib and was heavily bruised but survived .

The Tanzmeistersaal in the Mozart Residence Museum was full , and there was a keen sense of anticipation in the air .
After all , it is not every day you get to go to a premiere of pieces by Mozart - played on his own piano and in his own house .
Posthumous discoveries of works by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart are rare but not unknown .
And the two short pieces unveiled in Salzburg appear to be a " missing link " in the young composer 's development , according to Dr Ulrich Leisinger from the International Mozarteum Foundation .
The first piece to be performed was the Concerto in G ( molto allegro ) - probably the first movement of a harpsichord concerto written in 1763 or 1764 , when the composer was around eight years old .
Only the solo part of the harpsichord was written down .
' Wild leaps '
Researchers at the Mozarteum believe it forms an important link between the miniatures Mozart wrote as a very young child and the larger instrumental pieces he went on to compose later .
This was a young composer running riot to show what he was capable of
Dr Ulrich Leisinger
The Harvard professor Robert Levin says : " What the composer expects of the player in racing passagework , crossed hands and wild leaps is more than a bit crazy .
" I consider it quite credible that the movement was composed by the young Mozart , who wished to show in it everything he could do . "
There are anecdotes which suggest that Mozart began to compose concertos long before his first " official " piano concerto , K 175 , in 1773 .
The Salzburg court trumpeter and close friend of the Mozart family , Johann Andreas Schachtner , described being shown an inkblot - stained score of a part of concerto written by the young Mozart .
Mozart 's father , Leopold , had at first dismissed the piece - but then looked at it a little more closely .
" Look here , Mr Schachtner , " he said .
" See how everything is correct and regularly set - it is only useless because it is too difficult for anyone to play . "
Technically demanding
The young Wolfgang was not abashed .
" That 's why it is a concerto , " he said .
" You have to practise a long time before you can play the notes .
Here 's how to do it . "
The second piece , the Prelude in G major , is also technically demanding , but described by researchers as slightly more " refined " .
It was the " crazy " and virtuosic nature of the pieces that helped the researchers at the Mozarteum identify them as being by the young Mozart .
It is thought Mozart 's father Leopold transcribed the pieces
The works were part of " Nannerl 's Music Book " , a collection of music compiled by Leopold Mozart , in the archive of the International Mozarteum Foundation since 1864 .
They are written in Leopold 's handwriting - but Dr Leisinger believes he transcribed pieces his son played on the piano .
" This was a young composer running riot to show what he was capable of , " Dr Leisinger said .
" The piece does contain real technical mistakes and clumsy moments that an old hand like Leopold Mozart would never have made . "
The Austrian musician Florian Birsak played both pieces on Mozart 's fortepiano - and then a short orchestral version of the concerto was performed .
The missing orchestral accompaniment was written by Robert Levin , who specialises in historical performance .
There will be another performance of the pieces during Mozart Week 2010 in Salzburg .

One month after convicting him of arms dealing and funding and organizing the Karin A weapons ship , the Judea Military Court on Sunday handed down a 20 - year prison sentence to Fuad Shubaki , who was in charge of Palestinian Authority funds and considered late PA Chairman Yasser Arafat 's " right hand " .
Shubaki , 70 , was also sentenced to five years probation , as the court ruled that the security offenses he was found guilty of dictate that a harsher sentence despite his old age and his unstable health .
The prosecution had asked for a life sentence .
Shubaki was convicted of handling 1,000 tons of weapons in exchange for millions of dollars , funding the terror activities of the al - Aqsa Martyrs ' Brigades , and contacting a hostile element outside the region – meaning Iran
Even after his conviction , Shubaki continued to insist that he was innocent .
" I have been working from my first day to achieve peace between the Palestinians and Israelis and build neighborly relations , " he said after the verdict was delivered a month ago .
" I was responsible for a budget in the Palestinian security organization .
I have nothing to do with weapons .
I was responsible for salaries , clothes , fuel , cars and food for people working at the Palestinian Authority .
" I had nothing to do with this , " he claimed .
" Any document issued would be signed by the ' rais ' ( Arafat ) and we would just carry out orders .
I did n’t know it was an amount of 1,000 tons of weapons .
" I am on the side of peace supporters , " he said , adding that " I am from the gang of Abu Mazen ( Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ) .
I worked with him for 28 years . "
Shubaki also claimed that his medication condition was bad and that he wishes to return home to his six children , after eight years in jail .
He also hinted that he had helped Israel obtain information on terrorist elements .
The judges , however , we unimpressed by these claims .
Admits PA funded terror
Shubaki was first arrested by the Palestinian Authority at the United States ' request , and was held in a prison in Jericho together with the murderers of Israeli Minister Rehavam Ze'evi .
In March 2006 , the Israel Defense Forces raided the prison and arrested Shubaki and Ze'evi 's murderers , after receiving information that the PA planned to release them .
During his investigation , Subaki revealed to the Shin Bet a lot of information about the PA 's conduct under Arafat at the beginning of the al - Aqsa Intifada .
He admitted that the PA had funded cells which operated against Israel , using tax funds it received from the Jewish state .
Shubaki also said that Iran and Hezbollah were behind the Karin A weapons ship , in coordination with senior PA officials , and that several Palestinian officials had received funds to purchase weapons .
His trial was conducted for three years .
In the past year , he was included in the list of prisoners Hamas is demanding in exchange for the release of kidnapped IDF soldier Gilad Shalit
From Friday 's American Spectator online ...
The American people in their unimaginable kindness and trust voted for a pig in a poke in 2008 .
They wanted so much to believe Barack Obama was somehow better and different from other ultra-leftists that they simply took him on faith .
They ignored his anti-white writings in his books .
They ignored his quiet acceptance of hysterical anti-American diatribes by his minister , Jeremiah Wright .
We DID ?
Really ?
You mean CNN and MSNBC and Fox did NOT run Wright ’s nonsense over and over and over and over and over a year ago and , by association , try to tie him to Obama ?
And " pig in a poke ? "
I guess even you could n’t bring yourself to use " N****r in the woodpile , " eh , Ben ?
The American people ignored his total zero of an academic record as a student and teacher , his complete lack of scholarship when he was being touted as a scholar .
You mean , like being chosen as first African - American president of the Harvard Law Review ?
Yeah , howcum nobody ever mentioned THAT , Ben ?
Now , Americans are waking up to the truth that ObamaCare basically means that every time you are sick or injured , you will have a clerk from the Department of Motor Vehicles telling your doctor what he can and cannot do .
Gee , Ben ... you mean that clerk from the insurance company is gonna move to the DMV ?
These are perilous times .
Mrs. Hillary Clinton , our Secretary of State , has given Iran the go - ahead to have nuclear weapons , an unqualified betrayal of the nation .
Now , we face a devastating loss of freedom at home in health care .
It will be joined by controls on our lives to " protect us " from global warming , itself largely a fraud if believed to be caused by man .
Yes , Ben .
Hillary personally told Ouchmyweeniedad to go ahead and build nukes .
I do n’t recall WHEN that was or HOW she did it , but you say she did , so she must have .
And your global warming denial may someday be viewed with the same disgust as holocaust denial is now — I guess it all depends how many of us are ultimately killed by uncontrolled climate change .
Mr. Obama knows
Americans are getting wise and will stop him if he delays at all in taking away our freedoms .
There is his urgency and our opportunity .
Once freedom is lost , America is lost .
Wake up , beloved America .
Ben , you are n’t calling for armed revolution , are you ?
I mean , how ELSE are Americans going to " stop " a duly - elected president with popular support from doing the things WE VOTED FOR HIM TO DO ?
Elections .
They have consequences , Ben .
I know right wing neofascists such as you have shown yourself to be do n’t much CARE for the democratic process .
But I believe in it , Ben .
In fact , I plan to excerise my right to free choice as soon as I post this , and write a letter to Comcast telling them about your anti-freedom viewpoint and demanding that they refrain from using you as a spokesperson in the future .
Same goes for Visine and everywhere else your cherubic , innocent face is displayed .
ACTS 15 - WHAT WAS THE OBJECTIVE OF THE JERUSALEM COUNCIL ?
Acts 15 is one of the most misunderstood chapters in the Bible .
This passage of Scripture describes the decision of the Jerusalem Council regarding the admittance of Gentiles into the Messianic congregation ( Heb. qahal , Gr. ekklesia ) of Israel .
Many scholars use this chapter to claim that the Law given to Moses at Mount Sinai was nullified and no longer applicable to " New Covenant " Gentile believers .
The Encyclopædia Britannica reflects this erroneous conclusion , saying that the Jerusalem Council was " a conference of the Christian Apostles in Jerusalem in about AD 50 which decreed that Gentile Christians did not have to observe the Mosaic Law of the Jews " ( " Jerusalem , Council of " ) .
In this article we 're going to thoroughly examine the actual question brought before the Jerusalem Council by Paul and Barnabas , and the solution that James and the Jerusalem elders arrived at to resolve this issue .
Along the way , we 'll look closely at what the text of Acts 15 really says .
The 15th chapter of Acts starts by immediately identifying the problem :
ACTS 15:1
And certain men came down from Judea and taught the brethren , " Unless you are circumcised according to the custom [ ethei ] of Moses , you can not be saved . " ( NKJV )
We are told that some men came to the assembly of believers in Antioch , Syria from Judea and started teaching that circumcision " according to the custom of Moses " was a necessary part of salvation .
The word " custom " is translated from the Greek noun ethei ( lit. " custom , " " law " ) .
The root word ethos is sometimes used in the Bible to denote commands from the Law of Moses ( Luke 2:42 ; Acts 6:14 ; 21:21 ) .
Here is the circumcision command found in the Law of Moses :
LEVITICUS 12:1
Then the LORD spoke to Moses , saying , 2 " Speak to the children of Israel , saying : ' If a woman has conceived , and borne a male child , then she shall be unclean seven days ; as in the days of her customary impurity she shall be unclean .
3
And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised . ' " ( NKJV )
Instead of this command from the Law of Moses , the messianic Jews from Judea were apparently using the circumcision command for the Passover as the basis for their teaching :
EXODUS 12:43
And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron , " This is the ordinance of the Passover : No foreigner shall eat it .
44 But every man 's servant who is bought for money , when you have circumcised him , then he may eat it .
45 A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat it .
46 In one house it shall be eaten ; you shall not carry any of the flesh outside the house , nor shall you break one of its bones .
47 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it .
48 And when a stranger [ ger ] dwells with you and wants to keep the Passover to the LORD , let all his males be circumcised , and then let him come near and keep it ; and he shall be as a native of the land .
For no uncircumcised person shall eat it .
49
One law shall be for the native - born and for the stranger [ ger ] who dwells among you . "
( NKJV )
Yeshua was the fulfillment of the Passover ( I Cor. 5:7 ) .
Apparently , the position of these Jews was that a Gentile who wished to partake of Yeshua 's sacrifice was the same as a " stranger " ( Heb. ger ) who anciently dwelled among Israel and desired to observe the Passover .
Therefore , these Jews believed that in addition to baptism , adult Gentile males had to be circumcised before they could partake of the true Passover and become part of the covenant people , Israel .
Since uncircumcised Gentiles were a significant part of the Antioch congregation , this message clearly upset the members there .
ACTS 15:2
And when Paul and Barnabas had great dissension and debate with them , the brethren determined that Paul and Barnabas and some others of them should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders concerning this issue [ zetematos ] . ( NASU )
Paul and Barnabas , who were in Antioch at the time , did not agree with the teaching brought by these Messianic Jews .
They vigorously debated this view with the men from Judea .
Finally , the members of the congregation decided to send Paul , Barnabas , and others to Jerusalem to request the opinions of the apostles and elders on this matter .
The Greek noun zetematos , translated " issue " above , is SINGULAR .
This is important to recognize because it tells us that there was only ONE issue here – the necessity of circumcision for a Gentile to be saved and receive the covenant promises of Israel .
There were no other topics being debated .
It is vital to understand that obedience to the entirety of the Mosaic Law was NOT the issue in question at Antioch OR the issue ruled on by the Jerusalem Council !
This is a crucial point to comprehend if we are to truly grasp the reason for and the meaning of the decision rendered by James ( Acts 15:19 - 21 ) .
Later in this study we will examine the requirements established by the Jerusalem Council for the Gentiles that were accepting Yeshua and see where these requirements originated .
ACTS 15:3
So , being sent on their way by the church , they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria , describing the conversion of the Gentiles ; and they caused great joy to all the brethren .
( NKJV )
As Paul , Barnabas , and the others from Antioch made their way to Jerusalem , they recounted to the groups of believers they met in Phoenicia and Samaria how God was calling and converting Gentiles .
This was a source of great encouragement to these congregations .
ACTS 15:4
And when they had come to Jerusalem , they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders ; and they reported all things that God had done with them .
( NKJV )
Upon reaching Jerusalem , Paul and Barnabas reported all that God had done through them among the Gentiles to the apostles , elders , and the whole congregation ( at this point , there had not yet been an unscriptural division into " laity " and " clergy " ) .
They provided an explanation of the problem that had arisen in Antioch which had necessitated their appearance in Jerusalem .
ACTS 15:5
But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up , saying , " It is necessary [ dei ] to circumcise [ peritemnein ] them [ autous ] , and to command them [ paraggellein te ] to keep [ terein ] the [ ton ] Law [ nomon ] of Moses [ Mouseos ] . " ( NKJV )
Paul and Barnabas spoke to the assembly and laid out the matter at hand .
Afterward , some of the Pharisees in the congregation rose up to support the teaching about circumcision that had come to Antioch .
The translation above seems to indicate that the Pharisees were not only advocating circumcision , but also the keeping of the entire Law of Moses .
However , this impression is due to an inaccurate rendering of their statement from Greek into English .
Translating the Greek literally , the Pharisees said , " dei [ It is necessary ] peritemnein [ to circumcise ] autous [ them ] , paraggellein [ to instruct ] te [ and ] terein [ to keep ] ton [ the ] nomon [ Law ] Mouseos [ of Moses ] . "
What does the statement " It is necessary to circumcise them , to instruct and to keep the Law of Moses " mean ?
The key to understanding this assertion by the Pharisees is the little Greek particle te ( " and " ) .
This particle joins the Greek verbs paraggellein ( " to instruct " ) and terein ( " to keep " ) together .
The particle te is periphrastic in this verse ; that means it is used to connect two verbs that say what could be expressed by a single verb .
Therefore , the meaning of the Pharisees ' statement is that it was necessary to circumcise the Gentiles in order to instruct AND keep the Law of Moses .
The Pharisees believed that the act of circumcising the Gentiles would serve a dual purpose ; it would educate them on the Law of Moses at the same time they were obeying that Law .
ACTS 15:6
Now the apostles and elders came together to consider this matter .
7
And when there had been much dispute , Peter rose up and said to them : " Men and brethren , you know that a good while ago God chose among us , that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe . "
( NKJV )
Having had both sides of the issue presented to them , the apostles and church elders assembled together to discuss the matter .
Apparently both sides of the argument had supporters .
After a heated discussion , the apostle Peter stood up and began to relate how Gentiles had originally been brought into the church .
ACTS 15:8 " So God , who knows the heart , acknowledged them by giving them the Holy Spirit , just as He did to us , 9 and made no distinction between us and them , purifying their hearts by faith .
( NKJV )
We have to keep in mind that Peter 's point here is directly related to the issue at hand – circumcision .
Peter 's point was that God gave Cornelius and his house the Holy Spirit without requiring them to first be circumcised .
ACTS 15:10 " Now therefore , why do you test God by putting a yoke [ zugon ] on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able [ ischusamen ] to bear [ bastasai ] ? " ( NKJV )
By his question ( " why do you test God ? " ) ,
Peter rebuked those who wanted to require the circumcision of adult Gentile converts in order for them to become part of the covenant people of Israel .
Since the ONE issue being discussed here was circumcision ( NOT the entire Law of Moses ) , context requires us to understand that it was circumcision which Peter referred to as a " yoke . "
The word zugon ( " yoke " ) literally referred to a piece of wood that fastened on the neck of a beast of burden .
But here Peter uses it figuratively to refer to circumcision as something that was burdensome or difficult for the adult Gentile men to endure .
The final two Greek verbs in Peter 's statement , ischusamen bastasai ( " were able to bear " ) , are both in the aorist tense .
In Greek , the aorist tense in all of its moods represents the action denoted by it simply as a one - time event .
The verb ischusamen comes from the root ischuo .
The Theological Dictionary of the New Testament says that the primary meaning of this word is : " ' to be strong or powerful ' physically " ( p. 397 , vol. III ) .
Peter 's statement to the Council was intended to point out that the Pharisees were trying to lay a burden on the adult Gentiles that none of the Jews themselves would have been physically strong enough to endure .
The Tanakh alludes to how painful it was for an adult male to undergo the ritual of circumcision .
To illustrate this point , let 's look at the story of the rape of Jacob 's daughter Dinah by Shechem the Hivite .
After having sex with Dinah , Shechem and his father Hamor sought to persuade Jacob and her brothers to give her to him in marriage .
The brothers were angry about the situation , and concocted a plan to get revenge for their sister .
They told them that Dinah would marry Shechem if all their males consented to be circumcised .
Since he was captivated by Dinah , Shechem agreed .
He and his father then persuaded all the males in their city to be circumcised in order to be able to intermarry with the Israelites .
We 'll pick up the story in Genesis 34:24 :
GENESIS 34:24
And all who went out of the gate of his city heeded Hamor and Shechem his son ; every male was circumcised , all who went out of the gate of his city .
25 Now it came to pass on the third day , when they were in pain , that two of the sons of Jacob , Simeon and Levi , Dinah 's brothers , each took his sword and came boldly upon the city and killed all the males .
26 And they killed Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword , and took Dinah from Shechem 's house , and went out .
( NKJV )
From this story , it 's clear that adult circumcision was traumatic and debilitating to those who underwent the ritual .
Peter 's question in verse 10 is designed to cause the Jews advocating circumcision to put themselves in the Gentiles ' place .
Why should they put a physically burdensome " yoke " on the Gentiles that neither they nor their fathers had ever been required to bear ?
A better translation of Peter 's question into English is : " Now therefore , why do you test God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we would be strong enough to bear ? "
Adult circumcision was never required of the Jewish disciples of Yeshua because they had been circumcised on the eighth day after their birth in accordance with the Law of Moses ( Lev. 12:1 - 3 ) .
ACTS 15:11 " But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved in the same manner as they . "
( NKJV )
Peter ends up by affirming that circumcision is not what saves a believer , but rather the grace of God shown through Yeshua the Messiah .
This was an obvious rejection of the position put forth by the Jews who had gone to Antioch ( Acts 15:1 ) .
ACTS 15:12
Then all the multitude kept silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul declaring how many miracles and wonders God had worked through them among the Gentiles .
( NKJV )
Paul and Barnabas followed up Peter 's speech by listing the things God had done among the Gentiles through their ministry .
The point of mentioning these miracles and wonders was to show that God had accepted the Gentiles without requiring them to first be physically circumcised .
ACTS 15:13
And after they had become silent , James answered , saying , " Men and brethren , listen to me : 14 Simon has declared how God at the first visited the Gentiles to take out of them a people for His name .
15
And with this the words of the prophets agree , just as it is written : 16 ' After this I will return and will rebuild the tabernacle of David , which has fallen down ; I will rebuild its ruins , and I will set it up ; 17 so that the rest of mankind may seek the LORD , even all the Gentiles who are called by My name , says the LORD who does all these things . '
18 Known to God from eternity are all His works . " ( NKJV )
After Paul and Barnabas finished speaking , James the brother of Yeshua , the leading elder in the Jerusalem congregation , spoke to the group .
He confirmed the words of Peter , and then supported them with a quotation from the prophet Amos .
In verses 16 and 17 , James quotes Amos 9:11 - 12 from the Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Scriptures .
It 's interesting to note the context of the passage from Amos that James quotes .
Here is the entire prophecy :
AMOS 9:8 Behold , the eyes of the Lord God are upon the kingdom of sinners , and I will cut it off from the face of the earth ; only I will not utterly cut off the house of Jacob , saith the Lord.
9
For I will give commandment , and sift the House of Israel among all the Gentiles , as corn is sifted in a sieve , and yet a fragment shall not in any wise fall upon the earth .
10
All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword , who say , " Calamities shall certainly not draw near , nor come upon us . "
11
In that day I will raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen , and will rebuild the ruins of it , and will set up the parts thereof that have been broken down , and will build it up as in the ancient days : 12 that the remnant of men , and all the Gentiles upon whom my name is called , may earnestly seek me , saith the Lord who does all these things .
13 Behold , the days come , saith the Lord , when the harvest shall overtake the vintage , and the grapes shall ripen at seedtime ; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine , and all the hills shall be planted .
14 And I will turn the captivity of my people Israel , and they shall rebuild the ruined cities , and shall inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , and shall drink the wine from them ; and they shall form gardens , and eat the fruit of them .
15 And I will plant them on their land , and they shall no more be plucked up from the land which I have given them , saith the Lord God Almighty .
( Brenton's LXX )
This is clearly a messianic prophecy which speaks of the Kingdom of God being established in the Holy Land .
James ' use of this particular prophecy indicates that he very likely identified those Gentiles coming to faith in Yeshua as the members of the scattered House of Israel ( " Ephraim " ) mentioned in Amos 9:9 .
For more information on these " Gentiles , " see my article on the lost tribes of Israel .
ACTS 15:19 " Therefore I judge that we should not trouble those from among the Gentiles who are turning to God , 20 but that we write to them to abstain from things polluted by idols , from sexual immorality , from things strangled , and from blood .
( NKJV )
Here James announces his judgment on the matter under question .
Adult Gentile men would not be required to be circumcised .
However , James did expect that these Gentiles would abstain from four things in order to become part of messianic Israel :
(1) Eating food sacrificed to idols ;
(2) Sexual immorality ;
(3) Eating the meat of strangled animals ; and
(4) Eating blood .
This decision by James raises several questions in the mind of a modern reader .
Why did he choose these four particular requirements ?
Where did they come from ?
Was this all that Gentiles had to do ?
Or were these simply the beginning steps they had to take to enter into the congregation of Israel ?
The four requirements James bound upon the Gentiles are halakah based on commands found in the Mosaic Law .
In Hebrew , halakah literally means " the path one walks . "
Each of these commandments was based on ancient requirements found in the Law of Moses for a " stranger " ( Heb. ger ) who desired to live among the tribes of Israel .
In fact , all the original commands can be found in the 17th and 18th chapters of Leviticus .
In this matter , James defined the path that the Gentiles should walk in order to be accepted by the Jews .
James used a halakic interpretation of these commands from the Law of Moses regarding the ger to address how first - century Gentile " strangers " could be accepted into the assembly of Israel .
Let 's look at these four commands from the Torah and see how James interpreted them for the Gentiles of his day :
(1) The precursor requirement to abstain from things contaminated by idols is found in Leviticus 17:3 - 9 .
This command requires any ox , lamb or goat sacrificed by an Israelite or a ger to be brought to the door of the Tabernacle of Meeting .
The reason for this requirement was because these animals were being sacrificed to demons outside the camp instead of to God ( Lev. 17:7 ) .
Paul tells us that the sacrifices Gentiles made to idols were actually sacrifices to demons ( I Cor. 10:19 - 21 ) .
Therefore , James ' command based on Leviticus 17:3 - 9 was designed to remove this demonic influence from the lives of the Gentiles coming into the assembly of Israel .
(2) The command against sexual immorality comes from Leviticus 18:6 - 23 .
This passage is an extensive listing of forbidden sexual practices and relationships .
Included in this wide - ranging list are incest , homosexuality , adultery , and bestiality .
Leviticus 18:26 states that neither the Israelites nor any ger that dwelt among Israel should commit these abominable sins .
All of these were detestable practices that had made the Gentiles ( Heb. goyim ) unclean ( Lev. 18:24 ) .
(3) The commandment against eating animals that had been strangled was based on Leviticus 17:15 - 16 .
This passage states that Israelites or a ger living among them would become unclean by eating animals that had died naturally or had been killed by wild beasts ( cf. Lev 22:8 ) .
This command has its basis in the commandment against eating blood .
An animal that has been strangled ( or has died naturally or been killed by wild beasts ) has not had the blood properly drained from its body .
James proclaims that Gentiles coming into the church were to keep from becoming unclean by avoiding such things .
(4) The command to abstain from eating blood is found in Leviticus 17:10 - 14 ( as well as Gen. 9:4 ; Lev. 3:17 ; 7:26-27 ; 19:26 ; Deu. 12:16 , 23 ; 15:23 ) .
Neither the Israelites nor the ger dwelling with them were supposed to eat the blood of an animal , because the blood sustains the life of the flesh ( Gen. 9:4 ; Lev. 17:11 , 14 ; Deu. 12:23 ) .
So as we can see , all the underlying commands found in Leviticus 17 and 18 applied to the Israelites as well as the ger living with them .
James took these ancient commands from the Torah and built halakah upon them for the Gentiles coming into messianic Israel .
Since the entire Law of Moses was never the focus of this dispute , James ' judgment could not have abolished the Mosaic Law in favor of the four requirements he put forth for Gentiles .
If substitution had been his intention , he certainly left a lot of holes in his " replacement " law code .
He failed to cover murder , theft , and many other uncivilized actions prohibited by the Law of Moses and condemned in the New Testament .
Simple logic requires us to admit that James ' four requirements for the Gentiles were not all the laws they were expected to follow as believers in Yeshua the Messiah .
So why did James only address these four ?
He tells us in the next verse :
ACTS 15:21 " For Moses has had throughout many generations those who preach him in every city , being read in the synagogues every Sabbath . " ( NKJV )
What does the concluding statement by James mean ?
This declaration has been widely misunderstood by scholars because of a prevailing antinomian bias in interpretation .
However , if we keep in mind that James is explaining here the reason for his decision not to require circumcision of adult Gentile males , as well as the reason for the four commands he did bind upon the Gentiles , this verse begins to make sense .
With this statement , James answered the Pharisees ' earlier contention that it was necessary to circumcise the Gentiles in order " to instruct and to keep the Law of Moses " ( v. 5 ) .
Instead of immediate circumcision , he ruled that the same goal of instructing and keeping the Law of Moses could be achieved by the Gentiles attending Sabbath services in the synagogues .
James expected that after being accepted into the congregation of Israel by obeying these four minimal requirements , the Gentiles would attend synagogue services on the Sabbath and LEARN the Law of Moses .
If one was truly converted , with this familiarization would come OBEDIENCE .
The uncircumcised Gentiles would be taught the command of Leviticus 12:1 - 3 and would understand that it was required that they circumcise their male children on the eighth day in order to obey the Law .
The Pharisaic halakah regarding gerim ( the plural of ger ) becoming part of Israel required immediate circumcision of adult Gentile male converts .
James disagreed with this interpretation of the Law of Moses , however .
He concluded that God had accepted these Gentiles as they were , with only a spiritual circumcision of the heart .
So James ' halakic ruling regarding these gerim did not lay the burden of adult circumcision on them , but rather four other requirements based on the Law of Moses .
By observing these four commands , the Gentile gerim could be accepted into Israel and could attend Sabbath synagogue services with the Jews .
Yet despite his difference of opinion with the Pharisaic believers , James also thought that the circumcision command should ultimately be observed .
He believed this would happen as the Gentile converts grew in knowledge of the Law by attending synagogue services on the Sabbath .
Although a common misconception is that only Jews attended synagogues , the book of Acts clearly shows that Gentiles also went there ( Acts 13:14 - 32 ; 14:1 ; 17:1-4 , 10-12 , 17 ; 18:4 ) .
ACTS 15:22
Then it pleased the apostles and elders , with the whole church , to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas , namely , Judas who was also named Barsabas , and Silas , leading men among the brethren .
23
They wrote this letter by them :
The apostles , the elders , and the brethren , to the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch , Syria , and Cilicia : Greetings .
( NKJV )
James ' decision apparently was well accepted by the apostles , elders and the assembly .
They decided to write a letter explaining the decision and send it back to Antioch with Paul , Barnabas , and two men from the Jerusalem congregation , Judas and Silas .
ACTS 15:24
Since we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words , unsettling your souls , saying [ legontes ] , " You must be circumcised [ peritemnesthai ] and [ kai ] keep [ terein ] the [ ton ] Law [ nomon ] " – to whom we gave no such commandment – ( NKJV )
Here in the letter we have a restatement of the original problem ; some men went out from Jerusalem and preached that circumcision of adult Gentile men was needed to satisfy the Law of Moses .
We know that the men who came to Antioch specifically said , " Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses , you cannot be saved " ( Acts 15:1 ) .
There was no mention of keeping the entire Law of Moses in the original teaching brought by these men .
The Greek phrase legontes peritemnesthai kai terein ton nomon literally reads , " saying to be circumcised and so to keep the Law . "
The grammar in this verse shows that the last part of the phrase ( terein ton nomon - " to keep the Law " ) refers to a one time act – circumcision .
The Greek conjunction kai ( " and so " ) is used here to emphasize the result of the preceding action peritemnesthai ( " to be circumcised " ) .
For the Gentiles , " to be circumcised " would enable them " to keep the Law . "
The Jewish men who had come to Antioch were simply teaching that it was necessary to circumcise the adult Gentile men in order to conform to the Law of Moses .
One single issue from the Law , not the whole Law of Moses , was the subject .
ACTS 15:25
It seemed good to us , being assembled with one accord , to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul , 26 men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
27
We have therefore sent Judas and Silas , who will also report the same things by word of mouth .
( NKJV )
Here the letter identifies those who will be bringing the judgment to them , so they may verify that it was sent from Jerusalem .
Paul and Barnabas were one witness , Judas and Silas were the second witness , and the letter served as the third witness to the decision arrived at by the Jerusalem Council .
" By the mouth of two or three witnesses a matter shall be established " ( Deu . 19:15 ; Matt. 18:16 ; II Cor. 13:1 ) .
ACTS 15:28
For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit , and to us , to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things : 29 that you abstain from things offered to idols , from blood , from things strangled , and from sexual immorality .
If you keep yourselves from these , you will do well .
Farewell . ( NKJV )
This was the decision from James and the Jerusalem Council for the Gentiles in Antioch .
Since the assembly in Antioch clearly knew that the matter of adult circumcision was what prompted this letter , only the four requirements agreed upon by the apostles and elders were listed .
ACTS 15:30
So when they were sent off , they came to Antioch ; and when they had gathered the multitude together , they delivered the letter .
31 When they had read it , they rejoiced over its encouragement .
( NKJV )
The congregation in Antioch received the letter and rejoiced at the encouragement that the apostles and elders from Jerusalem had sent them .
All indications are that they agreed to abide by James ' instructions detailed in the letter .
Conclusion
The ONE issue being discussed by the Jerusalem Council was whether adult Gentile men had to be circumcised before they could become part of the congregation of messianic Israel .
Some Jews from Judea ( probably messianic Pharisees ) interpreted the Scriptures to say that they did , and these men went to Antioch to teach that requirement .
Meanwhile , Paul and Barnabas disagreed with this Pharisaic halakic ruling and went to Jerusalem to see what the consensus of the apostles and elders was regarding this matter .
After much discussion , including a speech against adult circumcision by the apostle Peter , James issued an overriding halakic decision that adult circumcision was NOT required of Gentiles .
However , he did lay down commands that they abstain from food polluted by idols , from sexual immorality , from eating strangled animals , and from eating blood .
These four requirements were not a replacement for the Mosaic Law , but rather guidelines on how Gentiles could be accepted into fellowship with Jews in the synagogues on the Sabbath .
It was here that James envisioned the Gentiles learning the Law of Moses with the intention of obeying it .

A US military helicopter launched an overnight attack on a group of what it believed were “ militants loading munitions into a van , ” killing five of them .
According to police in the rural district of the Kandahar Province , they were n’t militants , and those were n’t munitions .
Cucumbers are a fruit , not a munition
Instead , the Apache helicopter launched its attack on a group of farmers who were loading cucumbers they had grown into a van to be sent to a nearby bazaar .
Despite police confirming the van it hit was full of cucumbers , NATO maintained that those it killed were militants .
The attack is the second disputed incident of civilian killings in Kandahar Province in as many days .
The previous night , another helicopter launched an attack on a family ’s compound , killing four people , three of them children .
The family insists the four were sleeping at the time of the attack , NATO insists they were carrying “ plastic jugs ” and that it assumes they were planting roadside bombs .
NATO maintains the four were “ insurgents ” despite the young age of three of them .
The pair of incidents come as the new NATO chief is visiting the nation , and just a week after a UN report cautioned that the escalation of war in Afghanistan is taking a rising toll on the civilian population of the country .
With the US trying to convince farmers to switch crops to stem the rising opium exports from the nation , the fact that they ca n’t distinguish between cucumber and small arms is doubtless to make some farmers think twice .
Congressional Democrats are “ indignant ” about a top - secret post - 9/11 CIA program to kill al Qaida operatives , said Mark Theissen in National Review Online , because they were not fully briefed on it .
“ Excuse me , but this is the Democrats ’ idea of a scandal ? ”
Most Americans would “ not only expect but demand ” that we kill al Qaida ’s leaders .
And the leaking of this now - canceled program is probably why they were n’t informed in the first place .
Dick Cheney ordered the program hidden from Congress because it “ pushed the limits of legality , ” said Chris McGreal in Britain ’s The Guardian , by “ planning to assassinate al Qaida operatives in friendly countries without the knowledge of their governments . ”
But even that would n’t be too controversial — there have been many killings and detentions since 9/11 , and President Obama has even stepped up unmanned Predator aerial killings
Roaming CIA hit squads make a good story , but ex-CIA officials point to a “ somewhat less dramatic ” possibility , said Bobby Ghosh in Time :
The program involved domestic surveillance .
Spying on Americans falls way “ outside the CIA ’s purview , ” and it would be controversial enough to explain CIA chief Leon Panetta ’s quick cancellation , and Cheney ’s order for it to be “ kept under wraps . ”
Leaving aside the politics , morality , and specific legality of whatever program was in the works , said Mark Daniels in The Moderate Voice , under what authority did Cheney order its “ cover - up ” ?
If I read the Constitution correctly , so long as the president is not incapacitated , the vice president “ possesses no executive ( or operational ) authority . ”

A second appearance for the Duke of Burgundy could become more common
One of the UK 's rarest butterflies has produced a second brood in what conservationists are describing as an extremely rare event .
A second generation of the endangered Duke of Burgundy butterfly has now been spotted in Gloucestershire - the furthest north recorded so far .
Normally the butterfly produces one generation a year , taking to the wing in late April .
But a second brood has been recorded in August in Gloucestershire .
The National Trust said this second generation , documented at Rodborough Common , was highly unexpected .
" I 'd never expected to see this , " said the National Trust 's conservation adviser Matthew Oates .

More from Today programme " I 've been butterflying for over 40 years .
Butterflies push limits , they really do ... this is a really significant moment for one of the Duke of Burgundy strongholds . "
While in more southern areas of its range in Europe , the Duke of Burgundy produces a second brood in late summer , in the UK it usually has only one generation each year .
But the spring flight of the butterfly has been occurring increasingly early over the past 20 years , says the National Trust .
Sharp decline Warmer weather has spurred caterpillars to develop into pupae and produce a second brood within weeks rather than emerging the following spring .
A warming climate , which could be behind the earlier emergence of the Duke of Burgundy , may make a second appearance of the butterfly a more common event in the future .
Nearly half the 60 species of butterfly once common throughout the British Isles are on the charity Butterfly Conservation 's endangered list .
Five have become extinct .
The charity says it is currently most concerned about the Duke of Burgundy , which is characterised by its chequered orange and brown wings .
Butterfly Conservation has reported a sharp decline in its numbers of nearly 60 % in the last decade .
" There are probably just 100 sites in the UK where you can find this butterfly , " said Sam Ellis , head of regions for Butterfly Conservation .
" Most of these are located in the southern chalk downlands of Southern England .
" But they have suffered worrying declines largely down to loss of their habitats , particularly flower rich grasslands and woodlands where the insects thrive .
Many of those have been lost to intensive agriculture , modern forestry and urban sprawl . "

Gareth Anderson is critically ill after his liver failed A critically ill teenager being treated for liver failure after binge drinking left his hospital bed and went to the pub for a drink , it has been confirmed .
The father of Gareth Anderson , 19 , is fighting to overturn NHS rules which mean his son has to be alcohol free for six months before a liver transplant .
But at the same time , a publican confirmed Gareth went to her pub last Wednesday looking for a pint .
He was still in his slippers and with the needle from a drip in his hand .
Staff in the Old Moat Inn opposite the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald refused his order , alerted hospital staff who took him back .
The teenager from Newtownards , County Down , was transferred to Kings College Hospital in London on Friday and doctors have told his father , Brian , he may have as little as two weeks to live .
Mr Anderson Snr told the Press Association : " I do n't know what he was thinking about , I do n't think he knows .
" He said ' I do n't know why I did it , I just walked out and walked across to the pub ' . "
Mr Anderson
Snr said his son first told him he had a coke , but when pressed admitted trying to order alcohol first .
" I said ' What were you thinking about son ' and he said ' I do n't know , I just do n't know ' . "
Mr Anderson said he was trying to get his son psychiatric help .
" I do n't know what is going on in his head , he needs mental help as well . "
Old Moat Inn manager Lorraine McMillan said :
" He walked into the bar on Wednesday and the staff immediately recognised he was from the hospital - he had a needle in his hand , was wearing slippers and was still wearing his hospital name band .
" He was very young and did n't look very well .
He asked for a pint or possibly a vodka .
He was refused a drink and he said that was OK he would take a coke .
" I contacted the hospital and one of the staff walked him over and he was met at the door . "
Legal action
The incident last week came before Mr Anderson finally told his son that he could be dead in a couple of weeks unless he got a liver transplant .
He has since sworn never to drink again .
Gareth suffered acute liver failure earlier this month after drinking 30 cans of lager on a weekend binge - drinking session and had to be rushed to hospital .
Although it is common medical practice in the UK to insist that liver patients whose conditions are linked to alcohol abuse go without a drink for six months before going on the transplant waiting list , it is only a guideline and not a formal rule .
Mr Anderson insists the policy should apply to older patients with chronic alcoholism , not a teenager who has never before needed medical treatment for a drink related illness .
He plans legal action to get the rule overturned .
He was expected to launch a judicial review in the High Court in Belfast this week , but may now have to take action in London following his son's transfer to King 's College Hospital .

Councils , police and the intelligence services asked more than 500,000 times for approval to access private email and phone data , official figures revealed .
The total number of requests - including 1,500 from local councils - were approved .
Each one allows public authorities access to communications data - which includes records of phone , email and text messages - but not their content .
The figures were published in the annual report of the Interception of Communications Commissioner , Sir Paul Kennedy .
It showed 504,073 requests for communication data were made last year , or nearly 10,000 every week .
Although slightly down on last year , the total is up more than 40 % on two years ago .
Over the last three years , 1.2 million requests were made - the equivalent of one for every 31 adults in the UK .
Last year details handed over contained nearly 600 errors .
Of course , the information is not released in an easily accessible form - so we 've gone through each annual report and extracted the key data .
That makes this the only place in Britain you can get these numbers .

There is something troubling when the theme of recovery is never tied to U.S employment .
The American worker is suffering .
This has not changed .
The solace being offered is that less people are being fired .
I suppose the 26 million American workers who are unemployed or underemployed might find some comfort in the jobless recovery talk .
Yet this recession is making it particularly hard for people to find work .
That is why we are seeing a spike in bankruptcy rates that rival those of 2005 when people rushed to file before more stringent guidelines were imposed .
Even with the banking friendly rules , you can only squeeze so much out of someone who has nothing left .
If you want to see the actual pain for those at the lowest rung of the economic ladder , all you need to do is look at the massive spike in people receiving food stamps :
This is off the charts here .
We can look at two previous peaks to see how bad this in proportion to the population :
1981 : Food stamp participation at 21 million
Population ( 229 million )
9 percent of total population on food stamps
1994 : Food stamp participation at 27 million
Population ( 263 million )
10 percent of total population on food stamps
2009 : Food stamp participation 34 million
Population ( 307 million )
11 percent of total population on food stamps
I adjusted the figures to account for population and by far , this is the highest rate of people on food stamps in the last 30 years .
And the spike is amazing if you look at the above chart .
We went from 28.4 million in May of 2008 to 34.4 million in May of 2009 .
6 million people have been added to the food stamp program in the matter of one year .
And if you think people receiving this assistance are making big bucks , the average monthly benefit comes in at $ 101 per person .
And if you think these are average Americans ( i.e. , those making $ 50,000 a year who are struggling as well ) think again :
The program itself is no longer called food stamps but is now labeled as SNAP ( Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ) .
Bottom line however is that many people are struggling in this economy and those with lower incomes and the middle class are being squeezed the hardest .
With that as the economic back drop , let us now look at the overall employment situation :
Chart 1 – Sectors of Employment
These are illuminating charts from the Atlanta Federal Reserve .
We already know that since December of 2007 , the economy has shed nearly 7 million jobs by official standards .
But if you look at which sectors have been hit the hardest , you can see why the middle class is being hurt .
The biggest hit sectors are manufacturing , construction , and services .
Now we need to remember that the manufacturing sector has been decimated over the last 40 years so these jobs being lost are in light of the already deep cuts .
Construction employment has fallen with the housing bubble imploding .
In the past , we would usually have construction and housing lead us out of recession but this recession was caused by housing and massive amounts of debt .
Plus , we have $ 3 trillion in commercial real estate debt and plenty of empty vacant space for years to come .
These jobs were better paying positions .
If you look on the chart above , the only 2 sectors that had any hiring in 2009 on an overall basis to show up on the chart are the government and services .
This is not where you want to see job growth .
Chart 2 – Manufacturing
At a certain point we are going to need to realize that having some semblance of a manufacturing base is going to be important for the vitality of our country .
People may not even realize that we have the same number of people employed in manufacturing as we did back in the 1940s not adjusting for population growth !
These are typically better paying jobs and the pattern is abundantly clear .
The employment picture looks grim if we do n’t stabilize some of these markets .
Chart 3 – Unemployment and Participation Rate
We are starring at unemployment rates and labor force participation rates that have not been seen in 30 years .
What is troubling regarding this recession is how deep and how quick it is moving .
What is even more disturbing is the new structural changes that are occurring .
For example , we may not see the fabled 4 to 5 percent ideal unemployment rate for another decade .
What industry is going to pick up this massive slack ?
This is one thing that escapes many .
We went from a technology bubble to a housing bubble .
This has preoccupied our nation for 20 years .
Is there any other bubble to create massive amounts of employment ?
I just do n’t see it occurring in the short - run .
I ’m looking at indicators like the food stamp participation rate , U - 6 employment measures , and following the $ 3 trillion in commercial real estate debt outstanding .
This will give us a better sense of when true recovery occurs and not just a bailout for Wall Street rallying on the subsidies of the American taxpayer .
Chart 4 – Part - time for Economic Reasons
Never have we seen this many Americans working part - time for economic reasons .
In this way , we are becoming like Japan since they have a high part - time employment base .
No security , no benefits , and no stability .
Some 8.8 million fall in this category .
This pattern is troubling because Japan saw similar impacts once their Heisei bubble burst and caused two ( going on three ) lost decades .
They kept zombie banks alive while bleeding the real employment sector dry .
They report low overall unemployment rates but those working part - time make up nearly a third of their entire workforce .
We are seeing similar patterns with commercial real estate debt just sitting hidden and the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve buying up questionable assets in exchange for U.S. Treasuries .
Now this issue is going to carry a lot of weight especially with the current healthcare debate .
Part - time employment growth is not exactly something you want to see .
Chart 5 – Less Layoffs but Few Hiring
Chart 5 probably summarizes our current position best .
As you can see , the layoff trend is heading lower but the hiring trend is also at a low level .
In fact , according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve Board for June of 2009 the hiring rate came in at a record low of 2.9 % !
This is the lowest on record since data started being measured back in December of 2000 .
Now just think about what the above chart signifies .
If people are n’t hiring and people are still letting people go , is this actually a good sign ?
That is why it is premature to say things are getting better .
The jobs that were lost were good paying jobs .
Many will never return .
So what industry is going to make up that gap ?
If there is no industry , then our economy is going to have to adjust .
Sure the S&P 500 is up by 50 percent but this is n’t based on solid earnings .
If we look at more realistic indicators of our economy , the recession is still deep and painful and shows no signs of improving , just getting worse at a slower pace .

How well should people know each other before they have sex ?
In the biggest classroom at UC Santa Barbara , sociology professors John and Janice Baldwin are reeling off survey results showing that male and female students are almost equally willing to sleep with someone they love .
But the hall erupts in knowing laughter as a gender gap emerges :
Men , the long - married couple reports , remain eager for sex through descending categories of friendship and casual acquaintance .
Women do n’t .
By the time Janice Baldwin gets to the statistic on sex between strangers , the din from the 600 students is so loud , they can hardly hear her announce that 37 % of men would have sex with a person they had just met , compared with only 7 % of women .
“ So you can see , males are a little more likely to go to bed with somebody they do n’t know very well , ” Baldwin says dryly .

“ Or at all , ” she adds , to guffaws .
By turns humorous and deadly serious , “ Sociology of Human Sexuality ” has been an institution at the beach - side campus for more than two decades .
So have the Baldwins , unflappable sixtysomethings who are trusted voices on love and lovemaking for thousands of current and former UC Santa Barbara students .
Today ’s undergraduates have easy access to X - rated Internet sites , and many have watched television gurus dissect troubled marriages .
But there are often gaps in their knowledge of biology and sexual behavior , the result of squeamish parents and less - than - candid high school health teachers .
The Baldwins step in with data about orgasm , birth control and infertility -- and , implicitly , with their own example of a 41 - year marriage that seems to work well .

“ We do n’t feel we are the sex king and queen of the world , ” Janice Baldwin , 63 , said recently in the cramped office the couple share , their desks touching .
“ So this is not about us .
It ’s about the students , and we are privileged to get to teach a class that can help them avoid the downsides of sex and increase the positives . ”
John Baldwin , 68 , said he and his wife do not aim to be role models .
“ We are not trying to teach them to be like us , ” he said .
“ But we are going to be talking about relationships , and a lot of them want relationships .
Even though there is a lot of casual sex , they want to find somebody special . . .
So we are little hope signals . ”
Students say the class is fun , eye - opening and altogether useful .
Clearly , many of them pay attention : Lectures on sexually transmitted infections can trigger a stampede to the campus health center .
Adam Milholland , 21 , a geography major from Lompoc , Calif. , said his high school health class stressed abstinence .
So he appreciates the candor and scope of the Baldwins ’ course .
“ This class teaches you stuff that is important to your life , ” he said .

The couple ’s aura of nonjudgmental experience helps .
“ It ’s kind of cool to have teachers who know what they ’re talking about and who have been through it , ” Milholland said .
“ They ’ve probably had their problems , but they ’re still happy together .
You can tell by how they interact with each other and support each other . ”
“ Sociology of Human Sexuality ” is among the longest - running and most popular classes ever at UC Santa Barbara , according to the registrar .
The couple have received various honors , most recently in 2003 , when John Baldwin was given the campus award for distinguished teaching ; the citation noted his sensitivity in a field that could be a “ minefield for the careless . ”
( His wife , a senior part - time lecturer , could not share the award , which is for tenured and tenure - track faculty only . )
Both Baldwins grew up in Ohio families that avoided talking about sex .
Janice ’s mother never told her about menstruation .
John ’s early sex education consisted of his father holding him up to a garage window to watch two dogs mate .
John started at Johns Hopkins University as a pre-med undergraduate and stayed for a doctorate in sociology .
Janice earned a bachelor ’s degree at Ohio State University and , much later , a sociology doctorate from UC Santa Barbara .
They met on a blind date in Florida , where he was doing research and she was attending summer school .

After marrying , they traveled for several years in the jungles of Latin America while he researched the behavior of squirrel monkeys .
There , they witnessed the human suffering caused by overpopulation and lack of birth control .
The experience influenced Janice to volunteer for Planned Parenthood when they returned to Santa Barbara in the early ‘ 70s .
John Baldwin worked his way up the UC academic ladder to full professor of sociology .
When a sexuality course taught by graduate students was about to end , the couple picked up the torch , diving into research that concentrated on human , not monkey , behavior .
Martha Kempner , communications vice president of the nonprofit Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States , said many colleges offer similar courses , but she knew of no other taught by a married couple .
“ Having role models is a really interesting addition , ” Kempner said .

Slim and athletic - looking , the Baldwins often wear jeans and boots to class .
Standing on opposite sides of the stage during their three - times - a - week lectures , they take charge of the campus ’ enormous Campbell Hall like cheery radio announcers .
As large screens display New Yorker magazine cartoons about love alongside scientific charts about birth control , the pair speak without notes , often alternating sentence by sentence .
Occasionally , they converge at center stage for role play .
In a class about the life cycles of romance , they impersonate a young couple in an awkward first meeting .
“ Hey , are n’t you in my history class ? ”
John says , using a trite pickup line that resonates with his audience .
Advertisement
As the discussion turns to keeping love alive after infatuation fades , the professors demonstrate exercises in compliments .
Janice tells
John how kind and caring he is , and the class lets out a collective “ Aaawww . ”
They also act out the kind of bickering they urge couples to avoid , with Janice telling John she is “ so sick ” of him wearing the same jeans .
Students say they watch for signs of actual discord .
If the Baldwins cut each other off , there are worried whispers about a possible tiff .
“ They do skits onstage and do little flirty things , so you can obviously tell they have a good relationship .
But there is still some kind of mystery behind them , ” said Serena Winters , 20 , a communications major from Huntington Beach who leads study sessions for the class .
The Baldwins are tight - lipped about their own lives , except to say that they have no children , were never married to anyone else and spend their free time hiking .
They say it is fine for students to abstain from sex , but they also give off the vibe of supportive parents who think it ’s all right for young people to be sexually active as long as they keep it safe .

When students express public -- or more often , private -- befuddlement about anatomy and arousal , John Baldwin , unperturbed , hands out pertinent illustrations the way a geology teacher might distribute seismic fault maps .
He and his wife have noted that as newlyweds , they too were uncertain about the proper names and locations of some key parts .
Although their introductory classes are too large to allow much give - and - take with students , the Baldwins hold smaller sections for advanced students , including one this spring with just 16 in a small conference room .
There , the couple led students through topics from assigned readings , including the effect of testosterone on male violence and the popularity of cosmetic surgery .
The professors acted as moderators , engaging students in a lively discussion on the morality of outing closeted gay politicians and celebrities .
Advertisement
“ When is it right ? ” John Baldwin asked .
“ When is it an invasion of privacy ? ”
The professors are careful to handle controversial topics such as abortion and birth control in an even - handed manner , even though fliers about emergency contraception and referrals to Planned Parenthood are posted on their office walls .
Over the years , a handful of students have complained to administrators about topics they found offensive , such as oral sex , but no material has been dropped .
Many topics in the course demand forthrightness as well as sensitivity .
In a lecture about abortion dating to ancient Greece , the Baldwins advised students to look away if images were too upsetting .
The screens showed photos of aborted fetuses and of the bodies of women who died after botched illegal abortions .
The topic that seems to upset students most , the Baldwins say , is parental sex .
Year after year , the class breaks into groans at images of mature couples in nude embraces .
Advertisement
“ They . . do n’t like to think about their parents having sex , ” Janice Baldwin said .
A public website linked to the course , www.SexInfoOnLine.com, is explicit but not prurient .
It answers such questions as “ Is masturbation dangerous ? ” ( Answer : No. ) and provides information about emergency contraception , along with 50 ideas for great dates .

The Baldwins ’ periodic surveys of undergraduates ’ sex lives generate lively discussions -- and perhaps relief for the celibate at a campus that Playboy magazine often ranks high on its list of top party schools .
Advertisement
In the couple ’s most recent survey , from 2007 , about 75 % of respondents said they had engaged in vaginal intercourse .
The rest said they were virgins by that definition , although some had had oral sex .
The survey also found that promiscuity on the campus peaked in the late ‘ 80s , before awareness of AIDS .
In 1988 , 38 % of the school ’s sexually active undergraduates said they had had at least one sexual encounter with a person they had known one day or less ; by 2007 , that figure had dropped to 26 % .
Professor Maria Charles , vice chair of UC Santa Barbara ’s sociology department , said she took the Baldwins ’ class as an undergraduate and is not surprised that enrollment remains high .
“ It ’s very research - based .
It ’s not their personal opinions and value judgments , ” Charles said .
Yet , she added , students are drawn to the Baldwins as parental figures who speak about sex in the context of “ a healthy , loving relationship . ”
Advertisement
That may explain why the couple , who say they have no thoughts of retirement , keep receiving the ultimate compliment from former students : invitations to weddings .
“ We try to transmit an ethos of non-embarrassment , and I think students have felt comfortable around us for a long time , which is nice , ” John Baldwin said .
“ They keep us young . ”

Just hours before Global Gaming Factory ( GGF ) is scheduled to acquire The Pirate Bay , the company says it has lost several investors due to all the media controversy surrounding the deal .
Meanwhile the equity marketplace Aktietorget suspended trading in GGF 's stock until further notice .
From the moment it was announced , the Pirate Bay acquisition has been surrounded by controversy .
According to an announcement made by the intended buyer , this has caused several investors to pull out of the deal .
Despite all the negative media coverage , GGF CEO Hans Pandeya is confident that the deal will go through .
The investors that are left are existing shareholders of GGF and their names are not published but known by the company ’s management .
The equity marketplace Aktietorget meanwhile claims it has still not been provided with evidence showing the funding for the acquisition is in place , and has decided to extend the shut down in trading of GGF ’s stock .
Today , GGF ’s shareholders will discuss the buyout of the Pirate Bay and the plans for the site , before they give the green light or decide to vote against it .
After the shareholders meeting GGF will host a press - conference to discuss the outcome and inform the public on what steps they will take next .
GGF CEO Hans Pandeya told TorrentFreak that they have been working on a new deal with at least one other major BitTorrent site .
However , it will be difficult enough to successfully convert The Pirate Bay into a site where both users and the copyright holders are kept happy , before moving on to other sites .

This prototype lunar rover is just one of many racing for a $ 20 million prize
This spider - like robot is just one of the designs aimed at the moon ( Image : Team Italia )
It ’s been 36 years since NASA ’s last Apollo lander left the moon ’s surface .
But while the agency ’s plans to return humans to the moon remain confused , a pack of private teams are racing to send robots to kick up lunar dust and claim the $ 20 - million Google Lunar X Prize announced nearly two years ago .
So far 19 teams have registered for the contest .
To win , they must land a rover on the moon that will then drive 500 metres before turning to photograph its landing site – all before the end of 2012 .
The team that does it first will pick up $ 20 million .
Second place will earn $ 5 million and a further $ 5 million in bonuses will be awarded for finding relics from past US or Soviet moon missions .

Private affair
Like the Ansari X Prize for sending a human into space , the lunar contest is meant to stimulate commercial space exploration .
“ What we ’re doing is a proof of concept : that this can be done , and for less than the government would pay for the same kind of mission , ” says Fred Bourgeois , head of Team Frednet , a Lunar X Prize competitor based in California .
The Google Lunar X Prize teams span more than 12 countries on three continents .
They ’re led by students , engineers , CEOs and entrepreneurs .
Each has different strategies for flying to the moon , driving around once they get there and paying for it all .
Team Frednet has taken an open - source approach , meaning anyone can contribute to the wiki that is used for all the team ’s business .
“ The power of people collaborating is so much bigger than [ that of ] a small company hiring people to do the job , ” Bourgeois says .
“ You ca n’t get the same calibre of people that you can by finding people who are really interested in it . ”
( See an image of Team Frednet ’s “ hamster ball ” rover prototype ) .
Other teams , like Team Italia and the Romanian team ARCA , are trying whip up patriotism to give them a boost , although the contest ’s rules ban governmental support .
Marketing the moon
Some teams are making technology that will have a use and a market beyond the contest .
Team Astrobotic , based in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , has its sights set on the Apollo 11 landing site .
“ We ’re trying to create a robot that makes sense over the longer term so we can be part of the lunar frontier and help open it up , ” says David Gump , president of the team ’s parent company , Astrobotic Technology .
Team Astrobotic plans to send its rover to see how the descent stage of the Apollo 11 lunar module looks after 40 years on the moon and so gain insights into how to design future lunar equipment .
Astrobotic is also the only team so far to publicly set a launch date : 8 May 2011 .
( See an image of their rover prototype ) .
Most teams are relying on , or hoping for , private investment .
But not Synergy Moon , which is offering to take donors ’ DNA to the moon for $ 10,000 .
Odyssey Moon has a similar idea .
It was founded a year before the X Prize competition and its leader Bob Richards says it aims to be “ a FedEx to the moon ” .
He hopes people will pay to deliver things to the dusty lunar surface and expects consignments of plants and even human remains .
( See Odyssey Moon ’s prototype hopper ) .
Geeky business
“ For us it ’s all about building a business case , ” Richards told New Scientist .
“ We ’re pleased and proud to be the first registered team in the competition , but what ’s driving us are the customers . ”
Bourgeois also thinks there ’s money to be made from reaching the moon ’s surface and plans to have people sponsor images sent back from Team Frednet ’s lander .
“ Would n’t you like to have your name come back as ‘ This minute of moon video sponsored by …’ ? ” he asks .
“ It ’s just the geek value , you know ? ”

Alysa Stanton Becomes First Female Black Rabbi Alysa Stanton , 45 , will be ordained as the first black female rabbi in June .
May 21 , 2009  --
Growing up in a black , Pentecostal family in Cleveland , Alysa Stanton never imagined the day when she would be preparing to be ordained as a rabbi .
But that day will come June 6 for the single mother who will be ordained by the Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati , becoming the first African - American female rabbi in the world .
" Ten years ago , if someone said I was going to be a rabbi , I would have laughed , " Stanton , 45 , told ABCnews.com .
" Me , a spiritual leader ? "
Soon - to - be rabbi Stanton and her daughter Shana , 14 , whom she adopted when she was 14 months old , will move to Greenville , N.C. , in August , where Stanton will take her spot behind the pulpit at Congregation Bayt Shalom , which is both conservative and reform .
First Female Black Rabbi
Then , at age 10 , she received her first Hebrew grammar book from her devout Christian uncle who made it a habit to attend Jewish ceremonies , as well as his own .
By her early 20s , Stanton said she 'd decided to convert .
" Most people convert because they 're marrying or dating someone who is Jewish or for another reason other than just picking that spiritual path , " Stanton said .
" I did so because it was the path for me , " she said .
" Not only from a religious standpoint but from an ethical and social and communal standpoint , it was important to me . "
Stanton Garners Mixed Reaction from Jewish Community
Twenty percent of the U.S. Jewish population , or about 1.2 million people , are diverse , meaning black , Asian , Latino or mixed race , according to the Institute for Jewish and Community Outreach in San Francisco .
" What 's important here is not that this is the first black woman rabbi but rather that it's a symbol of a great change in the American Jewish community , which is becoming much more diverse because of things like conversions , intermarriage and adoption , " said Jonathan Sarna , an expert on U.S. Judaism at Brandeis University in Boston .
" That is a change that is really significant , " Sarna said .
" That a community that even 50 years ago was rather monolithic , so much so that people thought they could look at someone and see if he ' looked Jewish . '
" This is a reminder that the chosen people , so to speak , is not one race or another race but are in fact a range of races , " he said .
" While Jews remain united by a bond of peoplehood as well as religion , that bond is not characterized in racial terms . "
But the Orthodox Jewish community , which has historically not permitted women to hold leadership roles in its congregations , is less accepting of Stanton 's upcoming ordination because of her sex .
" My general feeling , as a rabbi , is that there is a great deal of room for everyone to have spiritual fulfillment in Judaism but the public role of a rabbi is only for certain people and that excludes women , " Orthodox Rabbi Gil Student of New York City told ABCNews.com .
" That 's based on tradition and enshrined in law . "
As for race , Student said that neither he nor the Orthodox Jewish community finds any problem with African - American Jews .
" There is no such thing as skin color in Judaism , it does n't exist , " Student said .
Shlomah Shamos , the chief editor of the popular New York Orthodox Jewish news site Vosizneias.com , said that as the reform and conservative movements continue to ordain female rabbis , the Orthodox Jewish community is finding it increasingly difficult to associate with them .
Still , he added , " Orthodox Jews have the highest respect for women and they play the most important role – to raise a true Torah Jewish family . "
Michael Barondes , the president of the congregation in North Carolina where Stanton will work , said that he was pleasantly surprised that her hiring did not spark any controversy among congregants .
" I'm very proud of my community , " Barondes said .
" [ Stanton 's being a woman or being black ] never came up in conversation .
Obviously , we all know that 's unusual but when she got on the pulpit during her visit , it was totally comfortable . "
Converting to Judaism
As for Stanton , she said that her family 's reaction to her conversion was ultimately positive , despite having a church pianist as a mother and a church choir director as a sister .
" I think at first they thought , ' OK , she 's going through a phase of exploration , ' " Stanton said .
When her family realized she was serious about Judaism , Stanton said they became " supportive " and " wonderful . "
Before studying to become a rabbi , Stanton had a career as a psychotherapist in Denver , Colo. , specializing in grief and trauma .
A first responder after the Columbine High School shooting in 1999 , Stanton said that her experience counseling and communicating will benefit her as the leader of a congregation .
Asked whether she foresees any challenges in becoming the rabbi of a mostly - white congregation , Stanton said that she is not concerned about how her race may affect her career .
" There 's an adjustment period for any rabbi when they go to a new congregation , " Stanton said .
" I am not anticipating that race will be a factor in their adjustment .
" My style and their style of worshipping will be the things we focus on , not the color of our skin . "
Stanton still anticipates some challenges in her new position .
" It 's difficult paving new ground , " she said .
" It 's difficult being a first of anything , and although I 'm honored and in awe that God has given me this responsibility , it 's one that I do not take lightly . "
First Female Rabbi Offers Advice to First Black Female Rabbi
Rabbi Sally Priesand knows all too well what it 's like to be a pioneer in the Jewish faith .
Priesand became the first ordained female rabbi in the United States in 1974 , a time when many members of the Jewish community reserved the role of a congregation leader only for men .
" It is hard to be the first , " said Priesand , who retired in 2006 from the New Jersey congregation where she worked for 25 years .
" I was well aware everyone would judge the concept of female rabbis by what I did . "
Priesand said that she spent much of her last year in rabbinical school traveling the country so that people would see that " she was a human like everyone else , " a decision she said was important to gaining the trust and respect of her congregants .
" Every time I preached a sermon or officiated a bar or bat mitvah for many people , it was the first time they had ever interacted with a female rabbi , " she said .
" I knew that when they left that would be their opinion of a female rabbi . "
When she was faced with people who believed she was filling a role that would be better suited for a man , Priesand said she learned to listen .
" I had a rule that I would never argue with anyone who thought women should n't be rabbis , " Priesand said .
" I would listen and I would say , ' Thank you so much for your opinion ' and I would walk away . "
" I do n't believe you can really accomplish your goal by arguing , you just have to do it , " she said , " and then people judge you for who you are as a person . "
Asked what advice she 'd give Stanton , whom she plans to see ordained next month in Ohio , Priesand said , " Be yourself . "
" When you 're the first of something , there 's a lot of notoriety that goes a long with that and it's easy to lose your focus along the way , " she said .
" When I was ordained , everyone thought that they knew what I should do and how I should dress and how I should be and I 'm rather proud of the fact that I 've always been able to be myself , " she said .
" You can not please everyone and so you have to be true to your own standards . "
With the home brew revival of the 1980s came a resurgence in craft brewing .
Home brewers who were inspired started microbreweries around the country .
With the coming of these new brew pubs , a newfound knowledge of how an honest ale is made spread like wildfire in the United States .
This momentum has culminated in what we now enjoy as the golden age of microbrew .
Although many microbreweries today have been or are in the process of being bought up by large corporate brewing interests , the ethics of real craft brewing has madeits way into the hearts and minds of beer fans across the country , ensuring that real craft brewing will never again die in the U.S .
To put things in a historical context , let us look back to the 1980s .
Ronald Reagan , the monkey man from the movies had been elected president .
Global tensions surrounding the insane cold war had everyone thinking that doomsday might be tomorrow .
This , of course contributed to a nihilistic youth culture known as punk rock .
At this time , there were only about twelve brands of beer to choose from in the United States .
CAMRA , the English group that encourages the manufacture and consumption of real ale had kept the madness of mass produced bland beer away from England , and a few microbreweries in the U.S. were spreading the gospel of good beer .
Once the cold war let up , we saw the microbreweries take off .
There must have been a huge sigh of relief worldwide - I 'm sure that that sigh contributed to a loosening up around the country .
Shortly thereafter the number of microbreweries in the U.S multiplied rapidly .
We 've gone from twelve varieties in the 1980's to nearly 1500 and counting by 2006 , bringing us into the golden age of the microbrew .
Nearly every large city has numerous microbreweries in the states , now , and many smaller towns have one as well .
According to beertown.org , since 2003 , Craft beer industry sales have grown 31.5 % .
It has become common for townsfolk to be asked " where is the local brew pub ? "
We are in an age where the trend of craft brewing seems to only be gaining more momentum .
The business of microbreweries is certainly a growth market , easily transplanted to tourist towns or to big cities .
Another aspect of the economics of the golden age of the micro brew is the ever - growing interest in home brewing and building a home bar .
With increased manufacturing and sales of the decadent appliance the kegerator , more and more people are enjoying pub style draft beer at home ( see article , " What is a Kegerator ? " for more information ) .
Online showrooms featuring the latest in home bar technology keep spreading the good word of the kegerator as a delightful addition to any home .
With so many microbrews to choose from , many people are opting for kegerator conversions .
Available easily online , these conversion kits allow you to transmogrify any working refrigerator into a kegerator .
By utilizing the kegerator conversion kits , one not only saves on shipping costs for one 's kegerator , but also allows for a kegerator that can serve up to five beers at a moderate cost .
This allows for numerous ale selections to be available at a relatively low cost , a real benefit in the golden age of microbrew , when such a vagarious array of beers is offered to the public .
The most we can really do to promulgate this tendency towards vast selection and variety of microbrews is to keep enjoying them .
By spreading the word of good beer far and wide , we may someday see this trend spread far and wide , to the remote towns of the Yukon , the remote towns of the Midwest , and even further .
With enough word of mouth promotion , we may even find ourselves moving from the Golden age to the Platinum age of Home Brewing .

Chris McMahon , the director of the Australian Centre for Sexual Health , told the hearing that AMI was '' concerned with its balance sheet rather than patient need ' ' and that the practice of prescribing medicines over the telephone was a ' ' casual , cavalier , careless and expedient ' ' approach .
David Handelsman , Concord Hospital 's ANZAC Research Institute 's head of andrology , said AMI 's advertising was pernicious and destructive , and its claims of efficacy for its erectile dysfunction treatments were a carefully constructed legal fiction .
Professor Handelsman told the hearing he had first come across Mr Vaisman more than a decade ago , when he was sitting on a Health Care Complaints Commission inquiry called by the NSW Government into an earlier Vaisman company , On Clinic .
'' I 've got to say , one of the most scarifying experiences as a medical practitioner I 've had , seeing just how low quality this sort of medical care can be . ''
David Malouf , Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand vice - president , said he believed AMI displayed serious ongoing inappropriate clinical practice lacking accountability .
He said he had treated some former AMI patients who suffered painful priapisms ( prolonged erections ) , including one 17 - year - old boy who had been prescribed penile injections .
Legendary British drag act Danny La Rue has died at the age of 81 .
The cabaret entertainer spent more than half a century on stage , and was most famous for his impersonations of such diverse female icons as Marlene Dietrich , Zsa Zsa Gabor and Margaret Thatcher .
His spokesperson said that La Rue died peacefully in his sleep at his home in Kent .
He had been suffering from cancer .
Brian Shaw , who worked as La Rue 's agent for more than 25 years , described him today as " a true show - business legend " and " a man of real class and style " .
Born Daniel Patrick Carroll in Ireland in 1927 , La Rue was brought to England at the age of nine , and his family settled in London .
The youngest of three children , he was evacuated to Devon during the blitz and worked in an Exeter shop after leaving school at the age of 15 .
La Rue first donned wig and eyelashes during a navy concert party in Singapore at the end of the second world war .
He acquired his stage name early on , but disliked being called a drag artist , preferring the title " comic in a frock " .
La Rue made his London debut at the tiny Irving theatre and worked with Barbara Windsor , who remained a close friend , after he broke into cabaret .
As his stage act grew even bigger , he opened his own nightclub in Hanover Square in 1964 .
The venture was a huge success , attracting more than 13,000 members and shooting La Rue to fame .
Judy Garland , Warren Beatty , Shirley Bassey , Noël Coward , Zsa Zsa Gabor and Elizabeth Taylor were all patrons .
La Rue went on to appear in pantomime in the 1960s , becoming one of the highest - paid entertainers of the decade .
He clocked up 53 panto roles over the course of his 54 - year career , andmade theatrical history by becoming the first man to play a female role in a major musical when he took the part of the titular matchmaker in Hello , Dolly !
He later said of that role : " It took me 20 years to make something that was n't acceptable , acceptable .
I mean , it 's not funny just to put on a frock and a wig .
It takes a lot of time to develop a character .
But I suppose I must be doing something right , otherwise I would n't have lasted . "
He went on to appear in dozens of TV shows , including The Good Old Days and Tonight With Danny La Rue .
He was appointed an OBE in 2002 , and performed more than 30 times at Buckingham Palace .
He was the first female impersonator to appear at the Royal Variety Performance for the Queen .
Following the death of his partner and manager , Jack Hanson , in 1984 , La Rue developed a drinking problem and financial troubles , revealed in his 1987 autobiography , From Drags to Riches .
He suffered a stroke in 2006 , but had a cameo on stage the following year at Benidorm Palace in Spain , appearing in a biographical show entitled Hello Danny .
Jerry Lane played the role of La Rue .
Noël Coward once described La Rue as " the most professional , most witty and most utterly charming man in the business " , while Bob Hope described him as " the most glamorous woman in the world " .

Residents of a southern Lebanese village on Saturday prevented United Nations peacekeepers from searching an abandoned building near a suspected Hezbollah weapons depot that recently exploded , a security official said .
Dozens of villagers in Bir el - Salasel , which is located near the Israeli border in an area where Hezbollah has strong support , ordered the peacekeepers to leave and threw stones at their vehicles , said the official .
Others blocked a nearby road to prevent more peacekeepers from coming to help their colleagues .
The Lebanese army eventually arrived and escorted the peacekeepers out of the area , said the official , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media .
There were no injuries , he said .
Bir el - Salasel is located close to Khirbet Silim , the site of Tuesday 's explosion in an abandoned building about 9 miles ( 15 kilometers ) from the Israeli border .
Lebanese officials have said the explosion was caused by a fire in a Hezbollah weapons storage facility .
Hezbollah has remained silent .
UN peacekeepers had no immediate comment on Saturday 's incident , but they earlier said the weapons depot was a " serious violation " of a ceasefire that ended a 34 - day war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006 .
The cease - fire prohibits Hezbollah from engaging in military activities in south Lebanon and forbids weapon smuggling to the group .
After the explosion , Israel accused Iran and Syria of violating those conditions by sending weapons to Hezbollah .
Under the ceasefire , a 13,300 - member UN peacekeeping force was deployed along Lebanon 's border with Israel to help 15,000 Lebanese government troops extend their authority into the south for the first time in decades and create a buffer zone free of Hezbollah fighters .
Italian police are investigating the theft of some $ 16 m ( £ 10 m ) in cash and jewellery from a Saudi princess staying on the Italian island of Sardinia .
The thieves used a master key to gain entry to her luxury hotel suite in Porto Cervo before ripping a safe from the wall , Italian media reports say .
They said the safe was only fixed with silicon to the wall in the suite .
Officials have not named the princess but say Italian and Saudi diplomats have had talks about the incident .
" The thieves used a master key .
In 10 minutes at dinner time , without making any noise , they managed to remove the safe from a suite occupied by the Saudi princess , " Italy 's La Stampa newspaper reported .
The hotel is located in one of the most chic resort areas on the Italian island .
[ I wrote this article earlier and WordPress messed up and deleted most of it .
I had to rewrite the final 2/3 of this article .
I think I wrote it better the first time , but enjoy . ]
I am not going to get into the philosophical reasons why I am opposed to income taxes in this piece article .
I am however going to explain why lower tax rates are better than higher tax rates .
Here is a chart that was sent to me by Mike at The Young Conservative Blog .
It shows the highest federal individual income tax rate .
It also shows the tax receipts received by the federal government as a percentage of GDP .
[ Check out Mike ’s blog , theres a lot of interesting stuff there .
Also , here is a Wall Street Journal article about Hauser ’s Law .
I think this is pretty remarkable .
While the highest individual income tax rates in this country dropped from 91 % down to 28 % , and then rose back up to the current 35 % , tax receipts as a percentage of GDP has remained at a fairly stable level of 19.5 % .
Cutting the rates from 91 % to 70 % in a few years didnt really affect the receipt rate , nor did increasing them from 28 % to 40 % in a few years .
Now , you might say that the reason that the tax receipts as a percentage of GDP remain pretty much the same is that when taxes on the rich are cut , the tax burden falls more heavily on the poor .
However , you may recall the chart that I posted regarding tax burden .
I was able to find an acrhived copy of the chart that the government removed from its website here .
I dont know how long it will stay up .
This chart clearly shows that the rich have paid an increasing portion of the total income taxes collected since 1979 .
In 1979 , the top income tax rate was 70 % .
The government collected about 19.5 % of GDP through income taxes , and the top 20 % of wage earners paid 64.9 % of all income taxes .
The top 40 % of wage earners combined paid 85.1 % of all income taxes .
In 2005 , the last year for which data is available , the top tax rate was 35 % .
The government still collected about 19.5 % of GDP through income taxes , however , the top 20 % of wage earners now paid 86.3 % of all income taxes ( a higher percentage than was paid by the top 40 % of wage earners in 1979 ) , and the top 40 % of wage earners paid 99.4 % of all income taxes collected .
I know this seems counterintuitive , but cutting taxes on the rich–and all Americans–actually increased the tax burden on the rich .
2005 ’s top tax rate ( 35 % ) was exactly half of what the top tax rate was in 1979 ( 70 % ) .
Yet , the rich paid a much higher percentage of income taxes in 2005 under a lower tax rate than they did in 1979 under a higher rate .
As I mentioned in a previous post , I found this spreadsheet when I was trying to prove to someone that President Bush ’s tax cuts favored the rich and hurt the poor .
I was wrong .
In 2000 , the top 20 % of earners paid 81.2 % of all income taxes .
By 2005 , this proportion had grown to 86.3 % of all income taxes .
The tax burden of the top 40 % increased from 94.7 % in 2000 to 99.4 % in 2005 .
In fact , every quintile in the “ bottom 80 % ” of wage earners paid a smaller proportion of the total income taxes in 2005 than they did in 2000 .
Broad based tax cuts benefit all wage earners .
Cutting taxes allows Americans to keep more of their hard earned money .
This in turn leads to increased spending , savings , and investment .
These three factors lead directly to increased GDP growth .
Increased GDP growth means higher tax revenue for the government ( which will always collect around 19.5 % of GDP through income taxes ) .
I have already demonstrated that the government will collect roughly the same percentage of GDP – 19.5 % –through income taxes no matter what the top tax rate is .
This is true whether that rate is 92 % or 28 % .
I have also demonstrated that cutting taxes on the rich and all Americans has actually increased the tax burden on the rich .
Finally , I have explained that cutting taxes leads to higher GDP ( which equals higher tax receipts ) .
I see no further arguments against cutting taxes on all Americans including the wealthy .
Rather than raising the tax rates on the wealthy back to what they were in 2000 , the President and Congress should consider drastically cutting income taxes for all Americans .
This will lead to increased economic growth which will in turn lead to higher tax revenues for the government .
Most importantly , doing this would allow all Americans to keep more of their hard earned money .
Americanly Yours ,

Ukraine 's SBU is declassifying the files selectively Ukraine is opening up part of its old KGB archive , declassifying hundreds of thousands of documents spanning the entire Soviet period .
But the move to expose Soviet - era abuses is dividing Ukrainians , the BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse reports from Kiev .
Deep in the bowels of Ukraine 's former KGB headquarters there is a deathly silence .
Thousands of boxes , piled floor to ceiling , line the walls .
Each box is carefully numbered and each one contains hundreds of documents : case notes on enemies of the former Soviet state .
Behind each number , there is a story of personal tragedy .
Volodymyr Viatrovych , the chief archivist , pulled out a brown cardboard folder stuffed full of documents : case number 4076 .
At the centre of the case is a letter , dated 1940 and addressed to " Comrade Stalin , the Kremlin , Moscow " .
Ivan Severin was " liquidated " in 1947 , his case notes state " Dear Iosif Vissarionovich , " the letter starts .
Nikolai Reva wanted Stalin to know the facts about the great famine of 1932 - 33 , when millions died as a result of the Soviet policy of forced collectivisation .
Like many at the time , Mr Reva believed that Stalin was being kept in the dark , and that if only he knew what was happening , he would surely put a stop to it .
But his letter landed him in the Gulag .
He was eventually rehabilitated - 25 years later .
Many met a harsher fate .
Leafing through one of many macabre photo albums , Mr Viatrovych pointed to a picture of Ivan Severin , shot in the head by the Soviet security services .
Under the picture , in very neat handwriting , is written : " Liquidated , 3 April 1947 " .
Criminal prosecution Mr Viatrovych and his team are helping people to find out what happened to relatives and loved ones , often decades after they disappeared .
Mr Viatrovych is helping the victims ' relatives to uncover the truth But the Ukrainian Security Service ( SBU ) , now in charge of the files , is declassifying them selectively .
They are concentrating on older cases , like that of the " liquidated " Mr Severin , who was part of a guerrilla campaign against Soviet rule in western Ukraine after World War II .
The authorities are preparing to mount a criminal prosecution in relation to the famine , or Holodomor , as it is known in Ukraine , though it is doubtful whether there is anyone still alive to stand in the dock .
But SBU head Valentyn Nalyvaichenko hopes this is just the beginning .
" As soon as Russia starts to open and uncover its archives , there will be more and more truth about the real history , " he said .
At the moment , he added , Russia is not being especially co-operative .
But there is another obstacle to complete disclosure , and that is the Ukrainian Security Service itself .
They are the ones deciding which files to declassify .
I put it to Mr Nalyvaichenko that the SBU is , after all , a successor to the KGB .
He came out on the defensive .
" First and most important for me - we are not a successor to the KGB .
That 's according to the law , " he said .
Could he state categorically that no - one working for the SBU today had formerly worked for the KGB ?
He could not , admitting that 20 % of his employees were former KGB officers .
Some analysts in Ukraine believe that is a conservative figure .
It seems unlikely that SBU officers who worked for the Soviet KGB in the 1970s and 80s will be enthusiastic about declassifying documents that could incriminate them .
Even if , as Mr Nalyvaichenko pointed out , the SBU is trying to recruit younger staff .
' Not worth it '
But not all young Ukrainians have an exclusively negative view of their 20th - Century history .
To start a process of lustration after 18 years of independence would lead society to the brink of civil war
Dmytro Tabachnyk
Historian and opposition MP
In Kiev , there is a vast monument to the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany : a sprawling bronze relief of soldiers bearing guns and bayonets .
" We love our history , " said Svitlana , a young schoolteacher from the southern city of Odessa , on an outing with her class .
She was not keen for the children in her charge to be forced to examine the darker chapters of Soviet history .
" The past is the past , " she said .
" The history of the famine , the killings , all the things Stalin did .
I do n't think we should bring them up .
There 's enough violence today as it is .
If we start blaming each other It 's just not worth it . "
' Witch hunt '
The idea of airing the past as part of a healing process , and excluding members of the former regime from positions of authority - a process known as " lustration " - is being actively promoted by some in the Ukrainian administration .
More than 200,000 bodies may be buried in Bykivnia , outside Kiev But it is highly controversial .
Dmytro Tabachnyk , a historian and opposition lawmaker , thinks the notion is absurd .
" It 's a witch hunt , " he said .
" To start a process of lustration after 18 years of independence would lead society to the brink of civil war . "
In a forest just outside Kiev , the tree trunks are tied with thousands of white scarves .
The scarves are embroidered in the traditional Ukrainian way , with red-and - black geometric patterns , and each one symbolically represents a life lost to Soviet oppression .
Under Stalin , the Soviet secret police would bury executed political prisoners at Bykivnia .
No -one knows exactly how many bodies lie buried in this wood , but some estimates put the figure at more than 200,000 .
But , says Nico Lange , the German director of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Kiev , Ukrainians must stop blaming the Russians for their past , and start looking inward .
" Ukrainians have a tendency to perceive themselves as only victims of those historical processes , " he says .
" But coming to terms with the past really starts when you start uncovering also your own involvement : the oppressions by your own state , the offenders who are from your own people .
If you do this work , this very painful work , the truth will finally set you free .
And you will not invite new dictators to oppress you again . "
The Germans have experience of confronting their own past , both following World War II , and after the fall of the Berlin Wall .
But it will take a lot of united political will for such a process to get under way in Ukraine .
And it may be that , for the moment , there are still too many people alive and in positions of power , who were involved with the Soviet regime in one way or another .

But APOE is not definitive .
Many people with e4 never become demented , and many Alzheimer ’s patients have no e4 .
That uncertainty helped turn the medical profession against testing .
In the past , the Alzheimer ’s Association discouraged testing , but it has relaxed its stance in the past few years , largely because of reports from the Reveal study .
Even so , William
Thies , the association ’s chief medical and scientific officer , said that so far there had not been much demand for the test , and that a direct - to - consumer company specializing in it had gone out of business .
Two authors of the study , but not Dr. Green , provided consulting services to a company that was marketing APOE testing .
Two study participants , among a half dozen whose telephone numbers were given to reporters by Boston University , said they were pleased that they had joined the study .
Amy Sumner , 45 , a social worker in Simsbury , Conn. , said she had sought out the research because there were several cases of Alzheimer ’s in her grandmother ’s generation on her mother ’s side .
Ms. Sumner thought her test results might help her mother and aunts ( who do not have dementia ) decide whether to be tested .
She turned out to have no copies of e4 , a relief for her but not much help for her relatives , who could still carry the gene .
She said her mother and aunts were concerned about their risk but did not dwell on it , adding , “ All four are very strong , spiritual women and have a lot of peace about it even though they ’re concerned . ”
Another participant , Robert McKersie , 79 , said he wanted the test because his mother died of Alzheimer ’s .
Dr. McKersie said he thought the test results might help him and his wife decide whether to stay in their house or consider moving to an assisted - living facility , just in case .
He learned that he did have a copy of e4  but given his high scores on mental tests and the fact that he has reached 79 with no intellectual decline , the researchers estimated his risk as fairly low .
Although is retired , Dr. McKersie is still teaching business courses at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Despite the study ’s reassuring results , Dr. Green said it did not mean that APOE testing was right for everybody .
Some people who initially wanted to participate changed their minds after they learned more about the test .
Dr. Green also cautioned that the study was small , participants were given extensive talks by genetic counselors and they were followed for only one year .
It is too soon to tell whether the knowledge will begin to haunt them later in life .
It is also not clear whether being positive for e4 could hurt people financially .
Although a law enacted last year forbids health insurers and employers to discriminate based on genetic tests , it does not apply to insurance for long - term care or disabilities .
Some study participants have already bought long - term care insurance specifically because they learned they had an e4 gene , Dr. Green said , adding that this scares long - term - care insurance companies .
He said that when he mentioned those purchases in a presentation to insurance executives , whom he described as a staid group , some leapt to their feet and shouted that there would be no more long - term - care insurance if too many people with risky genes started buying policies .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A woman from Cameroon has been found to be infected with an AIDS - like virus that came from gorillas , French researchers reported Sunday .

The woman , who has no symptoms of HIV infection , is well and was likely infected by another person , not an animal , the researchers said .
Their findings suggest this newly discovered gorilla virus is circulating among people , they reported in the journal Nature Medicine .
“ We have identified a new human immunodeficiency virus in a Cameroonian woman .
It is closely related to gorilla simian immunodeficiency virus and shows no evidence of recombination with other HIV - 1 lineages or with chimpanzee SIV , ” Jean - Christophe Plantier of the Universite de Rouen in France and colleagues wrote .
The 62 - year - old woman was diagnosed in 2004 , soon after she moved to Paris from Cameroon .
Routine genetic sequencing of the virus showed it looked like no other sample of AIDS virus and it was eventually compared to a gorilla simian immunodeficiency virus , itself only discovered in 2006 .
AIDS , which has infected an estimated 33 million people globally and has killed another 25 million , has been traced to chimpanzees .
Scientists say it likely jumped to people who hunted and butchered the chimps , which are the closest living genetic relatives of humans .
“ Our findings indicate that gorillas , in addition to chimpanzees , are likely sources of HIV - 1 , ” Plantier ’s team wrote .
“ The discovery of this novel HIV - 1 lineage highlights the continuing need to watch closely for the emergence of new HIV variants , particularly in western central Africa , the origin of all existing HIV - 1 groups . ”
The woman , a widow , herself had no contact with gorillas but said she had several sex partners after her husband died .
She remembered having been sick once .
When people become newly infected with HIV , they often have a fever and minor illness at the time but rarely know what it is .
They are usually diagnosed later , after the virus has begun damaging the immune system .
There is no cure for HIV but drugs can control it for years .

Research findings suggest that , contrary to popular belief , engineering does not have a higher dropout rate than other majors and women do just as well as men , information that could lead to a strategy for boosting the number of U.S. engineering graduates .
" Education lore has always told us that students - particularly women - drop out of undergraduate engineering programs more often than students in other fields , " said Matthew Ohland , an associate professor in Purdue University 's School of Engineering Education .
" Well , it turns out that neither is true .
Engineering programs , on average , retain just as many students as other programs do , and once women get to college they 're just as likely to stick around in engineering as are their male counterparts . "
The research also shows that hardly any students switch to engineering from other majors , pointing to a potential strategy for increasing the number of U.S. engineering graduates , Ohland said .
" A huge message in these findings is that engineering students are amazingly like those in other disciplines , but we need to do more to attract students to engineering programs , " he said .
" If you look at who graduates with a degree in social sciences , 50 percent of them started in social sciences , and for other sciences it 's about 60 percent .
If you look at who graduates with a degree in engineering , however , 93 percent of them started in engineering .
The road is narrow for students to migrate into engineering from other majors . "
Findings were drawn largely from a database that includes 70,000 engineering students from nine institutions in the southeastern United States .
Ohland manages the database , called the Multiple - Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Development , which followed students over a 17 - year period ending in 2005 .
Data show that the nine institutions vary dramatically in how well they retain engineering students over eight semesters , ranging from 66 percent to 37 percent .
Those findings indicate policies and practices at some institutions may serve to retain students better than those at other institutions .
The findings suggest educators should develop a two - pronged approach to increase the number of engineering graduates : identify which programs best retain students and determine why they are effective , and develop programs and policies that allow students to more easily transfer into engineering from other majors .
A report prepared by the National Academy of Sciences found that a federal effort is urgently needed to bolster U.S. competitiveness and pre-eminence in engineering and science .
Meanwhile , emerging nations such as India and China far outstrip the U.S. production of engineers .
One reason for the lack of migration into engineering is that institutions usually do not provide universal prerequisites , such as calculus , which can be applied to engineering , Ohland said .
" At one institution in the database , everybody takes the same calculus course , " Ohland said .
" There is n't calculus for business , or calculus for the life sciences , and this makes it much easier for students to transfer to engineering later in their academic careers .
Most institutions , unfortunately , do n't do it this way , meaning you 'd have to take calculus over again if you wanted to transfer into engineering , and this discourages students from switching . "
Some of the findings were reported in 2008 , and newer findings have been accepted for publication in a future issue of the Journal of Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering .
" The findings in both of these papers are counterintuitive , " Ohland said .
" People naturally assume there is a female persistence problem because only about 20 percent of undergraduate engineering students are women . "
By comparison , women earn more than half of bachelor 's degrees in psychology , agricultural sciences , biological sciences , chemistry and social sciences .
" The problem of few women in engineering , however , is one of recruitment , not retention , " Ohland said .
" The problem is complex and is certainly affected by engineering 's culture .
It is likely that engineering cannot attract significantly more women unless the profession changes .
Rather , a critical step in attracting more women to engineering is to accept women as they are and to be excited about how the engineering profession might be different if it were more gender balanced . "
The database only includes institutions in the southeast because the partnership to collect the data was first formed there .
Future work will include institutions in other geographical areas , but Ohland said there is no reason to assume results from other regions wo n't be similar .
" Certainly , we expect to see differences at private institutions , particularly those with low enrollments , but large public institutions probably all have similar behaviors , " Ohland said .
" These data should not give people the impression that persistence in engineering education is n't a concern .
Yes , engineering retains students as well as other majors , but that might be because we pay so much attention to engineering retention . "
The 2008 publication was authored by Ohland ; Sheri D. Sheppard , a professor of mechanical engineering at Stanford University ; Gary Lichtenstein , a consulting professor at Stanford ; Özgür Eris , an assistant professor of design and mechanical engineering , and Debbie Chachra , assistant professor of materials science , both at Franklin W. Olin College Of Engineering ; and Richard A. Layton , an associate professor of mechanical engineering at the Rose - Hulman Institute of Technology .
These earlier findings earned Ohland 's team the William Elgin Wickenden Award for best paper from the Journal of Engineering Education .
The award was issued by the American Society for Engineering Education in June 2009 .
The more recent work on women in engineering was authored by Susan M. Lord , a professor of engineering , and Michelle Madsen Camacho , an associate professor of sociology , both at the University of San Diego ; Russell A. Long , director of project assessment in engineering education , and Mara H. Wasburn , an associate professor of organizational leadership , both at Purdue ; as well as Ohland and Layton .
The database was created in 1996 , and Ohland began managing it in 1998 while a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Florida .

SUN VALLEY , Idaho ( Reuters ) - Google Inc Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said he will talk to Apple Inc about how his role on its board might change after Google ’s move to launch a new operating system .
Earlier this week , Google announced it was developing software for personal computers based on its Chrome Web browser , which would compete with Microsoft Corp ’s Windows as well as Apple ’s OS X platform .
Schmidt said at the Allen & Co media and technology conference in Sun Valley , Idaho , on Thursday that PC makers could announce products running Chrome OS later this year .
Schmidt , whose company has weathered the recession better than most technology and media companies , also said that while the worst of the economic downturn has passed , there are n’t any strong signs of an immediate recovery .
There had been talk during one presentation at Sun Valley of a “ square root recovery , ” meaning the economy could rebound but then remain flat , like the shape of the square root sign , Schmidt said .
“ We ’re through the shock , we ’re through the collapse .
I would argue the worst is behind us , speaking generally , not specifically to Google , ” he said at a one - hour briefing with reporters , along with Google co-founder Larry Page .
But much of the focus of the briefing was on Google ’s new operating system .
Because it would compete with Apple ’s own software , Schmidt said he would talk to the Mac computer maker about whether he should recuse himself from Apple ’s board .
Under federal antitrust law , a person is not allowed to sit on the board of two companies if it decreases competition between them .
“ I ’ll talk to the Apple people .
At the moment , there ’s no change , ” Schmidt said .
Google , the No. 1 Internet search company in the U.S. , is under increasing regulatory scrutiny .
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is looking into whether ties between the boards of Apple and Google violate antitrust laws .
Schmidt and former Genentech CEO Arthur Levinson are directors of both companies .
Schmidt began recusing himself from Apple board meetings where the iPhone was discussed after Google launched its own Android mobile phone operating system .
INCREASING COMPETITION
Google has said that computer makers like Hewlett - Packard Co and Acer Inc are working with it on Chrome devices , with the first netbook PCs expected in the second half of 2010 .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
“ Everybody we ’ve talked to under nondisclosure is excited about the plan .
So hopefully later this year we ’ll see some announcements , ” Schmidt said .
The move intensifies the competition between Google and Microsoft , whose Windows operating system runs on the majority of the world ’s personal computers .
And it comes in the wake of Microsoft ’s recent push into Google ’s home turf with the release of the Bing Internet search engine .
Schmidt and Page repeatedly steered the conversation away from the rivalry with Microsoft , describing the Chrome OS as a product that would be “ additive ” to the PC market .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
“ I do n’t want to talk about Microsoft , ” Schmidt said , noting later that Google did not have any particular goals for Chrome to take market share in the PC business .
“ We actually do n’t look at market share at all , ” he said .
The Chrome OS is a separate product than Android , the operating system that Google released last year aimed primarily at smartphones .
But Schmidt said the two products are closely related and could eventually “ merge even closer . ”
Schmidt also touched upon other business efforts , and cited display advertising as the primary revenue opportunity after Google ’s $ 3.2 billion acquisition of DoubleClick in 2008 .
“ I would suggest the display part of our business is likely to be the next billion dollar business , ” he said without giving a timeframe .
Schmidt also said he was kept well abreast of the circumstances surrounding Apple founder and CEO Steve Jobs ’ medical leave of absence , which began in January .
Jobs received a liver transplant while on leave , and has returned to work .
Apple and its board have been criticized by some observers for failing to disclose the exact state of Jobs ’ health .
“ I was extremely well - informed as a board member with what was going on with Steve , ” Schmidt said .
He declined to comment further on the matter .
State 's most conservative county uses much cash
Rhonda McGarva has come home to Likely , CA . to help out on the ranch .
Modoc County in the far northeastern corner of California is an interesting mix of Republican ranchers and progressive newcomers who seem to share a distrust of government and have an independent spirit .

Sprawling across the northeastern corner of California , this huge , thickly forested county with more cows than people epitomizes the Western frontier - and what seems to be a two - faced political ideology .
Modoc has the highest Republican registration of any county in California , it unfailingly elects anti-tax Republicans to office , and the vote here against last month 's ballot measure that would have raised a variety of taxes was one of the most lopsided in the state .
And yet , per capita , Modoc County gets more state taxpayer dollars than all but one of California 's 58 counties .
The prevailing attitude among the right - wing ranchers and modern hippies who define Modoc County is of fierce self - reliance - but more people here than just about anywhere else depend on welfare checks of some kind to get by .
So with state Republicans blocking new taxes and insisting on deep cuts in taxpayer - funded services , does that make this most solid of GOP bases politically conflicted ?
Or , worse , just plain ignorant ?
No way , say the cattlemen and the hippies .
Most folks up here will tell you that no matter who is in office or what the big-city politicians do , the dearest wish of anyone living in Modoc is to be left alone - except for a little help for core needs like hospitals and schools .
And if you cut off our funding even for that , they say , we wo n't like it - but we 'll get by .
We 're independent .
It 's a frontier thing .
Split but not split
Ken McGarva and Tina Hodge will both tell you with equal ardor that government should stay out of their faces .
But you would n't know they could agree by looking at them .
McGarva is a cowboy .
The real kind , one who ropes and brands his cattle in the dot - in - the - road town of Likely .
At 70 , he loathes liberal politics .
Hodge is a back - to - the - land hippie .
The real kind , one who raised her kids in a tepee on a remote mountaintop near tiny Eagleville and now lives off the grid in a hobbit - style house on that same mountaintop .
At 57 , she loathes conservative politics .
However , both McGarva and Hodge maintain that state legislators should n't even think of cutting health and education funding to rural counties like Modoc , where 9,184 residents knock around a territory the size of Connecticut .
Instead , they say , swing the budget ax on bloated - big - government - style frills - for instance , state - paid cars for legislators and misguided environmental regulations , though they do n't always agree on which ones are misguided .
' We 'll just get by '
The fact that health and education spending make up about 70 percent of California 's general fund , leaving little else to cut , only emphasizes the importance of that funding , they say .
And if the Capitol does indeed slash Modoc County 's money for road maintenance , health services and welfare job training - which will happen , if Sacramento 's Republicans get their way - McGarva and Hodge have the same plan .
" Well , we 'll just get by the way we did in the Great Depression - on our own , " McGarva said , swatting mosquitoes on his porch after another hard day of herding dogies on his 1,000 - head ranch .
" We 'll grow a vegetable garden , we 'll use milk cows . "
If the roads are closed , he said , they always have horses .
" We have pretty much all we need here on the mountain , and if we had to we could grow more of our own food , " said Hodge , standing in her front yard , which is 6,100 feet above sea level and a jarring , 4 - mile rumble up a dirt road .
If the roads are closed , she said , she can always pack into town using her herd of llamas .
The politicians 200 miles south in Sacramento say they admire that frontier spirit , and both sides say they know what is best for Modoc County .
But that 's about where they stop sounding alike .
Politicians can't agree
Democrats say the solution to the state 's $ 24.3 billion deficit involves more revenue sources .
Republicans say it requires only expenditure chopping .
Both sides have dug in their heels .
Assemblywoman Noreen Evans , D - Santa Rosa , chairwoman of a legislative budget conference committee , ordered up a report last winter ranking which of the state 's counties send the most tax money per capita to the Capitol , and which ones consume the most in health and other services .
It showed that conservative counties - like Modoc , with 49.9 percent Republican registration , the state 's highest - generally consumed the most , and liberal counties sent in the most .
Marin County was No. 1 in contributions , at $ 4,793 per person , and San Francisco was No. 3 at $ 3,578 .
Modoc was No. 2 in consumption at $ 2,216 per person , and conservative Tulare was No. 1 , with $ 2,223 .
" I do n't think voters in the conservative counties understand the connection between the service they are receiving and the votes their representatives are making , " Evans said .
" Maybe the layers of government are so convoluted that many people do n't realize how it works . "
In Modoc , the way it works is that if the cuts being proposed go through , near - catastrophe will reign , said County Administrative Officer Mark Charlton .
He said the entire road maintenance service would be closed except for snowplowing on a few main roads , the welfare - to - work CalWORKS program would be cut in half , many mental health patients would no longer be monitored and would relapse and wind up behind bars , and there would be fewer police patrols .
" You 'll be able to translate these cuts into more accidents on the road , more people in jail , more people getting sick , " Charlton said .
Assemblyman Jim Nielsen , R - Gerber ( Tehama County ) , vice chairman of the Assembly budget committee , represents Modoc County .
He said cutting social services is not what he has in mind when he talks about deficit reduction - it 's chopping other things , such as regulatory oversight committees and government employees .
He said health and road services cost more per capita in rural places like Modoc because they 're remote and expensive to reach .
So do n't blame the sticks for consuming more funding per person , he said .
" There 's no way you 're going to have a booming county up there , so every penny we send counts , " Nielsen said .
" The funding there would n't buy ( much ) in San Francisco , but it goes a long way in Modoc . "
Barbara March , 62 , who moved up from Carmel Valley six years ago to publish the Modoc Independent News with husband Ray , 74 , said the only people who move so far into the trees are by definition stubborn , frontier types .
So it makes sense they would share some values .
If you 're looking for multiplexes and Starbucks , you do n't come .
A self - selecting population
" Hippies and buckaroos and everything in between - they all have a tolerance and generosity of spirit up here , " March said .
" But you ca n't tell them what to do . "
In the cities , talk of chopping government services brings defiant cries of protest .
In Modoc , cowboy McGarva , whose family has ranched here since 1918 , said his solution to the budget crunch is to shoo government as far away as possible .
Fund good education and rural health services , he said - but do n't raise taxes .
" Get rid of all this environment crap first , saving the three - legged frog and whatnot , and protecting the mountain lion so much it ruins the hunting up here , " he said .
" Cut down on useless things like all those departments they have .
Then they 'll make some progress . "
Back - to - the - lander Hodge and her husband , Bill , 63 , moved to their mountaintop in 1981 to raise two daughters , as well as llamas for wool and breeding .
In 1995 , she started Eagle Peak Herbals , which ships herbal remedies and potions all over the world .
In their way , the Hodges are every bit the self - starting business people that the ranchers are .
" I think we should raise money when it 's needed ... but no , government does not work as well as it should , and there are quite a few things we do n't need , " Hodge said .
" We do n't need the corporate subsidies we give , and we do n't need more dams on the rivers up here . "
Her suggestions do n't exactly match McGarva's .
But then , they and their families said , in a place like Modoc , they do n't have to be a perfect fit .
" Around here there are a lot of people with great hearts , and if you work hard , you can do fine , " said Bill Hodge .
" We all have a real sense of community . "
" We 're the kind of people this country was founded on , still strong enough to stand up for our ideals , " said McGarva 's daughter , Rhonda , 44 , who can drive cattle with the best of them .
" When you 're talking about self - reliance , you 're talking about us .
" No matter what they do in Sacramento . "

Do n't worry , he 's nothing at all like the Wheelie from the cartoon .
RAMON RODRIGUEZ
Well thank goodness for that .
WHEELIE
I 'm actually more annoying now .
They find MARK RYANBOT , who helpfully explains the rich , detailed mythology of the TRANSFORMERS .
MARK RYANBOT
You must go to Egypt to find the Matrix of Leadership which can be used to unlock the Tomb of Primes and harvest Energon , fuel for Cybertronians I 'm sorry if I have to say one more of these stupid fucking lines I 'm going to blow my brains out .
DIRECTOR MICHAEL BAY
HELP I REALLY WANT A BIG BATTLE IN THE DESERT HOW DO I MAKE THINGS BOOM BOOM ON PYRAMIDS
SHIA LEBOUF
Dude , we 're in Washington , D.C.
What are you going to do , teleport us or something ?
DIRECTOR MICHAEL BAY
PERFECT THAT WORKS OLD TRANSFORMERS HAVE THE POWER OF TELEPORTATION NOW OKAY
SHIA LEBOUF
Wait , no , do n't --
EXT .
EGYPT
SHIA LEBOUF
-- god dammit .
SHIA is joined by TYRESE , JOSH , and all of the POLYGONS FROM EARLIER .
Suddenly DEVASTATOR starts to form !
JOSH DUHAMEL
Oh my God , it 's Devastator !
Considering the fact that he 's taking fifteen minutes to fully form , there must be an epic battle coming up !
One of the RACISMBOTS kills it before it can do anything cool .
TYRESE GIBSON
So much for that .
We 're going to need that little skidmark Shia to revive Peter Cullenbot so the movie can get interesting again .
JOSH DUHAMEL
Man I wish someone would just crack that kid's skull open and smash his brains .
SHIA LEBOUF
Alright , I 'll revive Cullenbot after I take a quick trip to robot heaven and talk to some Transformer ghosts .
MEGAN FOX
What 's sad is that anyone reading this Abridged Script that has n't seen the movie will just think that 's some kind of weird joke they do n't get .
It 's not .
That description is brain - meltingly accurate .
SHIA takes 45 minutes to revive CULLENBOT who proceeds to kill WEAVINGBOT and TODDBOT in ten seconds .
RAMON RODRIGUEZ
This sucks !
I 'm absolutely appalled that Michael Bay is n't taking the source material seriously !
MEGAN FOX
By " source matrial , " you mean the 30 minute advertisements for toys , right ?
SHIA LEBOUF
This is kind of depressing .
I mean , has our society truly reached a point where we find two - and - a - half hours of giant robots fighting each other entertaining ?
MICHAEL BAY
WE SURE HAVE LETS GET STARTED ON TRANSFORMERS 3 : THE EXPLOSIONS OF THE PYROTECHNICS

Update : Changed subroutine to comply with Perl Best Practices
Update2 : Removed the prototype from the subroutine .
I ’ve always had a problem with recursion .
Not with the general theory that a function will call itself , etc – no , that ’s easy .
The hard part was when I had to deal with complex data structures in Perl ( an array - or hashref containing a hash of arrays of hashes , a gazillion levels deep ) .
Well , I guess anyone would have a hard time with that kind of data .
Anyway , in this post I do n’t intend to get all complicated explaining all the kinds of recursions out there .
If you want that , check this article at wikipedia .
What I do want to do is help all of those who are in the situation I was in , by explaining in the simplest way possible how to deal with this scenario .
Let ’s start with a need .
I have a complex data structure that needs its spaces trimmed on both sides .
But since I ’m lazy , I ’d like my subroutine to modify the data directly , and not return the modified value ( pass by reference , not pass by value ) .
Here ’s our data structure :
my $ data = [ { key1 => ' trim me ! ' , key2 => ' trim me too ! ' , } , [ ' some element to trim ' , ' another one ' , ] , ' a simple string needing trimming ' , ] ;
$ data explained : an array containing 3 elements : element 0 is a hashref of keys " key1 " and " key2 " , element 1 is an arrayref of 2 elements .
Element 3 is a simple string .
All values have some extra spaces that need trimming ( or so they say ) .
We could use whatever number of levels and data types we want ( except for anonymous subroutines , I guess – let ’s not get too complicated ) .
Now , to trim all that , I want to be able to simply call trim ( ) à la PHP .
trim ( $ data ) ; # note the lack of the lvalue ( lvalue = rvalue )
I also want it to accept simple arrays and hashes , and the references thereof : trim( @array ) ; trim( @array ) ; trim ( %hash ) ; trim ( %hash ) ; trim ( $ string ) .
After all , I never know what kind of data my colleagues will be working with .
Better have it deal with everything .
The logic to do that is this : our subroutine will have to do the trimming ( s///g ) on scalars only .
For that , it has to check if the data it received is a hash , array , etc , and if it is , iterate through each element and trim the value … but only if the element is not itself a hash , array , etc .
Found it confusing ?
No problem , it really is .
In Perl , if I tried to remove the white space from element 0 of my $ data variable , it would n’t work .
The reason being is that if I printed $ data - > [ 0 ] onto the screen , I ’d get a funny looking output , something like HASH ( 0x1004f5f0 ) .
That ’s Perl ’s way of saying that you have a HASH structure stored in memory position 0x1004f5 f0 .
You can try to trim the spaces off of that string , but it wo n’t do you any good .
The elements of your hash will still be untouched .
That ’s why you need to de-reference your data structures and dive into them .
To de-reference a structure is simple , just add a % in front of the variable if it ’s a hashref , or an @ if it ’s an array .
But how do you know which is which ?
Use ref ( ) .
print ref( $data ->[ 0 ] ) . " n " ; # HASH print ref( $data ->[ 1 ] ) . " n " ; # ARRAY print ref( $data ->[ 3 ] ) . " n " ; # empty string , which is false
ref ( ) tells you what kind of data you are dealing with .
It returns CODE if you have a closure or anonymous subroutine , but we ’re not going there today .
So , now that we know how to identify the type of element we ’re going to be working with , we can build our subroutine …
sub trim ( ) { for my $ param ( @_ ) { if ( ref ( $ param ) eq ' ARRAY ' ) { for my $ element ( @{$param} ) { trim ( $element ) ; } } elsif ( ref ( $ param ) eq ' HASH ' ) { for my $ val ( values % {$ param} ) { trim ( $val ) ; } } elsif ( ref ( $ param ) eq ' CODE ' ) { return ; } else { $ param =~ s/( ^s+|s + $ ) //g ; } } }
trim ( ) explained :
We ’re working with passing elements by reference instead of by value .
This means that the elements themselves will be modified – no need to return any data .
The first thing we do is to iterate through all parameters passed to trim ( ) .
In a subroutine , parameters ( in our case , variables ) are populated into the special @_ array , allowing us to call trim ( $ var1 , $ var2 , $ var3 ) if we want .
We iterate through all elements of @_ and verify if they are an Array .
If they are , we iterate through each of their elements once , and call trim ( ) again against them .
That will handle as many nested arrays we want ( or that your computer can handle ) .
Now we have to make it deal with hashes .
Same technique – use ref ( ) to see if it ’s a hash .
If it is , then iterate through each of its key / pair elements .
There are several ways to do that .
I personally prefer calling keys to get the keys and use them to fetch the values of the hash .
The value of the hash is passed to trim ( ) for more validation .
We also check to see if we received a sub { } ( anonymous subroutine ) .
In that case , we do nothing , just return .
Finally , after handling Arrays , Hashes and Anonymous subroutines , we can set up the actual trimming of the strings .
We take the $ _ [ $i ] which is the parameter passed and remove the leading and trailing spaces with one neat substitution : ^s+ stands for leading spaces , s+$ stands for trailing spaces , and it ’s all joined by the ( | ) ( this or that ) .
We only call it once because we ’re using the global ( g ) modifier of the substitution s///g .
And that ’s all there is to it !
( CNN ) --
In " Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , " the threat from villainous Lord Voldemort is ignored until it 's almost too late .
" Harry and his friends start Dumbledore 's army to bring awareness to this , " said iReporter Andrew Slack .
" Meanwhile , our world ignores AIDS , Darfur and global warming . "
Harry Potter Alliance members attend a midnight screening in Burlington , Massachusetts .
Some Potter fans , under the leadership of Slack , have come together to bring the spirit of " Dumbledore 's army " to life .
Slack is the executive director of the Harry Potter Alliance , a nonprofit organization dedicated to engaging Potter fans in social activism .
Slack 's group has taken on many issues over the past few years .
" Because we 're basing it on a modern myth , you can point to many issues at once , " he said .
In the " Potter " books , " implications toward public policy are profound , " Slack said .
Slack , a former sketch comedian with an interest in building social movements , came up with the idea in 2005 after reading Potter books to children at a Boys and Girls Club , something he said transformed him .
" I saw that the books were n't just empowering personally , " he said .
" I think the books speak to something that is very unique , because [ " Potter " author ] J.K.
Rowling has been able to express a story about the importance of love . "
Slack founded the group with his friends Paul and Joe DeGeorge , members of a " wizard rock " band called " Harry and the Potters , " as well as comedian Seth Reibstein and music therapist Sarah Newberry .
Slack sees parallels between the magic in the " Potter " books and expanding one 's mind to come up with solutions in a creative way .
One of his mottos is " Do n't ignore the magic of being alive . "
One of the group 's projects has been to gather thousands of signatures for petitions in protest of the war in Darfur .
The alliance also helped hundreds to register to vote last year , according to Slack .
Earlier this year , the Harry Potter Alliance conducted a book drive for children around the world , an effort led by " Potter " actress Evanna Lynch .
Slack said they raised over 13,000 books , 4,000 of which went to youths in Rwanda who were very young at the time of the Rwandan genocide .
Slack also sees parallels between Voldemort and world leaders who have supported genocidal policies .
" Potter " author J.K. Rowling has many times compared Voldemort to Adolf Hitler .
On the other hand , Slack compares Potter 's mentor Dumbledore to Mahatma Gandhi , Martin Luther King , Jr. and John Lennon .
This has led to the group 's " What Would Dumbledore Do ? " campaign .
The campaign takes Dumbledore 's ethics and beliefs and translates them to the real world .
For the midnight screenings of " Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince , " members were encouraged to wear buttons mentioning lessons that Dumbledore taught them .
When iReporters were offered the opportunity to ask a question of President Obama , Slack knew exactly what he wanted to ask about : Darfur .
Slack thinks
Obama 's approach so far is " more than a disappointment .
... There 's a great deal of hope for Darfur , if President Obama can move on that . "
Rowling herself has praised the Harry Potter Alliance , one of Slack 's proudest moments .
" It 's incredible , it 's humbling , and it 's uplifting to see people going out there and doing that in the name of your character , " she told Time magazine in 2007 .
" What did my books preach against throughout ?
Bigotry , violence , struggles for power , no matter what .
All of these things are happening in Darfur .
So they really could n't have chosen a better cause . "
Rowling has also written personally to Slack about his efforts .
Science fiction and fantasy aficionados have translated their fandom into real - world action for years .
Recent examples : " Star Wars " fans put on a charity auction to benefit victims of the brushfires in Australia , and comic book fans such as " Crimson Fist " donned superhero costumes to help the needy .
Christopher " b ! x " Frakonis came up with the idea of screening the sci - fi movie " Serenity " for charity as a way of keeping it on the big screen in 2006 .
This year , 52 such " Ca n't Stop the Serenity " screenings are taking place around the world for charities such as the human rights organization Equality Now ! , in response to a challenge by the film 's director Joss Whedon .
Members of the Harry Potter Alliance , 4,500 of whom make up the most hardcore group , are inspired by what it has done .
" I know I would have loved to have had a group like this when I was a child or teenager , to support me and show that anything is possible if you put your mind to it , " said 29 - year - old Amanda Bolton , from Calgary , Alberta .
Bolton first learned about the group when it was mentioned on a fan podcast .
She was intrigued by the similarities between the plot of the books and its application to real life as well .
In the books , " muggle - borns and other intelligent nonhumans are discriminated against , treated like scum and forbidden from having equal rights , " she said , adding that love was the main weapon used against the forces of evil .
Like Slack , Bolton condemns the " Muggle mindset , " what members call an ignorance of or refusal to act on the important issues facing the world .
Some bloggers have criticized the group for taking their fandom too far or using young fans ' love of Harry Potter to promote an agenda .
Slack denies that he has a partisan agenda .
" I sort of took it as a compliment , " he explained .
At the same time , he hopes that at least some of their causes , such as promoting literacy , are things that all can agree on .
Alliance member Bobby Lang says that some within the group have occasionally raised questions about some of their projects .
" There have been some interesting debates over whether or not Dumbledore would be an activist , " he said , mentioning that some see Dumbledore as " teaching through living . "
Lang adds that such debates usually do n't get too heated , since " we 're all Harry Potter fans , we all have that in common . "
Noth Lang and Bolton say they are more knowledgeable about world affairs because of the organization 's connection to Harry Potter than they would be otherwise .
" There are issues I did n't know much about or had n't thought about too deeply that I 'm now involved in , like Darfur , " Bolton said .
" It has introduced me to new issues and new ideas . "

Google Android fans have long been waiting for official multitouch support on Android devices , but Google has yet to offer any confirmation .
Even at this year 's Google I / O developers conference where multitouch was a hot topic , I only heard that " we do n't know when it is coming . "
But after doing some digging and speaking to several sources with knowledge of the situation , it looks like Android users may finally get their wish this holiday season .
When is it coming ?
Allow me to start with the rumor of the day .
From what I understand , Android 2.0 will ship this year and will include multitouch support similar to what 's found on the iPhone and the Palm Pre .
This might sound far - fetched to some readers , but there is mounting evidence to back it up .
Several blogs have reported that Android will receive two more updates this year .
I believe the first will be a minor update based on the Donut branch of Android .
The second update , however , is likely to be a major refresh based off the Eclair branch .
The release schedule was recently echoed in a Reuters interview with Andy Rubin , director of mobile platforms at Google .
Reuters reported that Donut will become Android 1.6 and Eclair will ship as Android 2.0 .
So if Android 2.0 is coming this year , when exactly will it be released ?
Well , if the rumors are true , Google has chosen Motorola to showcase Eclair on one of its upcoming Android phones .
A Moto phone is quite plausible given the recent comments from Motorola CEO Sanjay Jha , who said that his company is " 100 percent " tied with Google .
He characterized Moto and Google 's relationship as " very solid " and said the two are coordinating their development effort .
Jha 's comments fall in line with what I 've seen about an upcoming device called the Motorola Sholes .
Several sources have told me that Sholes , which could launch on Verizon Wireless before year 's end , will be the flagship device for Google 's Eclair release .
What will it offer ?
Since Google apparently has decided to use the Android 2.0 branding this year , we can expect some significant upgrades to the mobile operating system .
As previously mentioned , multitouch support is one of the most requested features .
Android engineers have previously squashed hopes of seeing multitouch in the Donut update , but there is evidence that the company is working on it .
Google routinely drops new code into the Android Open Source Project ( AOSP ) that gives us a preview of what 's coming in Android .
Many independent developers use this open - source code to release custom versions of Android that you can flash onto a hacked phone .
Cyanogen , one of the most active developers , said there is nothing in the Donut Android code for multitouch , but there are new kernel commits to support it .
Some handset manufacturers like HTC have included their own multitouch features in phones like the Hero , but adding the feature through a software upgrade would be different because Google is directly involved .
Google , Motorola , and Verizon have been extremely quiet with the exact details of this looming launch .
With Motorola set to unveil its first Android phones at the upcoming Motodev Summit , we 'll finally know its secret .
And if everything turns out to be true , Verizon will have a hot smartphone and Google will have a worthy device for pitting Android 2.0 against the new iPhone OS 3.0 .
Prepare to be surprised .

はてなの注目キーワードではその日どんなキーワードを注目されているかが解って結構面白いです。視覚的に解るともっと面白いかもー、というわけで
PlotKit + GreaseMonkey でサクッと作ってみました。
こんな感じで表示されます。1画面内のグラフに主だったキーワードが表示されるので、「あっ、そういえばこの日こんな事あったよー」というのが解って割と面白いと思います。もちろんジャンル事の表示などにも対応してます。また例えば先日の大停電の日のグラフですが
このように、普段あまり使われてない「東電」というキーワードが一時的にめちゃくちゃ使われてる事が解って面白いです。
技術的なところでは 、GreaseMonkey の開発ならヤツに 丸投げ まかせろ！でお馴染みな砂糖さん の外部ライブラリを使う方 法( GreaseMonkey で MochiKit 使ってみる。すなわち外部ライブラリの読み込み。あるいははてなのグラフが綺麗じゃない ) で解説されている dll ( ) 関数で MochiKit と PlotKit を読み込んで使ってます 。
また PlotKit には EasyPlot ( ) という簡単にグラフを書くインターフェイスが用意されて居るのですが、割とデータを事前に加工しないと使えなかったりするので、自作の
PlotKit.
SimplePie というラッパーライブラリを使ってグラフを出力しています。使い方は
SimplePie( [ [ ラベル名 , 数値 ] , [ ラベル名 , 数値 ] , ... ] , // データの配列 コンテナ要素 , // DIV などのグラフを出力する要素 オプション //
Pie 描画のオプション + その他のラベル名 + %のしきい値 ) ;
などとして使います。たとえばこの GM では
Simple Pie( data , container , { axisLabelFontSize : 10 , threshold : 2 , otherLabel : ' Other ' } ) ;
フォントサイズは 10 で、割合が2%以下のデータはその他に含むようにしきい値を設定し、その他のラベル名を
' Other ' としています 。
