Dr Chris Britt ( left ) realised Mark Gurrieri 's condition straight away
Handshake recreated
Mark Gurrieri , 36 , from Loughton , Essex , was working in a restaurant when a friend introduced him to his dining partner , Dr Chris Britt .
The GP said he knew something was wrong when he shook Mr Gurrieri 's large , spongy feeling hand .
Mr Gurrieri underwent tests and was found to have acromegaly - caused by a tumour in the pituitary gland which leads to excess growth hormone .
The condition is seen in just three people per million , and can have serious effects if left undiagnosed .
It 's so rare most GPs would n't have seen patients with it
Dr Chris Britt
It causes problems with vision and can lead to diabetes and blood pressure problems .
If untreated acromegaly can also cause premature death .
Mr Gurrieri thought his hands were getting bigger because of too much DIY and working in his restaurant kitchen .
Surgery
He told the Ilford Recorder newspaper : " I felt good in myself up until that point , and did n't think I had a problem - just thought my conditions were down to getting older . "
He immediately booked an appointment with his GP , and tests confirmed he had the condition .
In January surgeons removed most of the 2 cm benign tumour growing at the base of his brain .
Mr Gurrieri , who has a seven - year - old son , must now take medication to keep the condition under control .
" My mum thinks Chris is my guardian angel , " he said .
" I could have lost my sight , or I could have had a number of other ailments , so I think I owe my life to Chris - and a few meals at the restaurant . "
Dr Britt , who works as a GP in Woodford Green , said he had not seen a case of acromegaly since he was a medical student working in a specialist hospital .
" It 's the sort of diagnosis you might make once in a career if you 're lucky .
It 's so rare most GPs would n't have seen patients with it . "

National party officials have decided to count only half of the delegates from Florida as a penalty for holding its primary earlier than allowed .
All of the remaining 57 delegates will be awarded to the candidate with the most votes statewide .
Without the penalty , Florida would allocate 114 delegates to the national convention based on the primary results : 75 of those would be divided among candidates with the most votes in each of the state ’s 25 Congressional districts .
The district - level delegates would be selected at caucuses held sometime between March and May .
The rest of the 39 delegates — 36 at - large delegates and three party officials selected at a party meeting — would be allocated to the candidate with the most votes statewide .
The car is designed for family use in India
The unveiling
The vehicle , called the Tata Nano , will sell for 100,000 rupees or $ 2,500 ( £ 1,277 ) and enable those in developing countries to move to four wheels .
The four - door five - seater car , which goes on sale later this year , has a 33 bhp , 624 cc , engine at the rear .
It has no air conditioning , no electric windows and no power steering , but two deluxe models will be on offer .
Tata will initially make about 250,000 Nanos and expects eventual annual demand of one million cars .
The price will be slightly more than the 100,000 once tax and other costs are taken into consideration .
The Nano release comes as India 's domestic car market is predicted to soar in the coming years on the back of the country 's fast - growing economy and increased consumer wealth .
' People 's car '
Indian car sales are predicted to more than quadruple to $ 145bn by 2016 .
Company chairman Ratan Tata said the launch of the Nano was a landmark in the history of transportation .
Tata Motors ' engineers and designers gave their all for about four years to realise this goal

He said the car was " a safe , affordable and all weather transport - a people 's car , designed to meet all safety standards and emissions laws and accessible to all " .
Environmental critics have said that the car will lead to mounting air and pollution problems on India 's already clogged roads .
But Tata said the car had passed emission standards and would average about 50 miles to the gallon , or five litres per hundred kilometres .
The firm also said it would introduce a diesel version of the Nano at a later date .
' Family transport '
At the unveiling ceremony Mr Tata said : " I observed families riding on two - wheelers - the father driving the scooter , his young kid standing in front of him , his wife seated behind him holding a little baby .

" It led me to wonder whether one could conceive of a safe , affordable , all - weather form of transport for such a family .
" Tata Motors ' engineers and designers gave their all for about four years to realise this goal .
" Today , we indeed have a People 's Car , which is affordable and yet built to meet safety requirements and emission norms , to be fuel efficient and low on emissions . "
Ravi Vangala , of Hyderbad , India , said : " I ... congratulate Tata for his dream , and I will definitely buy the Tata Nano car . "
WASHINGTON  Prodded in part by some of the nation ’s biggest banks , the Bush administration and Congress are considering costly new proposals for the government to rescue hundreds of thousands of homeowners whose mortgages are higher than the value of their houses .
Not since the Depression has a larger share of Americans owed more on their homes than they are worth .
With the collapse of the housing boom , nearly 8.8 million homeowners , or 10.3 percent of the total , are underwater .
That is more than double the percentage just a year ago , according to a new estimate of the damage by Moody ’s Economy.com .
Administration officials say they still oppose any taxpayer bailout for either people who borrowed more than they could afford or banks that made foolish loans during the height of the speculative bubble in housing .
But with the current efforts to arrest the housing collapse so far bearing little fruit , Washington is being forced to explore new ideas , among them the idea of a federal mortgage guarantee for troubled borrowers .
WASHINGTON , Oct. 5 — President Bush , reacting to a Congressional uproar over the disclosure of secret Justice Department legal opinions permitting the harsh interrogation of terrorism suspects , defended the methods on Friday , declaring , “ This government does not torture people . ”
The remarks , Mr. Bush ’s first public comments on the memorandums , came at a hastily arranged Oval Office appearance before reporters .
It was billed as a talk on the economy , but after heralding new job statistics , Mr. Bush shifted course to a subject he does not often publicly discuss : a once - secret Central Intelligence Agency program to detain and interrogate high - profile terror suspects .
“ I have put this program in place for a reason , and that is to better protect the American people , ” the president said , without mentioning the C.I.A. by name .
“ And when we find somebody who may have information regarding a potential attack on America , you bet we ’re going to detain them , and you bet we ’re going to question them , because the American people expect us to find out information — actionable intelligence so we can help protect them .
That ’s our job . ”
Without confirming the existence of the memorandums or discussing the explicit techniques they authorized , Mr. Bush said the interrogation methods had been “ fully disclosed to appropriate members of Congress . ”
1. Dusk
I 've always thought the name Dawn was a bit silly ( no offense ) , and especially subject to regional accents ( dahn , daun , don , etc. ) , but at least it 's optimistic .
Dusk is n't just strange , it 's depressing .
2 . Toolio
Pretty sure it's a joke , but who cares !
It 's friggin ' practical compared to some of the others .
3 . Tierrainney
I think this name is so densely packed with letters it will soon implode on itself , creating a star to rival our own sun .
4 . Taira Rose
Oh lord this entry 's cheesy .
I must 've drafted my comment on this one a dozen times before I scaled it back to the basics .
The breathy , reach - out - and - embrace - the - aura - of - the - universe tone gave me flashbacks of that summer I worked in a bookstore and had to reorganize the Self - Help / New Age section .
To this day the color " pale aqua " makes me cringe .
5 . In re : Rebecca
This one fits better in Etiquette Hell .
This is terrible .
If this one does n't gall you , there 's something wrong with you .
Period .
I mean , changing your mind about a name while the kid 's still an infant is OK by me ... better that than have them change it themselves on their 18th birthday , tears of rage streaming down their faces .
But to name your kid after someone and then a few months later take it back is about as low as it gets .
She should just spit on her sister - in - law and get it over with .
6 . Abeus
I actually do n't find much wrong with the name Abeus - provided the kid goes by Abe - it 's just the mother 's tone that I love .
There 's a real anger at being criticized under there , with a sort of creeping doubt and desperation .
I read that entry and it paints a whole psychological profile for me .
7 . D'Artagnan , Quillon , Griffon and Bayne
It 's so rare I get to hear back from one of these parents .
Most people who write to me are : a ) militant child - free folks who think I 'm sockin ' it to the breeders , b ) people sending me urban legends ( Orangejello , Uterus , Placenta , Female = " Femily , " Ophelia Balls , Crystal Shanda Lear , etc. ) c ) Teachers ... woah , do I get a lot of mail from teachers !
Now , D'Artagnan 's mom did n't write me directly , she posted this on a bulletin board that linked to me .
But her angry , wounded tone writing about being anonymous in a sea of Jennifers pairs so neatly with her , and I 'm being gentle here , bizarre names for her kids .
( Note : Evenutally she did write to me , but it was to take her post down .
I changed it to a paraphrased version instead , but the tone is consistent . )
These four names embody everything that goes wrong in the thought process on boys ' names : they are , or sound a lot like , last names
they sound Franco / Anglocentric and posh
they have non-intuitive spellings
they may or may not to have an ethnic origin , but conflict in what origin that may be and whether it is the heritage of the family
there 's an added Y Lady , I 'm sorry if it hurts your feelings that people think you gave your kids weird names .
But did you really anticipate otherwise ?

As one outraged reader wrote , " Do n't they realize ' Mc ' and ' Mac ' mean ' son of ' ? ? ? "

9 . Cinsere
I find this one two levels of strange : it 's strange in that it goes against the clear pattern of giving boys names that summon pictures of the Old West ( Colt , Cash , Maverick ) and girls names of delicate femininity , often more concept than trait .
Back in the day , women were often given names that were traits they should have : Charity , Faith , Hope , Prudence .
Now there are far more nouns , nouns which paint a more conceptual picture : Heaven , Angel , Solace , Flower , Destiny .
Here , for once , it 's a boy that gets an adjective for a name , but a more conceptual one , and then , for fun , gets it misspelled .

11 . Kryslyn
Talk about textbook .
We 've got a name that 's really a cross - bred hybrid of two names , the requisite - lyn , the replacement of everything possible with a K or Y .
Top it off with no obvious nickname to fall back on ( Krys ? ) and no ethnicity to balance / account for the weirdness , and we may have engineered before you the ultimate bad baby name : simulateously strange , stupid , difficult and boring .
12 . Blaze
I got an e-mail a while back from a lady who said she gave her potential baby names a test : did they fit better in the sentence , " Ladies and gentlemen , the President of the United States [ blank ] [ blank ] " or " And now , on the main stage , the Lusty Beaver Adult Club presents the hot action of [ blank ] [ blank ] . "
I think hospital forms should be reformatted to force parents to do just that .
13 . Brooklyn
In WWII movies , there 's always a guy from Brooklyn .
In WWIII movies , there will always be a guy NAMED Brooklyn .
14 . Oleo
I take back what I said about it making me think of cookies .
Or , as a lot of people pointed out , it being a name for generic margerine .
Now , and I can't explain why , it conjures the image of a cartoonish figure in a plush costume , sort of like Grimace from McDonald's , and he 's here to steal my Shamrock Shake .
He 's throwing margarine at me and I can't run because I 'm trapped in a giant mixing bowl !
No !
I do n't want to be a pie !

An open letter to the people of Wales , Ireland and Scotland on behalf of the U.S. and big chunks of Canada : I 'm sorry .
I 'm very , very sorry .
But here in North America , we seem to be harboring a class of people with an overzealous affinity for your nations and their history .
A breed of people who think Ireland and Wales , and to some extent Scotland , is some sort of mystical Avalon full of dainty faerie folk and think it 's somehow cultured to give their kids un -Anglicized Gaelic and Celtic names .
I know Welsh and Gaelic pronunciations are very different from English , but they 're not well - known here at all , so these parents are being three levels of mean : a ) giving a kid a difficult - to - say name , b ) spelled entirely different from how it 's said in English and c ) way , way pretentious because it 's a lot of effort for a name that Mom found in a Dungeons & Dragons guide and has no real connection to .
I 'm very sorry your history , language and culture are being appropriated by geeks .
What can I say , we 're really dumb sometimes .
Sorry , sorry , sorry .
17 . Kaytaquana and others
I do n't know what the hell is going on here .
Most of the list is entirely random , but Kaytaquana gets extra credit for appearing to be a name - ization of katakana , a Japanese alphabet .
Which , in retrospect , only makes my joke name of Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz that much more appropriate .

I stand corrected .
21 . Ruger
I made a joke about this sounding like a firearm without doing any research .
Turns out , oh yes , it 's a fire arm - a fire arm manufacturer , and a controversial one at that .
Seems some of your far - right paranoid gun-nuts ....er.... 2nd amendment enthusiasts .... have a problem with Ruger founder and chair Bill Ruger for advocating the banning of high - capacity magazines as a compromise to banning rapid - fire assault rifles as a whole .
( Remember , our twitchy - fingered friends who like to decide who lives and who dies would tell us , the authors of the U.S. Constitution wanted us to be able to spray 200 rounds a minute at anything we want .
And that makes Bill Ruger a traitor ! )
So be warned .
Name your kid Ruger and anti-fire arms folks will think you 're a freaky gun nut , pro-fire arms folks will think you 're some sort of left - wing commie from the guv'mint who wants to take away their precious , precious kill - sticks .

This lady 's name is fine .
In fact , that 's the issue I have with it .
She writes this long essay about how grotesque and horrible an ordeal her life has because ( sniff ! )
Grandma named her instead of Mom !
NNNOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OK , I see her point , it was rude of Granny , but her tone is ... I do n't know .
I find her tone to be incredibly snotty .
She 's framing her tale as overcoming adversity , or going from " victim " to " survivor , " but I 'm really not seeing it .
THEN there 's the thing about how one side just happens to be blue blood .
Well cripes , that makes your past indignities so much more terrible !
Not unlike the Grand Duchess Anastasia , crawling through the mud and slime disguised as a mere peasant to escape her assassins , her sumptuous robes now mere rags , her beautiful youthful visage dark and haunted !
Oh , the epic tragedy of .... wait , what was the half - assed bad thing that happened again ?
Oh , right , Grandma named you .
Oh , the horror ! ( swoon )

" It 's MY baby "
First off , she 's , uh , not good at expressing herself in writing .
Secondly , she 's psychotically combative about her designer baby names , asserting her ownership of her future children with the ferocity of a mama bear on crank .
They 're my children !
Mine !
MIIIIINE !!!!
But finally , and this is the important thing , she says everyone 's being supportive and LIKES her dopey names .
But she 's still ready to chew someone 's throat out at a moment 's notice if she thinks they MIGHT have an opinion , positive or negative .
She 's scary .
She 's what makes childfree - by - choicers militant .
And , in many cases , right .

" Cool " names
I admit , I use finger quotes a lot , but usually for parody purposes .
But they bug me .
I do n't like how most finger - quoters slow down , over enunciate and vamp what they 're saying in this giant forced show of post - modernism .
" I found that very AVANT GARDE "
( clenched - teeth laugh , clink of martini glasses )
Oh , you witty bitch .
This entry marks the first time I 've ever been able to hear finger quotes in writing .
Hey , maybe they 're not even meant to be there , but I think they 're there are and it changes everything .
It makes her smacking her " to - be husband " even snottier , his names even dafter , and these two things combine to make him sound like a weener and her like the boss ' spoiled daughter .
25 . Cierra , Makynzi and Quinlynn , Quinylin and derivitives
I hate all these , and more , for the same reasons , which I think summarize the advocacy intent of this site .
I appreciate these parents want their children to be unique .
I really do .
BUT ( and you knew there 'd be a " but " ) these parents are all foraging for this originality in one incredibly narrow direction , and when they feel the ( weird ) name they want is too common , they go to further and further extremes .
It 's strip - mining the alphabet ;
It 's like an arms race between parents .
The result are names like these - pretentious as hell names with difficult ( to guess , to reasonably explain ) spellings .
Meanwhile , outside of this narrow range of ideas , there 's a whole universe of other options being ignored .
In between the silly names , was there a single Claire or Hannah or Monica on this site ?
A single Charles or Kenneth ?
John ?
Mary ?
It 's not that I cut them - I rarely found them !
I get e-mail after e-mail from people bemoaning the fact their preschoolers are in classes with 2 , 3 or even 4 Madisons or Masons .
And I know from e-mail from teachers , and my own memory of growing up with Chris M. and Kris L. , that Madison and Madysyn will not be differentiated by a teacher .
So much for not being Matt R. Bottom line :
If you want to be original , stop following the trend .
It 's that simple .
By Joseph Stiglitz
When we look back someday at the catastrophe that was the Bush administration , we will think of many things : the tragedy of the Iraq war , the shame of Guantánamo and Abu Ghraib , the erosion of civil liberties .
The damage done to the American economy does not make front - page headlines every day , but the repercussions will be felt beyond the lifetime of anyone reading this page .
I can hear an irritated counterthrust already .
The president has not driven the United States into a recession during his almost seven years in office .
Unemployment stands at a respectable 4.6 percent .
Well , fine .
But the other side of the ledger groans with distress : a tax code that has become hideously biased in favor of the rich ; a national debt that will probably have grown 70 percent by the time this president leaves Washington ; a swelling cascade of mortgage defaults ; a record near - $ 850 billion trade deficit ; oil prices that are higher than they have ever been ; and a dollar so weak that for an American to buy a cup of coffee in London or Parisâ € ” or even the Yukonâ € ” becomes a venture in high finance .
And it gets worse .
After almost seven years of this president , the United States is less prepared than ever to face the future .
We have not been educating enough engineers and scientists , people with the skills we will need to compete with China and India .
We have not been investing in the kinds of basic research that made us the technological powerhouse of the late 20th century .
And although the president now understandsâ€ ” or so he saysâ € ” that we must begin to wean ourselves from oil and coal , we have on his watch become more deeply dependent on both .
Up to now , the conventional wisdom has been that Herbert Hoover , whose policies aggravated the Great Depression , is the odds - on claimant for the mantle " worst president " when it comes to stewardship of the American economy .
Once Franklin Roosevelt assumed office and reversed Hoover 's policies , the country began to recover .
The economic effects of Bush 's presidency are more insidious than those of Hoover , harder to reverse , and likely to be longer - lasting .
There is no threat of America 's being displaced from its position as the world 's richest economy .
But our grandchildren will still be living with , and struggling with , the economic consequences of Mr. Bush .
Remember the Surplus ?
The world was a very different place , economically speaking , when George W. Bush took office , in January 2001 .
During the Roaring 90s , many had believed that the Internet would transform everything .
Productivity gains , which had averaged about 1.5 percent a year from the early 1970s through the early 90s , now approached 3 percent .
During Bill Clinton 's second term , gains in manufacturing productivity sometimes even surpassed 6 percent .
The Federal Reserve chairman , Alan Greenspan , spoke of a New Economy marked by continued productivity gains as the Internet buried the old ways of doing business .
Others went so far as to predict an end to the business cycle .
Greenspan worried aloud about how he'd ever be able to manage monetary policy once the nation 's debt was fully paid off .
This tremendous confidence took the Dow Jones index higher and higher .
The rich did well , but so did the not - so - rich and even the downright poor .
The Clinton years were not an economic Nirvana ; as chairman of the president 's Council of Economic Advisers during part of this time , I 'm all too aware of mistakes and lost opportunities .
The global - trade agreements we pushed through were often unfair to developing countries .
We should have invested more in infrastructure , tightened regulation of the securities markets , and taken additional steps to promote energy conservation .
We fell short because of politics and lack of moneyâ€ ” and also , frankly , because special interests sometimes shaped the agenda more than they should have .
But these boom years were the first time since Jimmy Carter that the deficit was under control .
And they were the first time since the 1970s that incomes at the bottom grew faster than those at the topâ€ ” a benchmark worth celebrating .
By the time George W. Bush was sworn in , parts of this bright picture had begun to dim .
The tech boom was over .
The nasdaq fell 15 percent in the single month of April 2000 , and no one knew for sure what effect the collapse of the Internet bubble would have on the real economy .
It was a moment ripe for Keynesian economics , a time to prime the pump by spending more money on education , technology , and infrastructureâ € ” all of which America desperately needed , and still does , but which the Clinton administration had postponed in its relentless drive to eliminate the deficit .
Bill Clinton had left President Bush in an ideal position to pursue such policies .
Remember the presidential debates in 2000 between Al Gore and George Bush , and how the two men argued over how to spend America 's anticipated $ 2.2 trillion budget surplus ?
The country could well have afforded to ramp up domestic investment in key areas .
In fact , doing so would have staved off recession in the short run while spurring growth in the long run .
But the Bush administration had its own ideas .
The first major economic initiative pursued by the president was a massive tax cut for the rich , enacted in June of 2001 .
Those with incomes over a million got a tax cut of $ 18,000â € ” more than 30 times larger than the cut received by the average American .
The inequities were compounded by a second tax cut , in 2003 , this one skewed even more heavily toward the rich .
Together these tax cuts , when fully implemented and if made permanent , mean that in 2012 the average reduction for an American in the bottom 20 percent will be a scant $ 45 , while those with incomes of more than $ 1 million will see their tax bills reduced by an average of $ 162,000 .
The administration crows that the economy grewâ € ” by some 16 percentâ€ ” during its first six years , but the growth helped mainly people who had no need of any help , and failed to help those who need plenty .
A rising tide lifted all yachts .
Inequality is now widening in America , and at a rate not seen in three - quarters of a century .
A young male in his 30s today has an income , adjusted for inflation , that is 12 percent less than what his father was making 30 years ago .
Some 5.3 million more Americans are living in poverty now than were living in poverty when Bush became president .
America 's class structure may not have arrived there yet , but it 's heading in the direction of Brazil 's and Mexico's .
The Bankruptcy Boom
In breathtaking disregard for the most basic rules of fiscal propriety , the administration continued to cut taxes even as it undertook expensive new spending programs and embarked on a financially ruinous " war of choice " in Iraq .
A budget surplus of 2.4 percent of gross domestic product ( G.D.P. ) , which greeted Bush as he took office , turned into a deficit of 3.6 percent in the space of four years .
The United States had not experienced a turnaround of this magnitude since the global crisis of World War II .
Agricultural subsidies were doubled between 2002 and 2005 .
Tax expendituresâ € ” the vast system of subsidies and preferences hidden in the tax codeâ € ” increased more than a quarter .
Tax breaks for the president 's friends in the oil - and - gas industry increased by billions and billions of dollars .
Yes , in the five years after 9/11 , defense expenditures did increase ( by some 70 percent ) , though much of the growth was n't helping to fight the War on Terror at all , but was being lost or outsourced in failed missions in Iraq .
Meanwhile , other funds continued to be spent on the usual high - tech gimcrackeryâ€ ” weapons that do n't work , for enemies we do n't have .
In a nutshell , money was being spent everyplace except where it was needed .
During these past seven years the percentage of G.D.P. spent on research and development outside defense and health has fallen .
Little has been done about our decaying infrastructureâ € ” be it levees in New Orleans or bridges in Minneapolis .
Coping with most of the damage will fall to the next occupant of the White House .
Although it railed against entitlement programs for the needy , the administration enacted the largest increase in entitlements in four decadesâ € ” the poorly designed Medicare prescription - drug benefit , intended as both an election - season bribe and a sop to the pharmaceutical industry .
As internal documents later revealed , the true cost of the measure was hidden from Congress .
Meanwhile , the pharmaceutical companies received special favors .
To access the new benefits , elderly patients could n't opt to buy cheaper medications from Canada or other countries .
The law also prohibited the U.S. government , the largest single buyer of prescription drugs , from negotiating with drug manufacturers to keep costs down .
As a result , American consumers pay far more for medications than people elsewhere in the developed world .
You 'll still hear someâ€ ” and , loudly , the president himselfâ€ ” argue that the administration 's tax cuts were meant to stimulate the economy , but this was never true .
The bang for the buckâ€ ” the amount of stimulus per dollar of deficitâ€ ” was astonishingly low .
Therefore , the job of economic stimulation fell to the Federal Reserve Board , which stepped on the accelerator in a historically unprecedented way , driving interest rates down to 1 percent .
In real terms , taking inflation into account , interest rates actually dropped to negative 2 percent .
The predictable result was a consumer spending spree .
Looked at another way , Bush 's own fiscal irresponsibility fostered irresponsibility in everyone else .
Credit was shoveled out the door , and subprime mortgages were made available to anyone this side of life support .
Credit - card debt mounted to a whopping $ 900 billion by the summer of 2007 .
" Qualified at birth " became the drunken slogan of the Bush era .
American households took advantage of the low interest rates , signed up for new mortgages with " teaser " initial rates , and went to town on the proceeds .
All of this spending made the economy look better for a while ; the president could ( and did ) boast about the economic statistics .
But the consequences for many families would become apparent within a few years , when interest rates rose and mortgages proved impossible to repay .
The president undoubtedly hoped the reckoning would come sometime after 2008 .
It arrived 18 months early .
As many as 1.7 million Americans are expected to lose their homes in the months ahead .
For many , this will mean the beginning of a downward spiral into poverty .
Between March 2006 and March 2007 personal - bankruptcy rates soared more than 60 percent .
As families went into bankruptcy , more and more of them came to understand who had won and who had lost as a result of the president 's 2005 bankruptcy bill , which made it harder for individuals to discharge their debts in a reasonable way .
The lenders that had pressed for " reform " had been the clear winners , gaining added leverage and protections for themselves ; people facing financial distress got the shaft .
And Then There 's Iraq
The war in Iraq ( along with , to a lesser extent , the war in Afghanistan ) has cost the country dearly in blood and treasure .
The loss in lives can never be quantified .
As for the treasure , it 's worth calling to mind that the administration , in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq , was reluctant to venture an estimate of what the war would cost ( and publicly humiliated a White House aide who suggested that it might run as much as $ 200 billion ) .
When pressed to give a number , the administration suggested $ 50 billionâ € ” what the United States is actually spending every few months .
Today , government figures officially acknowledge that more than half a trillion dollars total has been spent by the U.S. " in theater . "
But in fact the overall cost of the conflict could be quadruple that amountâ€ ” as a study I did with Linda Bilmes of Harvard has pointed outâ€ ” even as the Congressional Budget Office now concedes that total expenditures are likely to be more than double the spending on operations .
The official numbers do not include , for instance , other relevant expenditures hidden in the defense budget , such as the soaring costs of recruitment , with re-enlistment bonuses of as much as $ 100,000 .
They do not include the lifetime of disability and health - care benefits that will be required by tens of thousands of wounded veterans , as many as 20 percent of whom have suffered devastating brain and spinal injuries .
Astonishingly , they do not include much of the cost of the equipment that has been used in the war , and that will have to be replaced .
If you also take into account the costs to the economy from higher oil prices and the knock - on effects of the warâ€ ” for instance , the depressing domino effect that war - fueled uncertainty has on investment , and the difficulties U.S. firms face overseas because America is the most disliked country in the worldâ € ” the total costs of the Iraq war mount , even by a conservative estimate , to at least $ 2 trillion .
To which one needs to add these words : so far .
It is natural to wonder , What would this money have bought if we had spent it on other things ?
U.S. aid to all of Africa has been hovering around $ 5 billion a year , the equivalent of less than two weeks of direct Iraq - war expenditures .
The president made a big deal out of the financial problems facing Social Security , but the system could have been repaired for a century with what we have bled into the sands of Iraq .
Had even a fraction of that $ 2 trillion been spent on investments in education and technology , or improving our infrastructure , the country would be in a far better position economically to meet the challenges it faces in the future , including threats from abroad .
For a sliver of that $ 2 trillion we could have provided guaranteed access to higher education for all qualified Americans .
The soaring price of oil is clearly related to the Iraq war .
The issue is not whether to blame the war for this but simply how much to blame it .
It seems unbelievable now to recall that Bush - administration officials before the invasion suggested not only that Iraq 's oil revenues would pay for the war in its entiretyâ€ ” had n't we actually turned a tidy profit from the 1991 Gulf War ?â € ” but also that war was the best way to ensure low oil prices .
In retrospect , the only big winners from the war have been the oil companies , the defense contractors , and al - Qaeda .
Before the war , the oil markets anticipated that the then price range of $ 20 to $ 25 a barrel would continue for the next three years or so .
Market players expected to see more demand from China and India , sure , but they also anticipated that this greater demand would be met mostly by increased production in the Middle East .
The war upset that calculation , not so much by curtailing oil production in Iraq , which it did , but rather by heightening the sense of insecurity everywhere in the region , suppressing future investment .
The continuing reliance on oil , regardless of price , points to one more administration legacy : the failure to diversify America 's energy resources .
Leave aside the environmental reasons for weaning the world from hydrocarbonsâ € ” the president has never convincingly embraced them , anyway .
The economic and national - security arguments ought to have been powerful enough .
Instead , the administration has pursued a policy of " drain America first " â€ ” that is , take as much oil out of America as possible , and as quickly as possible , with as little regard for the environment as one can get away with , leaving the country even more dependent on foreign oil in the future , and hope against hope that nuclear fusion or some other miracle will come to the rescue .
So many gifts to the oil industry were included in the president 's 2003 energy bill that John McCain referred to it as the " No Lobbyist Left Behind " bill .
Contempt for the World
America 's budget and trade deficits have grown to record highs under President Bush .
To be sure , deficits do n't have to be crippling in and of themselves .
If a business borrows to buy a machine , it 's a good thing , not a bad thing .
During the past six years , Americaâ € ” its government , its families , the country as a wholeâ€ ” has been borrowing to sustain its consumption .
Meanwhile , investment in fixed assetsâ€ ” the plants and equipment that help increase our wealthâ€ ” has been declining .
What 's the impact of all this down the road ?
The growth rate in America 's standard of living will almost certainly slow , and there could even be a decline .
The American economy can take a lot of abuse , but no economy is invincible , and our vulnerabilities are plain for all to see .
As confidence in the American economy has plummeted , so has the value of the dollarâ € ” by 40 percent against the euro since 2001 .
The disarray in our economic policies at home has parallels in our economic policies abroad .
President Bush blamed the Chinese for our huge trade deficit , but an increase in the value of the yuan , which he has pushed , would simply make us buy more textiles and apparel from Bangladesh and Cambodia instead of China ; our deficit would remain unchanged .
The president claimed to believe in free trade but instituted measures aimed at protecting the American steel industry .
The United States pushed hard for a series of bilateral trade agreements and bullied smaller countries into accepting all sorts of bitter conditions , such as extending patent protection on drugs that were desperately needed to fight aids .
We pressed for open markets around the world but prevented China from buying Unocal , a small American oil company , most of whose assets lie outside the United States .
Not surprisingly , protests over U.S. trade practices erupted in places such as Thailand and Morocco .
But America has refused to compromiseâ € ” refused , for instance , to take any decisive action to do away with our huge agricultural subsidies , which distort international markets and hurt poor farmers in developing countries .
This intransigence led to the collapse of talks designed to open up international markets .
As in so many other areas , President Bush worked to undermine multilateralismâ € ” the notion that countries around the world need to cooperateâ € ” and to replace it with an America - dominated system .
In the end , he failed to impose American dominanceâ € ” but did succeed in weakening cooperation .
The administration 's basic contempt for global institutions was underscored in 2005 when it named Paul Wolfowitz , the former deputy secretary of defense and a chief architect of the Iraq war , as president of the World Bank .
Widely distrusted from the outset , and soon caught up in personal controversy , Wolfowitz became an international embarrassment and was forced to resign his position after less than two years on the job .
Globalization means that America 's economy and the rest of the world have become increasingly interwoven .
Consider those bad American mortgages .
As families default , the owners of the mortgages find themselves holding worthless pieces of paper .
The originators of these problem mortgages had already sold them to others , who packaged them , in a non-transparent way , with other assets , and passed them on once again to unidentified others .
When the problems became apparent , global financial markets faced real tremors : it was discovered that billions in bad mortgages were hidden in portfolios in Europe , China , and Australia , and even in star American investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Bear Stearns .
Indonesia and other developing countriesâ€ ” innocent bystanders , reallyâ€ ” suffered as global risk premiums soared , and investors pulled money out of these emerging markets , looking for safer havens .
It will take years to sort out this mess .
Meanwhile , we have become dependent on other nations for the financing of our own debt .
Today , China alone holds more than $ 1 trillion in public and private American I.O.U.'s .
Cumulative borrowing from abroad during the six years of the Bush administration amounts to some $ 5 trillion .
Most likely these creditors will not call in their loansâ € ” if they ever did , there would be a global financial crisis .
But there is something bizarre and troubling about the richest country in the world not being able to live even remotely within its means .
Just as Guantánamo and Abu Ghraib have eroded America 's moral authority , so the Bush administration 's fiscal housekeeping has eroded our economic authority .
The Way Forward
Whoever moves into the White House in January 2009 will face an unenviable set of economic circumstances .
Extricating the country from Iraq will be the bloodier task , but putting America 's economic house in order will be wrenching and take years .
The most immediate challenge will be simply to get the economy 's metabolism back into the normal range .
That will mean moving from a savings rate of zero ( or less ) to a more typical savings rate of , say , 4 percent .
While such an increase would be good for the long - term health of America 's economy , the short - term consequences would be painful .
Money saved is money not spent .
If people do n't spend money , the economic engine stalls .
If households curtail their spending quicklyâ € ” as they may be forced to do as a result of the meltdown in the mortgage marketâ€ ” this could mean a recession ; if done in a more measured way , it would still mean a protracted slowdown .
The problems of foreclosure and bankruptcy posed by excessive household debt are likely to get worse before they get better .
And the federal government is in a bind : any quick restoration of fiscal sanity will only aggravate both problems .
And in any case there 's more to be done .
What is required is in some ways simple to describe : it amounts to ceasing our current behavior and doing exactly the opposite .
It means not spending money that we do n't have , increasing taxes on the rich , reducing corporate welfare , strengthening the safety net for the less well off , and making greater investment in education , technology , and infrastructure .
When it comes to taxes , we should be trying to shift the burden away from things we view as good , such as labor and savings , to things we view as bad , such as pollution .
With respect to the safety net , we need to remember that the more the government does to help workers improve their skills and get affordable health care the more we free up American businesses to compete in the global economy .
Finally , we 'll be a lot better off if we work with other countries to create fair and efficient global trade and financial systems .
We 'll have a better chance of getting others to open up their markets if we ourselves act less hypocriticallyâ € ” that is , if we open our own markets to their goods and stop subsidizing American agriculture .
Some portion of the damage done by the Bush administration could be rectified quickly .
A large portion will take decades to fixâ € ” and that 's assuming the political will to do so exists both in the White House and in Congress .
Think of the interest we are paying , year after year , on the almost $ 4 trillion of increased debt burdenâ € ” even at 5 percent , that 's an annual payment of $ 200 billion , two Iraq wars a year forever .
Think of the taxes that future governments will have to levy to repay even a fraction of the debt we have accumulated .
And think of the widening divide between rich and poor in America , a phenomenon that goes beyond economics and speaks to the very future of the American Dream .
In short , there 's a momentum here that will require a generation to reverse .
Decades hence we should take stock , and revisit the conventional wisdom .
Will Herbert Hoover still deserve his dubious mantle ?
I 'm guessing that George W. Bush will have earned one more grim superlative .

Using biofuels made from corn , sugar cane and soy could have a greater environmental impact than burning fossil fuels , according to experts .
Although the fuels themselves emit fewer greenhouse gases , they all have higher costs in terms of biodiversity loss and destruction of farmland .
The problems of climate change and the rising cost of oil have led to a race to develop environmentally - friendly biofuels , such as palm oil or ethanol derived from corn and sugar cane .
The EU has proposed that 10 % of all fuel used in transport should come from biofuels by 2020 and the emerging global market is expected to be worth billions of dollars a year .
But the new fuels have attracted controversy .
" Regardless of how effective sugar cane is for producing ethanol , its benefits quickly diminish if carbon - rich tropical forests are being razed to make the sugar cane fields , thereby causing vast greenhouse - gas emission increases , " Jörn Scharlemann and William Laurance , of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama , write in Science today .
" Such comparisons become even more lopsided if the full environmental benefits of tropical forests - for example , for biodiversity conservation , hydrological functioning , and soil protection - are included . "
Efforts to work out which crops are most environmentally friendly have , until now , focused only on the amount of greenhouse gases a fuel emits when it is burned .
Scharlemann and Laurance highlighted a more comprehensive method , developed by Rainer Zah of the Empa Research Institute in Switzerland , that can take total environmental impacts - such as loss of forests and farmland and effects on biodiversity - into account .
In a study of 26 biofuels the Swiss method showed that 21 fuels reduced greenhouse - gas emissions by more than 30 % compared with gasoline when burned .
But almost half of the biofuels , a total of 12 , had greater total environmental impacts than fossil fuels .
These included economically - significant fuels such as US corn ethanol , Brazilian sugar cane ethanol and soy diesel , and Malaysian palm - oil diesel .
Biofuels that fared best were those produced from waste products such as recycled cooking oil , as well as ethanol from grass or wood .
Scharlemann and Laurance also pointed to " perverse " government initiatives that had resulted in unintended environmental impacts .
In the US , for example , farmers have been offered incentives to shift from growing soy to growing corn for biofuels .
" This is helping to drive up global soy prices , which in turn amplifies economic incentives to destroy Amazonian forests and Brazilian tropical savannas for soy production . "
They added : " The findings highlight the enormous differences in costs and benefits among different biofuels .
There is a clear need to consider more than just energy and greenhouse gas emissions when evaluating different biofuels and to pursue new biofuel crops and technologies . "
Andy Tait , campaign manager at Greenpeace , said : " We 're already bought into mandatory targets for the use of biofuels with very little thought of what the environmental impacts will be .
This study further confirms that there are serious risks associated with first generation biofuels , particularly from corn , soya and palm oil . "
He said that the biofuel technology had been oversold by industry and politicians .
" It 's clear that what government and industry are trying to do is find a neat , drop - in solution that allows people to continue business as usual .
" If you 're looking at the emissions from the transport sector , the first thing you need to look at is fuel efficiency and massively increasing it .
That needs to come before you even get to the point of discussing which biofuels might be good or bad . "
Kathy Griffin Banned From ' The View ' Babs Miffed ( Video )
is an outspoken comedian who has apparently stepped over the line , at least whereis concerned .
Griffin does a dead on impersonation of Babs .
She has been performing her standup act in a sold out run at Madison Square Garden .
Her final show is tonight , and she had planned to be a guest on this morning 's broadcast of the popular talk show , The View .
Griffin apparently received a phone call yesterday from the shows producer Bill Geddie .
He informed her that they have canceled her scheduled appearance because she was too mean to Barbara during her last special on Bravo .
The comedian said that she had been banned once before , but was incredulous to have been rebanned .
Griffin is likely to use this momentary setback as fodder for her stand up act .
Babs may regret the slight because of the ensuing fallout that is likely to occur .
The subject is likely to be a Hot Topic on this mornings show .
It will be interesting to hear what kind of spin Walters will use to plead her case .
During the search for a Rosie O'Donnell replacement , Griffin was thought to be a possible replacement and appeared frequently as part of the hosting panel and appeared to get under Walter 's skin on several occasions with her irreverent remarks .
Play video clip below to see Babs hostility toward the comedian .
Kathy Griffin can't help herself .
She loves conflict and declared she was jealous of the Rosie and Elizabeth Hasselbeck feud , wishing for some controversy to puff up her public profile .
She 'll make the most of this one - no doubt about it .
Health Insurer to Be Charged With Teen 's Murder Calif .
family says it will sue medical insurer delaying a lifesaving surgery .
Dec. 21 , 2007  --
The family of a California teenager who died awaiting a liver transplant said they would sue the insurer whom they blame for their daughter 's death .
Nataline Sarkisyan , a 17 - year - old from Glendale , Calif. , died Thursday just a few hours after her insurer , Cigna HealthCare , approved a procedure it had previously described as " too experimental . "
Attorney Mark Geragos said that Cigna " maliciously killed her " and that he hopes to press murder or manslaughter charges against Cigna HealthCare for the death of Sarkisyan .
District Attorney spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons declined to comment on the request for murder or manslaughter charges , saying it would be inappropriate to do so until Geragos submits evidence supporting his request .
" They took my daughter away from me , " said Nataline 's father , Krikor , who appeared at a news conference with his 21 - year - old son , Bedros .
Cigna appears to have reversed its decision to deny the transplant after about 150 teenagers and nurses protested outside its Glendale office Thursday .
" Protestors are here , the war is here , " Hilda Sarkisyan , the girl 's mother , told the group hours before her daughter 's death .
" We have a war here . "
The Sarkisyan family claims that Cigna first agreed to the liver transplant surgery and had secured a match weeks ago .
After the teen , who was battling leukemia , received a bone marrow transplant from her brother , however , she suffered a lung infection , and the insurer backed away from what it felt had become too risky a procedure .
" They 're the ones who caused this .
They 're the one that told us to go there , and they would pay for the transplant , " Hilda Sarkisyan said .
Geri Jenkins of the California Nurses Association said the Sarkisyans had insurance , and medical providers felt comfortable performing the medical procedure .
In that situation , the the insurer should defer to medical experts , she said .
" They have insurance , and there 's no reason that the doctors ' judgment should be overrided by a bean counter sitting there in an insurance office , " Jenkins said .
Doctors at the UCLA Medical Center actually signed a letter urging Cigna to review its decision .
Nataline Sarkisyan was sedated into a coma to stabilize her as the family filed appeals in the case .
During the middle of Thursday 's protest , Hilda Sarkisyan fielded a call from Cigna alerting her that her daughter 's procedure had been given the green light .
Cigna released a statement announcing the company " decided to make an exception in this rare and unusual case and we will provide coverage should she proceed with the requested liver transplant . "
The cheers , however , soon gave way to concern as the the hospital called to say that Nataline 's health had taken a serious downturn .
The family was forced to make the decision to take her off life support , and she later died .
The battle to convince Cigna to support the medical procedure had taken too long .
" My daughter … she 's in God 's hands right now , " her father Greg Sarkisyan said .
Associated Press contributed to this report .
Chris Davies , a Liberal Member of the European Parliament ( MEP ) for the North - West of the UK , is a member of the Budget Control Committee of the European Parliament .
As he told BBC ’s Today Programme ( listen here ) , he discovered , quite by chance , that Parliament ’s auditors had made a report detailing abuses on a vast scale , abuses that suggest some MEPs are simply plundering the system to enrich themselves .
Notwithstanding that he is a member of the Budget Control Committee , Mr. Davies was only allowed to see the report on condition that he signed all sorts of confidentiality agreements , read the report in a sealed “ secret room ” , protected by biometric locks and security guards and neither made a copy of nor took notes of the report .
Mr. Davies said the report contained accounts of abuse – let ’s call a spade a spade here and call it theft and fraud – on a truly shocking scale .
Though individuals were not named he made it clear that the extent of the embezzlement and fraud was on such a scale that it could only be met with condign prison sentences for some of those engaged in such practices .
OLAF , the EU Fraud Squad , had not yet heard of this report which makes one wonder if attempts are being made to bury it so as not to rock the boat and to conceal from the European people the extent to which MEPs are looting the public purse for their own enrichment .
Davies made a number of politically rather incorrect statements about where he reckons the worst offenders come from and it is not from the UK , Scandinavia , The Netherlands .
So widespread is the abuse that the AVERAGE amount being nicked is £ 125,000 ( $ 245,000 , € 166,000 ) for each one of the Parliament ’s 785 MEPs .
So bad is the situation that Hans - Gert Pöttering , its president , and a group of senior MEPs are desperately trying to find ways to ensure that there was no “ collateral damage ” from the report ( which presumably means trying to ensure that their heads do not roll as a result of their failure to act in the matter which would thus have the effect of removing them from the gravy train ) .
The excuse being given for this exercise is laughable :
“ We want reform but we cannot make this report available to the public if we want people to vote in the European elections next year . ”
Some might think that publication would actually increase turnout at these elections when the people of Europe realise just why all these largely Europhile MEPs love the European Union and its Parliament so much .
Perhaps then they might turn to some more Eurosceptic politicians of their own , less inclined to view the European Parliament as a milch cow upon whose hind teat they can fasten .
That , one suspects , is what the source really meant : “ We are frightened for our own place on the gravy train ” .
Even more laughable is the explanation that the document is not being kept secret as such , merely confidential , a circumlocution that is both worthy of Sir Humphrey Appleby of Yes Minister and Orwellian :
“ The document is not secret .
It is confidential .
It can be read by Euro - MPs on the budget control committee , in the secret room but not generally .
That is not the same as a secret document nobody can read . ”
So that is all right then .
What is clear , though , is that the public interest demands that this document be published forthwith so that the people who pay for all this , Europe ’s Taxpayers , can see what is going on .

My post of a few weeks ago got a bit of attention .
I was called a Communist by one person .
Someone else suggested I was a secret member of the long - defunct FBI program COINTELPRO .
Markos Moulitsas of the Daily Kos approvingly linked to it from the main page of The Daily Kos .
The Freedom Democrats had a small discussion , including the notation that they could tell that “ the person who wrote it is not really a libertarian . ”
Enough people on reddit believed the post would cause damage to the candidacy of Ron Paul and down - modded it .
I have written this article in response to a few comments :
Libertas questioned :
Umm .. how exactly does ‘ Kos Libertarian ’ differ from the standard Democrat , other than opposing the various lobbies ?
… What you are describing is not Libertarianism ; it is the noble , but slippery slope to government expansion and to the loss of freedom .
A “ Jay ” opined :
It appears then that ‘ Libertarian Democrats ’ need to go look up the definition of ‘ corporation ’ .
If you would have done that first you might not have made an ass out of yourself and completely discredited yourself with such an absurd quote .
symphonyofdissent argued that :
… there is a real distinction between a progressive and a left - libertarian … Progressivism does not view the individual as the critical unit , but instead views society as a whole .
The sacrifice of individual liberty is justified if it benefits society on the whole Libertarianism views individuals as the primary unit of interest .

he is pulling democrats into his camp with fearless stances .
Fred Fnord had a thoughtful comment , which you should read in full .
This post is responding to a number of these points .
As always , feel free to comment .
The essence of libertarianism
I cannot do justice to the philosophy of libertarianism in a single post , and I will not try .
But I think we can all agree that there are two main ideas at the base of a libertarian politics :
I exist as an individual and I own myself ; and “ Where the State begins , individual liberty ceases , and vice versa . ”
In a pragmatic sense , the goal , or the teleological end , of libertarianism is the promotion of individual liberty .
Coming to the libertarian liberal philosophy
To summarize the point both I and Markos Moulitsas were making :
Kos Libertarians believe we do not need a government small enough to drown in a bathtub as Grover Norquist famously said .
Rather , we need a government that is as small as possible , while still allowing it to act as a check against corporate power .
In other words , Kos Libertarians believe we need a government that not only butts out of our life , but that guards our rights against others .
History has proven time and again that individuals and liberties will be trampled upon by the powerful without preemptive action by the government .
Corporations take advantage of their special status in order to circumvent legal responsibility for their actions .
The kind of libertarianism favored by many towards the right - wing of the political spectrum involves going back to the 1890s , when corporations were first granted the rights of individuals and had few regulations imposed on them ; and also when the government had fewer powers and intruded less on the life of the ordinary person .
But the changes that occurred after that point happened for a reason .
The traditional libertarian remedy of requiring individuals to bring suit against companies for any harm done to them failed .
Corporations exerted enormous power and subverted the courts to their will .
They forced workers to toil in unsafe conditions ; they made faulty products ; they exploited natural resources without giving anything back to the community ; they polluted the air , water , and soil .
If the government had not stepped in in the early 1900s under Teddy Roosevelt and in the 1930s under Franklin Roosevelt , the capitalist system of free markets guided by “ an invisible hand ” would have perished .
Government began to assume more power in a large part to act as a check against the corporate abuses of their growing power .
Yet by the 1980s , it was obvious to many Americans that the government could do great harm , even when it was trying to act beneficently .
The welfare program helped entrench people in ghettos ; the Vietnam War , fought to save the Vietnamese from Communism , had accomplished nothing ; the national security system created to respond to the domestic and international threat of the Cold War had turned against dissenters and political opponents ; the growing domestic spending led to huge deficits and inflation .
The government was clearly a problem .
The libertarian liberal philosophy is a response to this moment in history – synthesizing the critique of capitalism inherent in the New Deal and the critique of government inherent in the Reagan Revolution .
What does a libertarian liberal believe
At the heart of American liberalism , there has always been a contradiction .
American liberals have long fought for individual rights against the state – especially in matter relating to criminal law , civil rights , minority rights , and free speech .
At the same time , American liberals fought for greater state intervention in the economy and daily life of the nation .
The American liberal tradition had not acknowledged that by giving the state greater power , we were in effect conceding individual freedoms .
Even if that power was required to be used to help individuals , it would inevitably have negative side effects , making these individuals dependent on the state and giving the government more power and ability to manipulate individuals .
Today , many liberals have come to see this reality .
While we still believe that government can be used for good , we are much more cautious about what government can and should do .
The libertarian liberal approach is pragmatic rather than ideological .
It is about maximizing individual liberty with one caveat : the moral duty to empower the impoverished and the disadvantaged .
Maximizing individual liberty means using the government as a check against corporations ; it means setting up checks and balances within the government itself ; it means a strong media , willing to challenge the government and corporations ; it means strong individual rights to keep the government and corporations in check ; it means elections that are meaningful .
To maximize individual liberties , we need to constantly balance the many competing forces in such a way as to give each person the rights that are their birthright .
The difference between a liberal and a libertarian liberal
The goals of liberals and libertarian liberals are similar if not the same .
The difference is in the approach .
For example , let ’s look at health care .
As a traditional liberal , Dennis Kucinich does not see value in a libertarian view of the problem .
Government , for him , cannot be the problem ; it must be the entire solution .
He wants to eliminate the system as it is and impose a government - run health care plan on everyone , whether they want it or not .
To take another example of a more pragmatic traditional liberal , Hillary Clinton , does not want to eliminate the system , but wants to work within it .
She wants to take a number of steps to make it easier for the average person to buy health insurance , including opening up the plan used by members of Congress to the population at large .
But she also plans to mandate that every person get and maintain health insurance .
Barak Obama ’s plan is similar to Hillary ’s but with one crucial difference .
He too plans on taking a number of steps to make health insurance more affordable , and to open up Congress ’s plan to the rest of the country , to invest more in health care infrastructure , and take a number of steps to reduce costs .
But he will not force anyone adult to get health insurance .
This is the difference between a traditional liberal and a libertarian liberal .
Both see a problem – a problem that the free market is making worse – and both believe that the government must act .
Neither believes that a complete overhaul of the system can happen – for pragmatic reasons , if nothing else .
Both lay out similar steps that need to be taken – to reduce prices , to enable individuals to afford health care , and to make it more available .
But Hillary believes the government needs to force independent and competent people to get health care ; Obama does not .
There are arguments to be made as to why the government should force people to get health care – Paul Krugman has been harping on these for some time – but if one believes that the government should only use force when it is absolutely necessary , as a libertarian does , then Obama ’s program is better because it respects individual rights .
The best use of government in a libertarian liberal view is when it is able to empower individuals and act as a check against corporate abuse of individual liberty .
Obama ’s plan does this ; with Hillary ’s plan individuals are empowered to act against corporations , and corporate power is checked – but the government is given yet more leverage over every individual , creating another regulation for individuals to comply with , and another reason for the government to penalize the exercise of freedom .
Other comments
Some other worthwhile , or otherwise interesting , comments :
The Naked Man in the Tree had a few interesting observations .
smatty1 of reddit questioned the motivation of my original piece :
Nice article to “ divide and conquer ” libertarians .
One of the oldest tricks in the book is to cause infighting and dilute the message and the movement .
I ’m calling this article out !
Later he made the charge that the article was “ a mastubatory exercise at the expense of a revolution ” .
Nice touch .
Adam Ricketson wrote , regarding my “ Favorite Conspiracy Theory ” section of the former piece :
As for conspiracy theories , I think that libertarians are particularly immune to conspiracy theories , since libertarianism itself is largely based in institutional analysis , focusing on the distribution of power within society .
Mario said :
Socialism does not need big government .
If workers could elect a majority to the board of directors of their companies , that in itself would move the country farther to the left than even Venezuela .
Mike said of the previous post :
This is one of the stupidest articles I ’ve ever read …
A real libertarian , that means a Ron Paul libertarian , believes that the government , through the police and court system , gets involved ANYTIME someone ’s rights are violated , including on those occasions when a corporation is the perpetrator of the act of violence / coercion / fraud .
Matt Moore wrote :
The main difference between right libertarians and Kos libertarians : the former actually exist .
Seriously , this left libertarian thing is just old - style , big government progressives who glommed onto the libertarian trend because it was obviously on the upswing …
In a sentence : A libertarian that is n’t hostile to government is n’t a libertarian .

" I'm 5 foot even , but I 'm only 16 , so maybe I 'll grow more .
But if Pilates helps , I 'm totally doing that . "
Bryant needs to be 5 feet 6 inches by her 18th birthday to have a shot at the goal she 's been dancing toward since she was three years old : to become a Radio City Rockette .
Joining the precision company is a dream for thousands of young dancers .
Check out Rockette history and glamour »
Bryant and 18 other students from Patsy 's Dance Studio in Covington , Virginia , spent all night on a bus to New York City to attend the Rockette Experience at Radio City Music Hall , an intensive course in the company 's technique , on December 14 , as the Rockettes ' 75th Christmas Spectacular unfolded on the famed stage downstairs .
Over three hours participants learn tap and jazz routines from the show , including those eye - high kicks ( dancers do about 400 per show ) .
They also learn the tricky " hook up . "
Rockettes appear to link arms to form a tight - knit kick line , but they 're not actually allowed to touch -- leaning on a neighbor could send the dancers crashing to the stage .
Finally , they undergo a mock audition , where they receive grades and feedback .

It may sound like Rockette - for - a - day fantasy camp , but the $ 108 class ( offered throughout the year ) is not for newbies -- you 'll need at least intermediate dance skills to participate .
While most attendees are teens , older professional dancers sometimes sign up as training for the official Rockette auditions in April .
For those even more serious about a Rockette career , there 's a weeklong boot camp each summer , where dancers learn the moves and get a chance to shine for Radio City talent scouts .
Since the Experience started six years ago , about 30 Rockettes have been plucked from the 2,000 dancers who attend the courses each year .
The Experience was created in 2001 by Radio City marketing staffer Judi Ludovico .
A former dancer , Ludovico had been frustrated by not knowing what to expect from auditions .
She thought aspiring Rockettes could use a leg up , training in the troupe 's unusual technique .
The program " is a dream come true for these girls , " says Ramona Garcia , 58 , a Covington elementary - school teacher ( and former dancer ) chaperoning the group .
" I wanted to be a Rockette , but I was n't tall enough -- or thin enough , " she says with a laugh .
To these small - town dancers , class instructor Cheryl Cutlip 's road to Rockettedom is inspiring :
She left High Point , North Carolina -- a town with one dance studio -- carrying two suitcases , bound for New York .
She 's now in her 15th season at Radio City .
Cutlip offers some sobering facts about Rockette life : Rehearsals for the holiday show start in September , running seven hours a day for four weeks .
During the 10 - week season , Rockettes kick their way through 16 performances a week , doing as many as four 90 - minute shows in a day .
And that 's not including one - offs like the Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade , the " Today " show , presidential inaugurations and private appearances .
And they do it all in costume , sometimes with each dancer sparkling with 3,000 Swarovksi crystals .
" It 's pretty hardcore , " says Covington dancer Kelly Drummond , 16 .
St. Louis native Julienne Rencher , 24 , is already preparing for the grueling schedule .
While working as an Experience class assistant , she 's soaking up as much training as possible to prepare for the spring auditions .
She also does ballet daily , plus regular cardio workouts of 90 minutes , the same length as the Spectacular .
" And Bikram yoga , " she adds .
" Lots of it . "
It pays to prepare : When Cutlip tried out 15 years ago , about 200 girls auditioned , she says .
In 2007 , the line of hopefuls " stretched all the way around the block " to fill less than 20 available spots in the five shows ( New York 's , plus four touring troupes ) .
Blame daunting odds on low turnover .
" Once you become a Rockette , if you keep yourself in shape , the company is fantastic about keeping you on , " Cutlip says .
And because of the Spectacular 's enduring popularity , it 's one of the few reliable dancing gigs in show business .
Audition anxiety is a few years -- and thousands of practice kicks -- away for the girls from Covington .
For now , they 'll return home armed with newfound technique , insider tips .
" No quivering on the end pose .
If you put the wrong arm up , do n't switch .
Make the last kick strongest .
And smile ! "
Then there is the official word on the height situation .
Hopefuls must be between 5 feet 6 inches and 5 feet 10 1 / 2 inches to qualify -- up from the original standard of 5 feet 5 1/2 inches to 5 feet 9 inches " They grow 'em taller now , " says Cutlip .
Bryant 's not fazed .
" It 's worth all the hard work , " she says .
" It 's the Rockettes !
Seeing them is something you never forget . "

All About Radio City Rockettes • Dance
When strangers learn what we do for a living , their most frequently asked question is whether our constant investigation of the filthiest , nastiest and slimiest smut that the internet has to offer has made it impossible for us to get turned on by simple , run -of - the - mill pornography .
Oddly enough , we thought of this question again while watching a recent episode of Cartoon Network 's " Aqua Teen Hunger Force " and we think that fellow porn watcher and No. 1 Giants fan Carl Brutananadilewski answers it as well as we ever could .

Pro-Hillary 527's first spot
" If speeches could create jobs , we would n't be facing a recession , " the narrator says in the spot , titled " Blueprint , " that takes no more direct shots at Obama , but instead hews closely to Clinton 's economic message .
The 527 hews to the legal rule against direct advocacy for the candidate : " Tell Hillary to keep working on these solutions , " the ad says .
It 's aimed for Ohio , but there 's no buy yet .
It 'll air in Ohio to supplement Clinton 's push .
A spokesman for the American Leadership Project , Roger Salazar , e-mailed to stress that his group 's message is " positive " and focused on middle - class issues .
He wrote :
The American Leadership Project is a committee of Americans who have come together to shine a backlight on issues that matter most to our nation 's middle class and do it in a positive way .
These are positive ads that serve to raise awareness about these issues at a critical time in our nation 's history in places where they are paying the most attention .
Right now that 's Ohio and Texas .
Sen . Clinton is a champion of these issues and ALP supports her positions and we say so in the ads .
The most important thing to remember is to TIME your code .
Trying different tricks might or might not speed up your code .
So it is very important to time your code to see if you do get a speedup as you try each trick .
Beginner Freeing up all 8 CPU registers for use in your code .
This also demonstrates how to save a GP register in an MMX register push ebx push esi push edi push ebp ; has to be done before changing ESP ; load up ESI and EDI and your other registers with the vales passed ; in on the stack .
This has to be done before freeing up ESP .
movd mm0 , esp ; no pushing / popping past this point .
xor ebx , ebx ; So how do you save ?
A variable .
mov esp , 5 inner_loop : mov [ eax_save ] , eax ; eax_save is a global variable .
Ca n't be movzx eax , word ptr [ fred _2 ] ; local because that requires EBP to point to it .
add ebx , eax mov eax , [ eax_save ] ; restore eax movd esp , mm0 ; has to be done before you do the POPs pop ebp pop edi pop esi pop ebx ret Maximize register usage .
Most high level compilers generate a lot of memory accesses to variables .
I usually get around that by trying to keep most of them in registers .
Having all 8 cpu registers free can really come in handy .
Complex instructions Avoid complex instructions ( lods , stos , movs , cmps , scas , loop , xadd , enter , leave ) .
Complex instructions are instructions that do multiple things .
For instance stosb writes a byte to memory and also increments EDI .
They stopped making these fast with the original Pentium because they were trying to make it more RISC like .
Using REP and the string instructions is still fast .
That is the only exception to the case .
Do n't use INC / DEC on P4
On the P4 use ADD / SUB in place of INC / DEC .
Generally it is faster .
ADD / SUB runs in 0.5 cycles .
INC / DEC takes 1 cycle .
Rotating Avoid rotate by a register or rotate by an immediate value of anything but a 1 .
Eliminate unnecessary compare instructions Eliminate unnecessary compare instructions by doing the appropriate conditional jump instruction based on the flags that are already set from a previous arithmetic instruction .
dec ecx cmp ecx,0 jnz loop_again ; gets changed to dec ecx jnz loop_again LEA is still really cool , except for on the P4 it tends to be slow .
You can perform multiple math operations all in one instruction and it does not affect the flags register so you can put in in between one register being modified and a flags comparison jump on the next line .
top_of_loop : dec eax lea edx , [ edx * 4+3 ] ; multiply by 4 and add 3 .
Does not affect flags jnz top_of_loop ; so the next instruction does n't get hosed .
ADC and SBB .
Most compilers do n't really make good use of ADC and SBB .
You can get good speeds ups with that .
Adding 2 64 - bit numbers together , or adding big numbers together .
Keep in mind that on the P4 ADC and SBB are slow .
As a work around you can use " addq " , and use MMX to do this .
So the second optimization suggestion for this is to use MMX to do the adding or subtracting .
You just have to have a processor that supports MMX .
add eax , [ fred ] adc edx , [ fred + 4 ] ; the above 2 statements are the same as the below 3 statements movd mm0 , [ fred ] ;
Get 32 - bit value in MM0 movd mm1 , [ fred +4 ] ;
Get 32 - bit value in MM1 paddq mm0, mm1 ;
This is an unoptimized way to do it .
You would ; really pre-read MM0 and MM1 a loop in advance .
; I did it this way for ease of understanding .
ROL , ROR , RCL , and RCR and BSWAP .
It is a cool trick to switch from Big Endian to Little Endian using BSWAP .
Also you can use it for temporary storage of a 16 - bit or 8 - bit value in the upper half of the register .
Likewise you can use ROL and ROR for storing 8 - bit and 16 - bit values .
It 's a way to get more " registers " .
If all you are dealing with are 16 - bit values , you can turn your 8 32 - bit registers into 16 16 - bit registers .
Which gives you a lot more registers to use .
RCL and RCR can also easily be used for counting the number of bits that are set in a register .
Keep in mind that ROL , ROR , RCL , RCR and BSWAP are all slow on the P4 .
The rotate instructions are about twice as fast as BSWAP .
So if you have to use one or the other on the P4 use the rotate ones .
xor edx , edx ; set both 16 - bit registers to 0 mov dx,234 ; set the first 16 - bit register to 234 bswap edx ; swap it so the second one is ready mov dx,345 ; set the second 16 - bit register to 345 bswap edx ; swap to the first one add dx, 5 ; add 5 to the first one bswap edx ; swap to the second one add dx, 7 ; add 7 to it String instructions .
Most compilers do n't make good use of the string instructions ( scas , cmps , stos , movs , and lods ) .
So checking to see if that is faster than some library routine can be a win .
For instance I was really surprised when I looked at strlen ( ) in VC ++.
In the radix40 code it ran in 416 cycles for a 100 byte string !!!
I thought that was absurdly slow .
Multiply to divide .
If you have a full 32 - bit number and you need to divide , you can simply do a multiply and take the top 32 - bit half as the result .
This is faster because multiplication is faster than division .
( thanks to pdixon for the tip ) .
Dividing by a constant .
There 's some nice information now how to divide by a constant in Agner Fog 's pentopt.pdf document .
I wrote a program that you pass in the number you want to divide by , and it will print out the assembler code sequence .
I will dig it up later and post it .
Here is a link to Agner 's document .
Agner 's Pentopt PDF ( http://www.agner.org/assem/)
Unrolling .
This is a guideline .
Unrolling falls in the General Optimiation category but I wanted to add a footnote .
I always set up my Unrolling with a macro that unrolls an EQUATE value amount .
That way you can try different values and see which is best easily .
You want the unrolling to fit in the L1 code cache ( or trace cache ) .
Using an equate makes it easy to try different unroll amounts to find the fastest one .
UNROLL_AMT equ 16 ; # of times to unroll the loop UNROLL_NUM_BYTES equ 4 ; # of bytes handled in 1 loop iteration mov ecx,1024 looper : offset2 = 0 REPEAT UNROLL_AMT add eax , [ edi+offset2 ] offset2 = offset2 + UNROLL_NUM_BYTES
add edi, UNROLL_AMT
* UNROLL_NUM_BYTES
; we dealt with 16 * 4 bytes .
sub ecx , UNROLL_AMT
; subtract from loop counter the # of loops we unrolled .
jnz looper MOVZX .
Use MOVZX to avoid partial register stalls .
I use MOVZX a lot .
A lot of people XOR the full 32 - bit register first .
But MOVZX does the equivalent thing without having to have an extra XOR instruction .
Also you had to do the XOR enough in advance to give it time to complete .
With MOVZX you do n't have to worry about that .
Using MOVZX to avoid a SHIFT and AND instruction I ran across this bit of C code I was trying to speed up using assembler .
The_array is a dword array .
The code is trying to get a different byte from a dword in the array passed upon which pass this is over the data .
" Pass " is a variable that goes from 0 to 3 for each byte in a particular dword .
unsigned char c = ( ( the_array [ i ] ) >>( Pass < < 3 ) ) & 0xFF ; ; I got rid of the " pass " variable by unrolling the loop 4 times .
;
So I had 4 of these each one seperated by lots of C code .
unsigned char c = ( the_array [ i ] ) >> 0 ) & 0xFF ; unsigned char c = ( the_array [ i ] ) >> 8 ) & 0xFF ; unsigned char c = ( the_array [ i ] ) >> 16 ) & 0xFF ; unsigned char c = ( the_array [ i ] ) >> 24 ) & 0xFF ;
What if I can get rid of the SHIFT and the AND using assembler ?
That would save me 2 instructions .
Not to mention the fact that the P4 is very slow when doing SHIFT instructions ( 4 cycles !!! ) .
So try to avoid shifts where possible .
SO taking just the second to last line that shifts right 16 as our example ; esi points to the_array mov eax , [ esi ] shr eax ,16 and eax ,0FFh ; So how do we change that to get rid of the AND and SHR ? ;
We do a MOVZx with the 3rd byte in the dword .
movzx eax , byte ptr [ esi+2 ] ; unsigned char c = ( the_array [ i ] ) >> 16 ) & 0xFF ; Align , align , align .
It is really important to align both your code and data to get a good speed up .
I generally align code on 4 byte boundaries .
For data I align 2 byte data on 2 byte boundaries , 4 byte data on 4 byte boundaries , 8 byte data on 8 byte boundaries , 16 byte data on 16 byte boundaries .
In general if you do n't align your SSE or SSE2 data on a 16 - byte boundary you will get an exception .
You can align your data in VC ++ if you have the processor pack .
They added support for both static data and dynamic memory .
For static data you use __declspec ( align ( 4 ) ) - alignes on a 4 byte boundary .
BSR for powers of 2 .
You can use BSR to count the highest power of 2 that goes into a variable .
XORing a register with itself to zero it .
This is an oldie , but I am including it anyway .
It also has a side benefit of clearing dependencies on the register .
That is why sometimes you will see people use XOR in that fashion , before doing a partial register access .
I prefer using MOVZX to doing it that way because it is trickier to do using a XOR ( read my above comments about in # 12 above talking about MOVZX ) .
On the P4 they also added support for PXOR to break dependencies in that fashion .
I think the P3 does the same thing .
Use XOR and DIV .
If you know your data can be unsigned for a DIVISION , use XOR EDX , EDX , then DIV .
It 's faster than CDQ and IDIV .
Try to avoid obvious dependencies .
If you modify a register and then compare it to some value on the very next line , instead try and put some other register modification in between .
Dependencies are any time you modify a register and then read it or write it shortly afterwards .
inc edi inc eax cmp eax , 1 ; this line has a dependency with the previous line , so it will stall .
jz fred ; shuffling the instructions around we can help break up dependencies .
inc eax inc edi cmp eax , 1 jz fred Instructions to avoid on P4 .
On P4's try to avoid the following instructions , adc , sbb , rotate instructions , shift instructions , inc , dec , lea , and any instruction taking more than 4 uops .
How do you know the processor running the code is a P4 ?
CPUID .
Using lookup tables .
On the P4 sometimes you can get around the long latency instructions that I listed previously by doing lookup tables .
Thankfully on P4's they come with really fast memory .
So having to do a lookup table does n't hurt performance as much if it is n't in the cache .
Use pointers instead of calculating indexes .
A lot of times in loops in C there will be multiplications by non-powers of 2 numbers .
You can easily get around this by adding instead .
Here is an example that uses a structure .
typedef struct fred { int fred ; char bif ; } freddy_type ; freddy_type charmin [ 80 ] ;
The size of freddy_type is 5 bytes .
If you try and access them in a loop the compiler will generate code for multipling by 5 for each array access !!!!
( Ewwwwwwwwwwwww ) .
So how do we do it properly ?
for ( int t = 0 ; t < 80 ; t++) { charmin[t ] . fred = rand ( ) ; // the compiler multiplies by 5 to get the offset , EWWWWWWWW ! charmin[t ].bif = ( char ) ( rand ( ) % 256 ) ; } ; in assembler we start with an offset of 0 , that points to the first data item .
;
And then we add 5 to it each loop iteration to avoid the MUL .
mov esi , offset charmin mov ecx,80 fred_loop : ;... perform operations on the FRED and BIF elements in freddy_type add esi, 5 ; make it point to the next structure entry .
dec ecx jnz fred_loop
The MUL removal applies to loops as well .
I have seen people do multiplies in loops as part of incrementing the variable or for terminating condition .
So try doing addition instead .
Conform to default branch predictions .
Try to set up your code such that backward conditional jumps are usually taken , and forward conditional loops are almost never taken .
That has to do with branch prediction .
The static branch predictor uses that simple rule to guess if a conditional jump is taken or not .
So have a loop that has a backwards conditional jump at the end .
And then have special exit conditions from that same loop that executes a forward jump that only exits on a certain condition that does n't often occur .
Eliminate branches Eliminate branch where possible .
This might seem obvious , but I have seen some people use too many branches in their assembler code .
Keep it simple .
Use as few branches as possible .
Using CMOVcc to remove branches I have yet to see the CMOVcc instructions actually be faster than a conditional jump .
So I recommend using conditional jumps over CMOVcc .
It might be faster in the case where your jumps are n't easily guessable by the branch prediction logic .
So if that is the case with you , benchmark it and see .
Local vs. Global variables
Use local variables for a procedure over using a global variable .
If you use local variables you 'll get less cache misses .
Address Calculation Compute address calculations before you need them .
Let 's say you have to do some funky stuff to get to a particular address .
Such as multiplying by 20 .
You can pre-compute that before you get to the point in the code where you need it .
Smaller registers Sometimes using smaller registers will give you a speed up .
I did this on the radix40 code .
If you change the below code to use EDX it runs slightly slower .
movzx edx , byte ptr [ esi ] ; get the data from the ascii array test dl , ILLEGAL ; bit 7 set ?
if so do ILLEGAL handling jnz skip_illegal Instruction Length Try and keep your instructions to 8 bytes or less .
Use registers to pass parameters
Try passing parameters in registers instead of on the stack where possible .
If you have 3 variables that you have to push onto the stack as paramaters , that is at least 6 memory reads and 3 memory writes .
You have to read each variable from memory into a CPU register and then push it on the stack .
That is 3 memory reads right there .
Then the 3 pushes onto the stack make 3 writes .
Then why would you push parameters you 'd never use ?
So figure at least 3 ( maybe more ) reads from the stack of the pushed data .
Do n't pass big data on the stack Do n't pass 64 - bit data or 128 - bit data ( or bigger ) on the stack .
Instead pass a pointer to the data .
Intermediate Adding to memory faster than adding memory to a register
This has to do with the number of micro-ops the instruction takes .
Give preference to doing an add with memory over adding memory to a register .
add eax , [ edi ] ; do n't do this if possible add [ edi ] , eax ; This is preferred Instruction selection Try and pick instructions with the fewest micro-ops and shortest latencies .
Handling an unaligned byte data stream that needs to be dword aligned Parsing a byte array a dword at a time will get you performance hits due to the buffer not being aligned to a 4 byte boundary .
You can get around this by dealing with the first X bytes ( 0 to 3 ) , until you come to an aligned to a 4 byte boundary .
Using CMOVcc to reset an infinite loop pointer
If you are making multiple passes through an array , and want to reset it to the beginning when you have reached the end of the array , you can use CMOVcc.
dec ecx ; decrement index into array cmovz ecx , MAX_COUNT ; if we are at the beginning , then reset the index ; to MAX_COUNT ( the end ) .
Multiplying by 0.5 by doing a subtraction
This probably wo n't work for everything , but multiplying by 0.5 , or dividing by 2.0 in real4 ( in floating point ) , you can just subtract 1 from the exponent .
Wo n't work with 0.0 .
For real8 , the subtract value is 00100000h ( donkey posted this ) . data somefp real4 2.5 . code sub dword ptr [ somefp ] ,00800000h ; divide real4 by 2 .
Self Modifying Code The P4 optimization manual recommends avoiding self - modifying code .
I have seen cases where it can run faster .
But as always you need to time it to verify in your case that it is faster .
MMX , SSE , SSE2
Most compilers do n't generate good code for MMX , SSE and SSE2 .
GCC and the Intel compiler have gotten a lot better at it .
But hand tooled assembler is still a big win in this area .
Using EMMS .
EMMS tends to be a really slow instruction on Intel processors .
On AMD it is faster .
Generally I do n't do it on a per routine basis , because it is so slow .
I very rarely use a lot of floating point in a program that I already have a lot of MMX in ( and vice versa ) .
So I usually wait to do the EMMS before doing any floating point .
If you have a lot of floating point and very little MMX , then do the EMMS at the end of all the MMX routines you call ( if you call any ) .
But adding it in every routine that does MMX just makes the code run slow .
Converting to MMX , SSE , or SSE2
Can your code be convert to MMX , SSE , or SSE2 ?
If so you can get a big speed up by doing stuff in parallel .
Prefetching data .
This is underutilized a lot .
If you are processing a huge array ( 256KB and up ) , using the " prefetch " instruction on P3 and up processors can speed up your code anywhere from 10 - 30 % .
You can actually get a degradation in performance if you do n't use it right .
Unrolling works well with this , because I unroll to the number of bytes fetched with this instruction .
On a P3 it is 32 , but on a P4 it is 128 .
That means you can easily unroll your loops to handle 128 bytes at a time on a P4 and get the benfit from unrolling and prefetching .
It is not always the case that if you unroll it for 128 bytes that you will get the best speed up .
So try different variations .
UNROLL_NUM_BYTES
equ 4 ; # of bytes handled in one ; iteration of the loop .
UNROLL_AMT equ 128/UNROLL_NUM_BYTES
;
We want to unroll the loop such ; that we handle 128 bytes per loop .
mov ecx,1024 looper : offset2 = 0 REPEAT UNROLL_AMT prefetchnta [ edi+offset2+128 ] ; prefetch 128 bytes into the L1 cache before we need it .
add eax , [ edi+offset2 ] offset2 = offset2 + UNROLL_NUM_BYTES
add edi, UNROLL_AMT
* UNROLL_NUM_BYTES
; we dealt with 16 * 4 bytes .
sub ecx , UNROLL_AMT
; subtract from loop counter the # of loops we unrolled .
jnz looper Cache Blocking
Let 's say you have to call multiple procedures on this big array in memory .
It is better to break it up into blocks that fit into the cache to reduce cache misses .
For example if you were doing 3D code , the first procedure might translate your coordinates , the second might scale and the third might rotate .
So instead of going through the whole huge array in one fell swoop .
You break off a " chunk " of the data that fits into the cache , and then call all 3 procedures , and then go to the next chunk and repeat .
TLB Priming The TLB is the Translation Lookaside Buffer .
The TLB is cache that is used to improve performance of the translation of a virtual memory address to a physical memory address by providing fast access to page table entries .
Having it not in the TLB cache forces a cache misse which slows the code down .
The trick is to pre-read a data byte from the next page before you have to read it .
I will show an example later on in another one of the tips .
Intermix your code to break dependencies .
In C code the C compiler treats different chunks of code as seperate .
To break dependencies , when you get to the assembler level you can intermix them Parallelization .
Most Compilers do n't take advantage of the fact you have 2 pipelines for ALU stuff , which is the majority of what people use .
On the P4 you have it even sweeter .
You can execute 4 ALU instructions in 1 cycle if you do it right .
If you break things up into doing stuff in parallel it also helps break up dependencies .
So you kill two birds with one stone .
Assume this piece is in a loop .
looper : mov eax , [ esi ] xor eax,0E5h ; dependency with the line above it .
add [ edi ] , eax ; dependency with the line above it .
add esi, 4 add edi, 4 dec ecx jnz looper ; So how do we ' parallelize ' it and reduce dependencies ?
looper : mov eax , [ esi ] mov ebx , [ esi +4 ] xor eax,0E5 xor ebx,0E5 add [ edi ] , eax add [ edi+4 ] , ebx add esi, 8 add edi, 8 sub ecx , 2 jnz looper Avoiding memory accesses Re-structing the code to avoid memory accesses ( or other I/O ) .
One method is to accumulate a value in a register before writing it to memory .
Here is an example of that below .
In this example assuming we are adding 3 bytes from the source array to the destination array which is an array of dwords .
The destination array is zeroed .
mov ecx , AMT_TO_LOOP
looper : movzx byte ptr eax , [ esi ] add [ edi ] , eax movzx byte ptr eax , [ esi+1 ] add [ edi ] , eax movzx byte ptr eax , [ esi+3 ] add [ edi ] , eax add edi, 4 add esi, 3 dec ecx jnz looper
We can accumulate the result in a register , and then only do one write to memory .
mov ecx , AMT_TO_LOOP looper : xor edx , edx ; zero out register to accumulate the result in .
movzx byte ptr eax , [ esi ] add edx , eax movzx byte ptr eax , [ esi+1 ] add edx , eax movzx byte ptr eax , [ esi+3 ] add edx , eax add esi,3 mov [ edi ] , edx add edi, 4 dec ecx jnz looper
When to convert a call to a jump if the last statement in a routine is a call consider converting it to a jump to get rid of one call / ret .
Using arrays for data structures ( This is non-assembler related , but it 's a great one ) .
You can use an array for data structures such as trees and linked lists .
By using an array the memory ends up being contiguous and you get a speed up due to less cache misses .
Advanced Avoid prefixes
Try to avoid prefixes ( prefixes get generated for a number of things including segment overrides , branch hints , operand - size override , address - size override , LOCKs , and REPs ) .
Prefixes make your instructions longer .
Grouping reads / writes in code
If there is a bunch of alternating between read and write transactions on the bus , look at grouping and doing more reads at a time and more writes at a time .
Here is what we are trying to avoid : mov eax , [ esi ] mov [ edi ] , eax mov eax , [ esi+4 ] mov [ edi+4 ] , eax mov eax , [ esi+8 ] mov [ edi+8 ] , eax mov eax , [ esi+12 ] mov [ edi+12 ] , eax ; Grouping the reads and writes together this gets converted to mov eax , [ esi ] mov ebx , [ esi+4 ] mov ecx , [ esi+8 ] mov edx , [ esi + 12 ] mov [ edi ] , eax mov [ edi+4 ] , ebx mov [ edi+8 ] , ecx mov [ edi+12 ] , edx Making use of execution units to make your code run faster Choose instructions that execute on different execution units .
If you do this properly the time to execute the code will be the throughput time and not the latency time .
For most instructions the throughput time is less .
Interleaving 2 loops out of sync
You can unroll a loop twice , and instead of running each instruction after each other , you can run them out of sync .
Why is this useful ?
2 reasons .
First , sometimes you have instructions that have to use a certain register and have a long latency such as MUL or DIV .
That creates a dependency on EDX : EAX for the two MUL instructions in a row .
Second , sometimes some instructions just have really long latencies .
So you want to try and place a number of instructions after it from the other loop to help delay until it returns the result .
A lot of MMX , SSE , and SSE2 instructions on the P4 fall into that category .
Here is an example loop : A1 ; instruction 1 loop 1 D2 ; instruction 4 loop 2 B1 ; instruction 2 loop 1 A2 ; instruction 1 loop 2 C1 ; instruction 3 loop 1 B2 ; instruction 2 loop 2 D1 ; instruction 4 loop 1 C2 ; instruction 3 loop 2 Different tricks you can do with masks created by comparison instructions using MMX / SSE / SSE2 .
With MMX and SSE and SSE2 you can generate masks when doing comparisons .
This can be helpful in some cases when looking for a pattern in a file , such as a line feed .
So you can use it to search for patterns , not just math operations .
You can use MMX , SSE , and SSE2 masks that get generated by a compare instruction to control doing math on only part of a MMX or SSE register .
The following piece of code only adds a 9 to the dword parts of an MMX register if it has a 5 in it .
; if ( fredvariable == 5 ) ; fredvariable += 9 ; movq mm5 , [ two_fives ] ; mm5 has 2 DWORD 5's in it .
movq mm6 , [ two_nines ] ;mm6 has 2 DWORD 9's in it .
movq mm0 , [array_in_memory ] ; get value movq mm1 , mm0 ; get backup copy pcmpeqd mm1 , mm5 ; mm1 now has an FFFFFFFF in each dword location ; in MM1 with a 5 all other locations have 0 . pand mm1 , mm6 ; zero out the locations in MM6 that do n't ; have 5's in them for MM0 .
paddd mm0 , mm1 ; add 9 ONLY to the locations in MM0 that ; have a 5 in them .
PSHUFD and PSHUFW .
On the P4 MMX , SSE and SSE2 move instructionns are slow .
You can get around this by doind " pshufd " for the SSE and SSE2 and " pshufw " for MMX .
It is 2 cycles faster .
There is one caveat .
It has to do with what pipeline the opcode goes down .
So without getting too technical , sometimes it is faster to use the slower " MOVDQA " than to replace it with a " PSHUFD " .
So time your code .
pshufd xmm0 , [ edi ] ,0E4h ; copy 16 bytes at location EDI into XMM0 .
; The 0E4h makes it a straight copy .
pshufw mm0 , [ edi ] ,0E4h ; copy 8 bytes at location EDI into MM0 .
; The 0E4h makes it a straight copy .
Write directly to memory - bypass the cache .
Another optimization dealing with memory .
If you have to write to a lot of memory ( 256 KB and up ) it is faster to write directly to memory bypassing the cache .
If you have a P3 you can use " movntq " or " movntps " .
The first does an 8 byte write , the second a 16 - byte .
The 16 - byte write needs to be 16 - byte aligned .
On the P4 you also get " movntdq " , which does 16 - bytes also , but needs to be 16 - byte aligned .
This trick applies to both memory fills and memory copies .
Both do a write operation .
Here is some sample code .
I personally would do 8 XMM registers in parallel to help break up some of the latencies for the P4 MOVDQA instruction .
However to help understanding , I did not do that .
mov ecx , 16384 ; write 16384 16 - byte values , 16384*16 = 256KB . ;
So we are copying a 256KB array mov esi , offset src_arr ; pointer to the source array which has to be ; 16 - byte aligned or you will get an exception .
mov edi , offset dst_arr ; pointer to the destination array which has to be ; 16 - byte aligned or you will get an exception .
looper : movdqa xmm0 , [ esi ] ; works on P3 and up movntps [ edi ] , xmm0 ; Works on P3 and up add esi,16 add edi,16 dec ecx jnz looper Handle 2 cases per loop for MMX / SSE / SSE2 .
On the P4 the latencies are usually so long on the MMX , SSE and SSE2 instructions that I always handle 2 cases per loop , or read a loop in advance .
Or more than 2 cases if I have enough registers .
All the various MOVE ( including MOVD ) instructions on P4 are slow .
So adding 2 32 - bit arrays of numbers together is going to be slower on the P4 than the P3 .
A faster way would be to do two per loop , where you pre-read the loops initial values MM0 and MM1 before the FRED label .
You just have to have special handling if you have an odd number of array elements .
Just check that at the end , and if so add code for that one extra dword .
Here is the code that does not read a value in advance .
I think converting this to read a value in advance is easy .
So that is why I am not posting both .
This is how you would avoid ADC on a P4 , which is a slow instruction , to add two arrays together .
pxor mm7 , mm7 ; the previous loops carry stays in here .
fred : movd mm0 , [ esi ] ; esi points to src1 movd mm1 , [ edi ] ; edi points to src2 , also to be used as the destination .
paddq mm0, mm1 ; add both values together paddq mm0 , mm7 ; add in remainder from last add .
movd [ edi ] , mm0 ; save value to memory movq mm7 , mm0 psrlq mm7,32 ; shift the carry over to bit 0 . add esi, 8 add edi, 8 sub ecx , 1 jnz fred movd [ edi ] , mm7 ; save carry Pre-reading MMX or XMM register to get around long latency Pre-reading an SSE2 register before you need it will give a speed up .
That is because MOVDQA takes 6 cycles on a P4 .
That is really slow .
So because it has such a long latency , I want to read it in advance of where I use it to make sure it doens't stall .
Here is an example .
movdqa xmm1 , [ edi+16 ] ; read in XMM1 before we use it , takes 6 cycles on P4 , not including the time to get it from cache .
por xmm5 , xmm0 ; do an OR with XMM0 which was previously read .
Takes 2 cycles on the P4 . pand xmm6 , xmm0 ; do an AND with XMM0 which was previously read .
Takes 2 cycles on the P4. movdqa xmm2 , [ edi+32 ] ; read in XMM2 before we use it , takes 6 cycles on P4 , not including the time to get it from cache .
por xmm5 , xmm1 ; do an OR with XMM1 which was previously read .
Takes 2 cycles on the P4 . pand xmm6 , xmm1 ; do an AND with XMM1 which was previously read .
Takes 2 cycles on the P4 .
Accumulating a result in a register or registers to avoid doing a slow instruction Accumulating a result in a register or registers to avoid doing a slow instruction .
I did this to speed up a compare / read loop written in SSE2 .
The slow instruction was PMOVMSKB .
So instead of executing it every loop , I accumulated a result in a register .
And then every 4KB of memory read , I would do a PMOVMSKB .
This gave a good speed up .
The example below will also demonstrate using PREFETCH and TLB Priming .
Their are 2 loops in the below code .
The inner loop is unrolled to 128 bytes ( the number of bytes fetched by PREFETCH on a P4 ) .
The outer loop is unrolled to 4KB , so that it can do TLB Priming .
If you are using a system that does n't use a 4KB page size , you 'd have to do modify the code appropriately .
On the system I tested this on ( a Dell Server ) with 6.4 GB /s of max memory bandwidth , I was able to do a read and a compare at 5.55 GB/s ( in a non-Windows environment .
Under windows it will run slower ) .
I left out the code that at label " compare_failed " , for 2 reasons .
1 ) The cut / paste of code is already big .
2 ) It does n't demosntrate any techniques I want to show .
The code at " compare_failed " simply does a REP SCASD to find the failing address after PCMPEQD finds it to the nearest 4 KB block .
This one has a HUGE code example , so I put it last in case you fall asleep reading it ;) read_compare_pattern_sse2 proc near mov edi , [ start_addr ] ; Starting Address mov ecx , [ stop_addr ]
; Last addr to NOT test .
mov ebx,0FFFFFFFFh ;AND mask movd xmm6 , ebx ;AND mask pshufd xmm6 , xmm6,00000000 b ; AND mask movdqa xmm0 , [ edi ] ; Get first 16 bytes mov eax , [ pattern ] ; EAX holds pattern pxor xmm5 , xmm5 ; OR mask movd xmm7 , eax ; Copy EAX to XMM7 pshufd xmm7 , xmm7,00000000 b ; Blast to all DWORDS outer_loop : mov ebx,32 ; 128 32 byte blocks mov esi , edi ; save start of block if DO_TLB_PRIMING mov eax , [ edi+4096 ] ; TLB priming endif ; if DO_TLB_PRIMING fred_loop : movdqa xmm1 , [ edi+16 ] ; read 16 bytes por xmm5 , xmm0 ; OR into mask pand xmm6 , xmm0 ; AND into mask movdqa xmm2 , [ edi+32 ] ; read 16 bytes por xmm5 , xmm1 ; OR into mask pand xmm6 , xmm1 ; AND into mask movdqa xmm3 , [ edi+48 ] ; read 16 bytes por xmm5 , xmm2 ; OR into mask pand xmm6 , xmm2 ; AND into mask movdqa xmm0 , [ edi+64 ] ; read 16 bytes por xmm5 , xmm3 ; OR into mask pand xmm6 , xmm3 ; AND into mask movdqa xmm1 , [ edi+80 ] ; read 16 bytes por xmm5 , xmm0 ; OR into mask pand xmm6 , xmm0 ; AND into mask movdqa xmm2 , [ edi+96 ] ; read 16 bytes por xmm5 , xmm1 ; OR into mask pand xmm6 , xmm1 ;AND into mask movdqa xmm3 , [ edi+112 ] ; read 16 bytes por xmm5 , xmm2 ; OR into mask pand xmm6 , xmm2 ;AND into mask por xmm5 , xmm3 ; OR into mask prefetchnta [ edi+928 ]

jae do_compare ; No , jump movdqa xmm0 , [ edi ] ; read 16 bytes sub ebx , 1 ; Incr for inner loop jnz fred_loop do_compare : pcmpeqd xmm5 , xmm7 ; Equal ?

Success !!!
Prefetch distance and location within the loop
You will notice in the previous example that I prefetch 928 bytes ahead instead of 128 , when 128 is the number of bytes fetched on a P4 .
Why is that ?
Well Intel recmomends prefetching 128 bytes ( 2 cache lines ) ahead at the start of your loop .
I found both statements ( doing at the beginning of the loop and prefetching 128 bytes ahead ) to be wrong .
I do n't prefetch at the beginning of the loop nor do I prefetch 128 bytes ahead .
Why ?
Well when I was playing with the code I found that I could make it run faster by moving the PREFETCH instruction around in the loop and changing the offest for how far ahead it prefetches .
So being the geek I am I wrote code to try all combinations of the location of the prefetch instruction in the loop and offsets to begin prefetching .
The code takes an assembler file and moves the " prefetch " instruction around inside a loop , and also modifies the offset to begin prefetching .
Then a batch file compiles the just modified code , and runs a benchmark .
I ran the benchmark over several hours to try the different combinations ( I started at a prefetch distance of 32 , and went up to 1024 , in increments of 32 ) .
On the system I wrote the code on 928 ahead instead of 128 was the fastest .
And prefetching almost at the end of the loop was fastest ( the prefetchnta instruction is about 8 lines above the do_compare : label )

Toyota refuses to meet with union activists
Executives at Toyota 's Kentucky manufacturing plant say they have no intention of meeting with a Kentucky workers ' rights group that plans to call on them today to discuss worker issues .
The labor group intends to deliver a list of proposals to senior Toyota management in an effort to correct what the group claims are worker problems at Toyot 's Georgetown , Kentucky facility .
However , Toyota officials are reluctant to even speak with the labor group .
" They sent us an electronic invitation to meet last Friday , "  Toyota spokesman Rick Hesterberg said Monday .
" We declined that invitation .
But if they have recommendations or proposals for us , they can leave them here for us to review . " 
The Georgetown plant is currently nonunion , but the UAW is trying to change that .
According to Automotive News , in April , the UAW asked the Kentucky Workers Rights Board to investigate employee complaints about labor practices at the plant .
The Workers Rights Board is a community group composed of 70 civic leaders , including religious leaders , elected officials and labor interests .
This biggest complaint against Toyota is that the company allegedly replaced a large number of its production employees with lower - paid temporary workers who rarely achieve regular employment or full - wage rates with the automaker .
Toyota claims its use of temporary employees is in line with industry practices across North America .
Earlier this year , a confidential internal Toyota document was published stating the automaker 's desire to reduce its U.S. labor costs in the coming years .
The Georgetown plant employs 7,000 workers .

Women who cohabit may put on weight as a consequence
Eating man-sized portions and indulging in richer foods and wines can lead to weight gain , a review in The Lancet medical journal says .
When you combine that with going on the contraceptive pill or having babies , a woman 's waistline can severely suffer , says author Dr David Haslam .
" Men are very bad for women really , " he said .
If you are eating with a partner the evening meal is a social event ... you may eat more and maybe more extravagant stuff
Dr Haslam
He said research showed women tend to gain weight once they cohabit and begin to share meals with men who intrinsically have higher energy needs and therefore appetites .
" If you are eating with a partner the evening meal is a social event and its no longer just filling a gap .
You may eat more and maybe more extravagant stuff . "
The weekly shopping list may change from the basic fruit and veg to include indulgent treats .
Couples may go out to restaurants for meals more often .
Women may do less exercise when they are in a relationship , skipping a trip to the gym to spend quality time with their partner .
Multiple insults
The contraceptive they chose to use can also have an impact .
The Pill , taken by 3.5 million British women , has been associated with a slight weight gain among some users , on average 4lb in the first three months .
Repeated pregnancies can also lead to weight gain .
" Each individual factor for weight gain is serious enough but put them all together and you can get a significant increase , " said Dr Haslam .
Societal changes mean women may be less physically active than their great - grandmothers were , doing less housework thanks to time - saving gadgets , getting partners to share the load or paying others to do it for them .
Some studies have shown that married couples gain weight while those who divorce lose weight .
Dr Haslam stressed that it was important not to generalise and that being in a relationship had numerous positive influences and gains too .
He said the important thing was for individuals to look at their own lifestyles and make healthy changes if they needed to .
Obesity has been shown to decrease life expectancy by seven years at the age of 40 .
December 27th , 2007 by Jeff Simmermon
A few months ago , I saw David Levy give a presentation based on his new book “ Love + Sex With Robots ” at the Museum of Sex in Manhattan .
While the presentation had a pretty interesting premise , I had so many questions afterwards and could ’ve run roughshod over the Q&A session .
I bought the book and read it for myself , and just like the presentation it left me wanting so much more .
Levy lays his belief that one day , people will have sex with robots , out like a master ’s thesis that drops every idea down brick by thudding brick , cementing with precedent and detail in a way that makes you believe him while thinking “ alright already , I get it .
Where ’s the fun stuff ? ”
I have no problem buying the fact that pleasure robots are on the horizon … what I want to know is how they ’re going to fit in , how society will change .
The book ’s been talked about in a number of places online since Levy ’s presentation .
Wired , MSNBC , and The Globe and Mail have all done pieces on the book and its premise .
I tend to agree the most with Joel Achenbach ’s recent review in the Washington Post ’s book section , but in all of this chatter , something ’s been missing .
David Levy was kind enough to grant me an e-mail interview for this blog in an attempt to scratch my itching curiosity .
The interview follows , after the jump …
It could be argued that the written word destroyed short / long - term memory and computers are outsourcing human intelligence to the extent that we cannot think or remember without them .
What essentially human traits do you envision future sexbots changing forever ?
I believe that sexbots will change our perceptions of human relationships , and in some ways we will become more demanding with respect to what we want from a human partner .
This is not entirely a good thing .
If someone has great sex with their robot , they will want the sex with their human partners to be great as well , which could lead to disappointment .
On the other hand , sexbots will be excellent tutors , so people will be able to be taught the skills necessary in a great lover .
Obviously , not everyone will be able to afford robots for sex straight away and top - of - the - line ones will undoubtedly command top dollar .
One could conclude from your book that we will one day live in a world where robots designed for sexual pleasure are very commonplace .
Do you think there is room for the poor in this vision ?
Eventually , yes .
You are quite right of course about what will happen in the early days of sexbots ñ very few people indeed will be able to afford to buy one .
But the robots - for - hire business model will work .
As more and more people experience robot sex and communicate their experiences to their friends , and in the media , so the demand will increase and the price will drop .
ì Eventuallyî is a very long time , but consider television ñ in the early days very few could afford it , but nowadays some homes have 3 , 4 or more TVs .
Your book implies that robots designed to love and sexually gratify humans will greatly reduce , if not eradicate human loneliness .
Do you think that is the case or are loneliness and dissatisfaction inevitably part of the human condition ?
Do you think that those feelings can be eradicated or changed ?
How ?
To a large extent I believe that loneliness and dissatisfaction are now part of the human condition because they have become so , and therefore I believe they can be largely eradicated .
I feel that this particular argument is difficult to refute .
If someone is lonely because they have no - one to talk to , no - one to love , no - one to love them , then surely if those deficits are removed from their lives then these people will become much happier , their lives much richer .
Pet animals have been found to have this effect , so why not robots who have the additional ability ( relative to pet animals ) to speak , listen and make intelligent and emotion - ridden conversation ?
People buy used laptops and iPods all the time — but on the other , the secondhand market for vibrators , butt plugs and other sex toys is nil .
Do you foresee much of a secondhand / refurbished market for sexbots ?
An interesting question that Iíve never been asked and never considered before this interview .
I find it difficult to answer this because I just donít know .
On the one hand , as I point out in my book , STDs will be transmitted via badly kept sexbots ñ my book gives an example that occurred via a sex doll .
But if the depreciation rate is anything like that for motor cars , then presumably there will be a secondhand market for reasons of cost .
I find RealDolls ( and the people that use them ) to be utterly creepy .
While the Keepon is cute and a great dancer , it does n’t exactly turn me on either .
How do you envision sexbots overcoming the “ uncanny valley ” phenomenon ?
Personally I do not have much faith in the uncanny valley .
The original publication on this topic ( dating from 1970 ) was not based on any empirical research ñ it was more an intuitive feeling expressed by Masahiro Mori that has since been hyped into an assumption of fact .
And recently another Japanese roboticist wrote that the uncanny valley has already been crossed .
So if there was such an obstacle , there probably isnít any more .
That is my pragmatic answer to your question .
But looking behind your question , you raise an important point about what is needed in robotics development to ensure that no such antipathy exists on a large scale .
I believe the answer will be the creation of very humanlike , lifelike robots .
In my book I give the example of the waxwork at Madame Tussaudís .
When robots become that lifelike in their actions as well as in their appearance , that will answer your real question .
Is it ethical for an adult to have sex with a sexbot designed to look like a child but programmed to “ perform ” like an experienced adult ?
Why ?
I believe that it is ethical provided that the reason is [ a ] to attempt to cure the adult of their deviance ; and / or [ b ] to attempt to stop them , even though they might not be cured , from going after children .
Apart from these cases I can see no other reason .
Would you personally use one of these robots ?
I would certainly experiment with one , to find out what it was like — how much like the real thing .
Would your wife ?
Probably not — she is not interested in anything of a technological nature .
Would she mind if you used one ?
Surely you ’ve talked about it by now …
Actually , no , because it is purely hypothetical since they do not yet exist .
I ask because I was talking about this with my girlfriend , who , had she found one of these in my closet in the early stages of our relationship , would have hailed a cab and never seen me again .
She says that , but why ?
Has she never used a vibrator ?
And if she has , why does she think that you should n’t have left her immediately you found out ?
To what extent do you think sex robots and their primal pre-cursors , Real Dolls , actually PREVENT people from forming healthy , normal relationships ?
I do n’t believe they would do so at all , because it is part of human nature for ( almost ) all of us to form normal human relationships .
But a number of interviewers have asked this or similar questions , so clearly many people are wondering about this .
Perhaps I ’m too much of an optimist , but I see sex robots as being hugely beneficial for society .
Porn culture has pretty well infused pop culture at this point — clothing is more provocative , we see stories about porn stars on the news , and elements once relegated to porn films have entered the mainstream .
According to your book , a similar wave will permeate mass culture when robots reach popular acceptance .
What sorts of things do you think might catch on or wind their way into the popular consciousness once sexualized robots become mainstream ?
The idea of sex with robots being normal , and something we can talk about in polite conversation .
There was a time when sex would never have been a major topic in a dinner party conversation between a group of couples , and that was reflected in the lack of sex on TV and in mainstream media at that time .
But ideas change , moral values change , and nowadays there is little or no embarrassment in talking about sex .
So when people start to have sexual experiences with robots in big numbers , I expect the subject to become mainstream , and therefore the idea will become normal .
This is a little broad , but I ’m curious to see how you might finish this story :
A group of adolescent boys finds a working , discarded secondhand sexbot and keep it in their treehouse / shed in the woods , much like some of us oohed and aahed over a crinkled stolen Penthouse in the days before internet porn .
Difference being , they actually take turns using the thing .
What are the moral implications ?
Is this a positive experience ?
A negative one ?
They are learning about sex .
I do not see anything morally wrong in adolescents learning about sex .
Last night I lay beached and gasping on my girlfriend ’s bed , blissfully tripping on oxytocin and watching paramecium - shaped fireworks explode on the back of my eyellds .
“ What are you thinking , ” she asked , smiling and handing me a glass of water .
“ Nothing at all , for once , ” I said .
What I was really thinking was :
The day this can be reliably faked is the day that humans are obsolete .
I have no idea why I could n’t say that out loud .
Hey , techie people — see that Digg button up there ?
You ’re supposed to be able to press it and Digg this story up , right .
Well , if that button reads 0 ( zero ) , it ’s broken .
Again .
When I go in to fix the code , multiple slash marks appear in the link that seem to hose the thing .
I delete ‘em and save — it works for a while and then breaks again .
I ’m doing this in Firefox , with WordPress , on a Mac .
If any of you know how to fix this or prevent it , please , PLEASE let me know in the comments .
Dr. Phil Cancels Plan to Exploit Britney Spears On His Show
has apparently caved to a fire storm of pressure and has decided not to exploitand her family by taping a special that would have been aired later this week on his daytime talk show
The plan had been to tape the show on Tuesday for airing the following day .
Early hype had claimed it was an exclusive report on Britney Spears .
Then it was massaged and suddenly became about Spears parents and their struggle .
Now it has been deemed inappropriate - and rightly so .
The media has been buzzing about the Dr. Phil ambush since he charged into Cedars - Sinai Medical Center , hell bent to save Britney from herself .
He claims to have been sent by her parents .
She , in a moment of clarity , took one look at him and bolted .
Who can blame her .
He proceeded to follow her through an underground tunnel to a waiting car .
Dr. Phil then had the nerve to tell the world that he had met with Spears for an hour and added enough fluff to make it seem like he was on insider when in fact , he was an unwelcome intruder .
The jig is up for the pompous Dr. Phil .
Inappropriate indeed .

The archive has attracted a lot of attention
The Mukurtu Wumpurrarni - kari Archive has been developed by a community based in Australia 's Northern Territory .
It asks every person who logs in for their name , age , sex and standing within their community .
This information then restricts what they can search for in the archive , offering a new take on DRM
Dr Kimberly Christen , who helped to develop the archive , told BBC World Service 's Digital Planet programme that the need to create these profiles came from community traditions over what can and cannot be seen .
" It grew out of the Warumungu community people themselves , who were really interested in repatriating a lot of images and things that had been taken from the community , " she said .
" You find this a lot in indigenous communities , not just in Australia but around the world ... this really big push in these communities to get this information back and let people start looking at it and narrating it themselves . "
Where to look
Dr Christen , who is an assistant professor based at Washington State University , stumbled across the idea of the archive by chance after meeting a group of missionaries who had digitally archived photos of the Warumungu community since the 1930s .
After loading them onto her laptop , she took them back to Tennant Creek and set up a slideshow - where she noticed that people turned away when certain images came up on screen .
The site is designed to be friendly for those with low IT skills
Offline website
" The way people were looking at the photos was embedded in the social system that already existed in the community , " she said .
" People would come in and out of the area of the screen to look when they could look . "
This threw up issues surrounding how the material could be archived , as it was not only about preserving the information into a database in a traditional sense , but also how people would access it depending on their gender , their relationship to other people and where they were situated .
Dr Christen and her team of software developers came up with what is described as " a website that 's not online " , containing photos , digital video clips , audio files , digital reproductions of cultural artefacts and documents .
The system has also been designed with a " two - click mantra " in mind , making the content easy to access for those with low computer literacy skills .
Images are arranged in their own categories , with content tagged with restrictions .
The project believes it has established a cultural solution as well as an opportunity for Aboriginals to collate much of what was once lost .
The hope of the project 's designers is that as culture and traditions change , history can be rewritten and changed by people themselves .
AKRON , OHIO --
It looks and fires like something out of Star Wars , but the latest weapon that Akron , Ohio Police have in their arsenal certainly appears to be from a galaxy far , far away .
It 's called " Corner Shot " , and it allows officers to load their sidearm into an expandable arm that extends around a corner .
Using a video monitor to see that target , the officer can fire a round at a 90 - degree angle while staying protected behind cover .
" Expose a weapon , expose a lethal threat , without exposing any part of your body , " said Akron Police Captain Mike Shearer .
" So it 's looks like a very nice weapon .
" Shearer was the first officer to fire the system during a familiarization exercise in early December with the SWAT team .
Shooting around a barricade , Shearer easily positioned the weapon so that he could engage multiple targets via a small television monitor instead of having to stick his head out around the corner .
"
On the screen , there 's a nice crosshair , " Shearer said .
" So you do have a nice clear picture , a nice crosshair to look through .
This weapons platform is going to be a very , very useful tool for the Akron Police Department .
" One Corner Shot system costs between $ 5-10,000 depending on additional attachments such as laser sighting or a flashlight .
Akron officers are the first in the country to access the weapon system , which was sent to Akron by Corner Shot 's executives in Israel .
They met with Mayor Don Plusquellic during an overseas trip , where they discussed opening a distribution center in Northeast Ohio to provide the weapons to American police departments .

IF YOU are locked eyeball to eyeball with an adversary as wily as Iran , it does not make much sense to do something that emboldens your opponent and sows defeatism among your friends .
But that , it is now clear , is precisely what America 's spies achieved when they said in December that , contrary to their own previous assessments , Iran stopped its secret nuclear - weapons programme in 2003 .
Iran 's jubilant president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , immediately called the American National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) a “ great victory ” for his country .
Subsequent events suggest that he was right .
Western diplomats are despondent and international efforts to get Iran to stop enriching uranium and working on plutonium have been thrown into confusion .
Already difficult diplomacy has got harder .
The steadily pumped up pressure that led to two United Nations sanctions - bearing resolutions , in December 2006 and March 2007 , calling on Iran to suspend the offending work , suddenly deflated .
Unprecedented , if grudging , co-operation from Russia and China at the UN Security Council had been about to lead to a third , tougher resolution .
But the NIE produced an abrupt softening in the positions of the Russians and Chinese .
The draft America , Britain , France and Germany had to settle for when all six foreign ministers met last week in Berlin is a feebler one , designed to shore up their fraying unity rather than set Iran quaking in its boots .
In his final state - of - the - union speech this week , George Bush called on Iran to suspend uranium enrichment “ so negotiations can begin ” — a far cry from the fiery “ axis of evil ” speech he unleashed against Iran , Iraq and North Korea six years ago .
This will add to Iran 's belief that the NIE has made it harder for Mr Bush to brandish the military option that he has insisted remains “ on the table ” .
The threat of force had put some steel into the six - power diplomacy .
Presuming Mr Bush 's guns to be now truly spiked , his critics at home are cheering along with the Iranians .
Israel , which had been counting on America to put the frighteners on Mr Ahmadinejad and his ilk , is left mulling its own dwindling options in a fissile neighbourhood .
Yuval Steinitz , a former chairman of its parliament 's foreign - affairs and defence committee , calls the NIE “ the most bizarre and flawed intelligence report I 've ever read ” .
For Holocaust remembrance day this week , just before Mr Bush 's speech , Israel 's prime minister , Ehud Olmert , sent a not very coded message to Iran and America , promising not to be complacent about “ voices calling for the obliteration of Israel ” , and recalling the allies ' failure to destroy the Nazi death camps during the second world war .
The small print
If America 's spies have concluded that Iran is out of the nuclear - weapons business , why the gloom and doom ?
Iran , after all , has always insisted that its nuclear programme is peaceful .
Indeed , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , its supreme leader ( shown above in conversation with Mohamed ElBaradei , the director - general of the International Atomic Energy Agency or IAEA ) , says that building or using nuclear weapons is against Islamic law .
If only judging Iran 's nuclear intentions were that simple .
Contrary to the impression left by the NIE 's published conclusions ( the bulk of its analysis remains classified ) , a nuclear - weapons programme has three main elements : the design work and engineering to produce a workable weapon ; the production of sufficient quantities of fissile material — very highly enriched uranium or plutonium — for its explosive core ; and work on missiles or some other means of delivery .
Although the NIE talks of a halt to Iran 's “ weapons programme ” , its conclusions relate only to the design and engineering effort and past hidden uranium experiments .
But the weaponisation work the NIE thinks was halted is easy to restart and easy to hide .
Hence the fury of even some of America ' s closest European allies at the NIE 's selective and then mangled message .
Iran boasts of its skill in building ever farther - flying ( and potentially nuclear - capable ) missiles .
And by far the hardest skill in bomb - making is the one Iran now pursues in plain sight , in defiance of those UN resolutions : producing uranium or plutonium .
Israel claims to have evidence that the warhead work continues too — but this fails to pass muster in Washington under rules designed to avoid another debacle like that over the missing weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
Britain 's intelligence analysts , studying the same information as America's , have not yet decided whether the American conclusion is right .
The damage done by what the NIE did and did not say cannot easily be undone .
To some , the report changes little ; if anything Iran has an even harder case to answer , because the weapons programme the NIE says Iran was working on until 2003 is a breach of Iran 's anti-nuclear promises under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
Meanwhile , it is Iran 's open nuclear work that is the target of UN sanctions .
Yet it might be truer to say that the NIE changes both nothing and everything — and in all the wrong ways .
Unchanged is the suspicion hanging over Iran 's nuclear intentions .
Mr Ahmadinejad has never been able to explain convincingly why Iran is the first country to have built a uranium - enrichment plant without having a single civilian nuclear - power reactor that could burn its output ( the ones Russia has all but completed at Bushehr will operate only on Russian - made fuel ) .
He says he wants to build lots more power plants .
But learning to enrich uranium — a hugely costly venture — still makes questionable economic sense for Iran , since it lacks sufficient natural uranium to keep them going and would have to import the stuff .
And although the 3,000 fast - spinning centrifuge machines it has up and running at Natanz are enriching only to the low levels used in civilian reactors , running the material through a few more times , or reconfiguring the centrifuge cascades , could soon produce uranium of weapons grade .
Some other countries — Iran likes to point to Japan — have civilian uranium and plutonium - making technology and no one creates a fuss .
What they do n't have , however , is Iran 's murky nuclear past .
It took a tip - off from an Iranian opposition group to alert IAEA inspectors to the construction of a secret uranium - enrichment plant at Natanz and a heavy - water reactor that produces plutonium at Arak .
Since 2003 , the IAEA has found multiple other breaches of Iran 's nuclear safeguards .
Caught radioactive - handed , Iran could have chosen to come clean .
Instead it stonewalled , refusing to answer questions about some of its alleged activities , including those that the NIE is confident were clear evidence of weapons intent .
Under intense scrutiny , and fearful that it could be next on Mr Bush 's target list after Afghanistan and Iraq , in 2003 Iran called a temporary halt at Natanz and put out feelers to America for talks .
But America ignored those approaches , and since 2006 Iran has resumed uranium enrichment .
If its intentions were peaceful as claimed , this behaviour is “ incomprehensible ” , says Pierre Goldschmidt , a former deputy head of the IAEA .
Mr ElBaradei , the head of the IAEA , seems less certain of this .
Fortified by a Nobel peace prize , he has been working assiduously to prevent a military confrontation between Iran and America .
This outspoken effort to confound what he has called the “ crazies ” in Washington has angered Western diplomats .
They complain that he has tripped up diplomacy ( he suggested that Iran be allowed to keep some enrichment work going , even though the Security Council and the IAEA itself had demanded a halt ) and cares more about getting Iran “ out of the doghouse ” than doing his job by holding it fully to account .
Iran itself certainly appears to see the IAEA as the way out of its remaining difficulties rather than a thorn in its side .
On a charm offensive at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 26th , its foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , told world leaders that it made no sense for the Security Council to consider new sanctions at a time when American spies had confirmed that Iran was not building a bomb and Iran was on the verge of completing the “ work plan ” it signed with the IAEA last August .
Under that plan Iran promised to answer the agency 's outstanding questions by last December .
Now it says it will divulge all by mid-February .
The Iranians have already come up with some more answers about past illicit plutonium experiments .
They have shown that some of the unexplained traces of enriched uranium came from contaminated imports supplied by the black - market operation run by the now disgraced head of one of Pakistan 's nuclear laboratories , Abdul Qadeer Khan .
( Iran says it bought kit from Mr Khan because nobody else would supply needed “ civil ” equipment . )
And they have told inspectors more about the faster - spinning centrifuge machines supplied by the Khan network that Mr Ahmadinejad had already boasted were undergoing tests .
But inspectors have more questions .
They are still probing , among other things , alleged activities that the NIE report is confident show clear weapons intent : design work on a potential warhead and a test shaft , and high - explosive testing to develop triggers for nuclear bombs .
Come mid-February , Mr ElBaradei and his inspectors may have got no more than another Persian raspberry on some of this .
They will report to the IAEA 's 35 - nation board in March .
In any case , accounting for Iran 's past does not lessen the danger of its accumulation of enriched uranium for the future .
A stock of low - enriched uranium could give it a break - out capacity to build a weapon in a matter of a few months , depending on how far Iran had got with its earlier weaponisation work .
Thanks to Natanz , Iran could have enough highly - enriched uranium for a bomb by 2009 , says the NIE report , though more probably by 2010 - 15 .
So being more truthful about the past would not get Iran entirely off the hook .
Conditional offers
But might it open a path to negotiations with America ?
In a change of policy last year , Condoleezza Rice , America 's secretary of state , said she would be willing to talk directly to Iran about all their differences ( they are already talking on and off about Iraq ) once it had suspended uranium enrichment .
The Americans and Europeans , supported by Russia and China , promised that a halt to enrichment would win Iran improved political and economic ties , talks on regional security and help with advanced , but less suspect , nuclear technology .
Russia even offered to enrich uranium on Iran 's behalf , to get talks going .
Many of America 's presidential candidates have added to the mood music by picking up ideas for a “ grand bargain ” with Iran across a range of issues .
Yet it is far from clear that Iran is interested in a deal with America , especially while Mr Bush remains president .
Ayatollah Khamenei recently allowed that the bar on talks with America might not last for ever .
But , for the moment , “ Not having relations with America is one of our main policies ” , he said .
In the meantime , Iran continues to deride the actions of the Security Council as “ illegal ” .
Its atomic energy chief says he expects a clean bill of health from the IAEA in March , and at that point “ Iran 's nuclear case will be closed . ”
Mr Khamenei and Mr Ahmadinejad have long counted on the hesitation of sanctions - shy Russia and China , and the support of friends in the non-aligned movement , to give Iran sufficient cover to enrich on regardless .
America , Mr Khamenei reportedly told Mr ElBaradei , “ will not be able to bring the Iranian nation to its knees by raising this or other issues ” .
Mr Bush , to be fair , has stressed that he has no intention of depriving Iran of the properly peaceful benefits of nuclear power — to the point of supporting Russia over the start of its fuel supplies for Bushehr .
One reason for Iran 's defiance is that Mr Bush is looking increasingly weak .
On his tour of the Middle East last month , the president talked up the Iranian threat and America 's determination to deal with it diplomatically .
But his public efforts to rally Arab governments to confront Iran fell flat .
Damagingly , the NIE is being read in the Gulf as a signal that Mr Bush is no longer serious about facing down Iran .
An uneasy home front
As Iran approaches parliamentary elections in March , the regime 's bigger headaches may be on the home front .
Officialdom can brush off protests , such as a petition from several hundred activists , journalists and academics calling for a uranium freeze , and a letter from more than 500 women criticising some in the regime for playing into America 's hands with their defiance and risking war .
Mr Ahmadinejad may claim the NIE as a victory .
But before its publication and since , he has been under attack from fellow conservatives for the parlous state of Iran 's economy .
Even Mr Khamenei has chipped in with mild criticism , and recently overrode the president to order increased spending on gas supplies for Iran 's remoter regions that have been suffering shortages in a bitterly cold winter .
EPA
Ahmadinejad is less than loved
Oil may be hovering around $ 90 - 100 a barrel , but Mr Ahmadinejad has squandered much of the windfall on wasteful subsidies .
In a country where two - thirds are under 30 , unemployment is rising fast .
Inflation now runs at an official 19 % , according to central - bank figures , compared with 12 % in 2006 , and may well be higher .
Iran 's international isolation adds to the distress .
The UN'S sanctions have been closely targeted on companies and individuals involved in nuclear and missile work , but American - inspired financial sanctions bite harder .
Most European and Japanese banks , with too much to lose to fall foul of America 's sanctions laws , have backed away from business in or with Iran , especially in dollars , but in other currencies too .
In recent months some banks in the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain — where Iran has transferred a lot of its business — have reportedly followed suit .
Trade continues , but governments have pruned export credits .
Although India has hitherto been one of Iran 's main suppliers of refined gasoline and diesel , the difficulty in getting letters of credit recently forced Iran to find supplies through Singapore .
China has picked up contracts to exploit Iran 's oil and gas fields where European and Japanese companies have hesitated , but Iran needs Western technology to prevent energy production slipping further .
Disgruntlement at the cost of economic isolation grows .
The hope behind Western strategy has been that ordinary Iranians who take pride in their country 's nuclear prowess will come to question the price they are being asked to pay for persisting with expensive technologies that other nuclear - powered countries have done without .
All the more so , since their government denies any weapons intent .
The trouble is that Mr Ahmadinejad 's conservative critics within the regime and in parliament tend to be hardliners over Iran 's nuclear “ rights ” .
The president 's men may fare badly in the March elections .
Mr Ahmadinejad could be turfed out of office in presidential elections next year .
But it is the supreme leader who makes nuclear policy , and this may not change .
Having persisted with enrichment in defiance of sanctions , why should Iran alter course just when the combined efforts of America 's spies and the IAEA look likely to bring about a reduction of pressure and an escape from isolation ?
Hedging their bets , American allies such as Egypt and the Gulf Arabs have lately been showing a friendlier face to Iran .
In theory , one possibility Iran still needs to worry about is a pre-emptive attack by Israel .
Israel has no doubt that Iran is bent on getting the capability for a bomb , something that Mr Olmert says Israel will “ not tolerate ” .
Content to pipe down while pressure on Iran was building , Israel has nonetheless deliberately narrowed the ambiguity over its own nuclear arsenal , once a taboo subject in public .
A missile Israel recently tested was able to carry an “ unconventional ” payload , said Israel Radio .
Israel has also just launched a sophisticated spy satellite , making no secret of the fact that its target is Iran .
What Israel may or may not do
Israel says that even if America 's spies are right ( and it does not think they are ) about Iran having given up its efforts to build a nuclear warhead in 2003 , Iran 's enrichment activities at Natanz are a clear and present danger .
But whether Israel would dare to go it alone in an attack on Iran is uncertain .
Doing so without American approval or help would be fraught with danger , and the NIE has made it very much harder for Israel to justify such an attack in the court of public opinion .
What if neither sanctions nor force stops the centrifuges ?
Once Iran produces sufficient nuclear material , it could eventually get to not much more than a screwdriver 's turn from a bomb — as Pakistan showed before it decided to echo India 's nuclear tests in 1998 .
In 1981 Israeli airstrikes crippled an uncompleted Iraqi nuclear reactor to nip Saddam Hussein 's nuclear ambitions in the bud ( Iran , just as concerned at Iraq 's intentions , had earlier struck the reactor with missiles ) .
The attack may have delayed Iraq 's nuclear programme , but also drove it underground .
After the first Gulf war ten years later , astonished weapons inspectors found Iraq had been working secretly on three different ways to a bomb .
Paradoxically , America 's NIE raises the alarm about just this sort of eventuality .
The 16 intelligence services that signed the report concluded that Iran has the scientific and industrial capacity to build a nuclear weapon if it chooses , and that “ at a minimum ” it is keeping the option to do so open .
But , whether by accident or design , the report was written in a way that allowed the finding about weaponisation to suck attention away from the uranium work , which diplomats had spent years trying to stop by means of painstaking diplomacy .
Iran may not yet be home free , but the international campaign to stop it getting the bomb that many countries think it wants is on the point of failure .
Aug. 25 , 2005 -- --
If you saw Anthony Sukto , you would n't think he 's any different from most little boys .
He 's just as playful and cheerful .
But many people call him a hero .
Less than a year ago , Anthony 's father stabbed his mother to death before the boy 's eyes in their home in Tacoma , Wash .
Then he turned the knife on Anthony .
The 8 - year - old was stabbed six times -- slashed in the face , neck and chest , and cut twice in the liver .
Despite bleeding profusely , he managed to call 911 .
When emergency worker Kristin Woodrow answered the call , she heard the boy 's plaintive cry : " Please , help me ! "
He continued , " My daddy killed me with a knife and I 'm gone .
Can you please send the army men or the ambulance ? "
Anthony gave an address , and then suddenly hung up .
Woodrow called back .
Anthony explained to her : " My daddy killed me with a butcher knife . "
" How did that happen if you are talking to me ? " Woodrow asked .
" My dad , he was killing my mom and then , my dad told me to go into the other bed , " Anthony said .
" Then he 's like , ' You 're next ' and then he killed me .
I 'm still alive .
I kind of survived . "
Small Crucial Details
However , Anthony 's ordeal was far from over .
The street and house number he gave Woodrow did n't match , so she worked to get more information .
She asked him what kind of car his father drove , and what color it was .
From the small , crucial details , authorities were able to locate Anthony -- and his father , Tony , who was still at the scene .
Lt. Mark Eakes , who was among the first to arrive , remembers seeing the boy .
" He just was covered in blood -- his own blood .
His face , his neck , his chest , his back -- everything you looked at was blood , " Eakes said .
Anthony 's father was apprehended .
He told police he was " possessed " and that " spirits made him " do it .
Police say Sukto's wife , Pranee , was a victim of domestic abuse .
Angels on His Shoulders
Today , Woodrow reflects with wonder on her conversation with the boy .
" He was so calm , it was unreal , " she told " Primetime " co-anchor John Quiñones .
" I had to really work hard to confirm that what he was telling me was right . "
" I can't imagine what he felt , I can't imagine the fear .
But the fact he knew what to do , he knew how to do it .
He 's a hero , " she said .
Anthony 's aunt Nancy , with whom he now lives in Florida , agrees .
" He 's a special boy , " she said .
But Anthony says he was n't acting alone .
" God helped me .
He sent his angel , " he told Quiñones .
" The angel carried me to dial 911 . "
Anthony says that as he lay there bleeding , he actually heard a voice telling him to play dead until his father left the house .
" I heard , ' I will save you , ' " he told Quiñones .
Meanwhile , Nancy works to keep Anthony 's memory of his mother alive .
" I think about her a lot , " Anthony told Quiñones .
He still has nightmares about the day his mom was killed , but today Anthony is recovering surprisingly well -- thanks to the love of his family and friends , and thanks to those " angels " who , he says , saved his life .
Tony Sukto is scheduled to go on trial on Sept. 15 .
He says he plans to plead not guilty .
Congress is holding hearings on the use of carbon monoxide by retailers in meat .
American stores routinely inject carbon monoxide into meat to make it look fresh .
Even two year old meat filled with e-coli can look pink and fresh when treated with carbon monoxide .
Various countries have banned the practice , but the Bush Administration has refused to take action .
For the full story , click here Putting aside health questions , it is a dishonest practice meant to hide the age of meat .
The practice recalls other techniques such as dipping meat that has been the subject of litigation .
In the Food Lion v. ABC case , the store was shown in an undercover segment engaging in unsanitary techniques and accused Food Lion of selling rat - gnawed cheese , meat that was past its expiration date and old fish and ham that had been washed in bleach to kill the smell .

Today eight colleagues and I are releasing a significant new research result .
We show that disk encryption , the standard approach to protecting sensitive data on laptops , can be defeated by relatively simple methods .
We demonstrate our methods by using them to defeat three popular disk encryption products : BitLocker , which comes with Windows Vista ; FileVault , which comes with MacOS X ; and dm- crypt , which is used with Linux .
The research team includes J. Alex Halderman , Seth D. Schoen , Nadia Heninger , William Clarkson , William Paul , Joseph A. Calandrino , Ariel J. Feldman , Jacob Appelbaum , and Edward W. Felten .
Our site has links to the paper , an explanatory video , and other materials .
The root of the problem lies in an unexpected property of today ’s DRAM memories .
DRAMs are the main memory chips used to store data while the system is running .
Virtually everybody , including experts , will tell you that DRAM contents are lost when you turn off the power .
But this is n’t so .
Our research shows that data in DRAM actually fades out gradually over a period of seconds to minutes , enabling an attacker to read the full contents of memory by cutting power and then rebooting into a malicious operating system .
Interestingly , if you cool the DRAM chips , for example by spraying inverted cans of “ canned air ” dusting spray on them , the chips will retain their contents for much longer .
At these temperatures ( around - 50 °C ) you can remove the chips from the computer and let them sit on the table for ten minutes or more , without appreciable loss of data .
Cool the chips in liquid nitrogen ( - 196 °C ) and they hold their state for hours at least , without any power .
Just put the chips back into a machine and you can read out their contents .
This is deadly for disk encryption products because they rely on keeping master decryption keys in DRAM .
This was thought to be safe because the operating system would keep any malicious programs from accessing the keys in memory , and there was no way to get rid of the operating system without cutting power to the machine , which “ everybody knew ” would cause the keys to be erased .
Our results show that an attacker can cut power to the computer , then power it back up and boot a malicious operating system ( from , say , a thumb drive ) that copies the contents of memory .
Having done that , the attacker can search through the captured memory contents , find any crypto keys that might be there , and use them to start decrypting hard disk contents .
We show very effective methods for finding and extracting keys from memory , even if the contents of memory have faded somewhat ( i.e. , even if some bits of memory were flipped during the power - off interval ) .
If the attacker is worried that memory will fade too quickly , he can chill the DRAM chips before cutting power .
There seems to be no easy fix for these problems .
Fundamentally , disk encryption programs now have nowhere safe to store their keys .
Today ’s Trusted Computing hardware does not seem to help ; for example , we can defeat BitLocker despite its use of a Trusted Platform Module .

What is wealth ?
Let me try a slightly non-standard answer to that question .
Wealth is a measure of your ability to do what you would like to do , when you would like to do it - a measure of your breadth of immediately available choice .
Therefore your wealth is determined by the resources you presently own , as everything requires resources .
For the sake of argument , let us say that your resources presently amount to a leather bag containing a hundred unmarked silver coins .
Interestingly enough , by the " what would you like to do " measure , you are fantastically more wealthy than any given ancestor put in the same position of ownership .
You have immensely greater choice .
Clearly there is more to wealth - as - choice than present property .
We must also consider the historical investment made into increasing choice , and into lowering the cost of specific - usually popular - choices .
The engines of technology and open , free markets are turned by people to create new , better , cheaper choices .
The choice to fly , the choice to remain alive with heart disease , the choice to avoid that heart disease .
Where do silver coins - or indeed , any other resources you might own - come from ?
Where does investment come from ?
After all , we do n't come into this world with the proverbial silver implement between the teeth .
No , we worked for those coins .
We spent time and negotiated payment for that time .
Why ?
Because time is valuable .
But time spent alive , measured in the ticking of heartbeats , is more than valuable - it is wealth itself , the source of all other measures of wealth .
All property was created by someone , somewhere , taking their time .
The creation and exchange of property is a way to make time fungible , transferrable , a more valuable resource .
Time spent alive is the root of all property , all human action , and thus all wealth - both the silver in your pocket that provides for present choice , and the wealth of possible choices created by past investment .
Time is everything .
How much have time you spent reading this far ?
Could you have been doing something more useful , more optimal from your perspective ?
We make these small evaluations constantly , because time is the most valuable thing we have .
We all go through engineering our cycles of property and time ; how can we best optimize time to generate property that can be used to make our time more effective ?
We do this in small ways and large , but everyone does it .
Some people do it so effectively they launch themselves into property escape velocity , exponentially increasing the effectiveness of their time and exploring the outer limits of what it means to maintain ownership of a great deal of property .
Interestingly , despite the grand importance of time as the absolute foundation of wealth , very little progress has been made in the most obvious optimization of all : creating property that can create more time .
More heartbeats , more health , more time spent alive and active .
Rejuvenation medicine , capable of repairing the damage of aging .
Tissue engineering to generate replacements for worn organs .
The cure for cancer .
If you could do all that , then the much more productive form of escape velocity becomes possible - longevity escape velocity .
Why strive to maintain an empire of property that will crumble to dust when the degenerations of age catch up with you when you could be that fit - looking guy having a blast swimming in the breakers every other Sunday for as long as you like ?
Wealth is exactly time , and here we are , bordering the era of biotechnology for the repair of aging .
Planning ahead for the best possible personal future starts with investment now .
Think about it .
9 Signs You Should n’t Hire THAT Web Guy
My employer specializes in creating websites for middle - sized businesses .
We rarely create " Mom 'n ' Pops " websites and generally do n't pursue contracts with major corporations .
Working with mid-size business has given me the opportunity to speak with executives and " decision - makers " within each business .
Our discussions eventually end up with the other person telling me about their previous web developers and how their current site is ineffective as a sales tool or representation of the business .
There are some definitive characteristics about my customers ' previous web persons and without further adieu , I give you 9 signs you should n't hire THAT web guy .
1. He Calls Himself a " Webmaster "
Any web guy that calls himself a " webmaster " probably is n't a master of anything .
The term " webmaster " has become a translation for the word " amateur . "
The web has diversified into so many different realms that webmaster is no longer meaningful ( was it ever though ? )
2. He 's a FrontPage Expert
Any developer / designer with a degree knows that Microsoft FrontPage most definitely is n't a professional tool .
FrontPage will pass for Mom and Dad who want to create a website dedicated to their dogs , not someone who 's trying to do business .
I 'd argue that a solid Web Developer should work at code level .
3 . He 'll Submit Your Website to [ Inflated Number Here ] Search Engines
Submitting your website to hundreds of search engines would be great ... 10 years ago .
Websites are indexed by relevant search engines by how rich their content and keywords are .
Search engine optimization is big business and submitting sites to search engines simply is n't the way to get to the top of Google .
4. He Wants a " Designed By .... "
Plug on the Bottom of Every Page
You 've paid this person to create a marketing tool for you -- not a billboard for him .
Your website is a launch pad for your business and Poindexter McScooner is simply the man behind the curtain -- keep him there .
5 . He Created a Cool Website for [ Insert Family Member / Friend Here ]
Your business needs someone who 's been there before .
The most common answer to my " Who was he and what business did they work for ? " question is " Oh , he did a website for the CEO 's daughter 's [ insert lame organization here ] . "
I honestly hear that friend - of - a- friend story all the time .
Choose someone with a sizable portfolio that can provide references .
6. He Can Make You a Great Splash Page Flash Animation
Translation : " I can spend dozens of hours wasting your money to create something that will take too long to load and will be skipped more times than dessert at a bad restaurant . "
Consistency and website flow are important to web design -- not meaningless animations that waste visitors ' time and your money .
7. He Mentions He 's a HTML Expert
Who the hell is n't ?
I would argue that dropping any language acronym on a customer ( PHP , Ruby on Rails , ColdFusion , etc. ) unless they ask is meaningless fluff .
A mechanic could use a banana on my car if it would fix it .
Keep your tools , especially HTML , to yourself -- the customer does n't care .
8. He'll Fit a Cool Counter on Your Site
You 'll add an ugly relic of the early internet on my site so that my competitors have an idea of my web stats ?
Sweet !
Counters make a website look as unprofessional as possible -- do n't use them .
9 . He 'll Place a " Best If Viewed in ... "
Message on Your Website
Any real Web Developer knows that he does n't make the rules .
Follow standards in the initial build and then fix it in Internet Explorer -- that 's the flow .
No responsible programmer would place a " best if view in ... " message on the front - end of a website .

実験 2 : 5 の累乗の表示 実験 1 の数字を 10 進表示するのにかかる時間を調べました。多倍長整数を文字列化するということは基数変換するということであり、これが結構時間のかかる処理なのです。

実験 3 : 円周率の計算 最後に、多倍長整数を使って円周率 を 100 桁 、1,000 桁 、10,000 桁計算する時間を調べました 。 100 1000 10000 ruby 0.03 0.25 5.77 python 0.09 0.13 6.11 perl ( bigint ) 0.25 3.44 N/ A perl( GMP ) 0.11 0.59 6.56 あれほど圧倒的だった GMP がなぜか普通です。もっと大きな桁で威力を発揮するのかな。ruby と python はほぼ同じ。bigint はやっぱり全然ダメです 。
以下ソース。python わからないのでなんだかかっこわるい 。GMP の演算は破壊的なので copy ( ) とか必要でうっとうしすぎます。 a = b = 10 ** n ( n * 8 + 1 ) .step ( 3 , - 2 ) do | i | a = ( i / 2 ) * ( a + b * 2 ) / i end puts " 3 . #{ a - b } " a = b = 10 ** n for i in range ( n * 8 + 1 , 1 , - 2 ) : a = divmod ( divmod ( i , 2 ) [ 0 ] * ( a + b * 2 ) , i ) [ 0 ] print ( " 3.

" ) ; use strict ; use Math :: BigInt lib => " GMP " ; my $ a = Math :: BigInt -> new ( 10 ) -> bpow (n ) ; my $b = $ a -> copy ( ) ; my $ i ; my $t ; for ( $ i = n * 8 + 1 ; $ i >= 3 ; $ i -= 2 ) { $t = $ b -> copy ( ) ; $ a -> badd ( $t ) ; $ a -> badd ( $t ) ; $t = Math : : BigInt -> new ( int ( $ i / 2 ) ) ; $t -> bmul ( $ a ) ; $t -> bdiv ( $ i ) ; $ a = $t ; } $ a -> bsub ( $ b ) ; print ( " 3 . $ a
" ) ;
いい加減なまとめ 現状では、気軽に多倍長演算を享受したい時は ruby か python がおすすめです。perl の bigint は 速度がどうでもいいときだけ使いましょう 速度が重要なら GMP とあわせて使いましょう 。ソースを書くのが面倒でもそれなりに速く多倍長演算したいときは GMP がよさそうです 。
以下追記 : H.I . 2008/01/17 10:09
「 use bigint lib => ' GMP '」と書くことができて、GMPで
operator / constant overload をしてくれるみたいです。 との情報をいただきまし た 。Perl では記述性と速度を両取りする選択肢もあるようです
。Perl はさすがですね。円周率 10000 桁で試したところ 、10 秒でした 。GMP を直接たたくより若干遅 い
* 1 ようですが、記述性があがる方がいいですね。
あと、すべて実時間で計測してます。プロセスの初期化時間やコンパイル時間が含まれますので、0.0x のような小さい数値はあてにしないでください。

[ Activists ]
The American Family Association has recently discovered a vast conspiracy .
Now they 're issuing DVDs to help protect people against the coming invasion !
Residents of the small Arkansas town of Eureka Springs noticed the homosexual community was growing .
But they felt no threat .
They went about their business as usual .
Then , one day , they woke up to discover that their beloved Eureka Springs , a community which was known far and wide as a center for Christian entertainment -- had changed .
The City Council had been taken over by a small group of homosexual activists .
The Eureka Springs they knew is gone .
It is now a national hub for homosexuals .
Eureka Springs is becoming the San Francisco of Arkansas .
The story of how this happened is told in the new AFA DVD “ They ’re Coming To Your Town . ”
One of the first actions of the homosexual controlled City Council was to offer a “ registry ” where homosexuals could register their unofficial “ marriage . ”
City Council member Joyce Zeller said the city will now be promoted , not as a Christian resort , but a city “ selling peace , relaxation , history and sex . ”
AFA ’s “ They ’re Coming ToYour Town ” documents the story of how and why this happened .
And how homosexual activists plan to do the same in other towns .

As long as we 're discussing what 's wrong with one another 's countries , how about at least we do n't pay millions of dollars of taxpayer 's money to fund a fricking monarchy that does n't even have any power ... not trying to start a fight here but come on , we have better things to do than make pointless generalizations about each other 's relative intelligence .

America is getting robbed of their money with the Federal Income Tax so go find out where your money is going .. second , if you really think the Queen does n't have any power then you 're just another head of american cattle , Tony Blair is just another bitch that does whatever the queen and her sick husband want .

Great so , even better , instead of paying millions of dollars to support the wealthiest family in history , England is paying millions of dollars to support a completely unelected but powerful figurehead ... how is that any less worthy of criticism ?
Finally ... you really want to talk about British politics but you do n't know that it 's been months since Tony Blair was Prime Minister ?
Wowsah .

Now , do n't be too hard on the wingnuts at the American Family Association .
Turns out they 're the best ad agency Eureka Springs , Arkansas has ever had .
The reason they 've produced a nice little travelogue about our " takeover " of this mountaintop tourist town is because we have the only Domestic Partnership Registry in the state ; four Diversity Weekends a year ; more than 50 gay owned businesses and an enlightened and progressive population that advocates inclusiveness and justice for all .
Eureka Springs has been a " mecca " for gays , artists , hippies , independent thinkers and assorted other eccentric misfits for decades .
It 's a wonderful place to live and visit .
If the American Family Ass-ociation does n't like us , we know we 're doing something right .

Hope the AFA is proud and happy .
Oh , just a note , tourism is up this year for the town Name : ( change name for anonymous posting ) Title : Comments : 1 Article displayed .
Perhaps a global political apocalypse has already arrived .
Activists and dissidents should understand that evil forces and tyrannical governments have evolved .
Just as human knowledge and science expand , so do the strategies and instruments used by rulers , elites and plutocrats .
By learning from history and using new technology they have smarter tools of tyranny .
The best ones prevent uprisings , revolutions and political reforms .
Rather than violently destroy rebellious movements , they let them survive as marginalized and ineffective efforts that divert and sap the energy of nonconformist and rebellious thinkers .
Real revolution remains an energy - draining dream , as evil forces thrive .
Most corrupt and legally sanctioned forms of tyranny hide in plain sight as democracies with free elections .
The toughest lesson is that ALL elections are distractions .
Nothing conceals tyranny better than elections .
Few Americans accept that their government has become a two - party plutocracy run by a rich and powerful ruling class .
The steady erosion of the rule of law is masked by everyday consumer freedoms .
Because people want to be happy and hopeful , we have an epidemic of denial , especially in the present presidential campaign .
But to believe that any change - selling politician or shift in party control will overturn the ruling class is the epitome of self - delusion and false hope .
In the end , such wishful thinking perpetuates plutocracy .
Proof is that plutocracy has flourished despite repeated change agents , promises of reform and partisan shifts .
The tools of real rebellion are weak .
Activists and dissidents look back and see successful rebellions and revolutions and think that when today ’s victims of tyranny experience enough pain and see enough political stink they too will revolt .
This is wrong .
They think that the Internet spreads information and inspiration to the masses , motivating them to revolt .
This is wrong .
They await catastrophic economic or environmental collapse to spur rebellion .
This too is wrong .
Why are these beliefs wrong ?
Power elites have an arsenal of weapons to control and manipulate social , political and economic systems globally : corruption of public officials that make elections a sham ; corporate mainstream media that turn news into propaganda ; manipulation of financial markets that create fear for the public and profits for the privileged ; false free trade globalization that destroys the middle class ; rising economic inequality that keep the masses time - poor and financially insecure ; intense marketing of pharmaceuticals that keep people passive ; and addictive consumerism , entertainment and gambling that keep people distracted and pacified .
The biggest challenge for dissidents and rebels is to avoid feel - good therapeutic activism having virtually no chance of removing evil and tyranny .
Idealism without practicality tactics without lofty goals , and symbolic protests pose no threat to power elites .
Anger and outrage require great strategic thinking from leaders seeking revolution , not mere change .
And social entrepreneurs that use business and management skills to tackle genuine social problems do nothing to achieve political reforms .
To the extent they achieve results they end up removing interest in overthrowing political establishments that have allowed the problems to fester .
What is the new tool of tyranny ?
Technological connectivity achieved through advanced communications and computer systems , especially the rise of wireless connectivity .
The global message to the masses is simple : Buy electronic products to stay plugged in .
Connectivity may give pleasure , but it gives even more power to elites , rulers and plutocrats .
It allows them to coordinate their efforts through invisible cabals , to closely monitor everything that ordinary people and dissidents do , and to cooperatively and clandestinely adjust social , financial and political systems to maintain stability and dominance .
In this dystopian world all systems are integrated to serve upper class elites and the corporate state , not ordinary people .
When ordinary people spend their money to be more shackled to connectivity products , they become unwitting victims of largely invisible governmental and corporate oppressive forces .
They are oblivious that their technological seduction exacerbates their political and economic exploitation .
Though some 70 percent believe the country is on the wrong track , they fail to see the deeper causes of the trend .
And if Americans were really happy and content with their consumer culture , then why are they stuffing themselves with so many antidepressants , sleeping pills and totally unhealthy foods ?
In truth , the vast majority of people are in denial about the rotten system they are trapped in ( aka The Matrix ) .
They are manipulated to keep hope alive through voting , despite the inability of past elections to stop the slide into economic serfdom .
Increasingly , the little - discussed phenomenon of economic apartheid ensures that elites live their lavish lives safely in physically separated ways .
Concurrently , economic inequality rises , as the rich extract unusually high fractions of global wealth .
When the rich get richer , the powerful get stronger .
Does some economic prosperity trickles down to the poorest people ?
Perversely , the middle class is moved into the lower class .
In this new physics of evil , wealth transfer is not from the rich to the poor , but from the middle class in wealthier countries to the poor in developing nations , where a few new billionaires join the global plutocracy .
Some data on economic inequality :
The after - tax income of the top 1 percent of Americans rose 228 percent from 1979 through 2005 , while middle class income remained flat over the last 4 decades .
The richest 0.01 percent of earners made 5.1 percent of all income in 2005 , up more than 300 percent from just 1.2 percent in 1960 .
Bad economic times like the present just exacerbate inequality .
Even as most Wall Street companies lost billions in the sub - prime mortgage debacle after they had already made billions , they gave obscene bonuses to their employees : the average topped $ 180,000 for 2007 , tripling the $ 61,000 in 2002 .
Scholars used to predict that high levels of economic inequality like we have today would lead to rebellion .
But there are now insufficient tools and paths for rebellion , because the plutocracy has eliminated them .
Instead , citizens are offered elections whose outcomes can be controlled and subverted by the ruling class .
The New World Order is getting what it wants : a stable two - class system , with the lower class serving the elitist upper class .
The paradox is that along with rising economic inequality and apartheid is mounting consumerism and materialism that is used to pacify , distract and control the masses .
That ’s where easy credit and cheap products from low - wage nations are critical .
The poor can have cell phones , 24 - 7 Internet access and increasingly cars , while the bejeweled upper class travel in private jets and yachts , vacation on private islands , and have several gated mansions maintained by servants and guarded by private police .
We have a technologically advanced form of medieval society .
It is working in the US and China and most other places .
Elections just mask economic tyranny and slavery .
The ruling class knows how to maintain stability .
Keep the masses distracted , fearful , brainwashed , insecure , and dependent on government and business sectors for survival .
Train people to see themselves as relatively free consumers .
Maintain the myth that ordinary people can become wealthy and join the ruling class , which theoretically is not impossible , but of no statistical significance for the masses .
There are no easy paths to restore power to the people .
But here are three strategies worth considering .
First , the real power of the masses is as consumers , not as voters , workers , activists , or Internet users .
Weakened unions , globalization , technology , and illegal immigration have sapped the power of workers .
National economies , especially the US , depend on consumers .
Suspensions in discretionary consumer spending used as a political weapon could force reforms .
But curbing personal spending and saving money has become a rare form of civil disobedience .
Consumers buy stuff when they want it , not when they can afford it .
Rulers have replaced chains with debt and no political leader in a very long time has championed economic rebellion .
Second , because they are more a tool of tyranny than rebellion , the masses should stop giving credibility and legitimacy to faux democracies by boycotting elections .
Plutocrats cleverly equate patriotism and good citizenship with voting while at the same time ensuring that no genuine change agents can succeed even if elected .
All election results can be subverted by the forces of corruption .
Those promising change , like Barack Obama , do not pose a lethal threat to forces of evil and corruption .
Sadly , refusing to vote in corrupt political systems is another worthy but unpopular form of civil disobedience .
The compulsion to vote is a political narcotic that sustains democratic tyranny .
Third , people must seek forms of direct democracy that give them political power .
National ballot measures and initiatives are needed to make laws , impose spending mandates and recall elected officials .
A most important tool is constitutional conventions outside the control of status quo preservationists to obtain systemic reforms that governments will never provide , as explained for the US at www.foavc.org.
No greater example of ruling class power exists than the absence of massive public demands for using what the Founders gave Americans in Article V : the convention option to circumvent and fix the federal government that – amazingly – has never been used , and that no presidential candidate has supported , including constitutional champion Ron Raul .

Onthe morning of 9 February 2004 , The New York Times carried an exclusive and alarming story .
The paper 's Baghdad correspondent , Dexter Filkins , reported that US officials had obtained a 17 - page letter , believed to have been written by the notorious terrorist Abu Musab al Zarqawi to the " inner circle " of al - Qa'ida 's leadership , urging them to accept that the best way to beat US forces in Iraq was effectively to start a civil war .
The letter argued that al - Qa'ida , which is a Sunni network , should attack the Shia population of Iraq : " It is the only way to prolong the duration of the fight between the infidels and us .
If we succeed in dragging them into a sectarian war , this will awaken the sleepy Sunnis . "
Later that day , at a regular US press briefing in Baghdad , US General Mark Kimmitt dealt with a string of questions about The New York Times report : " We believe the report and the document is credible , and we take the report seriously ...
It is clearly a plan on the part of outsiders to come in to this country and spark civil war , create sectarian violence , try to expose fissures in this society . "
The story went on to news agency wires and , within 24 hours , it was running around the world .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
There is very good reason to believe that that letter was a fake – and a significant one because there is equally good reason to believe that it was one product among many from a new machinery of propaganda which has been created by the United States and its allies since the terrorist attacks of September 2001 .
For the first time in human history , there is a concerted strategy to manipulate global perception .
And the mass media are operating as its compliant assistants , failing both to resist it and to expose it .
The sheer ease with which this machinery has been able to do its work reflects a creeping structural weakness which now afflicts the production of our news .
I 've spent the last two years researching a book about falsehood , distortion and propaganda in the global media .
The " Zarqawi letter " which made it on to the front page of The New York Times in February 2004 was one of a sequence of highly suspect documents which were said to have been written either by or to Zarqawi and which were fed into news media .
This material is being generated , in part , by intelligence agencies who continue to work without effective oversight ; and also by a new and essentially benign structure of " strategic communications " which was originally designed by doves in the Pentagon and Nato who wanted to use subtle and non-violent tactics to deal with Islamist terrorism but whose efforts are poorly regulated and badly supervised with the result that some of its practitioners are breaking loose and engaging in the black arts of propaganda .
Like the new propaganda machine as a whole , the Zarqawi story was born in the high tension after the attacks of September 2001 .
At that time , he was a painful thorn in the side of the Jordanian authorities , an Islamist radical who was determined to overthrow the royal family .
But he was nothing to do with al - Q'aida .
Indeed , he had specifically rejected attempts by Bin Laden to recruit him , because he was not interested in targeting the West .
Nevertheless , when US intelligence battered on the doors of allied governments in search of information about al - Q'aida , the Jordanian authorities – anxious to please the Americans and perhaps keen to make life more difficult for their native enemy – threw up his name along with other suspects .
Soon he started to show up as a minor figure in US news stories – stories which were factually weak , often contradictory and already using the Jordanians as a tool of political convenience .

Then , on 7 October 2002 , for the first time , somebody referred to him on the record .
In a nationally televised speech in Cincinnati , President George Bush spoke of " high - level contacts " between al - Q'aida and Iraq and said : " Some al - Q'aida leaders who fled Afghanistan , went to Iraq .
These include one very senior al - Q'aida leader who received medical treatment in Baghdad this year , and who has been associated with planning for chemical and biological attacks . "
This coincided with a crucial vote in Congress in which the president was seeking authority to use military force against Iraq .
Bush never named the man he was referring to but , as the Los Angeles Times among many others soon reported : " In a speech [ on ]
Monday , Bush referred to a senior member of al - Q'aida who received medical treatment in Iraq .
US officials said yesterday that was Abu al Musab Zarqawi , a Jordanian , who lost a leg during the US war in Afghanistan . "
Even now , Zarqawi was a footnote , not a headline , but the flow of stories about him finally broke through and flooded the global media on 5 February 2003 , when the Secretary of State , Colin Powell , addressed the UN Security Council , arguing that Iraq must be invaded : first , to stop its development of weapons of mass destruction ; and second , to break its ties with al - Q'aida .
Powell claimed that " Iraq today harbours a deadly terrorist network headed by Abu Musab al Zarqawi " ; that Zarqawi's base in Iraq was a camp for " poison and explosive training " ; that he was " an associate and collaborator of Osama bin Laden and his al - Q'aida lieutenants " ; that he " fought in the Afghan war more than a decade ago " ; that " Zarqawi and his network have plotted terrorist actions against countries , including France , Britain , Spain , Italy , Germany and Russia " .
Courtesy of post - war Senate intelligence inquiries ; evidence disclosed in several European trials ; and the courageous work of a handful of journalists who broke away from the pack , we now know that every single one of those statements was entirely false .
But that did n't matter : it was a big story .
News organisations sucked it in and regurgitated it for their trusting consumers .
So , who exactly is producing fiction for the media ?
Who wrote the Zarqawi letters ?
Who created the fantasy story about Osama bin Laden using a network of subterranean bases in Afghanistan , complete with offices , dormitories , arms depots , electricity and ventilation systems ?
Who fed the media with tales of the Taliban leader , Mullah Omar , suffering brain seizures and sitting in stationery cars turning the wheel and making a noise like an engine ?
Who came up with the idea that Iranian ayatollahs have been encouraging sex with animals and girls of only nine ?
Some of this comes from freelance political agitators .
It was an Iranian opposition group , for example , which was behind the story that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was jailing people for texting each other jokes about him .
And notoriously it was Iraqi exiles who supplied the global media with a dirty stream of disinformation about Saddam Hussein .
But clearly a great deal of this carries the fingerprints of officialdom .
The Pentagon has now designated " information operations " as its fifth " core competency " alongside land , sea , air and special forces .
Since October 2006 , every brigade , division and corps in the US military has had its own " psyop " element producing output for local media .
This military activity is linked to the State Department 's campaign of " public diplomacy " which includes funding radio stations and news websites .
In Britain , the Directorate of Targeting and Information Operations in the Ministry of Defence works with specialists from 15 UK psyops , based at the Defence Intelligence and Security School at Chicksands in Bedfordshire .
In the case of British intelligence , you can see this combination of reckless propaganda and failure of oversight at work in the case of Operation Mass Appeal .
This was exposed by the former UN arms inspector Scott Ritter , who describes in his book , Iraq Confidential , how , in London in June 1998 , he was introduced to two " black propaganda specialists " from MI6 who wanted him to give them material which they could spread through " editors and writers who work with us from time to time " .
In interviews for Flat Earth News , Ritter described how , between December 1997 and June 1998 , he had three meetings with MI6 officers who wanted him to give them raw intelligence reports on Iraqi arms procurement .
The significance of these reports was that they were all unconfirmed and so none was being used in assessing Iraqi activity .
Yet MI6 was happy to use them to plant stories in the media .
Beyond that , there is worrying evidence that , when Lord Butler asked MI6 about this during his inquiry into intelligence around the invasion of Iraq , MI6 lied to him .
Ultimately , the US has run into trouble with its propaganda in Iraq , particularly with its use of the Zarqawi story .
In May 2006 , when yet another of his alleged letters was handed out to reporters in the Combined Press Information Centre in Baghdad , finally it was widely regarded as suspect and ignored by just about every single media outlet .
Arguably , even worse than this loss of credibility , according to British defence sources , the US campaign on Zarqawi eventually succeeded in creating its own reality .
By elevating him from his position as one fighter among a mass of conflicting groups , the US campaign to " villainise Zarqawi " glamorised him with its enemy audience , making it easier for him to raise funds , to attract " unsponsored " foreign fighters , to make alliances with Sunni Iraqis and to score huge impact with his own media manoeuvres .
Finally , in December 2004 , Osama bin Laden gave in to this constructed reality , buried his differences with the Jordanian and declared him the leader of al - Q'aida 's resistance to the American occupation .

It 's not entirely true what Davies is saying .
In the past , we just got scrutiny from newspapers and now think tanks publish results of investigations .

Davies is spot on .
It 's reasonable that newspapers carry PA accounts of court hearings , but he 's right that there 's more " churn " now .

The falling value of the US currency and the prospect of lower interest rates pushed up the oil price .
Crude prices are very close to the inflation - adjusted high set in 1980 .
The International Energy Agency said the price of a barrel of oil peaked at $ 102.53 in April 1980 , after taking account of inflation .
Gas concerns
The oil price was also driven higher by concerns about a fire at the Bacton gas terminal in Norfolk .
Shell said the interconnector , which brings natural gas from Europe ashore in the UK , had not been affected .
" I understand that this fire at the UK natural gas terminal is creating a strong push in the European market , and that is translating here , " US - based energy analyst Tim Evans from Citigroup Futures Research said .
The US dollar continued to weaken on Thursday , hitting an all time low against the euro of $ 1.52 .
Along with worsening US economic growth figures , this drove investors to put money into the oil markets .
They also continued to turn to metals , often regarded as safe havens , with gold , silver and palladium hitting historic levels .
" People just want to have hard assets , " said Bruce Dunn , vice president of trading at Auramet Trading
" I think people are very concerned .
The economic news coming out of the United States is just bad , " he said .

The Sea Organ ( morske orgulje ) is is a natural musical instrument , seventy meters long with thirty - five organ pipes built under the concrete .
The musical pipes are located so that the sea water and wind movements produce musical sounds that are heard by passers by so that it achieves a communication with nature and promotes a unity of architecture and environment .
As sea forces and energies are unpredictable in terms of tides and winds , this organ offers never - ending concert of numerous musical variations in which the performer is nature itself .
Each musical organ pipe is blown by a column of air , pushed in turn by a column of wave - moved water , through a plastic tube immersed into the water .
The pipes ' musically tuned sounds emanate to the surroundings through apertures in the vertical planes of the uppermost stairs .
The 7 successive groups of musical tubes are alternately tuned to two musically cognate chords of the diatonic major scale .
The outcome of played tones and / or chords is a function of random time and space distribution of the wave energy to particular organ pipes .
Listen to some sounds of the Sea Organ
In this part of Croatia the prevailing musical tradition is the spontaneous four - voice male singing , with melodies and chords conforming to the diatonic major scale .
The 5 musically tuned pipes of each section are arranged in 1.5 meter spacings .
A listener , standing or sitting on a chosen point on the scalinade , should be able to hear 5 to 7 musically tuned pipes play their natural music .
Thus , whole five - pipe sections are tuned to one musical chord .
The citizens of Zadar are extremely proud of the first natural musical organ driven by the sea waves ever to be constructed .
This installation , absolutely unique in the world , was designed to let people enjoy the point where the medieval town of Zadar embraces the Adriatic .
Sea Organ - musical instrument played by the sea
The musical Sea Organ ( morske orgulje ) is located on the shores of Zadar , Croatia , and is the world ’s first musical pipe organs that is played by the sea .
Simple and elegant steps , carved in white stone , were built on the quayside .
Underneath , there are 35 musically tuned tubes with whistle openings on the sidewalk .
The movement of the sea pushes air through , and – depending on the size and velocity of the wave – musical chords are played .
The waves create random harmonic sounds .
This masterpiece of acoustics and architecture was created by expert Dalmatian stone carvers and architect Nikola Basic in 2005 , who recently received the European Prize for Urban Public Space for this project .
Many tourists come to listen to this unique aerophone , and enjoy unforgettable sunsets with a view of nearby islands .
Famed director Alfred Hitchcock said that the most beautiful sunset in the world can be seen from precisely this spot on the Zadar quay .
That was how he described it after his visit to Zadar , a visit he remembered throughout his life by the meeting of the sinking sun and the sea .
Thanks to the Sea Organ music project , the inhabitants of Zadar have been restored once more to their relation with the sea .
Chaotic reconstruction work undertaken in an attempt to repair the devastation Zadar suffered in the World War II turned much of the sea front into an unbroken , monotonous concrete wall .
Now , the inviting white marble steps lead down to the water .
Concealed under these steps , which both protect and invite , is a system of polyethylene tubes and a resonating cavity that turns the site into a huge musical instrument , played by the wind and the sea .
Air Holes along the top row of steps let the Sea Organ breathe in air to be transformed into musical sounds as the next wave plays its song .
Below , the sound apertures are visible along the center of the walkway .

A disabled father whose twins have leukaemia made an epic journey and completed a charity bike ride in excruciating pain , only to have his benefits taken away .
It took Danny Johnson - Green four days to finish the 200 - mile trip to raise funds for a cancer charity .
But when the authorities were alerted to his heroic story in the local newspaper they did not take a charitable view of his fundraising efforts , and have decreed that if he is able to ride a bike , he is able to work .
Scroll down for more ...
Mr Johnson - Green embarked on the charity trek from Leicester to Wembley in March last year to raise awareness of his children 's condition and collected some £ 1,300 in donations for charity Clic Sargent .
His two - year - old sons , Terry and James , were diagnosed with leukaemia with 24 hours of each other in November 2006 .
They are now in remission , but face two years further treatment for the disease .
However , Mr Johnson - Green was born with hemiplegia , a muscular condition that has left the 25 - year - old paralysed down one side his body .
It leaves him unable to carry out simple tasks such as getting out of the bath or fastening his shoes without discomfort .
As a result , the charity trip took Mr Johnson - Green four days as he was forced to stop every four miles for a rest .

Soon after the bike ride the Department of Work and Pensions ( DWP ) called him in for an interview .
He claims officials said there was nothing wrong with him , and has now lost his £ 78 a week disability living allowance , which went towards an adapted car .
The father - of - two from Leicester now plans to appeal against the DWPs decision , after they demanded he repays £ 2,600 of benefits .
Speaking yesterday , he said : " Every mile was a struggle .
But I cycled the ride purely on adrenalin , basically I was doing it for my boys and that was what mattered . "
Mr Johnson - Green believes he was targeted after somebody reported him via the benefits fraud hotline .
" I was absolutely devastated .
Not only were they taking money away that I need but they were taking away a car that was adapted to my needs .
The ride was very important , " he said
" It was about raising awareness of leukaemia and money .
" I want them ( DWP ) to realise that they can't go around doing this to people . "
He added that although he had a medical assessment to qualify for disability benefit , he did not have one before the money was withdrawn .
Asked to comment on his case , a DWP spokeswoman said : " We can not comment on individual cases .
If people disagree with a decision on their benefits entitlement they have a right of appeal . "
Eyevine
WHEN they were young they might spend the night at the office , sleeping under their desks .
For years they would go out drinking with colleagues and clients , returning home sozzled at 3 am before rising at dawn to head back to the office .
They accepted boring jobs or postings to provincial backwaters without question .
And they did it all simply because the company asked them to .
The thought of finding another employer never crossed their minds .
That is how the “ salaryman ” became the paragon of modern Japan , the white - collar hero who fashioned the world 's second - largest economy from the ashes of war .
But he is becoming a figure of the past .
This has enormous implications in a country in which the company is the dominant institution in people 's lives , affecting not only Japan 's world of work but also wider Japanese society .
The change in the labour market gathered pace in the 1990s , as Japan 's economic woes forced companies to scale back employees ' benefits dramatically .
Increasingly , many firms hired new staff on short - term or part - time contracts rather than treating them as members of the corporate family .
Japanese businesses , harried by foreign competitors , have gained from having a more flexible workforce .
Moreover , mergers and acquisitions are starting to become more common , so firms cannot offer the traditional long - term assurances to employees even if they want to .
Lastly , a big generational shift is taking place .
Today 's young professionals refuse to make work the centre of their lives or to accept the hardships and corporate paternalism of earlier decades .
These labour - market forces manifest themselves in several ways .
They affect gender equality , as more women enter the workforce .
They touch on immigration , as foreigners are called in to do jobs that the Japanese reject .
They are changing the role of older people , as many pensioners rejoin the workforce .
And they have distributional consequences too .
Japan is one of the most egalitarian of the world 's rich societies , yet it now has one of the largest shares of “ working poor ” — people who have jobs but can barely make ends meet .
Wages have fallen by around 10 % ( in nominal terms ) over the past decade .
The demise of the salaryman brings all these issues into stark relief .
Though the term was coined in the 1920s to reflect the new managerial class that oversaw the country 's industrialisation and modernisation , it became an ideal only after the second world war .
Becoming a salaryman denoted success , enshrining solid middle - class status .
More importantly , it meant stability .
Employment was more or less guaranteed until retirement .
Wages were low at first but increased predictably until the pension arrived to see the salaryman through his silver years .
Training was provided .
Perks abounded .
The firm looked after the employee and his family .
In return , the salaryman devoted his life to the firm .
A university graduate did not choose a career ; he chose a company .
A night on the town
Today 's older salarymen are stoical about the changes .
They see that they are the last of their breed , but feel neither nostalgia for their past nor frustration at the younger generation 's rejection of their ways .
In private moments , indeed , the old guard question the sacrifices that led them to put work ahead of family and conformity ahead of their own interests .
In a survey by a global consumer - products company , many salarymen expressed frustration at how their lives had turned out .
One night in Shimbashi , a grey , worn district of Tokyo near a big train station that feeds salarymen to the suburbs , three men in their mid-50s are huddled around their sakes and cigarettes at an outdoor bar .
Akira , Sho and Hiroyuki ( “ Harry ” ) joined their firm around 30 years ago .
Each wears a pin of the conglomerate 's logo on his lapel .
They reminisce about their lives as salarymen and the changes that have taken place , recounting their experiences ever more richly as the sake flows .
When Akira got married , he recalls , he invited his bucho , or division chief , to the wedding , as all salarymen did .
And during the reception the boss made a speech to the bride , as he always did .
“ Your new husband is a very good worker , ” he began .
“ He is important to the company .
So please understand that he may need to work many long hours . ”
All the guests nodded silently .
“ And when he is at home , please take care of him . ”
Akira says that his bride — the marriage was largely arranged by their families — was not upset by the bucho's remarks : her role of housewife was taken for granted .
“ But later she thought something must be wrong with the system , ” he confides .
Akira would return home in the small hours stumbling drunk ; dutifully she would wait up , angered .
The dinner is put away and the bath is cold , she might say .
As he grew older , he no longer stayed out so late .
But he did not share her reservations about his evening activities .
“ In Japan entertaining clients is a part of the job , ” he explains .
A salaryman arrives in the office at 9 am and ends his working day late , often around midnight .
He does not dare leave the office before his supervisor — and managers stay late to show their loyalty .
Is any work going on ?
Rarely .
But long hours remain the norm .
A few times a week , at around midnight , the boss may assemble the team and go out on the town .
Then the “ working ” day does not end until around 2 am , in a bar ; the journey home takes another hour or two .
Drinking deep into the night was long considered part of the job ; companies set aside a budget for it .
But the funds were slashed during the “ lost decade ” and have not been replenished .
Now employees bear the cost themselves .
Late - night carousing is becoming less common these days : younger colleagues treat the hours after work as their own , not the company 's .
Nobu , an ambitious 31 - year - old salaryman , is one such .
He chose a job at an American company in part so that he could work reasonable hours .
He did n't count on having a manager of the old school , who kept the team in the office or in the bars .
“ My first year , I did n't get more than three or four hours of sleep a day , ” he says .
Changing jobs was not an option .
“ I did n't want to quit — because it was so tough , ” he says .
“ Then I would have ' lost ' . ”
When he got a new manager , Nobu was able to relish his free time .
The constant sleep deprivation results in a peculiar characteristic of Japanese life : sleeping in public , be it on a train or in a meeting , and its social acceptance .
Nightly drinking leads to a special camaraderie , salarymen argue .
This translates into better company performance , they say , because it is easier to reach a consensus — the way almost all decisions are made in Japanese companies .
Yet the rough living and working takes its toll .
There is even a term , karoshi , or “ death by overwork ” , which has been legally recognised since the 1980s ( although most victims have been industrial workers rather than salarymen ) .
Cases of mental illness in the workplace are soaring .
The country 's suicide rate is among the highest in the world .
Older salarymen can appreciate the younger generation 's preference for more humane hours .
The government is even pushing the idea of “ work - life balance ” ( it uses the English term ) .
“ The times have changed , ” says Harry .
“ Shoganai , ” concludes Sho , meaning “ it ca n't be helped . ”
Capitalism with a human face
Much is made in the West of the distinctive features of Japanese capitalism .
First , cross - shareholdings protect companies from unwanted takeovers .
Yet since 1990 the proportion of all company shares owned by business partners has fallen from around half to around a quarter .
Second , a “ lifetime commitment ” between company and worker — usually simplified to “ lifetime employment ” , although it is much more than that — means that employees have more stability in their careers .
This too has ebbed as the number of “ regular ” workers , who enjoy company benefits , has declined and the number of temporary and part - time employees has increased ( see chart 1 ) .
Less understood is the seniority - wage system , a third pillar of Japanese business .
Salaries are based on length of service rather than performance .
Employees are paid very little for most of their careers .
Moreover , there is little difference between the salaries of the highest - and lowest - paid staff of the same age : generally around 25 % .
( An old joke among salarymen is that Japan is the only country where socialism worked . )
From around 50 until the mandatory retirement age of 60 ( now rising to 65 ) , salaries grow quickly .
At retirement a bonus of around three times the final annual salary is paid in a lump sum .
And a steady pension kicks in — it comes partly from the state , partly from the company .
As a means of fostering solidarity in the workplace and an egalitarian society , this system is eminently practical .
Yet from the perspective of individual incentives , responsibility and performance , it is inefficient and unfair ; exceptional work is unrewarded , other than by a modest bonus and a bow .
The rationale for the system is that it matches a salaryman 's income to his household 's expenses .
So when the fellow is in his 30s , the family does not require much .
When he reaches 50 and the kids leave for university , his salary is commensurate with his increased bills .
And when he retires , he can count on being taken care of by the company .
Like so many things , however , the system is starting to fray .
Some companies have introduced a bifurcated structure that grafts performance - based pay onto the traditional seniority system .
Other forms of employee care are also on the wane .
University is largely a recreational interlude between the intense “ cram - schools ” needed to get on a degree course and the drudgery of office work to come ; it is not a time for gaining professional skills .
So on the first day at work , employees are often ushered into a classroom that creates a Mitsubishi man , a Matsushita man , and so forth .
( Among the courses is “ business etiquette ” , in which new hires learn how to exchange business cards following strict protocol and practise their bows . )
But as baby - boomers retire and temporary workers replace the full - time veterans , training is drying up .
For years , the three salarymen in Shimbashi placed their savings in the company 's bank , which paid interest at twice the rate of an ordinary bank .
The activity , a relic of the early 20th century , allowed the company to raise capital without turning to a bank by becoming a bank itself .
But the practice was discontinued around 2000 when regulators feared that if these large companies were to fail , not only the employees ' jobs and pensions , but also their savings , would be wiped out .
In addition the company provides housing .
Of the three salarymen in Shimbashi , two live in company apartments on which the rent is subsidised , so they pay only around one - third of the market rate .
Moreover , salarymen take their holidays at company - owned resorts , which cost half the normal price .
These perks help explain the sprawl that is one of the curiosities of Japanese companies .
A big firm may have more than 1,000 subsidiaries , from restaurants to property , partly to secure an in - house supply of a wide range of benefits to employees .
( Such units also make good places to park mediocre managers for a few years before retirement . )
How much holiday ?
Though the companies may own numerous onsen , or hot - spring resorts , dotted across the country , the amount of holiday is becoming a sore point with employees .
Most salarymen take only a small fraction of their annual paid holiday , since to use it all seems to raise a question over the employee 's devotion to the firm .
For example , Sho says that he has 20 days ' holiday a year .
But when pressed , he admits that he takes only five .
He says he does not feel badly , since it is only right to work a lot — but his robotic response and body language signal his reservations .
The consequences of breaking the unwritten code can be severe .
Even a star performer who uses the full holiday may be denied pay rises and promotions .
Leaving the company is treated as betrayal .
All trace of the person is airbrushed from the workplace .
Social norms keep people at their desks : older Japanese sniff about “ job - hopping ” .
And the seniority - wage system means that switching jobs can be expensive .
Until recently , pension contributions were company - based ; portable individual - retirement accounts did not exist .
And firms were not really equipped to absorb mid-career executives , preferring to hire them fresh out of university and keep them until retirement .
Leaving a company meant unwinding a dense web of relationships .
Even so , much of this is changing , as younger salarymen push back .
Preferring to delineate company time and personal time , more are taking their holidays .
New employees are switching jobs too ( see chart 2 ) .
Nobu , for instance , says that when he graduated , half his classmates joined leading Japanese companies ( the others chose smaller firms or Western ones ) .
But only around half are still in those traditional salaryman jobs .
In 1960 , he reckons , 90 % of the class would have gunned for the top jobs .
Almost all of them would have stayed with the same firm until retirement .
The structure of work , with its perks and paternalism , has had the effect of locking people into place .
It creates a static environment for labour rather than a fluid one .
Why ?
It is an important question : business efficiency is about the optimal allocation of resources , and a sclerotic labour market hampers companies ' performance and restricts workers ' choices .
Like many things in Japan , the answer goes back a long way .
An official at the Ministry of Labour traces it to the Edo period , beginning in the 17th century .
Important trading houses , some of which still exist , were founded then .
They considered employees as family .
But economic historians place a more recent date on the static workforce .
When Japan modernised at the end of the 19th century , it needed to import technology from abroad .
This new technology created a need for skilled labour in a then highly itinerant workforce .
So companies got into the habit of housing and training their employees .
And the investment in training meant that companies did everything they could to keep their workers .
This paternal relationship was frozen in place during the second world war , when the Japanese government leaned on companies to lock in employees as a way to guarantee production .
After the war the Americans gave Japanese workers the right to unionise .
This reinforced the illiquidity .
Unions prized job security and supported a pay structure based on age , not merit .

Images of days gone by
Today the legacy is clear .
The salarymen in Shimbashi recall enormous sacrifices as well as bountiful benefits .
Both are waning .
The salaryman system has buckled under the strains on the Japanese economy .
Yet its decline is in turn adding to those strains .
As the population ages and falls , by 2030 just two workers will have to support every pensioner .
But temporary and part - time employees are paid around 40 % less than regulars .
Half of them make no pension contributions , placing a burden on the system today and creating a huge fiscal time - bomb .
Japan is changing , but slowly .
On a commuter train outside Nagoya , in the centre of the country , five high - school girls giggle at a barrage of questions about their lives .
Chihiro , who wants to be a hairdresser when she grows up , says her father usually returns home around midnight .
Her mother disapproves , to no effect .
He works , by chance , for the same conglomerate as the men in Shimbashi .
Chihiro , asked if she also wants him home earlier , replies “ shoganai ” , echoing the salarymen .
But when she grows up and gets married , will she let her husband do the same ?
Chihiro and her friends shriek : “ No way ! ”
Nobu , the young salaryman , likes his job but plans to start his own business one day .
The older men in his office struck compromises that he is not prepared to endure .
“ After 1945 , we were left with nothing , so we had to work together , with the same goal and as one team .
We were a success , and Japan grew , ” he says .
“ But this organisation does n't work any more .
It has stayed the same for too long .
The system has rusted . ”
Looking back at 2007
2007 was the year of the video game .
All three consoles were on store shelves by the first of the year , and each console had a run of incredible titles .
People bought systems and software at almost alarming rates ; 2007 put 2006 soundly to bed in terms of retail sales .
There are no such thing as " next - gen " consoles anymore , as we 're firmly into the world of the Wii , Xbox 360 , and PlayStation 3 .
And , of course , the PC has n't gone anywhere .
Unfortunately , 2007 was also a year of growing pains for gaming as a business and an art .
There were important questions raised about the business of reviewing games .
The ratings system came under attack again , and once more Rockstar seemed to be in hot water over pushing the boundaries of what could be considered appropriate content for games .
One popular and critically - praised title showed war in a disturbing , unblinking way .
The PlayStation 3 had issues moving hardware , even though its platform was home to some of the best exclusives of the year .
2007 felt like an important year .
More people than ever picked up the gaming hobby , there was a massive pile of great games to choose from , and our consoles slowly became one of the most important ( if not the central ) component in our home theater systems .
We 're going to take a look back at some of the things we loved about this year , and some of the things we hated .
Then it 's time to crown our 2007 game of the year .
It was a hard choice , but in good years it always is .
The question Carminati has is , since illegal immigrants can not get refunds for the social security or Medicare taxes they pay , where is that money going ?
The two illegal immigrants pay their taxes with Tax ID numbers instead of social security numbers and get them prepared at Carminati Tax on lower Broadway , where Charles Carminati said about 70 percent of his more than 1,000 clients pay their taxes despite being in the country illegally .
One is from Egypt , the other Brazil .
Neither has the proper documentation to be in the country but both , like millions of Americans , will be filing their income taxes with the IRS in the next few weeks .
“ You always hear , ' Oh those illegals do n't pay their taxes . '
That 's bull , a lot of undocumented immigrants pay their taxes like everybody else except they wo n't have access to some of the benefits they are paying for like retirement . ”
In 2006 1.4 million people used Tax ID numbers when filing taxes , Carminati said most of those people are undocumented immigrants making between $ 8,000 and $ 12,000 a year .
They pay their taxes , he said , out of a hope that a comprehensive immigration reform bill will one day pass Congress and give citizenship priority to undocumented immigrants who have been filing tax returns .
Also , he said , they do it out of a sense of honesty .
“ They know it is something they have to do so they do it the same as anyone else would , ” he said .
The Egyptian man , whose taxes Carminati prepares , will receive about half of what he would if he and his family had their documents in order .
And Carminati wants to know where that leftover money is going .
Undocumented immigrants are not eligible to receive refunds for the social security or Medicare taxes they pay because they do not have valid social security numbers so that money often ends up , according to Carminati , “ lost in space . ”
The Social Security Administration estimates that undocumented immigrants pay approximately $ 8 billion each year in payroll taxes they will never be able to claim .
As of 2005 , the administration 's file containing paid - in taxes that cannot be matched to a social security number , was at $ 519 billion .
Carminati said that money should go to addressing the upcoming social security crisis .
“ It 's unclear where it is now , ” he said .
“ Nobody is stealing it , it is just kind of being lost in space .
It should be going to social security or Medicare like it is intended not moved around in any way . ”
As the immigration debate continues to rage , those at the center of it - the immigrants themselves - are taking part in at least one American tradition : paying taxes and wondering where all that money goes .
Standing outside Carminati
Tax , a man who would identify himself only as Javier said he is an undocumented immigrant who has paid his taxes every year he has been in the country .
“ I pay because I still have hope , ” he said .

UPDATE : Two Google officials , Matt Cutts , a top search engineer , and Peter Fleischer , Google ’s global privacy counsel , wrote comments below reacting to this post .
I wrote some thoughts responding to their comments in another post here .
Google has responded to European regulators who have suggested that Internet Protocol addresses of users be considered personally identifiable information .
Not surprisingly , it disagrees .
The issue matters because the standards for what companies do with data that can be traced back to an individual are subject to tighter rules than other information they use — as they should be .
Google records the I.P. address associated with every search it handles .
In a post on the Google Public Policy Blog , Alma Whitten , a software engineer , points out that often the I.P. address assigned to any one computer is changed on a regular basis by the Internet provider that services that computer .
Google , she writes , strongly supports “ the idea that data protection laws should apply to any data that could identify you .
The reality is though that in most cases , an I.P. address without additional information cannot . ”
True enough .
But it ’s also true that if someone has your I.P. address , it makes it much easier to gather the additional information needed to identify you .
Think of an I.P. address as one of two keys needed to unlock a door .
Just because the second key is needed too , does n’t mean the first key should n’t also be protected .
In the case of dynamic I.P. addresses — those that are periodically changed — the other key is held by the Internet providers themselves .
And they are routinely forced to provide information about which customer was assigned what I.P. address at a given time in response to legal proceedings .
Technically , fixed I.P. addresses — those that are permanently assigned to a given computer — are also not personal information , because a Web site does n’t know who is using that computer .
But once the site , or a partner , convinces a user at that site to reveal his or her identity — to register for a service , make a purchase , or even enter a sweepstakes — that information can be associated with everything else the users of that computer do .
Yes , there may be more than one person who uses a computer , just as there is often more than one person who uses a home telephone .
Few people would say that this means phone numbers are n’t personal
Google is right to say that an I.P. address is n’t exactly the same thing as your Social Security number .
But its blog post also skips over all the ways that having your I.P address can help someone unlock information about what you do online .
And doing so does n’t help the debate over what the right protections for personal information should be .
A prominent member of the national Democratic Party has circulated a sharp e-mail saying the removal of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle was disloyal to Hispanics and should give “ pause ” to superdelegates and voters .
The e-mail from , Steven Ybarra , a California superdelegate who heads the voting - rights committee of the DNC Hispanic Caucus , was sent to fellow caucus members in the hours after word broke that Solis Doyle – the most prominent Latina in Clinton ’s campaign – would be replaced by another close Clinton loyalist , Maggie Williams , who is black .
The e-mail noted that Clinton , who is looking to Latino voters for a boost in the Texas and Ohio primaries on March 4 , scored heavily with Hispanics in her California win .
“ Apparently , loyalty is not a two - way street , ” he wrote .
“ Latino superdelegates like myself . . . will have cause to pause . ”
Ybarra told The Post yesterday that the loss of Solis Doyle , a child of Mexican immigrants , just weeks before the Texas primary , where 36 percent of the population is Hispanic , was “ dumb as a stump . ”
Contacted for comment , the typically press - shy Solis Doyle told The Post that Ybarra was writing on “ false information , ” and confirmed she ’s staying on as an adviser .
Team Clinton insisted that the decision to switch from Solis Doyle to Williams , revealed on Sunday afternoon , was amiable .

I might be dumb , but why would you need to wait for 10 pm to " start " counting the votes that were cast in the morning .
In Taiwan all the votes are hand counted , and they have about a 60 - 70 % turnout , and a final count is done within 6 hours and reported about 10 pm ( polls close earlier since they actually have elections on days people do not work - crazy ) .
Taking too long to count can lead to mischief , especially counts taking place in early morning hours when supervision might be lax .
I mean , if 100,000 votes are cast over a 10 hr period , thats 10,000 votes per hour on average .
One person can count and recount 360 votes per hour .
Meaning you need 30 people to count the votes of 100,000 people in 10 hrs ( 10,000 per hr , just as fast as the unknown number of optical scanners - I assume more than 1 ? ) .
If they start counting from 10 AM they can finish by 10 pm with lunch and dinner and bathroom breaks included .
If 10 million people vote in CA , you just need 3000 counters , this number seems not excessive and even low ( 1 counter per 3000 voters ) .
I know this is simplified , but I think they can do a better job in getting the votes counted .
6 AM is not acceptable .
But then maybe we really have become just another Banana Republic .
We can not even count votes in a timely fashion .
No wonder the jobs have moved overseas .

Have no fear , the LA " Times they are a changin " reality .
The LA Times declared EI activists the victors in the movement .
But :
All things election are in tatters , machines rule the election world , electioneers throw a tantrum if humans have to count the ballots to check up on the machines , major races have been stolen in quite recent memory , and the LA Times calls that victory ?
Perhaps they should set their sights a bit higher ?
This Amurcon election fiasco has been going on for forty years , the government has known about it all along , and one person " certifies " the machines .
Currently we do n't know about the actual results , so as social medicinal pablum we have faith in the results .
The election scene is religious in nature based on faith , not scientific and therefore based on actual hand counts of ballots kept pure with a solid chain of custody .
The LA Times must have been sarcastic ?

ewastud : Althougth the voting industry has more apparent ties to the Republican party , election integrity is really a non-partisan issue .
( Both Democrats and Republicans are often eager to game the structure , and there are pro-integrity Republicans like Gov. Gregory in Florida . )
Honestly , it 's rather silly to have this whole ' Wednesday Morning ' thing when AFAIK election results typically take longer than that to be certified anyway , and the news media is all to willing to use exit polling to call states before the polls close .
There is plenty of time .

All paper ballots , hand counted .
It is doable sooner if " they " WANT it to be ... but those in favour of DRE 's may not want you to see it that way , just as they made it look like hanging chads were the problem in Florida in 2000 so " they " could promote DRE's .

PFT # 1 : We wait until after the polls close until we start counting the day 's votes .
Logistically and security - wise , this makes sense .
I can see all kinds of problems with running ballots from precints to county elections offices throughout the day .
I have no problem with waiting a bit longer to find out elections results .
As a matter of fact , I would prefer to wait A LOT longer , rather than to allow speed to trump accuracy .
I 'm with Brad on this one .
Waiting for elections results is simply not a problem .
Some MSM news sources are presenting it as one .
I suppose it gets people riled up , buying more newspapers , staying tuned in longer , WHAT EVER ...
Look at the good side .
This allows more opportunity to fill in advertising spaces , which means more money flowing around in our economy .
As a parallel point , look where insisting on going to war immediately in Iraq in order to save our asses from some WMD bogeyman got us !
Stop , think , consider , discuss .
Elections are not triage events , in which rapid deployment of resources is required in order to get the job done .
Elections should be more like a planned operation , with successful results being the goal , not situations based on " who can get the votes counted and out into the press the fastest . "
That 's just my two bits .

One problem here is that renegades in the California election system , headed by SoS Debra Bowen , are stabbing her in the back after the fact .
She gave them all ample time for input during her intensive study which found the system to be in dire straights .
They did not participate in a convincing way , waiting instead to whine and throw ill advised temper tantrums after the decision had been made to beef up the system .
I strongly suspect that they collaborated with those in diebold , ES&S , and other vendors in a clandestine operation conspiring against the one they should have been faithful to , their own SoS and the people of their own state .

Brad -
Here 's what really happens when counting is done by hand : mass satisfaction , not mayhem .
I recently witnessed the vote counting in the Potrero recall election , in which all planners who voted for Blackwater were recalled .
The count was done entirely by hand .
Candidates on both sides were present , along with media and representatives of citizens ’ watchdog and election integrity groups .
One activist was allowed to videotape the proceeding , standing a couple of feet behind the ballot counters with the camera actually zoomed in on each ballot — a first in San Diego history .
( Remember , this is the city where our former registrar , Mikel Haas , actually had a Black Box Voting advocate ARRESTED for daring to try and observe the vote count in a mayoral race . )
The special election was a vote - by - mail election , with the exception of a ballot box left on election day at the general store – a concession to fire victims whose ballots were delayed arriving due to the Harris wildfire . )
Opponents of Blackwater were diligent in getting out their supporters and even checking with the ROV days before the election to see whose ballots had been returned as undeliverable , then making efforts to track down as many of those voters as possible .
ROV staff was cooperative in this effort .
Granted , this was a small town with only a few hundred voters .
But when results showed that the pro-Blackwater planners had been recalled by a 2 to 1 margin with 60 % turnout , nobody questioned the results – not even those ousted from their positions .
It took until midnight to tally most of the ballots by hand .
A final ballot box ( which arrived escorted by armed Sheriff ’s deputies and ROV employees ) containing the last 8 ballots was not unsealed until morning , nor was a final reconciliation done until then on the rest .
So what happened ?
There was no rioting .
No panic .
The recalled planners began yawning around 10 pm and ultimately left before results were known .
The newly elected planning board chair remained and gave a press conference before the official projection was made , as the projection did n’t come early enough for the evening news or the late night news .
The media hordes left and went to bed , too .
The public did n’t storm the gates of the ROV , and residents in the sleepy hamlet of Potrero were content to await results until the next day .
Come morning , peace reigned .
Residents of Potrero and election activists praised the Registrar for allowing hand - counting of the votes and in general , people felt confident of the outcome .
There were no challenges to the outcome filed with the ROV .
No lawsuits .
No angry mobs , and the majority of voters were pleased to learn the outcome .
That said , there were procedures that election reform activists hope to see corrected for future elections , such as making sure mailed in ballots are not opened or removed from envelopes until witnesses are present , and to have witnesses observe chain of custody from the time ballots arrive in the mail .
Despite concerns about new ROV Debra Seiler , a former Diebold sales representative , in the Potrero election done entirely without any voting machines or electronic counting equipment whatsoever , democracy prevailed .
The Presidential Primary in California will unfortunately include a lot of votes still counted on electronic voting machines .
Too bad counting wo n’t be done by hand statewide in front of witnesses on all sides , starting with hand - counting at each polling place .
I am confident that the vast majority of voters would far rather see their votes counted accurately than fast .

Say , this is not even the whole mess .
Besides numerous other irregularities that will gum up the works , there will be a whole bunch of libertarians who want to vote for republican Ron Paul .
As a disaffected republican turned libertarian who thinks there may be hope in Ron Paul , I tried to switch my party online last December .
A few days before the deadline I still had not received my sample ballot to confirm the change of party .
Went to the Post Office to get the postcard to change my party three days before the deadline to do so .
Still have yet to receive my sample ballot .
Having been a pollworker during the 2004 nightmare presidential elections , I know I can still vote " provisionally " .
But the running joke among the pollworkers is that those votes are not counted unless there is a tie .
Takes time to confirm the legitimacy of a provisional voter .
It 's only a token courtesy to allow everyone to vote who wants to vote .
If people have been shuffled around at the last minute , they should make sure the polling official checks all sections of the roster .

InstantRunoffVoting # 50 Most exquisite point !
Without chain of custody ( of the real and valid kind ) nothing , not even paper ballots , will bring true elections .
Black box voting is all over that aspect of electioneering .
I do know Bowen issued a missive that condemned the practices of san diego county , which was allowing " sleep overs " , i.e. breaking the chain of custody of the machines themselves by letting them " out of sight and out of mind " prior to an election .
In other words , the " chain of custody " is just another way of saying everything is accounted for that could have an effect on the outcome .
Ballots must be kept under lock and key , and so must any " memory cards " or other electronic things that can be tampered with .
And they must be kept from remote access as a proper part of chain of custody .
The practices currently are so shamefully inadequate it boggles the mind .
California is tackling it from the SoS down , but there are many pockets of resistance within the California system .
After all , ex-vendor officials and operatives for some reason end up working as election officials all too often - once they " leave " a vendor 's employ ( but not the vendor 's influence ) .

Are you aware that the voting system used in Sonoma County , the " Mark a Vote " system , has never been federally certified nor was it included in Debra Bowen 's top to bottom review ?
Go to her website and you will see DFM's Mark a Vote was certified for use in CA " before January 1 , 2005 . "
In Mark a Vote 's case , it was WAY before January 1 , 2005 .
http://www.sos.ca.gov/el...s/vs_certified_jan07.pdf
CA 's elections may be in good hands now , but it is a mystery why Bowen declined to review the Mark a Vote system and still allows it to be used without either federal certification or her review .

Linda , # 57 This issue of Mark a Vote arose in the lawsuit filed by the County of San Diego against Debra Bowen concerning " Post Election Manual Tally " ( PEMT ) requirements , reported by Brad in early January .
( He provided a link to the complaint https://bradblog.com/Doc...mplaint_Bowen_121807.pdf
In a document entitled , " San Diego County 's Reply Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Request for Declaratory Relief and Petition for Writ of Mandate , " page 4 , footnote 4 , it says , " Remarkably , the Mark a Vote system has never received federal qualification , was not part of the SOS 's top - to - bottom review and does not comply with the Federal Help America Vote Act's ( " HAVA " ) accessibility component . " ... "
The SOS 's website identifies Sonoma , Madera , and Lake as the only counties that use the Mark A Vote system . " ( http:www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting_systems/systemsinuse_110606.pdf)
" Sonoma , Madera and Lake each also use the Hart InterCivic system and are subject to the 10 % PEMT requirements so it is unclear why these three counties would not also be subject to the same requirements as every other county that uses the Hart InterCivic system . "

Confabulator # 59 , yes I am aware of what you wrote .
The machines we are using are being presented as units for disabled voters to use if they choose to do so .
By law , all federal elections must have disabled access machines available , so every precinct in our county has one .
For the record , this will be the third election in which we have used these machines .
The first time , only one voter used either of the two machines available for the two precincts at my polling place , and that was only because the pollworkers begged a voter to use it right before closing , so they could at least try it out .
The second time , not a single voter voted on either of the two machines available for the two precincts at my polling place .
There is a good likelihood these two machines will not be used at all on Tuesday .
IMHO , Bowen is probably not prioritizing our county as being one that requires immediate attention .
All I was saying is that things have really changed since we threw out McPherson in June 2006 , thanks in part to Brad 's efforts here at his site .
Thank - you , Brad !

Linda # 61 , I apologize for being unclear .
Yes , each precinct in Sonoma County will have two voting machines .
One , to comply with HAVA requirements for disabled voters , is the Hart InterCivic system .
That system has been federally certified and was reviewed in Debra Bowen 's top - to - bottom review .
The system that everyone else uses , the Mark A Vote system , never received federal certification and was not a part of Bowen 's top - to - bottom review .
Yes , things have changed .
And good for you for working at the polls !
I do , and I wish more would .
Keep up the good work .

Confabulator # 61 , I 'm confused .
Each precinct in Sonoma County has one electronic voting machine , which they refer to as a DAU ( disabled access unit . )
What is the second voting machine you are referring to ?

Linda # 63 , You are correct .
There will be one electronic voting machine in each precinct for the disabled .
Everyone else will fill out an optical scan ballot .
After the polls close , those optical scan ballots will be taken to the registrar 's office to be counted on a Central Count Optical Scan system called " Mark A Vote " , marketed by DFM Associates .
This " Central Count Optical Scan " system , which will count almost all of Sonoma County 's ballots , has not been federally certified nor was it included in Deborah Bowen 's top - to - bottom review .
Other " Central Count Optical Scan " systems used in other counties , such as those of Diebold and ES&S , have received federal certification and were reviewed in Bowen 's top - to - bottom review .
She found flaws in those systems , decertified them , and then , after changes were made , conditionally recertified them to be used in the up coming primary election .
Because Mark A
Vote not been federally certified nor reviewed in the top - to - bottom review , there is no way to know if the system has flaws such as those found in virtually every system reviewed by Bowen .

Thanks for the clarification , Confabulator .
I 'm going to restate that I think Bowen has probably prioritized trouble spots throughout the state , and has determined that Sonoma County is low on the list .
If true , this would explain why she has n't addressed the certification problem here .
Also , I suspect that we may have a system in place to check for problems .
This is really quite a well - run county with elections over all .
The biggest problem we have is that not enough people are volunteering to work the polls .
I encourage anyone who 's reading this to consider doing this as your community service obligation .
It 's really not so bad .
It 's a long day , but you make friends and , if you like people , you definitely get your " people - fix . "
Unpleasant encounters are rare .
Most voters are really appreciative of you taking off a day in your life to do this job .
I 'm goingto write a letter to the PressDemocrat for possible printing asking why our counting machines are not certified .

Do you use carpets in your home ?
Want to see how carpets looked in Soviet homes ?
Here they are , right from the Soviet Museum :
This is Lenin .
The most popular hero of Soviet propaganda carpets .
Here he comes again .
And even again !
The slogan on this carpet is : “ Lenin is dead but his business lives ! ”
This Lenin lacks some details but it ’s definetely Lenin again .
And again Lenin is in the middle and different happy workers of Soviet Russia surround him .
That is Fidel from Cuba .
He was a big friend of Soviet people .
This is Yuri Gagarin , the first Russian spaceman , as it has been said , the first man that flew to space .
This is Budenniy , Russia military leader from the dawn of Soviet state , back to 1917 .
This guy is Trotsky , he was also in the Revolution but after he quarelled with Stalin and ran to London where he was killed by KGB agent with a hammer .
Last week , the UK health secretary declared that we are in a grip of an obesity epidemic , but does the evidence stack up ?
Researchers debate the issue in the British Medical Journal .
Claims about an obesity epidemic often exceed the scientific evidence and mistakenly suggest an unjustified degree of certainty , argue Patrick Basham and John Luik .
For example , the average population weight gain in the United States in the past 42 years is 10.9 kg or 0.26 kg a year .
Yet , between 1999 - 2000 and 2001 - 2002 , there were no significant changes in the prevalence of overweight or obesity among US adults or in the prevalence of overweight among children .
Furthermore , they say , the categories of normal , overweight , and obese is entirely arbitrary and at odds with the underlying evidence about the association between body mass index and mortality .
For example , the study on which the bands for overweight and obesity in the US are based found that the death risks for men with a body mass index of 19 - 21 were the same as those for men who were overweight and obese ( 29 - 31 ) .
Other studies have shown negligible differences between body mass index and death rates .
The association of overweight and obesity with higher risks of disease is equally unclear , they write .
And , despite supposedly abnormal levels of overweight and obesity , life expectancy continues to increase .
They suggest that some public health professionals may have deliberately exaggerated the risks of overweight and obesity , and our capacity to prevent or treat them on a population wide basis , in the interests of health .
They warn that this has unwelcome implications for science policy and for evidence based medicine .
But Robert Jeffery and Nancy Sherwood argue that a large body of scientific evidence shows that obesity is a major global health problem .
In the US , the prevalence of obesity in 1976 - 80 was 6.5 % among 6 - 11 year olds and 5 % among 12 - 17 year olds .
In 2003 - 4 it was 19 % and 17 % respectively .
Europe can also expect to see the numbers of overweight and obese children rising by around 1.3 million a year by 2010 .
The risks of obesity on many serious health conditions including high blood pressure , diabetes , heart disease and some forms of cancer , are also serious and well established , they write .
Most health economists and epidemiologists agree that the contribution of obesity to current healthcare costs is high and that it is likely to get much higher .
Some have argued that we may even see real falls in life expectancy within a few decades , they add .
In summary , a large body of evidence documents that over - nutrition and obesity are a major global health problem , say the authors .
With the continuing rise in obesity and limited treatment efficacy , options for averting a poor public health outcome seem to rest either on the hope that scientists are wrong in their projections or speedy investment in the development of more effective public health measures to deal with it .
They think the second option a more prudent scientific and policy choice .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Nearly 70 percent of Americans believe traditional journalism is out of touch , and nearly half are turning to the Internet to get their news , according to a new survey .
While most people think journalism is important to the quality of life , 64 percent are dissatisfied with the quality of journalism in their communities , a We Media / Zogby Interactive online poll showed .
“ That ’s a really encouraging reflection of people who care A ) about journalism and B ) understand that it makes a difference to their lives , ” said Andrew Nachison , of iFOCOS , a Virginia - based think tank which organized a forum in Miami where the findings were presented .
Nearly half of the 1,979 people who responded to the survey said their primary source of news and information is the Internet , up from 40 percent just a year ago .
Less than one third use television to get their news , while 11 percent turn to radio and 10 percent to newspapers .
More than half of those who grew up with the Internet , those 18 to 29 , get most of their news and information online , compared to 35 percent of people 65 and older .
Older adults are the only group that favors a primary news source other than the Internet , with 38 percent selecting television .
Howard Finberg , of the Poynter Institute in St. Petersburg , Florida , said the public often does n’t understand that the sources they are accessing online such as Google News and Yahoo News pull stories from newspapers , television , wire services and other media sources .
“ It ’s delivered in a non-traditional form , that does n’t necessarily mean there is n’t traditional journalism underneath it , ” he explained .
But Finberg said the study does support the belief among many large media companies that focusing on local issues is important to their journalistic and economic survival .

Denver Democrats have a problem : 172 of the delegates and alternates they elected at Super Tuesday caucuses appear to be ineligible .
Some showed up at the wrong precinct .
Most of them were n’t even registered Democrats .
“ A couple people were Republicans .
A couple people were Green Party , ” said Jennifer Coken , who chairs the Democratic Party of Denver .
“ It ’s been kind of nerve - racking for us . ”
Republicans getting elected as Democratic delegates is just part of the confusion that accompanied an overwhelming turnout at precincts throughout Colorado .
Two weeks after the vote , state party chair Pat Waak cannot say exactly how many eligible Democrats took part in the record - breaking caucuses .
Only one - third of the counties have turned in audited totals .
Others are still scrambling to separate eligible from ineligible voters before Democratic delegates begin meeting in county conventions , the next step toward the selection of Colorado delegates to the 2008 presidential convention in Denver .
The problem showed up — though in smaller numbers — in counties across Colorado .
“ We had a few , but our number was more like 20 , ” said Boulder County chair Deborah Gardner .
About half of those had not lived in the precinct long enough , “ and about half were non-Democrats . ”
El Paso County party chairman John Morris said the party had to toss about 25 delegates and alternates who were in the wrong precinct , registered as unaffiliated voters or not registered at all .
In most cases , “ people were excited and wanted to get involved and just showed up , ” he said .
Waak and other party officials emphasized that on a percentage basis , the number of ineligible caucus voters appears to be minuscule and should not affect the ultimate number of Colorado delegates snared by Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton at the convention .
Obama overwhelmingly won the state with 66 percent of the vote to Clinton ’s 32 percent .
Waak said that roughly 120,000 people , a record , showed up for Democratic caucuses , and she expects the number of ineligible participants to be less than a thousand .
On the bright side , Democrats can be pleased “ that people are so interested that they would lie about their party affiliation , ” Waak said .
Party officials also say many ineligible voters made an honest mistake .
“ Most of these people were unaffiliated voters , and some of them did n’t know that , ” said Jennifer Jacobson , director of operations for Denver Democrats .
“ They said they voted for Democrats their whole lives .
They did n’t know they had n’t affiliated with a party . ”
In Iowa and Nevada , Democrats can register on caucus day .
In Colorado , a “ closed caucus ” state , law requires participants to register with a party by Dec. 5 , 2007 , and live in their precinct for a month .
At the county level , tabulating Colorado caucus votes is a time - consuming effort performed by party volunteers .
They take handwritten results from informal precinct gatherings in homes and school classrooms and enter them all into a computer file that identifies participants , delegates and alternates .
And while Colorado Republicans excluded people whose names did n’t appear on the list that came from the county clerk ’s office , Colorado Democrats offered an option that complicated the count .
Would - be participants could sign a statement swearing they were eligible , and the party would check later .
Colorado statutes state that “ any person who fraudulently participates and votes in a precinct caucus , assembly , or convention when he is not a member of the political party … is guilty of a misdemeanor . ”
Waak said she believes that law requires her to turn over the names of ineligible caucus voters to district attorney ’s offices for possible prosecution .
Republicans had an official state total of 70,229 participants the next day , party chairman Dick Wadhams said , but “ there were some cases where there were people who were not on the list who should have been . ”
Democrats had the opposite problem .
In Denver , the number of voters who showed up at Democratic caucuses jumped from 2,628 in 2004 to 26,096 on Super Tuesday .
They chose 3,032 delegates and 3,032 alternates to attend their county convention on March .
8 , Jacobson said .
But according to Denver Election Commission records , 119 of the delegates and alternates are not registered Democrats , she said , and 53 “ caucused in a location other than their precinct . ”
All 172 will be challenged , but they get an opportunity to prove the city records wrong at a Monday night meeting at Denver party headquarters .
To qualify , “ they have to bring in a certified copy of their voter registration , ” Jacobson said .
Because Denver concentrated its efforts on ineligible delegates , Jacobson expects it will be weeks before the local party can check the eligibility of all the others who signed affidavits and voted in the caucuses .
“ There were a lot , ” she said , “ maybe close to a thousand . ”

Erin Pizzey , the campaigner who pioneered treatment for abused women by setting up Britain 's first refuge centre for victims of domestic violence in the 1970s , is now turning her attention to another group of often overlooked victims : men .
Launching an online campaign and research project aimed at bringing the issue out in the open , Ms Pizzey is hoping to raise awareness of abuse perpetrated by women against men – a subject she describes as " one of the last taboos " .
She has put a questionnaire on the website femininezone.com that allows women to answer questions anonymously about how they treat men .
As many as one in six men are thought to suffer physical and mental abuse at the hands of women , yet the topic is widely seen as insignificant or implausible .

" I feel that this kind of violence is one of the last taboos – men are reluctant to talk about it , and so are the women who are doing it , " said Ms Pizzey , whose father was abused by her mother .
" Much is known and studied about male violence , but very little is written about women , and any attempt to discuss female violence is met with rabid attacks and howls of ' blaming the victim ' . "
During the 1970s , Ms Pizzey created safe havens for hundreds of abused women , but she found it increasingly frustrating that people could only see females as victims .
As she tried to create similar sanctuaries for men , she discovered that even those who had been generous towards her women 's centres would not consider giving funding .
" I imagined people who had given money to my women 's projects would also give it over for the men , but not one gave money , " she said .
" It 's shocking that across the world there are no facilities giving sanctuary for men , and no sympathy .
I think it 's a deeply held taboo that if a man is assaulted by a woman he is weak , but if a woman is assaulted by a man she is a victim .
It 's social conditioning . "
Samantha Wilson , a therapist working in London and Manchester who specialises in domestic abuse , says she often sees men who were injured by women .
" I 've been working with cases of violence for 20 years , and many of them have been women abusing men , " she said .
" This could be happening to people you know and you simply would n't realise . "
According to Ms Pizzey , the issue is greeted with scepticism by police and social services who , she says , often " refuse to believe " it .
She hopes that by discussing violent women in the open she may be able to bring about change .
Next month , she is travelling to Sacramento , California , to attend the first conference on domestic abuse to deal with men and women as perpetrators .

A man salvaged an immaculate Kenyan flag within the ashes of a burning house .
Â© Anne Holmes
Tuesday afternoon I was witness to a scene in Soweto Kibera , a slum of Nairobi , where an estimated 3,000 non-Kikuyus were asked to leave .
Many packed their belongings and left their homes to take shelter by St. Judes Church as houses burned around them .
Some Kikuyus came and burned some non-Kikuyu houses and these responded in kind by burning some Kikuyu houses .
All across the country we are seeing communities pushing unwanted tribes out .
In Nakuru the Luos and Kalengins pushed the Kikuyus out and burned their houses .
In Naivaisha the Kikuyus were pushing the Luos out , and now all along the way towards Nairobi , the Kikuyus are ordering all others to leave .
Where will they go and how will they start their lives again ?
Yesterday in the towns of Kefri and Kikuyu , just on the outskirts of Nairobi , Kikuyu mobs attacked non-Kikuyus and burned their houses as the latter took refuge in the Research Centers in Kefri .
Buses took countless families to the police station in Kikuyu for refuge but it is not known what will happen to them next .
When we arrived at the station , a truck full of police pulled up , firing a tear gas canister straight into the crowd of refugees who were sitting on the lawn with their children , injuring one man .
This was incomprehensible and a testament to how little the police are doing to help and how often they are against those suffering the most .
We were unable to get into the town centers because of security reasons and waited at the station to document the arrival of yet another bus full of refugees coming from Kefri .
Then a police convoy agreed to take us into the research center in Kefri .
When we arrived , there was a mob standing outside the gates .
We got out of the car and when we turned around , the police had vanished .
The mob came towards us .
I was working with a team of Luo journalists and some Kikuyus had come with us to act as a buffer .
The crowd grew very angry with us and we asked to be let into the Research Center for safety .
The man at the gate refused .
Our driver was identified as a Luo and the mob wanted to kill him and my colleagues as well .
We managed to jump in the car and drive away as the mob stoned our car .
It has become increasingly difficult for us to do our work , not to mention dangerous .
It ’s a strange phenomenon that is particular to the Kikuyu areas where the press has time after time been thrown out , threatened , and even attacked .
On a few rare occasions in the last week , some have been let in to document what is happening , others have risked being beaten or stoned just to get a few images .
The Luos and Kalengins have seemingly not cared when we document them burning Kikuyu houses , looting their stores and attacking them , but the Kikuyus do n’t want a bad image and perhaps prefer to be painted solely as victims .
In this story , all sides have suffered and as always , it ’s the women and children who bear the greatest brunt .
The dilemma now for us , the press , is this : if we ca n’t go in to these areas alone without security , and if the police is apt to simply abandon us in the middle of a blood - thirsty mob , there is virtually no way for us to truly document what is happening on the ground at the moment .
Earlier this month I was accused of biased reporting in the comments on this blog .
Now I will admit to it openly , but not by any fault of my own .
I simply ca n’t get the pictures .

It seems that with each passing week there are more stories raising the specter of George Bush turning Iraq and Afghanistan into a bloody trifecta by attacking Iran .
In mainstream daily papers we see pieces like one by Gannett 's John Yaukey , who wrote in early November that " confrontation could be near " because " Iran continues to taunt the United States with its aggressive posturing in Iraq and Lebanon while pushing ahead with its nuclear research ... "
We are also witnessing what appears to be a chilling rerun of the Iraq debacle .
Confronted with evidence that calls into question the status of Iran 's nuclear program , the Bush administration is shifting its rhetoric .
" The Bush administration has charged that Iran is funding anti-American fighters in Iraq and sending in sophisticated explosives to bleed the U.S. mission , although some of the administration 's charges are disputed by Iraqis as well as the Iranians , " the Los Angeles Times reported in October .
" Still , ... diplomatic and military officials say they fear that the overreaching of a confident Iran , combined with growing U.S. frustrations , could set off a dangerous collision . "
Look beyond daily papers — from Seymour Hersh 's reporting in The New Yorker to articles in The Nation — and the picture emerges of an administration that is determined to attack Iran .
John H. Richardson 's " The Secret History of the Impending War With Iran That the White House Does n't Want You to Know " in the November issue of Esquire magazine is particularly eye - opening .
Richardson , using two former high - ranking Middle East experts who worked for the White House as his primary sources , warns that the Bush administration is " headed straight for war with Iran " and that " it had been set on this course for years . "
" It was just like Iraq , when the White House was so eager for war it could n't wait for the UN inspectors to leave , " writes Richardson , who details the Bush administration 's success at scuttling diplomatic efforts — notably involving then - Secretary of State Colin Powell — to reach a peaceful accord with Iran .
" The steps have been many and steady and all in the same direction .
And now things are getting much worse .
We are getting closer and closer to the tripline . ... "
With all this in mind , we decided to talk with the man who literally wrote the book on Bush 's intentions .
Nearly a year ago , Scott Ritter 's Target Iran was published , and he 's been sounding the claxon of impending war ever since .
A former Marine Corps intelligence officer , Ritter served as chief United Nations weapons inspector in Iraq from 1991 to 1998 when he left as a pointed critic of the Clinton administration 's commitment to weapons inspection and its Iraq policy .
Before the United States ' 2003 invasion , Ritter loudly disputed the Bush administration 's claims regarding weapons of mass destruction under Saddam 's control and predicted that , instead of the quick and easy war being promised , Iraq would turn into a quagmire , though not necessarily of the type he envisioned .
His analyses have been embraced by both the right and the left at various points .
He portrays himself as the straight - shooting analyst unconcerned by who supports him or whom he offends .
To learn what he thinks the future holds for Iran , and the consequences of a U.S. invasion , we recently sat down for a 90 - minute phone interview with Ritter .
What follows is a condensed version of that conversation .
Metro Times : A year ago , when your book Target Iran came out , you were sounding the alarm about war being imminent .
Why do you think that attack has n't occurred ?
Scott Ritter : Let 's remember that this is an elective war , not a war of necessity .
A war of necessity would be fought at the point and time a conflict is required , if somebody is threatening to invade you , to attack , etc .
But an elective war is one where we choose to go to war .
It will be conducted on a timescale that 's beneficial to those who are planning the conflict .
As far as why it has n't happened , there 's any number of reasons .
One , the Bush administration has not been able to stabilize Iraq to the level they would like to see prior to expanding military operations in the region .
Two , the international community has not rallied around the cause of Iran 's nuclear program representing a casus belli to the extent that the Bush administration would like .
They were hopeful that there would be more action from the [ United Nations ] Security Council .
It took a long time to get the issue shifted from the International Atomic Energy Agency 's headquarters to the Security Council .
And even when it got shifted to the Security Council , the Council took very timid steps , not decisive steps .
The Bush administration sort of tied its hands at that point in time .
I think you are seeing increasing frustration today at the slow pace .
Also , the need to redefine the Iranian threat away from exclusively being focused on nuclear activity , because now you have the difficulty of both the IAEA saying there is no nuclear weapons program and the CIA saying pretty much the same thing .
So the Bush administration needs to redefine the Iranian threat , which they have been doing successfully , casting Iran as the largest state sponsor of terror , getting the Senate resolution calling the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Command a terrorist organization , and creating a perception amongst the American people , courtesy of a compliant media , that talks about the reason why things are going bad in Iraq is primarily because of Iranian intervention .
They have been working very hard to get back on track .
I still believe that we are seeing convergence here .
The Bush administration is moving very aggressively toward military action with Iran .
MT : Is your conclusion that an attack is imminent based on the administration 's statements and actions , like labeling Iran 's Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist group , or do you also have sources within the intelligence community and the military and the administration telling you what 's going on ?
Ritter : I do n't have any current sources of the sort you just spoke of .
I was plugged in back in 2006 to good quality current information .
But I have n't been plugged in recently , so I have to use some sort of analytical methodology as opposed to saying , " Aha , I got it from the horse 's mouth . "
But there 's nothing that has occurred that leads me to believe the Bush administration has changed its policy direction .
In fact there has been much that 's occurred that reinforces the earlier conclusions that were based on good sources of information .
We take a look at items in the defense budget , the rapid conversion of heavy bombers to carry bunker - busting bombs on a specific time frame , the massive purchasing of oil to fill up the strategic oil reserve by April 2008 .
Everything points to April 2008 to being a month of some criticality .
It also matches my analysis that the Bush administration will want to carry this out prior to the crazy political season of the summer of 2008 .
MT : Last year you expressed hope that if Democrats took control of Congress it might pass legislation that could block the march toward war .
Do you see them stepping up ?
Ritter : No .
They just passed a resolution declaring the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Command as a terrorist organization .
Unless there is a radical reawakening in Congress , I do n't see them passing any sort of pre-emptive legislation of that nature .
MT : But it is now clearer than ever that our invasion of Iraq has been a disaster .
How do you explain the lack of opposition ?
Ritter :
It 's difficult to explain .
First of all you have to note , from the public side , that very few Americans actually function as citizens anymore .
What I mean by that are people who invest themselves in this country , people who care , who give a damn .
Americans are primarily consumers today , and so long as they continue to wrap themselves in the cocoon of comfort , and the system keeps them walking down a road to the perceived path of prosperity , they do n't want to rock the boat .
If it does n't have a direct impact on their day - to - day existence , they simply do n't care .
There 's a minority of people who do , but the majority of Americans do n't .
And if the people do n't care — and remember , the people are the constituents — if the constituents do n't care , then those they elect to higher office wo n't feel the pressure to change .
The Democrats , one would hope , would live up to their rhetoric , that is , challenging the Bush administration 's imperial aspirations .
Once it became clear Iraq was an unmitigated disaster , one would have thought that when the Democrats took control of Congress they would have sought to reimpose a system of checks and balances , as the Constitution mandates .
But instead the Democrats have put their focus solely on recapturing the White House , and , in doing so , will not do anything that creates a political window of opportunity for their Republican opponents .
The Democrats do n't want to be explaining to an apathetic constituency , an ignorant constituency whose ignorance is prone to be exploited because it produces fear , fear of the unknown , and the global war on terror is the ultimate fear button .
The Democrats , rather than challenging the Bush administration 's position on the global war on terror , challenging the notion of these imminent threats , continues to play them up because that is the safest route toward the White House .
At least that is their perception .
The last thing they are going to do is pass a piece of legislation that opens the door for the Republicans to say , " Look how weak these guys are on terror .
They 're actually defending the Iranians .
They 're defending this Ahmadinejad guy .
They 're defending the Holocaust denier .
They 're defending the guy who wants to wipe Israel off the face of the earth . "
The Democrats do n't want to go up against that .
They do n't have the courage of conviction to enter into that debate and stare at whoever makes that statement and say they 're a bald - faced liar .
They 're not going to go that route .
MT : Do you think there is anything that can happen at this point that will stop this attack ?
Ritter :
You have to take a look at external influences , not internal ones .
I do n't think there is anything happening inside the United States that 's going to stop that attack .
I do believe that , for instance , if Pakistan continues to melt down , that could be something that creates such a significant diversion the Bush administration will not be able to make its move on Iran .
To attack Iran , they 're going to need a nice lull period .
That 's what they 're pushing with this whole surge right now .
They 're creating the perception that things are quieting .
I do n't know how many people picked up on it , but one day we 're told that 2007's been the bloodiest year for U.S. forces in Iraq , the next day we 're told that attacks against American troops are dropping at a dramatic pace .
So , what 's the media focus on ?
The concept of attacks dropping at a dramatic pace .
No one 's talking about the fact , wait a minute , we 've just lost more guys than we 've ever lost before .
They are pushing the perception that Iraq is now stable .
If you have a situation in Pakistan that explodes out of control , where you suddenly have nuclear weapons at risk of falling into the hands of Islamic fundamentalists , that could stop it .
If Turkey attacks Kurdistan and that conflict spins out of control , that could put a halt to it .
These are things that could overshadow even Dick Cheney 's desire to bomb Iran .
And there could be some other unforeseen meltdown globally that 's not on the radar at this time , that , unfortunately , we have to be hoping for to stop an attack on Iran .
And that says a lot , that we have to hope for disaster to prevent unmitigated disaster .
MT : What 's the motivation ?
Ritter :
The ideologues who are in there believe the United States in the post - Cold War environment needed to fill the gap created by the demise of the Soviet Union so that no nation or group of nations would ever again confront us as equals .
And in order to do this , they basically divided the world into spheres of strategic interest and said we will impose our will .
And the Middle East is one such area .
There 's a whole host of reasons to do this .
It 's not just supporting Israel .
It 's not just taking down Saddam .
It 's about geopolitics .
It 's about looking down the road toward China and India , the world 's two largest developing economies , especially the Chinese , and the absolute fear that this resurgent Chinese economy brings in the hearts of American industrialists and the need to dictate the pace of Chinese economic development by controlling their access to energy .
And controlling central Asian and Middle East energy areas is key in the strategic thinking of the Bush administration .
So , there 's a lot of complexity at play here .
But you say why do they want to do this ?
It 's about as Condoleezza Rice continuously says before the U.S. Congress :
It 's about regional transformation , inclusive of regime change .
It turns the Middle East into a sphere of interest that we have tremendous control over .
That 's what 's behind all this .
MT : And when Bush talks about being an instrument of God , do you think he really believes that or is that just political posturing , playing to the religious base ?
Ritter :
That 's a question that can only be asked of George Bush .
But I find it disturbing that an American politician who is supposed to be the head of a secular nation where religion is protected but there is no state religion , and who has control over the world 's largest nuclear arsenal , not only openly talks about how God is his final adviser , which pretty much negates the role of Congress or any other system of governmental oversight , checks and balances of the executive , but also embraces a kind of evangelicalism that gives legitimacy to the notion of the rapture , Armageddon , the apocalypse as a good thing .
Here 's a man who speaks of World War III and the apocalypse and he has his hand on the button and he talks to God .
I do n't know , if it 's a show , its a dangerous show , if its real , we should all be scared to death .
MT : Even going back to before the start of the Iraq war , the national mainstream media just seemed to be beating the drum for it .
Why do you think that is ?
Ritter : Again , only they can really answer that question , but I think it is clear the mainstream media , while not outright fabricators , are not there to tell the truth , they 're there to win over ratings .
They will package their programming in ways that sells well to an audience .
And we are dealing with a complacent American audience , where in - depth reality stories are trumped by reality TV .
I do n't see the programming director saying , " Look , we 're going to spend an hour explaining to the American people why Ahmadinejad 's speech was n't that big of a deal . "
Or they can say , " Hell , no ; in three minutes we can lead with a story saying he 's a Holocaust denier and win everybody 's attention . "
MT : Do you think the resolutions in 2001 and 2002 authorizing Bush to use military force against Iraq give Bush the authority to attack Iran without first obtaining congressional approval ?
Ritter : I 'd like to believe it did n't , but unfortunately when you take a look at it , and I 've had constitutional scholars take a look at it , the feeling is that , yeah , because of the terrorist threat , if you take a look at the fine print on both of those resolutions , it gives the president authorization to use military force to take out groups , organizations , individuals , etc. who are linked to the events of 9/11 .
And the president has continued to make the case that Iran is linked to the attacks .
MT : Do you think an attack on Iran would be an illegal war of aggression and a war crime under international law ?
Ritter :
It depends on what triggers it .
If Iran engages in an action that legitimizes a military response , the answer is no .
There are two conditions that we are legally allowed to engage in military operations .
Militaries are bound by the charter of the United Nations ' Article 51 , legitimate self - defense , and a Chapter 7 resolution passed by the Security Council authorizing military force to be used .
If we attack Iran void of any of these , especially when it can be shown that we have hyped up a threat in defense of pre-emption —
I think the Nuremberg Tribunals from 1946 have set a clear precedent with Judge Jackson condemning German generals to death for invading Denmark and Norway in the same premise of pre-emption .
It is quite clear this is illegal .
Unfortunately the Nuremburg Tribunals do n't have any weight when it comes to prosecution of the law .
The international community has not agreed upon a definition of what pre-emptive aggression is , and what the consequences of such are .
Let 's keep in mind if we attack Iran we 're guilty of no more than what we 're already guilty of in attacking Iraq .
Hyping up a threat where one does n't exist , going to war void of any legitimacy , violating everything we claim to stand for .
Yet we do n't see any war crimes tribunals being convened for the Bush administration over Iraq .
MT : One of the scenarios that 's been raised has Israel launching the first strike , prompting a response from Iran that would then pull us in .
Ritter : I think Israel is capable of doing a one - time limited shot into Iran .
One has to take a look at the distances involved and the complexity of military operations ... the lack of friendly airspace between corridors into and out of Iran .
It 's nice to talk about an Israeli attack , but the reality is far different .
Israel had trouble dominating Hezbollah right on its own border with air power .
I think Israel could actually go into Iran and get their butts kicked .
It may not go off as well as they think it 's going to go off .
It is too long of a distance , too much warning for the Iranians .
The Iranians are too locked - in ; they 're too well prepared .
It does n't make any sense .
Israel does n't have the ability to sustain a strike .
Like I said , they might be able to pull off a limited one - time shot .
But I think the fallout from that would be devastating for the United States .
As much as we 've worked to get an Arab alliance against Iran , that would just fall apart overnight with an Israeli attack .
No Muslim state will stand by and defend Israel after it initiated a strike against Iran .
It just will not happen .
And the United States knows this .
I just think it 's ludicrous to talk about an Israeli attack .
I think what we 're looking at is an American attack .
It 's the only viable option both in terms of initiation and sustainment of the strike .
Israel might be drawn in after that .
There 's no doubt in my mind the Iranians will launch missiles against Israeli targets , either directly or through proxies , and that Israel will suffer .
This is something I try to warn all my Israeli friends about .
If you think Saddam Hussein firing 41 missiles was inconvenient , wait until the Iranians fire a thousand of them .
It goes well beyond an inconvenience ; it becomes a national tragedy .
And then the escalation that can occur from there .
I think right now what the Bush administration is conceiving is a limited strike against Iran to take out certain Revolutionary Guard sites and perhaps identified nuclear infrastructure .
Not a massive , sustained bombardment , but a limited strike .
But we were always told in the Marine Corps that the enemy has a vote and no plan survives initial contact with the enemy .
So we may seek to have a limited strike , but if the Iranians do a massive response , things could spin out of control quickly .
MT : What do you foresee as some of the possible consequences ?
No one is talking about putting troops on the ground in Iran are they ?
Ritter : A while back there was talk about having forces move in on Tehran via Azerbaijan .
But I think those plans have gone to the wayside .
If Iran is successful in shutting down the Straits of Hormuz , it will force our hand and we 'll have to put the Marines in to secure the Straits .
If the conflict drags on and air power is not sufficient to break the will of the Iranian resistance , the Army may have to activate its option to put a reinforced corps into Azerbaijan and punch down the Caspian Sea coast .
But these are definitely not the leading options at this point in time .
MT : When you say a " limited strike , " what might that look like in more detail ?
Ritter : Iran is a big country .
There are a number of target sites we have to look at .
To give an example , to take out a number of air defense sites during the Gulf War , a sortie required over 100 aircraft .
It 's not just one airplane coming in , firing a missile and going out .
You have to secure a corridor , you have to put a combat air patrol over it , you have to have air - to - air refueling , you have to have aircraft protecting the refuelers , and then you have to have the strike aircraft themselves .
You have to have pre- and post - reconnaissance .
When you replicate this , let 's say , over 20 targets , we do n't have enough airplanes to do it all at once .
So , it 's something that will occur in phases .
What you look at is maybe a three - to five - day bombardment where we take out sites , radar sites and air defense sites the first day , the second we pound the nuclear sites , the third day we take the Revolutionary Guard Command sites , the fourth and fifth days we do follow - up strikes to make sure all targets are destroyed , then we 're done .
That 's probably what we 're looking at .
MT : How much damage could be done to the Iranian nuclear program ?
Ritter :
No damage would be done to it .
Remember , the problem the Iranians face is n't the manufacture of this equipment .
They 've already mastered that .
And if you think for a second machine tools that are used to manufacture enrichment equipment are going to be stored out in the open where we can bomb them , you 're wrong .
They 've been dispersed .
The Iraqis were masters of this .
We spent a lot of money blowing up concrete , but we never got the machine tools , because they were always hidden .
They were always evacuated the day before — they 'd take it to palm groves or warehouses that we did n't know about , or hidden in narrow streets .
And we never detected that , and we never got them .
The Iranians are even better .
They 've been mastering the technology of deep - earth tunneling , so they can hide things underground that we can't reach with our conventional weapons .
So I just think it is absurd to talk about bombing these sites , because all we 'll do is blow up buildings that can be rebuilt .
A couple of sites are more sensitive ; I think the uranium conversion facility at Isfahan , that 'll be a major blow .
It 's a site that can be rebuilt however .
It was a facility put in by the Chinese , but the Iranians have the blueprints .
It 'll take time , but they can rebuild it .
At the best we are talking about retarding an Iranian program .
But what 's worse is if we bomb them , we may retard it , but we might also make it a militant program .
Meaning that if their objective is only nuclear energy and suddenly they 're being attacked and the world is doing nothing , we may push the Iranians into weaponization even though that is something they do n't want to do .
That 's not in the cards right now .
But our attack will have little or no impact on anything .
That 's for certain .
MT : So what do you think the United States should be doing to keep Iran from getting nuclear weapons ?
Ritter : I think that is the wrong question .
That presumes Iran is seeking nuclear weapons .
There 's no evidence of that whatsoever .
So rather than pose a question that legitimizes a certain point , I think the question should be , " What should the United States be doing in regards to Iran ? "
I think we should be seeking to normalize relations with Iran .
We should be seeking stability in the region .
This concept that the United States gets to dictate to sovereign people the makeup of their government is absurd .
First of all , the theocracy in Iran , while not a model , for instance ... it's an Iranian problem , not an American problem .
The day of the exportation of the Islamic revolution is long gone .
The Iranians are not seeking to convert by the sword anybody .
It 's a nation that has serious internal problems .
Economic .
Huge unemployment .
It 's a nation that recognizes these problems .
And they are in desperate need of not only political stability but also the economic benefits that come with this stability .
The Iranians want a normalization of relations with the United States that would be inclusive of peaceful coexistence with Israel .
They 've said this over and over and over again .
So what the United States should be doing is exploiting the olive branch that is being held out by the Iranians .
We should be engaging them diplomatically .
We should be terminating economic sanctions and seeking to exploit the leverage that comes with having American businesses working inside Iran to try and change them from within .
We should be doing everything to get Iran to be a positive player in the region , especially considering the debacle that 's unfolding in Iraq .
Having the Iranians working with us to engender stability as opposed to being at cross-purposes .
The same can be said in Afghanistan and the entire central Asian region .
We keep putting our hopes on allies like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan .
Saudi Arabia , which produced 14 of the hijackers who slaughtered Americans on 9/11 .
Pakistan , which was the political sponsor of the Taliban and al - Qaeda in Afghanistan and continues to have ties to radical Islamic terror organizations .
These are our allies ?
And we call Iran the enemy ?
We 've got it backward .
The Iranians are actually the ones we should be working with to oppose dictatorships like Pakistan and irresponsible governments like Saudi Arabia's .
MT : Even under Iran 's current president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ?
It seems like before him , just after 2001 , there was a window where the Iranians were seeking rapprochement and doing things perhaps quietly and not well - known to Americans to stabilize things .
Ritter :
You have to remember that Ahmadinejad does n't make any policy .
He is more than a figurehead , but constitutionally he 's hampered by the reality that the power resides with the theocrats .
It 's the theocrats we need to be engaging , not Ahmadinejad .
You engage the people who make the decisions .
In the end we should be sending people to talk to the National Security Council , the Guardian Council , the representatives of the supreme leader .
That 's where the power is , that 's where the decisions are made .
Ahmadinejad is in reality just a minor inconvenience .
The bottom line is , not only does n't he account for much , his words have n't created a problem at all .
Half the things we claim he said , he never said at all .
And the other half we put out of context and exaggerate .
I 'm not here to defend what the guy says .
But the notion that just because a man dared question a 100 percent interpretation of the history of the Holocaust as put forward by Israel — and again , I 'm not saying he 's right to do that —
I 'm just saying that because he dared do that , he 's suddenly evil incarnate and we need to go to war against this guy ?
No .
At worst he 's a joke .
He 's a guy whose words mean nothing , have no power , have no relevance .
It 's the supreme leader that matters .
And , yes , today the supreme leader continues to want to seek to normalize relations with the United States .
MT : You are getting ready to go to Iran at the start of December .
What 's the purpose of that trip ?
Ritter : I 've been trying to get there for some time now to talk with Iranian government officials trying to ascertain firsthand what 's going on in Iran .
We get a lot of rhetoric here at home , we get the media saying a lot of things that are derived not so much from on - the - ground truth in Iran but rather from talking points put out by the White House .
I think it is imperative that if we are going to have a national debate , discussion and dialogue about Iran , that we get all sides of the story .
Hopefully , I 'll have an opportunity to meet with Iranian government officials , and have a chance to speak with some religious officials , and maybe even have a chance to talk about hypotheticals , not only what the current situation is , but how the Iranians would like to see this thing resolved and what mechanisms might need to be employed and maybe come back with some ideas that people in Congress might be interested in .
MT : You 've been to Iran before , have n't you ?
Ritter : Yes .
And having been to Iran , I can tell you that it is the last nation in the world we should be saying these are people we have to fight .
When you visit Iran and you see the Iranian people and you get the chance to talk to them , you realize that these are peaceful people .
These are highly educated people .
They are more like us than we can possibly imagine .
They are very Western in their approach , although they reject the term Western because they say think those in the West are Neanderthals compared to the Persian culture .
But they are very modern in their approach .
They are a very modern people .
I always say the best way to stop a war with Iran would be to issue every American a passport and roundtrip ticket and money for a two - week stay and let them go there and when they came back they 'd say there 's no way we should bomb this place .
Once you 've been to Iran you realize just how utterly useless the concept of militaristic confrontation is .
MT : I think it is fair to say you are perceived as a champion of the left at this point .
But 10 years ago , when you were criticizing the Clinton administration for undermining efforts to root out Saddam 's weapons , you were being heralded by the right .
Saddam accused you of being an American spy .
And you were criticized for being too close with the Israelis and sharing information with them .
But when you go to Iraq prior to the war there , people on the right are calling you a traitor .
The FBI put you under surveillance .
What do you make of all that ?
Ritter :
What I make of it is my consistency and the inconsistency of those who seek to gain political advantage by manipulating the truth .
When the right embraced what I was saying , they did n't embrace the totality of what I was saying .
They only embraced that aspect that was convenient for their political purposes .
I would say today that the left is guilty of the same thing .
I 'm only convenient to the left when that which I espouse mirrors what they are pursuing .
It will be interesting to see , if Hillary Clinton wins the White House , how popular I will be in certain circles , because I can guarantee I will go after her with all the vengeance I go after the Bush administration .
It 's not about being Republican , it 's not about being Democrat , it 's about being American .
It 's about doing the right thing .
And in the 1990s the right thing was to implement the [ United Nations ] Security Council resolutions calling for the disarmament of Iraq .
That was the law .
That was what I was tasked with doing , and the Clinton administration was not permitting the task to be accomplished .
By holding them to account , if that suddenly made me popular with the right , then so be it .
It 's not something that I sought ; it was n't the purpose of what I was doing .
But when the complexity of my stance became inconvenient to the right , when they found out it was n't just about taking down the Clinton administration , but rather criticizing an American political position that put unilateral policy objectives and regime change higher up in the chain of priorities than disarmament , suddenly it was n't convenient anymore to be saying , " Hey , we like this guy . "
One cannot be held accountable for the words and actions of those who seek to selectively embrace what you say .
MT : When Bush talks about World War III , how likely is the scenario that an attack by us would escalate into that ?
Ritter : I do n't know about likely , but what I say is that I can sit here and spin scenarios that have it going in that direction .
And these are n't fantastic scenarios .
MT : Would that be having Russia or China coming in ?
Ritter : No , no , no .
It would be something more like the destabilization of Pakistan to the point where a nuclear device gets in the hands of Islamic fundamentalists who are aligned with al - Qaeda and there 's some sort of nuclear activity on the soil of the United States of America .
That 's more what I 'm looking at .
I do n't think the Russians or the Chinese would become involved .
They do n't need to .
All they have to do is sit back and wait and pick up the pieces — because it is the end of the United States as a global superpower .
That 's one thing I try to tell everybody .
The danger of going after Iran is that it is just not worth it .
What we can lose is everything , and what we gain is nothing .
So why do it ?

Small businesses need cash flow to sustain operations and grow revenues .
Oftentimes , owners use small business loans to cover the costs of new equipment , inventory or employees .
While the cash injection could help your business , it is very difficult to qualify for these loans .
Banks have stringent requirements to prevent them from losing money on the loan .
They need to know that the business is strong enough to pay off the loan even if things do n’t work out perfectly .
To learn more , follow these steps to qualify for a small business loan .
Compare Small Business Loan Options
Before you apply , compare the various small business loan options available .
Depending on the size of the loan , you will have to meet various requirements and terms .
For example , an SBA loan is government backed , so the interest rate is a lot lower .
These loans have tight minimum requirements though .
Your company must be established with significant business revenues .
Depending on the type of loan you ’re looking for , you may need as much as $ 75,000 in annual revenue just to apply .
If you ca n’t qualify for an SBA loan , there are many other alternative loans from private lenders or commercial loans offered by banks .
As you compare the best options for your company , take careful notes of the eligibility requirements , interest rates and payment terms .
Improve Your Credit Score
To secure any of the small business loan options , you will need a strong credit score .
If your business has n’t been around enough to build its own credit score , the bank will look at your personal credit score .
These scores are how the bank will determine if you pay back debt .
If your score is low , you can rebuild your credit score by paying off any outstanding debt .
The best way to keep the score up is to always pay off your debts on time .
You should also keep an eye out for errors in your credit score that could also drag it down .
A strong credit score will establish immediate trust between your company and the bank .
Provide Financial Statements
Next , you will need to provide the bank with profit and loss statements , cash flow statements , company tax returns , and checking account statements .
The bank needs these documents to determine the health of your business .
They may require your articles of incorporation and any licenses your company needs to comply with the law .
Depending on the type of lender , these documents may need additional verification .
While qualifying for a small business loan , have your document proof ready just in case the underwriters need further evidence to support the business .
Present Your Business Plan
One of the most important things to show the bank is your company ’s business plan .
This is your chance to advocate for your small business and future plans .
A well - thought out and thorough business plan will lead the bank to take you seriously as a borrower .
Your business plan should include important financial metrics , industry analysis and product details .
In addition to a strong financial profile , a business plan gives lenders a sense of confidence in your business .
As you build a relationship with lenders , you can show how you have delivered on your business plan .
Present your business plan in a professional manner to convince lenders that your business can handle the additional funds and repayment obligations .
Prepare Personal References
Moreover , business lender may want to confirm your authenticity as the business owner .
In order to prevent dealings with unethical business owners , you should have references available .
Strong references could give you the final stamp of approval to get the business funding required for growth .
When preparing your personal references , ask professional contacts , clients or suppliers who have an established relationship with your business .
This way , they can explain that you are dedicated business owner who will uphold the loan agreement .
Before you apply for a loan , there are five steps you can take to ensure you can qualify .
Firstly , consider all of your small business loan options and make sure you can meet the minimum requirements .
Then , improve your business and personal credit score to build trust in lenders .
Prepare company documents to inform the bank of your company ’s financial standing .
If possible , present your business plan to convince them that you intend to use the loan wisely .
Finally , prepare references who can vouch for your ethical business practices .
By following these steps , you can successfully qualify for your first small business loan .

Powerful car bomb explodes in parking lot at Spain 's busiest airport
• Spain says bombing is a violation of nine - month cease - fire with separatist ETA
• Blast followed warning to police , claimed by Basque separatists ETA
• One man reported missing after explosion
Adjust font size :
MADRID , Spain ( CNN ) --
Spain has blamed a powerful bomb explosion Saturday at the country 's busiest airport on Basque separatist group ETA , declaring it a violation of a nine - month cease - fire .
The bomb at Barajas International Airport is " absolutely incompatible with the permanent cease - fire that ETA declared nine months ago , " Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said during a nationally televised news conference .
He ordered the government to halt any peace efforts , but he declined to say that the attack " breaks the cease - fire , " which was the way Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba described it to reporters a few hours earlier .
A police source had initially said that the blast , which occurred in a stolen van and damaged a parking lot and nearby Terminal 4 , caused no serious injuries .
( Watch smoke billowing from airport )
But Rubalcaba said that may not be the case : Police were looking for two people reported missing after the blast -- one of them a 19 - year - old Ecuadorian national who had stayed in his car as a companion went into the airport to pick up someone .
The other person was not described .
If it turns out that either person is dead , the death would be the first attributed to ETA in three years .
Beginning about an hour before the 9 a.m. ( 3 a.m. ET ) explosion , three calls to authorities warned of the event , the third acknowledging it as an ETA blast , Rubalcaba said .
After several hours , regular air traffic at Terminal 4 resumed Saturday .
Terminal 4 opened this year and primarily serves Iberia Airlines , a private company .
Flights at the airport 's other three terminals were not interrupted .
Before Rubalcaba 's remarks , opposition leader Mariano Rajoy of the Conservative Popular Party told reporters , " This confirms what we knew : that ETA is a criminal organization that does not want any peace . "
Zapatero was out of Madrid at the time of the blast , but he hurriedly returned to address the nation at 6 p.m. ( noon ET ) .
Samantha Graham , an employee of CNN 's parent company Turner Broadcasting , was in the terminal and heard the blast .
Graham described a huge column of black smoke billowing into the sky .
She said hundreds of people evacuated the terminal through jetways and gathered outside on the airport tarmacs .
The Madrid airport is Spain 's busiest , handling more than 40 million passengers a year , according to the airport 's official Web site .
ETA announced a " permanent " cease - fire last March , raising hopes for an end to nearly 40 years of separatist violence blamed for more than 800 deaths and thousands of other casualties .
Last fall , low - level street violence resumed in the northern Basque region -- which ETA is seeking to make an independent nation -- as pro-ETA youths burned buses and automatic bank teller machines and carried out other attacks .
In late October , authorities blamed ETA for the theft in Nimes , southern France , of 350 handguns and 10,000 rounds of ammunition from an arms factory .
Arnaldo Otegi , a leader of the outlawed Batasuna party , which authorities link to ETA , on Saturday blamed the government for the roadblocks in the peace process .
But he told reporters there 's still a chance for peace , even after the bomb .

support MUG info 01.2.08 The Times Rubs Its Eyes
The Times ran an editorial on Monday ( Looking at America ) that began this way : " There are too many moments these days when we cannot recognize our country , " followed by a spin through the high crimes and low points of the Bush administration .
The Times wrote , " [ T ] here is no excuse for how President Bush and his advisers panicked — how they forgot that it is their responsibility to protect American lives and American ideals , that there really is no safety for Americans or their country when those ideals are sacrificed . "
It 's a variation on Benjamin Franklin 's point that " Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety . "
And that 's a point that always bears repeating .
The editorial , however , would have been much improved in two ways .
First , it should have run several years ago .
Surely the Times can not be rubbing its eyes only now in disbelief at what has happened to our country , our Constitution , and our reputation around the world under this regime .
More troubling , though , is the Times ' amnesia about its own role in failing its two crucial obligations of accuracy — embodied most egregiously in reporting by Judith Miller — and skepticism , a pervasive reluctance by the paper to examine the claims by the Bush administration in its rush to war .
Yes , the Times has previously , openly , even vigorously discussed these failures .
But to look at what the world has come to in the past seven years without including the systemic failure of the mainstream press gives the impression that the Times would like what happened on 43rd Street to stay on 43rd Street .
That impression is reinforced by the paper 's decision to hire William Kristol as an editorial writer .
No , it 's not as appalling as hiring Karl Rove , which Time magazine has done .
But it 's another in a string of serious misjudgments by the Times that have us fearing not only that they just do n't get it but that they may never get it back .
Proof of this comes from Times editorial page editor Andy Rosenthal , quoted by Media Matters , who said he does n't understand " this weird fear of opposing views . "
That is a defense so disingenuous or so clueless as to be itself suggestive of a pathology .
It 's not an opposing view that 's the problem .
It 's not simply that Kristol has been a narrow - minded proponent of the neocon viewpoint .
It is that he has been so demonstrably , disastrously wrong in so many of his arguments and nearly as many of his assertions .
Give us an opposing view , but not one so manifestly discredited here and around the world .
Moreover , some of us feel the country has been injured so grievously in the past seven years that being asked to listen to any of them — the captain , the team , or the cheerleaders — is an insufferable affront , particularly coming from a once - unassailable newspaper , reduced by the worst administration in the country 's history to the role of enabler .

Former Foreign Minister Mahmoud Zahhar is leading the delegation
The Palestinians , led by former Foreign Minister Mahmoud Zahhar , are trying to come to an agreement with Egypt over the contentious frontier .
It was the third such meeting between the two sides in the past two weeks .
Gazans poured into Egypt last month when the border fence was breached by Palestinian militants .
They streamed across the border in their hundreds of thousands to buy goods before the fence was eventually re-sealed .
For several hours on Saturday , shopkeepers across the Gaza Strip kept their stores closed as part of a strike protesting against the continuing Israeli blockade of the territory .
Three dead in airstrike
Egypt and Israel severely restricted access to Gaza following the take - over of the territory by Hamas last year .
Meanwhile , three Palestinians were killed in an Israeli missile strike in the Gaza Strip .
Israel says it targeted militants in the attack , but local people said the three were civilians .
The incident happened near Beit Hanoun , in the northern Gaza Strip .
Palestinian militants regularly fire rockets from Gaza into Israeli territory .
New OSKit 0.96 released and a " Scheme machine "
Also , check out the the appended msg : a grad student from Rice who had never before seen the OSKit built a Scheme machine in five hours !
Good luck and please let us know of interesting uses and good and bad feedback and fixes -- to both code and docs .
We really do n't know how easy it will be for people to use this newish COM stuff , which is needed , but a bit more complicated than the simple old libraries .

Subject : The OSKit 0.96 is released Date : Fri , 18 Dec 98 21:58:09 MST
Go to http://www.cs.utah.edu/projects/flux/oskit/ and follow your nose for all the goodies .
Briefly : it 's up to 30 component libraries now , comes with 45 example mini-kernels , a 500 page ( help ! ) document with few blank pages anymore ( although still lots of gaps in it ) , can be configured with full multithreading and Posix threads , has prototype CPU inheritance scheduling in it ( 5 policies including 2 real time ) , has a hierarchical network link - sharing component , has a " simple virtual memory " component including pageout .
Has most Linux and BSD filesystems , several networking libs , the full FreeBSD C library ( which means most of Posix ) , lots of device drivers ( perhaps 60 ) , profiling support , and some minimal video and window manager support .
A currently inelegant but useful component lets you run many kernels on Unix in user - mode , which is great for debugging .
Most components now use the COM object model , which is a first in internal OS design .
Just about every component is optional , and unlike any other OS , is designed to fit into * other * operating systems and environments if desired .
Of course the OSKit 's got problems , too , do n't we all .
There are a ton of things that it needs .
One nice thing in that regard is that it 's easy to incrementally add to the OSKit .
Let 's do it !
Re licensing , the OSKit comes with full source , and is GPL 'ed ; " open source " is now the " in " term apparently .
If a business or someone has trouble with the GPL , the University is willing to talk about other options .
As a special holiday bonus -- for such patience on your part -- this release supports a version , which we provide , of the Kaffe OpenVM ( Java to you ) from Transvirtual .
Thus you can link them together and you 've got Kaffe on the bare HW , or with a configuration change , you can run the same " Java OS " on top of Unix .
Our Kaffe changes will go into the next beta release .
Thanks to Tim Wilkinson and his company for giving Kaffe to the world .
We are grateful to the long line of free software projects from whom we drew code , including Mach , Linux , FreeBSD , NetBSD , and XFree86 .
The GNU build tools were , as always , invaluable .
DARPA 's support has been great .
Finally , I want to thank and acknowledge the fine team at Utah that has accomplished so much , and with whom I have the honor to work .
Check out the CREDITS file for their names .

To : plt-design@cs.rice.edu cc : lepreau@cs Subject : MzScheme kernel MzScheme 100/21 is now available in kernel form for x86 machines .
In other words , MzScheme can run as a stand - alone OS on your PC .
Practical ?
Perhaps eventually .
For now , it 's just fun .
The MzScheme kernel is based on OSKit from the Flux group at Utah .
Coverting MzScheme to a kernel took about 5 hours , most of that being the time to understand various aspects of the OSKit .
I spent an additional 2 or 3 hours making MzScheme run as smooth as it does , but a little more work is needed ( as described below ) .
A LILO - friendly kernel is now available ( on cs at Rice ) : /home/mflatt/zMzScheme
To install the kernel on a machine that already has Linux : 1 ) Copy zMzScheme to / ( or wherever you want ) .
2 ) Edit /etc/lilo.conf , adding image=/ zMzScheme label=mz root= / dev/hda6 read - only but change / dev /hd a6 to be whatever is in your image= / boot / vmlinuz - 2.0.32 line , and adjust the path in the image= / zMzScheme line if you did n't put zMzScheme it in the root directory .
3 ) Run `lilo ' within Linux .
4 ) Reboot .
5 ) At the lilo boot prompt , type " mz " and hit return .
6 ) Evaluate MzScheme expressions to your heart 's content .
In principle , you do n't even need Linux , and I can supply a kernel in multiboot format if anyone wants it .
( So far , I 've only learned to start kernels via LILO . )
The current MzScheme kernel is missing a few useful features : * No useful filesystem support .
It looks like it 's easy to support any filesystem that Linux supports , and I 'll wire things together sometime .
Meanwhile , when you start the current MzScheme kernel , you get an empty filesystem .
You can create files and directories , but they 're stored in memory , not on disk .
* No TCP support , yet .
That 's probably also straightforward to add .
* Reading from stdin blocks all MzScheme threads .
This seems to be a limitation of the OSKit 's default stdin support ( no non-blocking reads on stdin , and select ( ) always claims stdin is ready to read ) , but if so , it looks like MzScheme can talk to the console directly to fix the problem .

As the Clock Ticks Towards Final Certification , and the County 's Registrar Makes Excuses , Hundreds of Thousands of Voters Stand to be Disenfranchised for No Reason at All ...
Every Vote Counted REDUCES the Current Error Rate !
The Registrar Must Act NOW !
Brad Friedman Byon 2/14/2008 , 2:08 pm PT
You can read The BRAD BLOG 's previous detailed explanations of the current Los Angeles County " Double Bubble " ballot debacle here and here .
If you 've yet to sign the Courage Campaign 's petition demanding that these ballots be counted immediately , please do so right now !
As the clock ticks towards the date required for final certification of as many as hundreds of thousands of currently uncounted ballots in Los Angeles County --- due to an idiotic , ill - conceived , and possibly illegal scheme by the county 's Registrar of Voters --- it is imperative that those ballots be counted immediately .
While the acting Registrar has claimed , incorrectly , that it is " impossible " to accurately determine the intent of the voters on those ballots , he is wrong .
Almost every single uncounted ballot can be counted today with absolutely certainty that the intent of the voter is being accurately recorded .
With current the miscount / error rate of those uncounted ballots --- on which the voter 's intent has currently been inaccurately recorded by the optical - scan voting machines as " no vote " --- now standing at 100 % , almost every single ballot counted will only lower that rate at best .
At worst , in a tiny ( almost infinitesimal ) percentage of ballots , the current error rate will be not be lowered , though it will not be increased .
Thus , the error rate can be reduced to almost 0 % if the Registrar 's office will simply begin counting the ballots --- immediately .
Here 's what everybody , ( including apparently the Registrar ! ) , needs to know about the currently miscounted ballots ...
The short background for the " Double Bubble " debacle
In short ( ish ) , working from the very conservative numbers offered by the LA County Registrar 's office , at least 170,000 non-partisan ( NP ) , also known as decline - to - state ( DTS ) , voters showed up in the county to vote on Super Tuesday .
Of those , at least 100,000 requested to vote in either the Democratic or American Independent Party open primaries as they were welcome to do .
When an NP voter asked to " cross - over " and vote in one of those primaries , the procures required that they be given a paper NP " InkaVote " ballot ( a card with only a series of empty numbered bubbles on it ) , slip that ballot into one of the Dem or AI template booklets in one of the booths , and then select BOTH a Presidential candidate , as well as fill in a second bubble meant to specify --- to the computer optical - scan counting machine --- that the ballot should be tallied as either a Dem or AI vote , depending on which bubble the voter filled in .
If that second bubble was n't filled in , the computer did n't bother to count the presidential selection on the ballot .
Since the great wisdom of recently - resigned Registrar Conny McCormack determined that both the Dem and AI presidential candidates would be recorded in the same line of bubbles on the same NP ballot , the second bubble had to be filled in , else there would be no way of knowing --- if only looking at the ballot --- which primary , Dem or AI , the NP voter was intending to vote in .
The result has been ( again , using the exceedingly conservative numbers of the LA Registrar ) some 50,000 NP ballots with a selection for Presidential candidate on it , but no selection for either Dem or AI in that second bubble .
Therefore , the machines did not count the Presidential selection on those ballots .
For the moment then , some 50,000 voters in Los Angeles County have had their votes for Presidential candidate currently miscounted .
An intended vote for Hillary Clinton , for example , has not been registered as a vote for her .
She has lost that vote for the moment , and the voter has been disenfranchised .
Needlessly .
Moreover , current acting Registrar Dean Logan is claiming that , due to the fact that the same sets of bubbles were used for both Dem and AI candidates , it 's " impossible " to determine with absolute certainty the intent of the voter .
But he is wrong .
In almost every single case .
The current miscount / error rate for those 50,000 ballots is now at 100 % .
Thus , any ballot counted at this point will only lower the current miscount / error rate .
Since almost every single one of those ballots can be counted accurately , as per the voter intent , beyond a shadow of a doubt , it 's an absolute absurdity and outrage that Logan is claiming that none of them can be , as he argued in an absurd report [ PDF ] delivered to the County 's Board of Supervisor 's on Monday .
How Do We Know Most Ballots Can be Counted With 100 % Accuracy Immediately ?
The precinct procedure for handling NP cross -over voters , when they came in and requested to vote in one of the open party primaries , was to cross out the NP next to their name in the poll roster at check - in , and write either DEM or AI next to the crossed out NP in the book .
In almost every single precinct there were zero NP voters who requested to vote in the AI primary .
I 'll repeat that another way :
If you check the poll rosters in most precincts , you will find that every NP cross -over voter intended to vote in the Democratic primary .
Therefore , any NP ballot in that precinct which has a Presidential candidate bubble filled in , can be counted immediately , with 100 % certainty , that it was meant as a vote in the Democratic Primary .
For a start , those ballots should be counted immediately , in full , and tallied as part of the official Democratic Party primary count , as the clock is ticking towards the official certification date , just over two weeks from today .
What about precincts in which the poll roster shows some NP - AI crossover voters ?
When the poll rosters are checked to see if anybody at the precinct was an NP voter who requested to vote in the AI primary , as mentioned , most such precincts will show zero such voters .
How many NP voters do you think bothered to go out to vote on Primary Day in order to vote for a minor candidate in a minor party that almost nobody has ever heard of ?
Nonetheless , there may be a few precincts where one or two , or even a handful of NP voters , might have requested to vote AI for some reason .
In those rare ( perhaps minuscule ) number of cases , there are essentially two choices if one wishes to comply with the California Constitution , which requires that " A voter who casts a vote in an election in accordance with the laws of this State shall have that vote counted , " and the California Elections Code which requires that code requirements " shall be liberally construed so that the real will of the electors will not be defeated by any informality or failure to comply with all of the provisions of the law . "
Remember , filling in that second bubble is not part of either the law or the elections code , and the requirement to fill it in may even be against the law .
So the two options , in such rare cases , where there happens to be an NP - AI voter or two at a precinct , are as follows :
OPTION 1 ) Count all NP ballots at the precinct as Democratic votes .
Yes , that would disenfranchise a few AI voters , which is not good .
Nonetheless , those voters are disenfranchised already if the Registrar continues to refuse to count any of the ballots , as he is currently doing .
And , again , counting any ballot at this time would most likely reduce the current 100 % error rate that exists now for the currently uncounted ballots .
OPTION 2 ) Count the ballots as Democratic votes and reduce the count by a proportional number .
Though this option requires a bit of fairly simple math to account for a tiny number of AI voters , the county routinely uses such fractional extrapolations in other areas of vote counting .
For example , just 1 % of ballots are counted by hand for the state - mandated post- election " audit " of ballots , meant to check for accuracy of machine counting .
As well , the acknowledged error rate on the optical - scan counters is already some 1 % or more .
Any errors factored in to the count of NP - DEM ballots , where a small fraction would be reduced proportionately to the tiny number of AI voters , at a rate commensurate with the overall results for each Democratic candidate in that precinct , would still likely be far smaller than the " acceptable " error rate of the county 's computerized optical - scan counting machines .
Either option , of course , would reduce the current 100 % error rate , to nearly 0 % .
[ UPDATE 2/16/08 :
A reader writes in to offer yet one more option as to how to count these ballots in such a way that would ensure that no votes are given to any candidate inaccurately :
You may have thought of this , but to count the votes in precincts where there are AI crossovers , you simply take the count for the democratic candidates and reduce EACH candidate 's vote count by the number of AI voters .
That will ensure that no AI vote goes to a Democrat .
Yup .
Sounds like that would work !
A handful of potential votes for Dem candidates might still go uncounted using this method , but every vote counted would then be ensured as a vote for a Dem candidate . ]
As to other elements that can be factored into the already existing error rates , we 'll note that many poll workers , thankfully , misunderstood the Registrar 's ridiculous scheme and actually handed Dem ballots , instead of NP ballots , to NP voters who asked to vote in the Dem primary .
Those ballots , even though they were " erroneously " given to the voters , have already been counted as Democratic Primary votes .
So as it stands now , many NP - Dem cross -over voters --- perhaps hundreds of thousands , since LA County has some 761,000 NP voters registered --- have already had their votes counted " more equally " than all of the others , simply because they were handed Dem ballots , instead of NP ballots .
( Please see the addendum now posted at the end of this article for further details on this , and how the off ice of the Registrar --- who has had the temerity to blame poll workers for this mess !
--- issued contradictory information to poll workers about how to handle NP cross - over voter ballots . )
To Review : This is What Must be Done Immediately to Avoid Disenfranchising at least 50,000 LA County Voters
In precincts where the poll roster shows no NP to AI crossover voters , count ALL NP ballots with votes for President on them immediately .
There is no legitimate justification for doing anything other than that .
If there are any precincts with NP - AI cross -over voters noted in the poll roster , the NP ballots with presidential votes on them can either be counted in full as Dem ballots immediately , or ( the more conservative option ) they can all be counted as Dem ballots , and then reduced by a proportional fraction to account for however many NP - AI voters there may have been signed into the precinct , as noted in the poll roster .
To reiterate :
We currently have , conservatively , some 50,000 voters who have been disenfranchised .
100 % of their ballots have been miscounted .
Any counting of those ballots --- even if an infinitesimal number of them are counted contrary to the voters intent --- will only decrease the existing miscounted / error rate for those ballots which now stands at 100 % until the acting Registrar of Voters directs that those ballots be counted , as is his legal requirement .
While the clock ticks towards certification day , any delay continues to risk the permanent and inexcusable disenfranchisement of thousands and thousands of voters .
That prospect which is wholly unacceptable on any level .
The excuses must stop .
Dean Logan must get to work and start counting .
NOW .
Any questions ?
ADDENDUM : As mentioned above , at some precincts poll workers gave Dem ballots , instead of NP ballots , to NP crossover voters .
Those Dem ballots have been counted in the Democratic Primary tally , despite the fact that the procedure was supposed to be for poll workers to give NP voters an NP ballot and direct them to vote on it in the Dem InkaVote booth .
Despite the Registrar 's claims to the contrary , the instructions given to poll workers were both confusing and incomplete , and , as we reported in an earlier story on this , did not include clear instructions to direct NP - Dem voters to fill in that second bubble on the NP ballot .
Worse still , as the email just sent from a precinct inspector where poll workers gave out Dem ballots instead of NP ballots details below , the Registrar 's office issued contradictory instructions on which type of ballot should be given to NP cross -over voters .
All of which makes the suggestions , made by acting Registrar Dean Logan , that poll workers and / or voters were to blame for this mess --- instead of his office , where the blame squarely belongs --- all the more reprehensible .
Brad , I 'm the inspector that wrote that I used the wrong method for the nonpartisan voters [ by giving them Dem ballots , instead of NP ballots ] ; I just found out that the written instructions given to us were contradictory .
One of the clerks that worked with me just dropped off the " Election Guide and Checklist " that was issued to all poll workers at the workshops provided by the County .
On page 21 it states : " Ask all nonpartisan voters if they wish to vote for candidates from either the American Independent or Democratic parties and , if so , cross out the ' NP ' , in the party column , and enter voter 's party preference . "
The very next step listed is : " Announce the party listed for the voter so that the Ballot Clerk can hear and select the correct ballot for the voter . "
That means , the County did not intend for the NP voters to receive nonpartisan ballots to take to the Dem or AI booths ; but to use either the Dem or AI ballots in the Dem or AI booths .
That is the method my poll used .
But on page 23 it states : " If a nonpartisan voter is voting for American Independent or Democrat , direct them to take their NP ballot to either the AI or Dem party booth . "
Did the County want us to give the NP voter the ballot that corresponded to the choice they made ( NP or AI or Dem ) or were they supposed to receive only the NP ballot ?
The instructions contradict themselves .
As an interested observer , it appears that volcanic activity is working its way around the “ Ring of Fire . ”
Seismic activity is also on the rise , and I believe it ’s safe to speculate that the entire area is adjusting itself to compensate for the recent changes which occurred during Indonesia ’s great quake and tsunami .
No one can predict earthquakes and volcanoes yet , however , we can identify patterns - and it seems to me one is developing .
I mentioned to my son a few days ago that I believed this was happening , and when Columbia ’s volcano erupted Thursday night , it seemed too much of a coincidence not to document and mention .
It appears to be moving in a northerly direction and I now believe we will see some serious volcanic activity in the United States .
For those who have not visited this site before , my interest was piqued when I caught CNN minimizing the danger of Yellowstone National Park , Earth 's only known active “ super volcano ” .
The ground has swelled in Yellowstone 27 centimeters in the last century .
However approximately one third of that groundswell occurred in the past three years .
CNN referred to Yellowstone as the site of an “ ancient volcano ” which was light - years from the truth , so I did an in - depth article that virtually went around the world .
CNN Oversimplifies
The Danger of Yellowstone National Park I have a firm belief when a news organization as astute as CNN purposely plays - down a story there ’s a reason , and I imagine they do n’t want to cause fear or panic if some people over - reacted to the situation , which quite frankly , there ’s absolutely nothing we can do about .
An eruption of a super volcano the size of Yellowstone is an extinction level event .
Ever since that article , I have paid particular attention to volcanic activity as it relates to this hemisphere , and if you note the locations , it is increasing in frequency as well as moving north .

LLAIMA Chile 38.692°S , 71.729 °W ; summit elev .
3125 m
SERNAGEOMIN reported that seismicity from Llaima decreased in energy , but the number of events increased during 10 - 14 January .
Based on seismic interpretation , weak explosions produced plumes of gas and ash .
On 11 January , lava flows on the W flank that were observed during an overflight were cooled and snow - covered near the crater but snow - free , and therefore still hot , about 500 m further down on the flank .
Blocks of incandescent material rolled about 1.5 km and caused steam emissions at several points where they contacted the glacier .
Ash plumes drifted NE .
Abundant cracks in glaciers to the SW of the crater were noted .
Based on observations of satellite imagery and pilot reports , the Buenos Aires VAAC reported that ash plumes rose to an altitude of 5.5 - 6.7 km ( 18,000 - 22,000 ft ) a.s.l. and drifted NE and SW on 11 and 13 January , respectively .
Geologic Summary .
Llaima , one of Chile ’s largest and most active volcanoes , contains two historically active craters , one at the summit and the other to the SE .
The massive 3,125 - m- high , glacier - covered stratovolcano has a volume of 400 cu km .
A Holocene edifice built primarily of accumulated lava flows was constructed over an 8 - km - wide caldera that formed about 13,200 years ago , following eruption of the 24 cu km Curacautín Ignimbrite .
More than 40 scoria cones dot the volcano ’s flanks .
Following the end of an explosive stage about 7,200 years ago , construction of the present edifice began , characterized by Strombolian , hawaiian , and infrequent subplinian eruptions .
Frequent moderate explosive eruptions with occasional lava flows have been recorded since the 17th century .
January 2 - 7 - 12 , 2008
NEVADO DEL HUILA Colombia 2.93°N , 76.03 °W ; summit elev .
5365 m
Based on seismic interpretation , INGEOMINAS reported ash emissions from Nevado del Huila on 2 , 7 , and 12 January .
Geologic Summary .
Nevado del Huila , the highest active volcano in Colombia , is an elongated N - S - trending volcanic chain mantled by a glacier icecap .
The andesitic - dacitic volcano was constructed within a 10 - km - wide caldera .
Volcanism at Nevado del Huila has produced six volcanic cones whose ages in general migrated from south to north .
Two glacier - free lava domes lie at the southern end of the Huila volcanic complex .
The first historical eruption from this little known volcano took place in the 16th century .
Two persistent steam columns rise from the central peak , and hot springs are also present .
January 9 - 14 , 2008
POPOCATEPETL México 19.023°N , 98.622 °W ; summit elev.
5426 m
CENAPRED reported that emissions of steam and gas from Popocatépetl were visible during 9 - 14 January .
The plumes occasionally contained slight amounts of ash during 9 - 12 January .
On 14 January , high - frequency seismic tremor was followed by an explosion that produced ash emissions and propelled fragments from the crater .

Many cultures and tribal societies have tried to develop the most effective penis enlargement solution .
Over the centuries men's tried to enlarge their penises using a woven sleeve made of plant fiber similar to a Chinese finger trap .
The penis was inserted into one end and a rock or other heavy object was hung from the other end .
As technology advanced , mechanical devices were used in an attempt to enlarge the penis .
These metal devices were cold , uncomfortable and also difficult to operate .
Their effectiveness was very questionable .
A special importance has always been placed on the male genitalia going as far back as ancient Greece .
While the ancient Greeks actually viewed smaller penises aesthetically superior to large ones , they placed great effort on insuring that their genitals remained healthy .
During this period , young men would exercise naked and would protect their genitals by stretching the prepuce over the glans and securing it to the penile base using a ribbon .
In recent years , man has incorporated his greater technical knowledge into building mechanical devices used for penis enhancement .
Modern day traction devices , instruments that force penis cells to grow by applying a continuous stretch along the length of the penis , were invented to generate a more permanent enlargement solution .
Here is some 3 images with penis enlargement devices .
The most endangered mammal in North America , the black - footed ferret , has taken off like a weed in southeastern Wyoming , US .
This unexpected success story suggests that the best conservation strategy for reintroducing the ferret – and perhaps some other endangered species – might be to release more animals and worry less about them .
“ Most managers still coddle them one by one .
I say shovel ’em out of the back of pickup trucks , ” says David McDonald , a behavioural ecologist at the University of Wyoming in Laramie , only half facetiously .
“ Some reintroductions wo n’t take , but we need to keep a mosaic of weed patches running . ”
In Wyoming ’s Shirley Basin , for example , biologists reintroduced 228 captive - bred ferrets ( Mustella nigripes ) in the early 1990s , only to watch their numbers dwindle to just five individuals by 1997 – despite intensive monitoring .
Booming population
Then , suddenly , the tide turned .
In 2003 , biologists found 52 animals and by 2006 the population numbered several hundred .

Most likely , a booming population of prairie dogs , the ferrets ’ prey , and a reduced incidence of plague and other diseases allowed the ferrets to increase – though their rapid reproductive rate took experts by surprise even so , says Martin Grenier , who manages the ferret programme for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department in Lander .
A closer analysis by Grenier , McDonald and their colleague Steven Buskirk showed that the success or failure of a ferret population hinges on the reproductive success of young animals , rather than their longevity .
That means that adverse conditions in any one year can drastically affect the size of the ferret population , and that the success of any particular reintroduction is difficult to predict or ensure .
Roll the dice
Faced with such uncertain prospects , the best strategy for conservationists may be to roll the dice as many times as they can , hoping to seed enough populations for a few to succeed .
“ Rather than spend a large amount of resources in those first couple of years after reintroduction , let ’s step back .
Put the animals on the ground , then put additional resources into more sites , ” says Grenier .
A similar strategy may prove useful for other imperilled species such as Swift foxes ( Vulpes velox ) , he notes .
Fisheries managers , too , sometimes go the cheap - and - abundant route .
In Minnesota , biologists now stock lakes with millions of three - day - old walleye larvae ( Sander vitreus vitreus ) instead of rearing the hatchlings for a year in protected basins and then stocking fewer , larger fish .
“ It ’s hugely successful , ” says Donald Pereira , a fisheries biologist with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources in St Paul .
This scattergun approach would only work for species that can be bred easily in captivity , cautions David Wilcove , a conservation biologist at Princeton University in New Jersey .
“ You would n’t try it with something like a California condor or whooping crane , because they do n’t breed that easily in captivity and you do n’t have that large a population , ” he says .
However , conservationists may be able to get away with less care in other cases .
For example , he notes , wolf biologists have sometimes coddled reintroduced animals and other times left them to fend for themselves , and both strategies have been successful .

Wow , talk about entirely crazy .
Not your post Brad , but on this person Mizgin 's post .
It is amazing to me that someone who knows nothing of journalism , source - reporter relationships , the work that goes into confirming a story , is going to give me a lecture on their blog about what I posted on my personal blog .
At the very least , Mizgin could have read the preface to the list in which I state rather clearly that I am posting information " from my own investigation . "
Apparently , I am only allowed to post what this Mizgin thinks is appropriate with regard to this case .
I know that with collecting clips of news reports all day , someone could get a bit confused about just what it is they think they know .
I would have appreciated an email from this fine mental all star if there were questions , but I do n't appreciate the lecture .
I am not going down a laundry list of what ONLY Sibel knows , because I have been for the past few years trying to understand the scope and implications of her allegations .
That is why I can add things that do not appear on Edmond 's list .
I can also subtract things , that do appear on Edmonds list from my own notes .
Why ?
Because if I cannot find a confirming source , then I am not simply going to take someone 's word for it .
Sibel has not been and obviously cannot be my source ( prison ) .
So for the last few years I have worked this story on my own trying to confirm as much as possible of what Sibel has said .
On Lantos , I simply do n't have additional confirmation .
That is not to say that I question Sibel 's allegations .
I do n't .
It is simply due diligence in terms of investigating .
On Kissinger , he does relate from his involvement with funding and supplying the extremists in Turkey ( who are still there by the way ) .
You cannot start this story at the birth of Sibel and end it with the photo gallery .
Her allegations require context to fully understand .
So I have no problem with my list .
Mizgin has shown exactly why there are so many skeptics about citizen journalism .
You can believe a source with all of your heart , but a single source without any confirming evidence , context , etc. , does not equal fact in the eyes of standard journalistic procedures .
That is why one attempts to verify as much as possible on their own if there is only a single source .
Otherwise , Mizgin , you would simply be a stenographer - and frankly , that is exactly what Mizgin is .
Sadly , Mizgin has now made this important story about herself and her fight against the big , bad , journalist - me - who has been one of the few people trying to report this story .
Really , consider the harsh criticism and tell me - any of you - if Mizgin is justified .

hmmm .
If you research Lantos you 'll easily find out tons about : Lantos & AIPAC ; Lantos & JINSA ; Lantos & WINEP ; Lantos & Armenian Genocide ; Lantos & Kurdish Issue ; and more .
Makovsky is on the list right ?
Well , it takes only 5 minutes to establish that Alan Makovsky works for Lantos directly as a congressional aid .
Did you miss that ?
How ?!
Also , there are tons of articles ( legit ones ) on Lantos in Turkish .
Mizgin can read Turkish ; so either you have to have Turkish translators working for you , or , speak Turkish to really research Lantos .
Do you ?
Here are a few links ( in English ; - ) , you can find tons ( legit / established ) on Lantos , and I can't see how that can be missed : http://www.edwinali.com/news.php?readmore=65
http://www.gmfus.org/eve...id=268&parent_type=E
http://www.jinsa.org/art...,2359,2166,147,1723,3116
Then you should oppose Makovsky & Sayari !!!
Considering both are paid ( officially ) by Lantos ' office as ' aid & advisor . '
Facts are facts .
Whether someone is a Democrat , or , a holocaust survivor , should not taint it !
That 's all .

The only thing the pictures that Sibel has posted tell me , as a reader , is that these are the American officials she heard referenced in FBI wiretaps by Turkish officials and / or spies .
No confirming source is needed .
We are talking about people referenced on a wiretap .
Furthermore , there is a feeling amongst those of us who follow the case that many of the ' liberal ' bloggers simply do n't want to cover this issue properly because it reflects badly on Democrats as well as Republicans .
I 'll name other names of journalists either misreporting or not reporting on the Edmonds case : Steve Clemons , Jane Hamsher , Josh Marshall .
This is an explosive story , now given important backing by a major foreign newspaper : U.S. officials taking cash for passing nuclear secrets .
While our own government refuses to prosecute said officials , it tells us , the American people , that we must sacrifice our civil liberties in order to be kept safe from nuclear terrorism .
What is there about this story NOT worth covering from a liberal perspective ?
The minute we become partisan in our analysis of such disgusting public corruption , we lose all ability to become faithful guardians of the public trust .
We become Democratic Party shills , little better than the right - wing shills we all decry .
Grossman is a Clinton appointee .
Lantos is a Democrat .
Solarz is a Democrat .
Get over it .
There are serious allegations against these people levied by an open , credible source .
All of them need to be investigated by the alternative press because the government and the major media have given them a pass .
If the allegations not true , let them be exonerated .
If they are true , they need to be exposed and - at minimum - their lucrative consultancies ruined .
At a maximum , they should be incarcerated for a very long time .

Re Larisa Comment # 1 . Mizgin is entirely correct .
If Larisa had created HER OWN unique list , rather than plagiarizing Sibel Edmonds ' list , then she could make whatever changes she likes .
But to both plagiarize the list , and then blast Mizgin for knowing " nothing of journalism " is absurd .
Since when is plagiarism considered " good journalism " .
Larisa - come off it - do your own work and then you can take credit for it , and change it if you like .
Until then , back off and stop trying to corrupt something you have no real knowledge of .
Sibel Edmonds knows what she knows - you do n't .

Miguel , I both covered this on my blog and had it posted on Raw Story .
I listed all the names , but one - the one I could not find any allegation for .
I have listed Marc Grossman , which should put the story of me scrubbing the list of Jews or Democrats to rest .
I am hardly part of this group of people you list and if you actually believe that , then it is unfortunate for all of us , because if those of us on the same side are going to attack one another , we wo n't accomplish much .
Frankly , it is precisely this kind of garbage that makes me disinterested in doing any more work on this story .
Instead of thanks , I get called everything from a spy ( go read the psycho blogs ) to protecting Democrats .
We do n't need the criminal element to discredit this story .
This nonsense will accomplish it all on its own .
And yes , I too share your frustration that the left leaning blogs did not cover this .
I even wrote about that too .
I expect this bullshit smear from the people we are exposing , not from the people on the same side as me .
How sad it is that you and your friends ( I read your posts at those other blogs ) I once considered on the same side as me .

Okay one more post and then I am done .
I am now being accused of plagarism ?
Were gray wolves on Sibel 's list ?
King Faisal ?
Kadi ?
Just curious ?
I added Lantos to the list when I saw her gallery , but then thought it was a mistake , given that I did not have anything on him .
That is why I removed him .
So let me see here : According to Mizgin , I am " working for someone . "
I assume she means Mossad .
According M , above , I am scrubbing the list of Holocaust survivors and to Miguel , of Democrats .
Now Jefferson is claiming that I am now guilty of plagiarism .
My god , is this who Sibel has as her activists ?
You should be ashamed of your selves for this nonsense .

... ME said on 1/8/2008 @ 11:17 am PT ...
Okay , here is a post from someone who has done his homework - journalistic : [ Lantos is mainly known for his exceptionally close ties with Israel , but he does have some Turkish connections .
In November 2001 , he was one of the signers of a letter to President Bush supporting Turkey , and in February 2002 he co-sponsored a bill praising Turkey for its roll in the war on terror .
Lantos also received an award at some point from the American Turkish Council .
According to a Wayne Madsen item of a couple of years back , " Past recipients of ATC awards are a ' Who 's Who ' of the neo-cons , neo-libs , and their supporters of which Washington , DC is teeming with infestation : Richard Perle , Paul Wolfowitz , Dick Cheney , Richard Holbrooke , Al Haig , Eric Edelman , Newt Gingrich , William Perry , William Cohen , Tom Lantos , and Marc Grossman .
Another award recipient was Princeton Professor Bernard Lewis ( who once compared Iraqi con artist Ahmad Chalabi to Kemal Ataturk ) . " ]
Now add to that : Makovsky works directly for Lantos .
Sayari is Lantos ' advisor .
ATC is a conformed target of the FBI operations ... And , Lantos is on the gallery ( appropriately ) .
Why these facts ( all legit public record ) were not mentioned before removing Lantos ??!!
That 's the question .
And it has n't been answered .

On the topic at hand here , when I mentioned Lantos as one of those being pointed to here , an Armenian friend of mine , who keeps heavy track of issues like the Armenian genocide , etc. responded to that news by saying something like " Well that 's why he changed his position on the genocide resolution . "
So it might be good to study that angle to see if it fits in with the Hastert Vanity Fair piece more .
Perhaps not as much the nuclear black market parts .
Its also interesrting that BOTH he and Hastert have left the congress .
Brad , I did catch the tail end of the I.N.N. World Report Interview with you on Free Speech TV a few minutes ago on this topic , so even though the MSM of this country is n't covering it , at least we have some other independent video newscasts covering it here .
I set my PVR to record a later chunk of it today .

Re Larisa 's comment # 9 : Come on Larisa - now you 're going to " take your ball and go home " ?
- you started this , so take a little constructive criticism in stride - And - the definition of plagiarism as defined in Webster 's " The act of plagiarizing ; taking someone 's words or ideas as if they were your own . "
Seems to fit .
I repeat , the list taken from Sibel Edmonds ' justacitizen website is her list , not your list - so I think it is you who should be ashamed of yourself here ;
A little apology from you would go a long way toward putting this to rest - and show that you are not above admitting when you have made a mistake .

I do n't understand the big deal about Larisa A. removing Lantos ' name from her list because she has no proof of his involvement in the case according to her investigation .
She says Edmonds has Lantos ' picture posted which is her way , in avoiding violation of the states secrets laws , that she implicates him .
But how ?
I do n't see anyone actually saying , for ex , that " Lantos was paid X dollars for Y at such and such a place at such and such a time . "
So if you do n't know then how can you get upset if Alexandrovna does n't know ?
Are any of you posting at sites where no one is writing anything about Edmonds ' revelations ?
Maybe that would do more for the story than carping about a reporter who wo n't misreport a name for which she has no proof .

Re : Edmonds vs. Alexandrovna vs. Mizgin , et. al .
From my reading on this , it seems that many are missing the point of what has actually been said .
Edmonds states that what she has revealed was based on her own observations and recollections and rely on no outside facts or opinions .
Alexandrovna , independently of information from Edmonds , researched the facts and reported her conclusions based entirely on her own research using sources completely independent of Edmonds .
If their statements are accurate , in reality it strengthens both of their arguments , since two completely separate researchers / witnesses came to nearly identical conclusions .
If Edmonds alone were to state her evidence , it would be easier to refute since it is likely very hard for her to provide proof of her allegations .
Their slightly different positions are no different than if two different people were reporting independently on the same painting in a gallery - that they describe virtually the same scene is less important than minor differences between their accounts .

The reason I am disturbed by Larisa 's attempt to modify Sibel Edmonds ' list is just that it is Sibel Edmonds ' list , and by creating it she is telling us something that we should pay attention to - about EVERYONE on the list .
It is certainly proper for any of us , including Larisa , to discuss each and every one - to research and find whatever we can - perhaps then we 'll discover on our own their significance .
But one thing we cannot do because we do not know - we cannot take it upon ourselves to try to judge whether anyone on the list should be there or not , or whether anyone else should be there .
Sibel Edmonds , and she alone knows why they are there .
I do n't know , you do n't know , Larisa does n't know .

Interesting .
Sad , but interesting ( Me=Mizgin ? ) .
Yesterday on her own blog , Larissa chastised an individual for using the word " Zionist " to describe Dov Zakheim , a person who describes himself as a " Zionist . "
Fully half of the people of Sibel 's list are Zionists , whether Jewish , Christian or Atheist .
She went on to claim that any use of that term implies " Jew " ( a false claim ) , AND FURTHER , stated that she has completely sworn off use of the word Zionist , and essentially let everyone know not to mention that word on her blog - implying that its mere use is somehow anti-Semitic .
When viewed in the light of this entire conspiracy , and her unilateral decision to remove Lantos from the list , one must ask what agenda Larisa is pursuing that would benefit by removing the term " Zionism " from the entire story .
Anyone who fails to put Zionism at the very center of this conspiracy does so purposefully , particularly in light of the use of the word repeatedly in the PNAC document .
Prior to the popularization of the replacement term " Neocon , " - The Zionist Organization of America proudly led its efforts with the use of this word to define its agenda - the creation of Eretz Israel - the project which proceeds apace .
Beware of " thought police " who would compel you to change the English language to conceal the guilt of those they might prefer to protect from scrutiny .
You ant Lantos off the list ?
I say let 's focus twice as hard on Lantos if only for your desire to shine the light away from him .
Truthseekers do n't take search terms off the table - or admonish others to do so .
Beware the hidden agendas of those who doth protest too much .

I do n't recall seeing anywhere that Larisa 's list is based on anyone else 's list , only on her own research .
I also do n't recall anyone saying that because a name appears on one list it must appear on all lists .
As I stated above , from my brief research , each list was created independently based upon only what each individual was willing to stake their reputations on as being the truth .
If Larisa cannot say personally that the evidence she posseses says that a given person is involved , she is completely correct to withhold that name from her list .
Further research may provide more evidence in the future , but she has published her list now .
Likewise , if Sibel cannot positively confirm the identities of every person or know for certainty that they were involved , she is completely correct to put only a question mark in place of their photograph .
Everyone absolutely should form their own conclusions based on their own research and the evidence they find , and to weigh each piece of data on it's own merits .
I 'm sure that each would gladly modify their list to include anyone that could be positively and independently verified to be involved within their own personal level of confidence .

SOCIAL ENGINEERING :
While social engineering can be carried out by any organization - whether large or small , public or private - the most comprehensive ( and often the most effective ) campaigns of social engineering are those initiated by powerful central governments .
Extremely intensive social engineering campaigns occurred in countries with authoritarian governments .
In the 1920s , the revolutionary government of the Soviet Union embarked on a campaign to fundamentally alter the behavior and ideals of Soviet citizens , to replace the old social frameworks of Tsarist Russia with a new Soviet culture , to create the New Soviet man .
The Soviets used newspapers , books , film , mass relocations , and even architectural design tactics to serve as " social condenser " and change personal values and private relationships .
Similar examples are the Chinese " Great Leap Forward " and " Cultural Revolution " program and the Khmer Rouge 's plan of deurbanization of Cambodia .
Non-authoritarian regimes tend to rely on more sustained social engineering campaigns that create more gradual , but ultimately as far - reaching , change .
Examples include the " War on Drugs " in the United States , the increasing reach of intellectual property rights and copyright , and the promotion of elections as a political tool .
The campaign for promoting elections , which is by far the most successful of the three examples , has been in place for over two centuries .
Social theorists of the Frankfurt School in Weimar Germany like Theodor Adorno had also observed the new phenomenon of mass culture and commented on its new manipulative power , when the rise of the Nazis drove them out of the country around 1930 ( many of them became connected with the Institute for Social Research in the United States ) .
The Nazis themselves were no strangers to the idea of influencing political attitudes and re-defining personal relationships .
The Nazi propaganda machine under Joseph Goebbels was a synchronized , sophisticated and effective tool for creating public opinion .
http://en.wikipedia.org/..._%28political_science%29
A number of techniques which are based on social psychological research are used to generate propaganda .
Many of these same techniques can be found under logical fallacies , since propagandists use arguments that , while sometimes convincing , are not necessarily valid .
A few examples are : Flag - waving , Glittering generalities , Intentional vagueness , Oversimplification , Rationalization , Red herring , Slogans , Stereotyping , Testimonial , Unstated assumption .
In the West , the term propaganda now overlaps with distinct terms like indoctrination ( ideological views established by repetition rather than verification ) and mass suggestion ( broader strategic methods ) .
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda
As the 1983 American Heritage Dictionary noted , fascism is : " A system of government that exercises a dictatorship of the extreme right , typically through the merging of state and business leadership , together with belligerent nationalism . "
( The US dictionary definition has gotten somewhat squishier since then , as all the larger dictionary companies have been bought up by multinational corporations . )
Mussolini was quite straightforward about all this .
In a 1923 pamphlet titled " The Doctrine of Fascism " he wrote , " If classical liberalism spells individualism , Fascism spells government . "
But not a government of , by , and for We The People - instead , it would be a government of , by , and for the most powerful corporate interests in the nation .
The BANKSTERS control the media .

Okay , can we please keep the Zionist bullshit out of comments at my site .
Most of the people named are not Jewish or Zionists .
Fascism is not Zionism , although some Zionists have become fascists .
The point is , I find it offensive that the term Zionism is being used as though Jews are behind everything .
Not specifically your comment , but just what I see all the time now .
I am a Jew , my family are Jews .
If there was a big ass conspiracy , then why the hell were we not invited to the secret meetings ?
Do me a favor , respect my wishes and do n't post those kind of remarks .
Posted by : anonymous | January 07 , 2008 at 08:22 AM
AND THIS : Larissa said : " I find it offensive that the term Zionism is being used as though Jews are behind everything . "
Who said that ?
You said that ?
Zionism and Judaism are completely unrelated .
One is a religion that you practice - and is often misused to define a race of people .
Israel is a country , not a religion .
A true search for the truth would allow all words to be used in a key word search , no ?
RESPONSE FROM LARISA ALEXANDROVNA
I know the difference between them .
The problem is , that most people do n't .
The other issue is that you post implied something with regard to Dov Z , Zionism , and 9/11 .
Do you see his name on the Sibel list ?
If I misunderstood you , then I apologize .
But given the abuse of the term by those seeking to attack Jews , I have grown entirely opposed to using that term and frankly , it has nothing to do with the topic at hand .

Of course Brad , by all means , let 's all eliminate the word Zionism from our vocabulary as Larissa demands .
That will solve everything and lead straight to the truth .
Her attack was completely disproportionate , and exceptionally revealing .
1984 has arrived .
FYI : Dov Zakheim was the Comptroller under Rumsfeld when trillions of dollars went missing .
A key word search for " Dov Zakheim " +
Zionist returns 9,100 results .
You think trillions of dollars has nothing to do with this conspiracy ?
Over half of the people on Sibel 's list could be defined as such in some form - regardless of religious affiliation .
I focus on it because the MSM refuses to - and unlike many , I actually want to know the ENTIRE truth .
Remember free speech ?

Larissa added Kissinger to Sibel 's list , with the following justification : " On Kissinger , he does relate from his involvement with funding and supplying the extremists in Turkey ( who are still there by the way ) .
You cannot start this story at the birth of Sibel and end it with the photo gallery .
Her allegations require context to fully understand . "
Dov Zakheim was added to the list , defining him accurately as a Zionist , as he defines himself , based on his upbringing .
Study the Wikipedia PNAC page and cross-reference it to Sibel 's list , then tell me why we should ignore Dov Zakheim .

Funny .
There 's even a black out at daily kos on this story .
In fact , yesterday someone diaried about this , and the diary made the front page and was accumulating many comments .
I checked back five minutes later and the diary had mysteriously been pulled . . . not only from the front page , but also from the list of " recent diaries . "
I was wondering who made the decision on Kos to pull the diary and WHY it was made .
Such actions go along way toward cementing my perception that that site has been wholly co-opted by the Demcoratic Party / ruling class establishment .

To Ms. Larisa Alexandrovna , i would personally like to thank you for your investigative reporting and work at Rawstory.com .
If this post is the bit least effective , i will calm the tensions seething off some of these personal attacks on your work .
As an artist i have the ability to step back , look at things from different angles and see different colors .
i understand how it could be emotionally upsetting to pour your life blood into your work because you are driven for the truth only to receive harsh critisms from people who do not fully understand all the facts at hand .
The efforts and conviction required to get leads , check facts , and properly investigate a story to accurately get the truth out is how a reporter earns their integrity .
The stakes are higher on this one .
The use of racism and stereotypes to incorporate someone 's hatred of a race and attribute it to defining the facts of a situation is how many humans think .
i am not trying to explain life to you because you are sharp as shit .
All i am trying to do here is pass on a little information in light of the fact that you have made outstanding contributions in a modern media world devoid of journalistic integrity .
Please do not give up now .
Fcking racists that only know how to hate is how they get on .
This story is big .
It 's the story that can imprison the treasonous bush / cheney government and their accomplices .
You stated your reasons for your revised list so ignore redudant critism and thicken your skin a little because we need people like you .
The focus needs to be on taking these corrupt lying bastards down and saving our country .
The manipulative people in the bush / cheney crime family are men , women , black , white , hebrew , democrat , republican and ALL are supported by the U.S. corporate mass media .
All are care - less lying 1 % er criminals that have done immeasurable damage and need to be removed from power immediately .

Open letter to the news networks of America ;
To the news networks of America and the citizens of the United States who work for them .
Jan 2008 Dear Sirs , I recently read a front page article in the respected London Sunday Times entitled , “ For sale : - West ’s deadly nuclear secrets . ” dated January 6th 2008 .
The information contained therein is shocking and has grave implications for the security and future of our nation .
The article tells of a US citizen and former FBI employee who is in possession of hard evidence proving high level treachery involving senior officials within our own government .
The Sunday Times reports that Sibel Edmonds , who worked for the FBI as a language translator and was fired after repeatedly attempting to bring these issues to the attention of her superiors , alleges specifically : - 1 - That high level officials some of whom are still in office , in the State department , the Pentagon and the Nuclear weapons establishment , conspired to provide foreign governments with highly classified information including US Nuclear weapons technology , some of which may now be in the hands of America ’s enemies including incredulously , Al - Quaida .
2 - That senior figures within our own government had prior knowledge of the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 .
3 - That high level individuals within the current US administration have been actively working to block investigation into these issues and to protect those guilty of treason .
Given the obvious serious nature of these issues , I find it incredulous that not a single US news network has to date covered or even attempted to investigate this story .
This brave woman and patriot , has risked her own career and personal safety to tell of these crimes that are still ongoing , and has repeatedly approached US networks to cover the story only to be ignored and forced to tell her story outside the United States .
This serves to demonstrate the shocking dishonesty of the US media as a whole , and questions by extension the professionalism , patriotism , and integrity of those individuals who work within it .
One of the most essential elements of any democracy is a free press , one that is free from governmental control and represents the true interests of its people , the fact US networks are not covering this story highlights a high level of corruption within the media which is directly undermining democracy , and compromising the security of our great nation .
I call on every single American in the media industry in the United States , whether you are owners , editors , media personalities , news anchors , managers , journalists , reporters , cooks and bottle washers included , to think very carefully about these issues and your actions , and that of the industry you work for .
For to look the other way when our nation is being threatened as it clearly is , is not in the American tradition and is the action not of a patriot , but that of a coward and a traitor , .
I know it will not be easy for you and I hope at least some of you will do the right thing and stand up to the forces that threaten our country as countless brave Americans like Ms Edmonds have done throughout our history .
You alone have the power to expose these crimes and this you must do .
To fail in your duty is to fail the American people and be guilty by association of treason , this consequently , has dire implications for the future of America and for that of the whole world .

Hey all .
I am a novice when it comes to activism but after reading these kinds of stories for the last few years I am literally getting sick to my stomach , anxious about what is in store for us Americans .
The least you can do is write a letter to Conyers or your congressman .
i include the letter i just sent to him as an example .
while by no means eloquent , it should be enough .
please consider writing .
his email address is :
John.Conyers@mail.house.gov
Good luck .
" Dear Congressman ,
I am writing to you to implore you to finally open hearings into the case of
Sibel Edmonds .
I am sure you remember this name since the public has been requesting hearings into
her case for the past 5 years .
In case you have forgotten , she is the FBI translator who , after 9/11 , came forward with information about corruption within the government and outright obstruction of investigations into the perpetrators of 9/11 .
She is now under a ridiculous ' gag order ' for ' state secrets ' ; this , for information that she already gave to the congress in prior 9/11 hearings .
She is now speaking out and claiming that certain higher ups in the Defense Department and other departments have essentially been blackmailing some employees as well as possibly some members of congress to keep them from investigating this further .
In the name of protecting the values that America stands for I believe it is important for her information to be heard and acted on , even if that means criminal charges for some present members of congress or the administration .
This Youtube link might refresh your memory if the case does not sound familiar : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjxmIfkG-3c
As a second issue , I am sure you are aware of Congressman Wexler 's attempts to bring impeachment charges against Vice President Cheney ( at least ) .
While Nancy Pelosi might think this should be ' off the table , ' I can assure you , there are a myriad of citizens who do not agree .
The mere suggestion that those in the administration might have acted in ways incompatible with our constitution requires and investigation .
I believe the many actions of this administration would be enough to warrant proceedings .
Not having impeachment hearings for some sort of political expediency is a slap in the face to the constitution and to the American people .
Whatever a few Congressmen might be being blackmailed with is nothing compared to the fundamental disregard for the law of the land spelled out in the Constitution .
I thank you for reading this and ask that you please act quickly .
Respectfully , Concerned Citizen . "

Failure to Cover Vital Issues Highlights Widespread US Media Corruption .
By JWTruther
Jan 9th 2008
If there is anything positive to come out of the failure ( up to now ) of US media networks to cover the Sibel Edmonds story , it is that the issue has been a ‘ litmus test ’ and has highlighted what some of us have known for a long time , that the mainstream media news networks of North America are wholly and absolutely corrupt .
Of this there can now be not one shred of doubt , the story first printed in the London Sunday Times , of ongoing high level treachery within the United States government , has been covered all across the globe including in Pakistan and Israel , almost everywhere it seems apart from where it ’s most important , where this clearly ‘ infected ’ government actually governs , in the United States itself .
This is unarguable proof , if anyone needed it , that the MSM is not working in the public interest , in fact it is in reality actively working against it .
It is deliberately preventing vital information regarding the security of the nation from reaching the American people , and preventing criminal activity within our own government from being exposed .
No matter which side of the political divide one falls , this fact can no longer be questioned .
Evidently then , the MSM can no longer be relied upon for impartial reporting and this example may lead to more and more people discovering this .
The Sibel Edmonds story has shown us the extent to which the government can control the MSM and prevent them from telling the truth regarding it 's crimes .
Is also raises the obvious question , what else are n’t they telling us ?
One group of activists have been consistently warning of government sponsored crimes being covered up by the MSM for several years .
They have been criticized and dismissed by the MSM as among other things “ Dangerous , crazy conspiracy theorists ” and even “ Holocaust denying terrorists ” .
The 9/11 truth movement is a growing global community of ordinary people from all walks of life , who believe the US government aided by a compliant media is hiding the truth about the attacks of September 11th 2001 , and that up to now , there has been no credible investigation of these events .
They have long complained of unfair representation in the press and in light of these revelations , may now be entitled to feel some vindication .
Although the issues are related , and this may become more apparent later on , the message they carry may be even more potentially catastrophic to certain senior figures within the government than that of Ms Edmonds .
In light of these facts , clearly it ’s time to take another look at 9/11 truth .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - A virulent anti-smoker in Germany was so angry when his girlfriend lit up he emptied a fire extinguisher to put out the cigarette , caking her and their apartment in powder .
“ My colleagues said it looked like a bomb had gone off in there , ” said a spokesman for police in the western city of Bielefeld .
“ He managed to put the cigarette out though . ”
After the woman ignored his request not to smoke , the 42 - year - old sprayed the contents of the extinguisher all around the flat shouting abuse , police said .
“ He said he was n’t bothered by the damage it caused , ” the spokesman said .
“ And that he ’s through with his girlfriend . ”
Credit Card Companies Want to Eat You Alive !
In September my husband and I transferred all of our remaining credit card debt to the Citi Home Rebate card .
The card had no annual fee , no balance transfer fee , and a 0 % intro APR for 12 months … enough time for us to pay off our card .
I faithfully made payments above and beyond the minimum due .
September … October …and in November I switched over to paperless billing .
Toward the end of the month I noticed that I had n’t received a statement in my email box .
Normally I would have had the paper statement by then , so I checked the due date online and made a payment .
That was November 21 .
I received the email statement in my inbox a few days later .
I double checked online to make sure everything was hunky dory , and I went on my way .
At the end of December I received notice of another statement .
I let it sit in my inbox for a couple of days , because I was busy with the holidays .
Two days later I received a notice that my balance had gone UP by around $ 100 .
THAT got my attention !
I logged into my Citi account and saw that I had been hit with a late fee , AND my interest rate had gone up !
I looked all over the site for a customer service number and could n’t find one .
So I went into the depths of my freezer to unfreeze my credit card .
Credit card in hand , I dialed the customer service number .
The man who answered the phone seemed nice enough .
I sweetly explained that I had made a payment every month , and I did n’t understand why I was hit with a late fee .
He explained that I had paid my bill too early in November .
I ( getting less sweet by the moment ) explained that things got messed up when I went to paperless billing , and that I had made November ’s payment specifically to avoid a late fee .
The man replied that he would do me a “ courtesy ” of dropping the late fee .
I think my jaw dropped .
He was doing me the courtesy of dropping the late fee , even though my payment was n’t late ?
I could n’t wait to hear his answer to my next question .
Are you going to set my interest rate back to 0 % ?
His reply : “ I ’m not sure if that ’s possible , ma’am . ”
Me : “ So , let me get this straight … I switch to paperless billing on YOUR site .
I do n’t receive my statement on time , so I take the preemptive measure of paying my bill to avoid a late fee .
It ends up being a couple of days early , so it does n’t count , and now I lose my interest rate , because I ’m a good customer ? ”
The guy ( stutters a bit ) “ Let me see what I can do . ”
After much more haggling back and forth , and a lot more of the guy trying to convince me that I was wrong , he agreed to lower the interest rate .
End of conversation …. so I thought .
Two days later , I was blissfully taking a Sunday afternoon nap , when my husband received a phone call .
You ’ll never guess who it was .
You guessed Citibank ’s automated calling system ?
You ’d be right .
The automated system informed my husband that we were late in making a payment and asked if he ’d like to pay now , or whether he ’d like to talk to a customer service representative .
He pressed the number 3 for customer service .
You ’ll never guess what the automated machine told him next .
Are you ready for this ?
We ’re sorry , but there are no customer service representatives available today .
Please call back during regular business hours .
I woke up from my nap to the sound of my husband yelling at the phone .
That ’s not a pleasant way to wake up .
Monday I called Citibank again , just to make sure things were OK .
This time I got a very nice woman .
I explained ( again ) the whole story and asked her to please make sure that our account was listed as current , that our late fee was waived , and that our interest rate was set back to zero .
She pulled up our record and said she could see the account was set back to zero percent , but she was n’t sure if she ’d be able to waive the late fee .
What ?
Did n’t the guy I talked to a few nights before say that the late fee would n’t be a problem , but the interest rate might be ?
At this point I ’m really beginning to doubt whether these people know what they are talking about .
The conversation ended with the woman assuring me that my account was current , my interest rate was 0 % , and the late fee was waived .
But she told me to double check my next statement just to be sure .
Very reassuring .
So now I ’m waiting until the middle of the month to make sure everything is taken care of .
Pray for me .
I may need it .
To recap :
I faithfully make payments to my credit card every month …. payments that are larger than the minimum due .
I switch to paperless billing .
My statement is running late .
I make my usual payment to avoid a late fee .
The payment ends up being 5 days early , because my due date apparently moved .
I get hit with a late fee and an increased interest rate .
The first guy I talk to sets my account current , says waiving the late fee will be no problem , but that resetting the interest rate to zero might be a problem .
He eventually says the interest rate is reset .
Two days later we get an automated call , telling us our account is past due .
I talk to a live operator the next day , who tells me that setting the interest rate back to zero is n’t a problem , but waiving the late fee might be a problem .
She eventually tells me it ’s all taken care of .
But she ’s not completely sure , so I need to make sure to double check my next statement .
Does this sound ridiculous to anyone besides me ?
Make no mistake .
Credit card companies want to suck you dry .
Check your statements , check them often , and follow up quickly when you notice something is wrong .
And get out of debt !
------------------------------Black Box Voting : Latest Investigations from Black Box Voting : 1-17-08 : Ballot boxes found slit ; NH stops putting ballots in vault ;------------------------------------------------------------Posted by Bev Harris on Thursday , January 17 , 2008 - 10:48 pm:
No worries , say New Hampshire officials when cuts up to eight incheslong are spotted in newly delivered ballot boxes .
" The only seal thatcounts is the one on top .
" Except the seal on top can be peeled off without leaving a trace , thenreaffixed .
Black Box Voting has been doing a chain of custody exam for the New Hampshire Primary 's recount .
On Wednesday night , Election DefenseAlliance 's Sally Castleman mentioned a troubling observation : Afterfollowing the ballots back to the ballot vault following Wednesday ' srecount , she had the opportunity to enter the ballot vault , andnoticed what looked like cuts , or slits , in the side of many ballotboxes .
New Hampshire officials assured us that these cuts , which slicethrough the tape , seals and box itself do not permit access to theuncounted ballots , pointing to a label on the boxtop which they call aseal .
But the " seal " can be removed , like a Post - it , and reaffixed .
So it 's not a seal all !
We wanted to know if the ballot boxes were slit while in the vault , inthe transport van , or came from the towns with slits in them .
I confirmed this morning that many if not most of the boxes scheduledto be counted today had slits in them .
I went out when a vanload ofballots arrived , and saw that they were slit at the time they arrivedby van .
Susan Pynchon and I drove to two nearby towns and watched asthey handed over their ballot boxes to " Butch and Hoppy " , the two menwho drive around in the state in a van picking the ballots up .
Weobserved as they loaded boxes of ballots into the van with no slits atall in them .
We videotaped each of these up close .
They arrived at thedestination without slits .
The label on the top was affixed , but insome cases was crumpled , or also damaged .
Of cource , the label affixed to the top can be removed and reattachedwithout telltale signs .
No vault tonightA significant departure from the normal chain of custody path occurredtonight .
They decided not to use the vault to store the ballots .
More tomorrow .------------------------------------------------------------Use this link to go directly to full article :

Web2.0の先にあるC10K問題
個々のクライアントがサーバに要求する処理量は小さなものでハードウェアの性能上は問題がなくても、あまりにもクライアントの数が多くなるとサーバがパンクする――。これが最近Web開発者の間で話題となっている「C10K問題」（クライアント1万台問題）だ。
プロセス番号が足りなくなる
パンクするのは例えばプロセス番号だ。
Ajaxの実装として最近注目されている技術に“ Comet ” （コメット）と呼ばれるものがある。HTTPのセッションをあえて切断せずに、サーバとクライアント間でつなぎっぱなしにするテクニックだ。Cometを使えばクライアントからのリクエストに応えるだけでなく、サーバ側からも不定期に情報を送り出すことができる。例えば、Web上でチャットサービスを実装するには、通常はクライアント側からサーバに一定間隔でポーリングすることで、ほかのユーザーの発言分をサーバから取得して表示するが、Cometのモデルを使えば、誰かが発言したとたん、サーバ側からすべてのクライアントに差分の発言テキストを送信できる。
Comet とAjaxを組み合わせることで、きわめてリアルタイム性の高いWebアプリケーションを作成できる。チャットサービスの「Lingr」、Wikiのように編集できてリアルタイムに編集内容が変化する付箋紙サービス「 Wema3 」 、Web上のホワイトボード共有サービス「 Thinkature 」などは、すべ てCometを使ったサービスだ。
Lingrのような軽いサービスでネックとなるのはプロセッサパワーでもストレージのI/O速度でもネットワーク帯域でもない。同時接続ユーザー数が万のオーダーに達したとき、現在のOSやサーバのプログラミングモデルが現実に合わなくなってくることだ。
LinuxなどUNIX系のOS では、メモリ上で実行中のプログラムに与えられるプロセス番号は符号付き16ビット整数だ。つまり、デーモン（サーバプロセス）も含め、すべての実行中のプロセスには1〜32767までのユニークな番号が与えられていることになる。ところが、HTTPサーバのApacheなどはクライアント1台からのリクエストに対して1つのプロセスを生成するため、必然的に同時接続数は3万クライアント程度が上限となる。IRCのように参加者が能動的に発言するとは限らず、時間があるときや必要なときにだけ発言するような利用法であれば、ハードウェア性能的にもネットワーク性能的にも1台のサーバで10万クライアントを扱うことができても、プロセス番号が足りないという理由でこのモデルは破綻する。
このように、1万クライアントには対応できても10万クライアントには対応できないという状況が「C10K問題」だ。Cはクライアント、10Kは1万を示す。
1スレッドで多数のクライアントに応える
1クライアントに1プロセスというモデルは、軽い処理をこなすには、いかにも無駄が多い。では、マルチスレッドにして1スレッドに1クライアントを割り当てればいいかというと、それでもまだ別の問題がある。多くのOSでは、万単位のスレッド生成ということを前提として設計されていない。例えば、特別な設定をしていないLinuxでは、1スレッド当たりデフォルトで2MB程度のスタックメモリを割り当てる。1万クライアント＝1万スレッドであれば20GBのメモリが必要になる。これでは、仮想メモリを使うとしてもパンクしてしまう。
もちろん、64bit対応のLinuxを使って力技で解決してもいい。プロセス番号不足も、仮想化技術を使って1台の物理サーバ上に仮想サーバをパラレルに走らせれば、ある程度はスケールアウトが可能だろう。しかし、C10K問題の本質は、やはりOSやサーバプロセスの設計が、Web2.0的なサービスに不向きになってきていることにある。最新のLinuxでは3万2000個を超えるスレッドを扱ったり、スレッドごとに消費するスタックの量を減らすことも、カーネルパラメータの設定で可能だが、まだ標準的といえるほど普及したテクニックではない。
進むノウハウの蓄積と開発環境の整備
C10K 問題が及ぶ範囲は広い。すでに書いたようにサーバ側ではOSのスレッドやサーバの設計モデルがネックとなっている。膨大な数の「軽い処理」を要求してくるクライアント1万台環境では、細かなI/Oが多数発生するため、I/O関連のライブラリの整備も始まっている。現在、一部の先進的な開発者が試行錯誤しながら個別に実装しているCometについても、HTTPサーバでの対応やライブラリの整備が望まれる。実際、その名もずばり「Cometd」というプロジェクトなどが始まっている。
クライアントについても、同時接続セッション数の上限が比較的小さな数値に設定されていることも、いずれ問題となってくるかもしれない。例えばタブブラウザを使って多数のチャットルームに同時にログインしたとき、今のところ何が起こるかよく分からない。特定の実装に対する個別の組み合わせの検証はできるが、一般論としての挙動は、あまり前例がなく予測不能だ。
Ajax普及が本格化してきたのが、ノウハウの蓄積や開発環境の整備が一巡したからだとすると、Cometのようにクライアント1万台（あるいは1万セッション）を扱うC10K時代のWebアプリケーションの時代の幕開けも、もうすぐそこまで来ているのかもしれない。

THE dollar used to be the universal tourist currency , accepted almost anywhere , from the streets of Hanoi to the plains of Africa .
But the continued slide of the dollar against other currencies has led the greenback to be shunned in unexpected places , creating new problems for American travelers and pushing prices higher .
The Taj Mahal has stopped accepting dollars for the entrance fee , under a new edict from the Indian Ministry of Culture that also affects other national tourist sites like the 13th - century minaret known as the Qutb Minar and Humayun ’s Tomb in Delhi .
As a result , for entrance to the Taj Mahal , Americans must now pay 750 rupees , about $ 19 , at the rate of 39 rupees to the dollar , compared with $ 15 previously .
Some tour operators say they have encountered newfound resistance to dollars in parts of Vietnam and Peru , especially in villages that are off the beaten path .
“ It used to be a $ 100 bill was universal everywhere , from Moscow to Mozambique , ” said Peter Rudy , the North America director for KE Adventure Travel , a Denver - based outfit that books adventure trips throughout the world .
“ It ’s not now . ”
Al Gore , who lost to George W. Bush in the 2000 presidential election , is becoming a key potential power broker in the increasingly bitter battle between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama to win the Democrat nomination .
Gore emerged yesterday as a possible mediator who could negotiate a resolution if the primary campaign ends in a stalemate and has to be decided by the party convention , where divisions are likely to run deep .
The former vice - president , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his environmental campaign , is among a number of party ' elders ' who plan to remain neutral in order to keep such an option open , the New York Times reported yesterday .
They are increasingly concerned that the momentum built up by Clinton and Obama 's enthralling race could be squandered if neither lands a knockout blow and the nomination is decided at the convention by an elite of 796 Democratic ' super - delegates ' .
A perception that a backroom deal had ignored the wishes of millions of voters could be a gift to the Republicans , who have already in effect settled on John McCain as their candidate .
Nancy Pelosi , the House Speaker , and three candidates who have dropped out of the contest - former senator John Edwards and senators Chris Dodd and Joe Biden - have spoken to Gore recently .
None has declared allegiance , although Gore is said to have been wooed by supporters of both Clinton and Obama .
Gore 's possible role is especially intriguing because of his complicated history with the Clintons .
Some of his allies accused Bill Clinton of concentrating more on his wife 's run for the Senate in 2000 than on Gore 's bid for the presidency .
In turn , Bill Clinton felt snubbed when Gore did not call on his famed campaigning abilities in the final weeks of the battle with Bush .
Already the arguments over process have begun .
Trailing for the first time after successive defeats in eight states since Super Tuesday , Hillary Clinton has renewed her call for the result of last month 's Florida primary to count in the final reckoning .
If she gets her way , it could yet push her back to pole position , assuming the contests in Texas , Ohio and Pennsylvania fall largely in her favour .
' Sure , she has a big hill to climb , but never count a Clinton out , ' said Don Fowler , a former national chairman of the Democrats and a prominent supporter of her campaign .
The Florida lifeline would be thrown if the party 's national leadership rescinded a decision that was supported by Obama and Clinton when it was made last summer .
The Sunshine State decided it was too important to wait until after the Super Tuesday voting of 5 February and brought forward its primary to 29 January .
As punishment for the breach of party rules , the state 's 210 delegates were barred from August 's convention .
Clinton won the ballot with 50 per cent of the vote to Obama 's 33 per cent , and the same thing happened in Michigan , which Clinton won with 55 per cent of the vote and where Obama 's name was not on the ballot , excluding another 156 delegates .
' The people of Michigan and Florida spoke in a very convincing way , that they want their voices and their votes to be heard , ' Clinton said .
' The turnout in both places was record - breaking and I think that should be respected .
They have a right to be heard just as much as anyone else . '
Obama , who leads by about 100 delegates and is 700 short of the winning post of 2,025 after victories last week in Maine , Maryland , Virginia and the District of Columbia , unsurprisingly takes a different view , given the advantage those delegates would restore to his rival .
' At the 11th hour , the Clinton campaign is trying to rewrite rules that were firmly established and I do n't think there 's a lot of appetite for that , ' said David Plouffe , Obama 's campaign manager .
But Obama has said he would be happy for the two states ' delegates to attend the convention providing their participation did not affect the result .
' I think even my six - year - old would understand it would not be fair for Senator Clinton to be awarded delegates when there was no campaign , ' Obama said .
With both camps lobbing insults and the issue becoming an increasing distraction before the next round of primaries in Hawaii , Washington and Wisconsin on Tuesday , and more significant elections in Texas , Ohio , Rhode Island and Vermont a week later , Democrat chairman Howard Dean is under pressure to find a solution acceptable to both sides .
Clinton has numerous other headaches as her challenge nears its make - or - break point .
A tumultuous week saw her campaign manager , Patti Solis Doyle , replaced and David Wilhelm , the key strategist behind Bill Clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign , declaring his support for Obama .
Moreover , there are signs that Clinton 's support from prominent black leaders is eroding - the New York Times reported that veteran civil rights activist John Lewis had switched his allegiance to Obama .
Exit polls at last week 's primaries suggested that women voters are also turning away .
' It 's been a bad week for her , but I would n't count her out yet , ' said Michael McDonald , professor of government and politics at Virginia 's George Mason University .
' Obama has never been a front - runner before and now he 's receiving attacks not only from Clinton , but also John McCain .
They 're saying he has no substance , and the attacks that follow will colour in the picture for the voters . '
Fowler , meanwhile , laments that this latest controversy is taking place in Florida , scene of the disputed 2000 election when Democrats insist Bush ' stole ' victory , and consequently the White House , from Gore by a margin of just 537 votes .
' There have been other controversial elections in our history going back to the 18th century and Florida has been a questionable state in a few of them , ' he said .
' Maybe it 's the heat down there that 's getting to them and making them do crazy things . '
What they 're saying
' I am a candidate of , from and for the middle class of America . '
Hillary Clinton
' Obama 's going around issuing promissory notes on the future that he can't possibly redeem . '

' I do have my own personal political ambition , and that 's to see my mom become my president . '

The Pentagon 's mad science division is in a hurry to start making brains - on - a - chip .
According to DARPA 's recently - released budget , the Systems of Neuromorphic Adaptive Plastic
Scalable Electronics ( SyNAPSE ) program is n't set to being until the next fiscal year .
But the agency is already ramping up preparation for the program , which promises to " develop a brain inspired electronic ' chip ' that mimics that function , size , and power consumption of a biological cortex . "
DARPA is holding a workshop next month for potential SyNAPSE researchers .
And its providing a preview of just how challenging it 'll be , to piece together a faux brain .
As compared to biological systems , today 's intelligent machines are less efficient by a factor of one million to one billion in real world , complex environments .
The key to achieving the vision of the SyNAPSE program will be an unprecedented multidisciplinary approach that coordinates aggressive technology development in the following technical areas : 1 ) Hardware ; 2 ) Architecture ; 3 ) Simulation ; and 4 ) Environment .
Hardware includes neuromorphic electronics with novel , high density , plastic , synaptic components ; Architecture includes neuromorphic design from microcircuits to complete system ; Simulation includes large - scale digital simulation of neuromorphic circuits and functional neuromorphic systems ; and Environment includes virtual training , testing and benchmarking for neuromorphic systems .
So you better get going , brain - builders .

The huge Democratic turnout in the Iowa Caucuses , over twice that of the GOP , and the stampede by independents to vote in the Democratic precincts , suggests that Iowa , a swing state carried by President Bush in 2004 , may be lost irretrievably to the GOP in 2008 .
Why is Iowa walking away from the GOP ?
Why did Barack Obama win almost as many votes as all the Republicans put together ?
First , Iraq .
Parties that march nations into what the people come to see as unnecessary or unwinnable wars face the inevitable consequences .
Truman found that out when he was trounced by Estes Kefauver in New Hampshire in 1952 .
Lyndon Johnson found that out when Sen . Gene McCarthy captured 42 percent of the vote in New Hampshire in 1968 and was about to humiliate LBJ in Wisconsin .
LBJ stood down , before the country threw him down .
Richard Nixon took the helm .
The GOP lost Iowa because of its persistent failure to recognize and its refusal to address the anxiety and insecurity of the middle class .
George H.W. Bush ’s failing in 1992 is the failing of son George W. Bush .
With the sole exception of Mike Huckabee , the GOP seems unable to comprehend how throwing U.S. workers into Darwinian competition with foreigners earning one - fifth or one - tenth their wages impacts the Reagan Democrats now deserting the GOP .
A party that used to admonish one and all , “ There is no free lunch , ” can not see that free trade is no free lunch .
Moreover , the party is mired in the past , looking back to the time of Reagan .
Reagan was a good man and a great president , but our time is no more his time than the Eisenhower 1950s were like the 1920s .
While the GOP is in grave trouble , defeat in 2008 is not foreordained .
The Democrats are winning not because of the superiority of their candidates or ideas but because the Republicans are perceived as failing .
Neither Hillary Clinton nor Barack Obama has the answer to what ails America .
Both , and Barack especially , have moved far outside the mainstream of the nation .
“ I am the change agent , ” each of the Democrats proclaims .
But when this country is facing an entitlements crisis with Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid – unfunded liabilities adding up to scores of trillions of dollars – is it not madness to promise 50 million people , half of them immigrants , legal and illegal , national health insurance ?
Who is going to pay for this when the states are heading back toward bankruptcy , the economy is slowly sinking , U.S. companies are being taxed up to 40 percent , and the most successful Americans are already paying half their income to local , state and federal governments ?
Does anyone think Democrats have an answer to the immigration crisis that now grips every great American city ?
The amnesty , the “ path to citizenship ” they favor , will mean the next invasion will be the last and decisive invasion that makes America unrecognizable .
Does anyone think the Party of Government that depends on government workers and unions at election time can make government more efficient ?
Does anyone think that a party that depends on teachers unions and the NEA can reform the social Katrina that is inner-city education in America ?
Was it not Democrats who ran the city of New Orleans and the state of Louisiana in the time of Katrina ?
But the American people want change , and Democrats represent change .
On issue after issue , the Republican Party , if it stood true to its beliefs and purged the twin heresies of neoconservatism in foreign policy and Wall Street Journal ideology in trade and immigration policy , would still stand well with Middle America .
Most Americans are traditionalist on right to life , homosexual marriage , a polluted culture and Hollywood values .
Most Americans believe in a defense second to none , while staying out of wars that are not our quarrels .
Conservatives never believed in the United States going into nation - building abroad because they never believed in government nation - building at home .
Nations grow organically .
They rise from the soil of their own history , culture , faith , traditions .
Republicans believe in conservative judges and strict - constructionist justices like Antonin Scalia , who do not write the laws , but interpret the laws we have written through our elected representatives .
Democrats know this .
Thus , they are not promising us any new Ruth Bader Ginsburgs .
What has alienated America is the Bush bellicosity , the my - way - or - the - highway free - trade ideology , the refusal to defend the border with the implication that anyone who wants to preserve the country he grew up in is some kind of bigot .
The Party of Reagan is losing the country because it is no longer the party of the principles , policies and persona of Reagan , as applied to the problems of our time .
Each month the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) prepares the Employment Situation Report for the prior month .
This particular report is a big deal because it's a " market mover " meaning the results of this report have the ability to push the Dow Jones Industrial Average , DJIA , higher if the results are good , or send the stock market spiraling if the numbers are poor .
The employment report consists of a combination of data from two separate sources
Household Survey is a sampling of approximately 60,000 households and only covers a small percentage of employed persons .
Establishment Survey is a survey conducted on approximately 400,000 businesses of all sizes and represents about 33 % of total nonfarm employment .
Between the two data sources the BLS is able to provide us with various information in their report , including the following figures for December 2007 , as released on January 4 , 2008 .
Unemployment Rate - 5 % - Household Survey
Nonfarm payroll employment - +18,000 - Establishment Survey [ 138,495 ]
Number of unemployed persons - 7.7 - Household Survey
Total employment - 146.2 million - Household Survey
The figures released each month are the seasonally adjusted totals and the key number is the increase / decrease in nonfarm payroll employment .
In the month of December 2007 the increase in nonfarm payroll employment is +18,000 , meaning 18,000 jobs were added to payrolls during the month of December 2007 .
During a President 's term of office , the number of jobs produced during his / her administration becomes a very important issue because job creation is based on economic policies put in force by the administration .
Upon release of the January 4 , 2008 Employment Situation Report , the White House placed a Fact Sheet on their website claiming " Since August 2003 , more than 8.3 million jobs have been created " .
Knowing the Bush administration did n't start in August 2003 and knowing 8.3 million jobs since August 2003 averaged out to little more than 160,000 jobs a month I decided to research the subject further .
During the eight years , Bill Clinton was in office , his economic policies produced 23.1 million jobs [ average 240,000 per month ] as follows :

At the end of December 2000 , the total has increased to 132,484,000 .
The difference is 23,066,000 or 23.1 million new jobs were produced during the Clinton presidency .
In contrast , George Bush has been in office seven years and his economic policies have produced a total of 6.0 million jobs as follows :

Some earth scientists are pushing to enshrine officially a decades - old idea — that Earth is now in a biogeochemical era of our own making that should be distinguished from the Holocene , the epoch that began with the end of the last ice age .
They say the new period should be called the Anthropocene epoch — a name proposed in 2000 by Paul J. Crutzen , the atmospheric chemist ( now at the University of California , San Diego ) who shared a Nobel Prize for work on human - caused damage to the ozone layer , and Eugene F. Stoermer of the University of Michigan .
The proposal to move forward with this idea has come in a paper in the journal GSA Today by Jan Zalasiewicz and Mark Williams , geologists at the University of Leicester in England , along with colleagues at the Stratigraphy Commission of the Geological Society of London .
A news release from the university explains the latest proposal :
“ They have identified human impact through phenomena such as : Transformed patterns of sediment erosion and deposition worldwide ; major disturbances to the carbon cycle and global temperature ; wholesale changes to the world ’s plants and animals ; ocean acidification .
“ The scientists said their findings present the scholarly groundwork for consideration by the International Commission on Stratigraphy for formal adoption of the Anthropocene as the youngest epoch of , and most recent addition to , the Earth ’s geological timescale .
“ They state : ‘ Sufficient evidence has emerged of stratigraphically significant change ( both elapsed and imminent ) for recognition of the Anthropocene — currently a vivid yet informal metaphor of global environmental change — as a new geological epoch to be considered for formalization by international discussion . ’”
I explored this notion back in 1992 , in “ Global Warming : Understanding the Forecast ” — my first book on global warming ( long since out of print ) .
Not being versed in Greek , I goofed a bit on the parlance , but you get the idea :
Perhaps earth scientists of the future will name this new post - Holocene era for its causative element — for us .
We are entering an age that might someday be referred to as , say , the Anthrocene .
After all , it is a geological age of our own making .
The challenge now is to find a way to act that will make geologists of the future look upon this age as a remarkable time , a time in which a species began to take into account the long - term impact of its actions .
The alternative may be to leave a legacy of irresponsibility and neglect of the biosphere that could eventually manifest itself in the fossil record as just one more mass extinction — like the record of bones and footprints left behind by the dinosaurs . *
Despite my linguistic lapse , my proposal made it into the Wikipedia entry on Anthropocene .
The idea , of course , goes much farther back in time , with one intellectual stepping stone laid down more than 60 years ago by the Russian scientist Vladimir I . Vernadsky , who wrote : “ Mankind taken as a whole is becoming a powerful geological force . ”
A new translation of his essays , “ Geochemistry and the Biosphere ” ( Synergetic Press ) is worth scanning for more of his prescient thinking , which took the idea forward toward what he called “ noösphere , ” or Earth becoming a “ planet of the mind ” ( some see hints of the World Wide Web and Google Earth in all of this ) .
As he put it : “ Mankind ’s power is connected not with its matter but with its brain , its thoughts and its works , guided by its mind .
In the geological history of the biosphere , a great future is opened to Man if he realizes it and does not direct his mind and work to self - destruction . ”
In a 2002 special report , I went into more depth on this uncomfortable situation for Homo sapiens — which , as far as we can tell , is the first species to become a planet - scale powerhouse and be aware of it ( photosynthesizing organisms transformed the atmosphere , too , but most likely did n’t know it ) .

Leaked documents sent from the government of the German province of Bavaria have revealed an attempt by the Ministry of Justice to contract out the development of software to intercept encrypted Internet communication , including conversations held over Skype .
The documents , which were leaked by the German political party Piraten , are addressed to a software firm by the name of Digitask and come in two parts .
The first is a letter from the Bavarian ministry inquiring about Digitask 's ability to develop this interception software , along with a list of suggested monthly rental prices that Digitask could charge the government to rent its interception solution .
The second is a reply from Digitask outlining how the company would deploy their solution .
The method outlined involved the installation of malware referred to as the " Skype Capture Unit " that would be delivered in an executable file that " can for instance be attached to an e-mail or directly be installed on the target machine . "
This software would then transfer unencrypted conversations to a remote Skype Recording Server that can record and replay 10 Skype interceptions in parallel .
The Recording Server then sends the conversations through to Skype and their intended destination , a classic " man in the middle " attack that is difficult for the compromised user to detect .
Bavaria is n't the only place where malware is used by law enforcement .
Other countries , including the United States , are looking into or are already using so - called " policeware " to conduct investigations .
Popular vendors of anti-malware software have given vague responses when asked if they will detect and remove policeware .
This type of malware is the digital equivalent of old - school telephone wiretapping , and whether it is simply a useful tool for police to catch criminals or a terrifying " Big Brother " enabler depends very much on the type of government that is giving the orders .
While " wiretapping " evokes images of black - suited investigators attaching wires to physical phone lines , these days a telephone call can be intercepted digitally from the phone company without any manual labor .
Tapping of Skype calls is , for now , a more difficult endeavor that requires the policeware to be installed on the target 's computer .
However , as open source advocate Richard Stallman pointed out in a post on Boing Boing , unless you are using open - source VoIP software you can't necessarily guarantee that a wiretapping backdoor has n't been built into the software already .
This does n't appear to be the case with Skype at the moment , though .
PORTSMOUTH , Ohio
An eight - ton rock rested for generations at the bottom of the Ohio River , minding its own business as time and currents passed .
It favored neither Ohio to the north nor Kentucky to the south .
It just  was .
Occasionally , when water levels dropped , the boulder would break the surface long enough to receive the chiseled tattoos of mildly daring people seeking remembrance .
But it stopped playing peek - a- boo nearly a century ago , leaving only ephemera in its wake , including a sepia photograph of a well - dressed woman in a frilly hat , standing in the middle of the Ohio , on this rock .
Now , because of one man ’s obsessive good intention , the fabled rock sits on old tires in the municipal garage of this river city , awaiting the outcome of a border dispute that goes something like this :
Some Ohioans say the rock is an important piece of Portsmouth history and should be put on display .
Some Kentuckians say the rock is an important piece of Kentucky , period , and should be returned .
And some in both states say : I ’ve been distracted by war , recession and a presidential campaign , so forgive me .
But are we fighting over a rock ?
Last month the Kentucky House of Representatives passed a resolution demanding the rock ’s return to its watery bed , with one of its members suggesting that a raiding party to Portsmouth might be in order .
Not to be outdone , the Ohio House of Representatives is considering a resolution that asserts the rock ’s significance to Ohio , and its speaker has said he is ready to guard the boulder with his muzzle - loading shotgun .

" Just because I do n't look angry does n't mean I do n't have a whole lot of anger inside , " Masters said .
" I do n't want to get drunk .
People get drunk , they have no self control .
I do n't want to get mad or do anything stupid or say something stupid .
I 'd rather just stay sober . "
The anger he fears unleashing is aimed squarely at the Fort Collins Police Department , which doggedly pursued him for almost 12 years before charging him with the 1987 murder of Peggy Hettrick -- a crime he has always insisted he did n't commit .
Masters , 36 , was released Tuesday from prison after new DNA evidence pointed to someone else .
He will find out next month if he will stand trial again , but a prosecutor said Monday that charges against Masters could be dismissed .
Watch Masters talk about his freedom »
Speaking with CNN about 24 hours after his release , Masters said he is relieved to be out of prison , but he can't shake the feeling this saga might not be over .
He also can't shake his anger at one investigator in particular .
" My opinion is that Jim Broderick , the guy in charge of it , has a very big ego and would not allow anything or anyone to convince him that he was wrong , " Masters said .
" He made up his mind in the beginning , from day one when he walked into my bedroom and saw my horror drawings and war stories , that I was guilty .
Nothing would change his mind . "
Broderick did not return a call Wednesday to his office .
His answering machine said he would not be checking messages until the end of the month .
Michael Goodbee , one of the special prosecutors handling the Masters hearings , said in court that Broderick was out of town on a family emergency .
Broderick told CNN in November , before the DNA evidence was confirmed , that he still believed Masters was the killer .
The key players »
Masters was convicted largely on circumstantial evidence -- a collection of gory sketches and narratives , a few knives and a forensic psychologist 's testimony that Masters ' stories and artwork indicated he fantasized about sexual homicides .
Case history
In 1987 , a bicyclist found the maimed body of Peggy Hettrick , 37 , near the home of Tim Masters .
Masters , then 15 , quickly became the top suspect in the slaying , but it was not until 1999 that police and prosecutors saw Masters convicted .
He was sentenced to life in prison .
In hearings that began in September , Masters ' new defense team alleged police and prosecutorial misconduct in the investigation and trial .
On Tuesday , a judge threw out the conviction and freed Masters after DNA evidence pointed to someone else .
He was also the first person to find Hettrick 's body .
He did n't immediately report it , he said , because he thought it was a mannequin and someone was playing a prank .
" It 's just unbelievable because here 's all these stories and drawings that have no nexus with the crime .
There 's no one being stabbed in the back .
There 's no one being sexually mutilated , " he said .
" The only thing they had in common with this crime is there was violence . "
Lots of kids in high school sketch violent scenes and scribe violent stories , Masters said .
Go to any high school , he said , and you 'll likely find similar artwork and writings .
" They won their case by assassinating my character , " he said .
Masters said he 's been angry for years .
Though his father Clyde , who died while Masters was in prison , taught him to never show his emotions , his fellow inmates were aware of his bitterness , he said .
" My best friend who sat across from me at the chow hall , he used to actually sit there and say , ' Damn , I 've got to look across at this surly face every day ?
Look at your face .
You look mad all the time . ' "
His frustration began to wane when the media started reporting on his case about six months ago .
The letters he received in prison and support from fellow inmates helped , he said , but the anger is " still going to be there .
There 's no way to get around that .
It 's still inside . "
Masters said he can't thank his family enough for standing by him .
And though he spoke with reverence of his father , there was an undertone of resentment in his words .
It was his father , he said , who initially told him to cooperate with police , a decision that ultimately would be his undoing .
His father allowed police to search their trailer .
He also allowed Masters to be interrogated for hours without an attorney .
Police would use the evidence and interrogation to convict Masters in 1999 .
" We 'll cooperate with them and give them anything they want and then they 'll see that you did n't have anything to do with this and they 'll move on , " Masters recalled his father telling him in 1987 .
" It turns out that by cooperating with them it just encouraged them , because I was the easiest suspect to go after . "
Clyde Masters knew his son had n't committed the crime , but he thought police were there to help , Masters said .
His father was in the Navy for 22 years and felt you should obey authority , he added .
" Well , you know what ?
You should n't always submit to authority .
Our country would n't exist if everyone submitted to authority , " he said .
" It 's just a shame Dad did n't know how the system was . "
In a news conference after his release , Masters said he wanted only to see his family .
He was whisked away from the courthouse to the local Elks Lodge , which his aunts and uncles had rented .
At the party , he met some of his younger relatives for the first time .
" Everybody did n't get to come up there and visit me over the years , and the cousins , the younger ones , have had kids of their own and I do n't know any of them , so I 'm trying to learn everyone 's name and not succeeding , " Masters said .
His first meal was two pieces of grocery store fried chicken -- which he ate simultaneously -- and a glass of lemonade .
The chicken was " fantastic , " he said .
" I did n't even eat anything else with it .
I just had two pieces of chicken there and people are shaking my hand and leaving like , ' Ugh , I got grease on my hand , ' " he said with a chuckle .
" Sorry . "
During visits with family members , he learned how much the world had changed since he was locked up .
Everyone had high - tech cell phones with cameras .
His cousins and nephews were showing him YouTube and their MySpace pages .
Despite the changes all around him , the changes within him seem negligible , he said .
" I do n't feel a whole lot different other than a lot of emotional baggage , " he said .
" Other people would be able to tell you better than I would how much I 've changed . "
His freedom still seems like a dream at times , he said .
As for trying to recover the years he feels were wrongly taken from him -- the years in high school and in the Navy when he was pegged as a murderer or the decade he spent in a prison cell -- he understands they 're gone forever .
" You ca n't get any time back , " he said , quipping , " My youth and my hair , gone . "
Though there are strong indications that Masters could be fully exonerated in February , he is not getting his hopes too high -- not after the events of the past two decades .
" For me , it 's not over until it 's over .
They have n't dismissed any charges .
I 'm out on bond , so I 'm not completely free yet , " he said .
Masters said he and his legal team are prepared in the event of a new trial .
" Whatever happens , happens .
We 're ready . "

Officials in the small city of Kiryat Yam have filed an official police complaint to force Google to settle in its favor an Arab - Israeli land dispute .
( Update : Google tells me it 's not their job .
See below . )
At issue is this user - generated notation placed on the image of Kiryat Yam that is visible via Google Earth :
This is one of the Palestinian localities evacuated and destroyed after the 1948 Arab - Israeli war .
For basic information about this locality , including brief history , the 1948 events , its current status , pictures and statistics , visit : www.palestineremembered.com.
The notation is labeled Arab Ghawarina .
Kiryat Yam officials contend that the passage is patently false , according to this Arutz Shiva report :
Those who see Kiryat Yam on Google Earth are told that the city was built on the ruins of an Arab town from which innocent civilians were expelled .
In fact , officials said , the city was built by Holocaust survivors on land that was completely barren and had not been settled in the past .
The false information was placed as part of a deliberate attempt to hurt the city 's interests , they said .
I 've been unable to ascertain whether the city approached Google directly for relief - one would presume it did - or how Google replied .
I have a request in to the Google press office .
( Update , Google 's reply : )
While we recognize that some may find the user generated content objectionable , we are careful to balance the integrity of an open forum with the legal requirements of local governments .
It looks as though this particular user - contributed annotation does not breach our Terms and Conditions nor is it in any way illegal .
The Google Earth community layer is a place where people can tag their knowledge or opinions of a location .
Their comments are clearly indicated with the ' I ' icon and this layer can easily be switched on and off .
We believe the majority of people use the community positively to share their expertise and experiences .
In most cases , our users increase the utility of the product and provide a more meaningful and robust experience for each other with their contributions to the Google Earth community .
The matter was first brought to my attention by the author of Israel - On - Blog , who tells me via e-mail that the story was featured on television news there today , so it has the makings of a genuine international incident , of which Google seems to attract more than its share .
( Update 2 : The International Herald Tribune has more details , including comment from the man responsible for the dispute notation .
He says he 's amenable to moving the notation if it is proven incorrect . )
( Update 3 , Feb .
15 : Seems Google has another cartographical controversy on its hands , this one having to do with its decision to rename the Persian Gulf .

They can do that ? )
New discoveriesabout magnetic field lines and the first - ever direct observation of their reconnectionin space are offering hope that scientists will learn how to unlock fusionpower as an energy source in the future .
? Thereconnection processes in the [ Earth ?s ] magnetosphere and in fusion devices arethe same animal , ? said James Drake , a University of Maryland physicist .
Spacecontains magnetic fields that direct the flow of plasma , an energetic fourthstate of matter consisting of positive ions and electrons .
The plasma particlesnormally follow the paths of the magnetic field lines like streams of carsfollowing highways .
Magneticreconnection can release that stored energy when two magnetic field lines bendtowards each other and fuse to createnew field lines .
The effect is not unlike an earthquake forcibly realigning parallel highways into perpendicular routes and channeling cars along the newlycreated paths .
Although some released plasma energy travels in a straight line — called a super - Alfvenic electron jet — other plasma particles fan out asthough escaping the opening of a trumpet .
The effectnot only fascinates astrophysicists but also frustrates efforts on Earth to createsustained energy sources through fusion .
Experimental fusion reactors force atomic particles to fuse together andrelease energy as plasma .
The plasma is contained within a " magneticbottle , " or a cage of magnetic field lines , so that the high plasmatemperatures can maintain the fusion reaction .
However , magneticreconnection can break the magnetic bottle and allow plasma to reach the colderwalls of the reactor where fusion will not sustain itself .
Drakebecame interested in the topic when he looked at early fusion studies andrealized how many theories at the time were ? dead wrong ?
about magneticreconnection .
To learn more about the phenomenon , he had to look beyond Earth .
? I startedrealizing some of the best magnetic reconnection data is in space , ?
Drake said .
During asabbatical at the University of California - Berkeley , the theoretical physicist happenedto work in the same office as Tai Phan , anobservational physicist who was looking at magnetic field data from the European Space Agency ?s
Cluster satellites .
? I wasdoing theory , Tai was doing data and we suddenly saw this correspondence , ?Drake marveled .
?
It was purely accidental .?
The fourCluster satellites crossed through a turbulent plasma region just outsideEarth ?s magnetic field in January 2003 , when they happened to run into an areawhere magnetic reconnection had occurred .
Physicists thought such areas , knownas electron diffusion regions , were just over six miles long and so spacecraftwould probably miss them in the vastness of space .
Instead , anew look at the Cluster data showed that the electron diffusion region measured 1,864 miles long — 300 times longer than early theoretical expectations andstill four times longer than seen in the latest astrophysics simulations .
Thatalso marked the first ever direct observations of magnetic reconnection inspace .
Althoughthe basic physics behind magnetic reconnection remain a mystery , Clusterpromises that future missions have a good chance of further examining thephenomenon .
One example is NASA ?s Magnetospheric Multiscale mission , which willconsist of four spacecraft that study why the plasma particles can become ?
unfrozen ?
or unstuck from the magnetic field lines they normally travel along .
Magnetic reconnection is simply the most ? dramatic ?
example of this , Drake said .
Such an energyrelease amounts to a conversion of magnetic energy into particle energy , whichcan occur in blackhole jets and drivessolar flares .
Drake hopes to someday create a computer model that can accuratelydescribe the conversion process — and if scientists can also apply someunderstanding towards improving fusion reactors , so much the better .
Why is Simplicity Difficult ?
Simple websites are easy to use , easy to understand , nice to look at .
In practice , websites are either unusable or ugly and filled with too many words .
Why do designers have a hard time to keep it simple ?
Simplicity is “ the ultimate sophistication ” ( Leonardo da Vinci ) .
Achieving simplicity is a difficult task in web - design as in art , business , sports , or science .
But paper derived graphic design and usability on one side , marketing language and user expectations on the other side make a Web designer ’s life even harder than necessary .
Graphic Design vs Usability
HTML and its table structure was not made to display graphics .
It was made for text .
By its technological nature the Internet was against designers .
There is an unarticulated war currently raging among those who make web sites .
(…)
This war is between usability experts and graphic designers .
— Curt Cloninger , A List Apart
Flash does n’t solve this problem , it creates new problems .
Flash is hard to use , hard to optimize for search engines , hard to administrate and hard to combine with current components .
Designers like flash , users do n’t .
No technology is bad as such , if used intelligently , but flash rarely helps .
Things got better since table - less CSS .
Things got better since websites are made in table - less CSS though , as CSS is made for and by friends of typography and graphic design .
The conflict design and usability is not just a technical one .
Some Usability Rules for Web Designers
Web - designers are confronted with a set of rules that websites have to follow in order to work , such as :
Links have to be recognizable either through being underlined or blue
Logos should be placed in the upper left corner
Fonts should be big and scalable
Few pictures have more impact than many pictures
Few fragmented text works better than long text - blocks
No columns for text , as websites scroll
Branding vs. Usability
The usability rules above lead to design rules that are different and in many ways stricter than the rules with paper based design .
And , in many of those ways corporate design manuals clashed with these rules .
All too often , corporate identity was and is made by designers that are not familiar with design on the web .
An important part of a corporate design is missing or poorly adapted from paper based design guidelines .
The conflict between branding and usability , is also a conflict between identity and conformity .
Strong identities are first of all : different , recognizable , bold , successful websites tend to uniformity but manage to create identity through their interface .
Simplicity as Unity of Conflicting Parameters
To create a unity between those principles is a difficult task .
On the other hand , brand experience online is defined by the ease of use .
If using a website is without problems , the user has a good brand experience .
If on top the website is consistent with corporate design , you are right there .
If web identity is part of the core identity development , there should be no conflict between branding and usability .
Whoever develops the on- and offline identity has to be aware of the characteristics of interactive media .
In one word : Online identity is not a question of how big a logo is or where it is placed ( this is almost a given ) , it is more a question of who you are and what you say , it is more a question of what words , what pictures do you use , than where you place them .
And quite honestly , this is a measure stone for any corporate identity — on - as well as offline .
New Rules
Creative people do n’t like to be censored , yet few regulations incite more creativity than censorship .
Since 1994 , and more - so since we can use table - less CSS , web - design has evolved .
It is establishing its own set of graphic rules , and insights such as :
Work with light , not with layers of color .
Set up a dynamic visual hierarchy that works vertically and is easily understood Define fonts so they work with poor rendering as well as with good rendering
Websites should be made as simple as possible , but not any simpler , in order to achieve maximum effect with minimum means .
Web copy writers uses clear simple words .
The practice of simplicity is their daily bread .
This clashes with the corporate bullshit machine .
Thus , Websites are a remedy for obsolete communication practices .
Successful websites are funny .
Humor is the strongest weapon of communication .
With customers getting smarter and more suspicious , and time getting sparse and sparser due to the acceleration of our communication practice — you need the clearest communication to make yourself heard .
No Grey Noise
Paper brochures are expected to be filled with text , so copywriters write and write more or less blind text .
As a result , nobody reads them .
And not just brochures , fashion magazines , newspapers are filled with blind text , TVs implode with nonsense .
They do not care for the attention of the consumer , all they seem to care is to fill the world with grey noise .
Struggle for every word : Writing for the Web means struggling for every word , as with every word that is too much , you might loose your reader .
If you stay simple without oversimplifying or being sensational ( works for the some audiences though ) , your chances to keep the reader are fair .
Simplicity is not a given : it is the fruit of concentrated , diligent work .
If you know what you do you are able to do it simply .
There is no recipe for an ideal website .
But if you know what you are doing as a designer , copywriter , business strategist , you are focused on reducing things to their essence .
Designers have a hard time to keep it simple , because simplicity is a lot of work .
Having been as excited about KDE 4.0 as most people , I was keen to try the beta releases , though I did n’t want to compile it myself .
Consequently , I waited for packages to become available for Kubuntu 7.10 , as this seems the most convenient way to try it out .
I followed the instructions detailed on the Kubuntu website , though found that several of these packages are broken and wo n’t install correctly .
These unfortunately include Konqueror and Dolphin amongst others , so the testing I was able to do was limited .
( see Edit at bottom – this has been resolved ! )
To install on Kubuntu 7.10 , add deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/tsimpson/ubuntu gutsy main to your
/etc/apt/sources.list then make sure you run sudo aptitude remove kdebase - workspace kde4 base - dev kdelibs5 before running sudo aptitude install kdebase - dev - kde4 kdebase - workspace - dev kdebase - runtime kdm - kde4 for best results .
( i.e. fully uninstall any previous betas of KDE 4 )
Then run cp usr / lib / kde4 / share / kde4/apps/kdm/sessions/kde.desktop
/usr/share/xsessions/kde4.desktop
Change the Name section in /usr / share / xsessions / kde4.desktop to be called “ KDE 4 ” by using nano /usr / share / xsessions / kde4.desktop
Then nano / usr / lib / kde4 / bin / startkde and add
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/kde4/lib
export KDEDIRS=/usr/lib/kde4
export PATH=/usr/lib/kde4/bin/:$PATH
export KDEHOME=~/.kde4
to the top of the file .
Log out and choose KDE 4 in the session chooser in KDM .
( I did n’t bother with the xephyr stuff as suggested on the Kubuntu page , as that ’s only if you do n’t want to run KDE 4 as it ’s own session . )
On boot up , it ’s clear that there are numerous bugs in these packages that make it unusable – all the different components or plasmoids open up , but you ca n’t move them .
Also , none are stuck to the panel at the bottom , meaning that there is a free floating KDE menu that ca n’t be moved .
The easiest thing to do is to close them all , then just activate one at a time to see them .
If you add plasmoids , they appear behind the add widgets window , so you might want to move it first , otherwise you will end up with loads of them behind it !
Add widgets dialog
Weirdly , if you move the scroll wheel on the desktop , it scrolls up and down – currently this has some weird behaviour as shown below – this does let you move the K menu down though so you can see it all .
Looking at the K menu , it has been nicely redesigned , as in previous releases – there are multiple sections on it , including a favourites section that remembers the most used applications .
The many faces of the new K menu .
As mentioned previously , Konqueror and Dolphin do n’t install , so we can only see the old versions .
Below are some other screen shots , including those of the icon themes and the widget themes .
Default widgets
Over all , things look good – shame that it ’s not really ready to use full time , but I think that it ’s worth waiting for !
Edit :
Having played some more , it turns out you can drag and drop the widgets , but they wo n’t stick to the panel yet .
You can also rotate them and enlarge them however you like .
The ?
lets you move them round , the purple circle lets you rotate and scale .
I also managed to get Dolphin et al. installed – here ’s a look at that .

CCTV camera systems ( Closed - circuit tv cameras ) are utilized in a variety of surveillance to present video surveillance .
CCTV kits utilization can be carried out in universities , offices , banks , homes , stores , and so on .
As a result of which people today will think two times before they just take any illegal stage .
In schools and colleges , in the course of an examination , it is usually utilized or to monitor the action of school or school campuses .
CCTV systems in homes allows you to live a peaceful lifestyle .
Several instances it happens that men and women coming for your home arrives having a poor intention and may develop pointless troubles .
It ’s a one - time investment ; however , it gives you safety 24/ 7 .
Even it is useful when you are not at house and thief break out at the house , at that time , CCTV camera systems are if installed recording can aid to catch the thief .
In the case of consumer service employees , they ’ve to manage distinct varieties of the client .
If a time comes to handle an angry customer or disappointed consumer , the CCTV camera system may well assist the worker from struggling with any physical damage .
Quite a few occasions , buyers claim of becoming cheated with very poor high quality items and genuine capital .
In this kind of instances , the CCTV cameras assists discover the reality , thus bringing justice for the buyers .
In a retail business , CCTV security systems aids in monitoring the prospects , thieves , and even the employees .
If workers understand that they are becoming watched , they ’re less likely to steal things though working .
Furthermore , it assists in maintaining documents , if any argument happens between two workers then being a proof one can consult the recorded video clip tape .
These systems may be fitted outside or within based on your comfort .
This will allow you to monitor all the things to do happening within the premises as well as the people coming in and going out .
CCTV security systems can also be perfect for business and public places like malls , dining establishments , airports , and railway stations .
The bomb blasting along with other these kinds of criminal activities are much more likely to consider location in public places .
In these kinds of instances , acquiring these kinds of CCTV cameras plays a key function .
A lot of sorts of CCTV methods are readily available like some are Computer - based , television - based , and so on .
CCTV is significantly affordable than nearly all of the people today imagine .
Because it has become earlier mentioned , it truly is just a one - time investment but provides you life span security .
Moreover , even with the advancement of technologies , the manufacturing price has long been decreased so one can manage it conveniently .
Enhance the safety of the residence .
Contact local CCTV specialists to find out far more about CCTV programs .
In 2004 , New York magazine reported on a DC dinner party , at which Condoleezza Rice was reportedly overheard saying , “ As I was telling my husb– ” and then stopping herself abruptly , before saying , “ As I was telling President Bush . ”
As the magazine explained it , those who heard her were quite surprised , though the slip seemed “ more psychologically telling than incriminating . ”
In other words , no one seriously believes Bush and Rice are romantically involved .
But the alleged “ husband ” gaffe nevertheless points to a relationship that ’s kind of … creepy .
In fact , with this background in mind , consider Newsweek ’s Marcus Mabry ’s analysis on Rice ’s loyalty to the president ( as excerpted from his new biography of Rice ) .
… Rice was drawn to Bush .
“ First of all , I thought he was wonderful to be around , ” she recalled , sitting on the couch in her State Department office .
“ He was warm and funny and easy to be around .
I thought he had just an incredibly inquisitive mind …
You could barely finish an explanation before he was digging into it . ”
Bush was also a bad boy .
And Rice , according to friends and family , had a thing for bad boys .
That was why , as a 20 - year - old grad student , she preferred her second Fighting Irish football player boyfriend to her first , said Jane Robinett , Rice ’s best Notre Dame friend : John “ Dubie ” Dubenetzky , cocky and handsome with wavy blond hair , was less deferential than Wayne Bullock , the sweet fullback who had moved Condi ’s boxes into Lewis Hall .
Rice ’s friends insisted the attraction to Bush was platonic , but Brenda Hamberry - Green , her Palo Alto hairdresser , who had spent years commiserating with Rice over how hard it was for successful black women to find a good man , noticed a change when Rice started working for Bush .
“ He fills that need , ” Hamberry - Green decided .
“ Bush is her feed . ”
Like I said , creepy .
Sir Richard and a coconut hail the " historic " flight
A Virgin Atlantic jumbo jet has flown between London 's Heathrow and Amsterdam using fuel derived from a mixture of Brazilian babassu nuts and coconuts .
Environmentalists have branded the flight a publicity stunt and claim biofuel cultivation is not sustainable .
Earlier this month , Airbus tested another alternative fuel - a synthetic mix of gas - to - liquid .
Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson said the flight marked a " vital breakthrough " for the entire airline industry .
" This pioneering flight will enable those of us who are serious about reducing our carbon emissions to go on developing the fuels of the future , " he said .
But he said fully commercial biofuel flights were likely to use feedstocks such as algae rather than the mix used on the passenger - less flight .
Virgin's Boeing 747 had one of its four engines connected to an independent biofuel tank that it said could provide 20 % of the engine 's power .
Instead of looking for a magic green bullet , Virgin should focus on the real solution to this problem and call for a halt to relentless airport expansion
Dr Doug Parr , Greenpeace
Solution for future flight ?
Have your say
The three other engines were capable of powering the plane on conventional fuel had there been a problem .
The company said the babassu tree , native to Brazil , and the coconuts did not compete with staple food sources and came from existing mature plantations .
Both products are commonly used in cosmetics and household paper products .
' Gimmick '
One problem with flying planes using biofuel is that it is more likely to freeze at high altitude .
The Boeing 747 was partly fuelled by coconut and Brazilian babassu
The technology is still being developed by companies GE and Boeing , but Virgin believes airlines could routinely be flying on plant power within 10 years .
Kenneth Richter , of Friends of the Earth , said the flight was a " gimmick " , distracting from real solutions to climate change .
" If you look at the latest scientific research it clearly shows biofuels do very little to reduce emissions , " he said .
" At the same time we are very concerned about the impact of the large - scale increase in biofuel production on the environment and food prices worldwide .
" What we need to do is stop this mad expansion of aviation .
At the moment it is the fastest growing source of greenhouse gases in the UK , and we need to stop subsidising the industry . "
Greenpeace 's chief scientist , Dr Doug Parr , labelled the flight a " high - altitude greenwash " and said less air travel was the only answer .
BIOFUELS
They are any fuels made from living things Commonly means fuel made from crops including corn Pioneers such as Henry Ford designed cars to run on biofuels

" Instead of looking for a magic green bullet , Virgin should focus on the real solution to this problem and call for a halt to relentless airport expansion . "
Airbus ran its test using the world 's largest passenger jet , the A380 .
The three - hour flight from Filton near Bristol to Toulouse on 1 February was part of an ongoing research programme .

Mr Bush 's message was taped and later broadcast to other marchers
Mr Bush was speaking before thousands of anti-abortion activists attended a March For Life rally in Washington .
" You 're here because you know that all life deserves to be protected ...
I 'm proud to be standing with you , " Mr Bush said to organisers of the annual march .
There are an estimated 1.2 million abortions in America annually .
White House invitation
On 22 January 1973 , the US Supreme Court legalised abortion in America when it ruled on the Roe versus Wade case .
In that case the court decided under the constitution individual states did not have the right to prevent abortion .
America is better than this , so we will continue to work for a culture of life
President Bush
Each year there is a well - attended March for Life rally in Washington to urge the Supreme Court to overturn its ruling .
Campaigners hope a court which has become more conservative under Mr Bush is more likely now one day to do that .
Mr Bush invited 200 of the marchers to the White House to offer his support .
He said each unborn child was a separate individual with his or her own genetic code .
" America is better than this , so we will continue to work for a culture of life , " he said .
A taped version was broadcast to other demonstrators later .
Abortion reform has not featured large in the current campaign for the presidency but it retains the potential to become an issue .
Of the Republicans only the former New York Mayor , Rudy Giuliani , does not want to overturn the Roe versus Wade ruling - and this has alienated some in his party .
Games : Friendship - Enders
During the holidays I use my Good Gateway Games lists to promote family games ; that is , games that bring people together for a fun and relaxing time , and strengthen the bonds of comradery between the participants .
Of course , now that the holidays are over ...
Matthew , I 'm sure you get asked this a lot , but I 'm looking for a board game that is like I'm The Boss -- something in which the human interaction really changes the course of the game .
Nothing is better then screwing over a good friend ... and having that awkward talk later when you can tell he 's seething with anger because you purposely made him lose the game .
If you have any ideas I 'd really appreciate it .
Jeremy
Ah , yes .
The friendship - enders .
Ah , yes .
The friendship - enders .
I 'd recommend a good negotiation game , but you already own one of my favorites .
In I'm The Boss , each player is an investor , willing to throw their support behind a variety of projects in the hopes of reaping a windfall .
On a turn a player either draws Influence cards , or becomes The Boss and tries to cobble together a deal .
Each deal requires the involvement of two or more of the players and pays out a specified amount of money ; to complete the deal , The Boss will therefore need to entice the other players to join him , by offering them a share of the profits .
Sometimes a deal needs a specific investor , but other times it will permit The Boss to select from a subset of players , allowing him to play them off one another in an effort to keep as much money as possible for himself .
All this could get real nasty were it not for the Influence Cards , which inject a healthy does of chaos into the game .
Wielded at the right time , a well - played Influence Card could send a key Investor on vacation and scupper a deal , allow someone to become The Boss of a deal previously managed by someone else , and even steal an Investor from another player entirely .
All this -- plus a rapid - fire pace , short playing time ( 60 minutes ) , and element of randomness ( no one knows when the game will end , for instance ) -- make it hard to get too worked - up over I'm The Boss , even when the others actively conspire against you .
And they will ... of yes , they will .
But maybe you 're in the market for something that will wreak complete and irreparable damage to your hard - won friendships .
If so , might I suggest one of the following ?
Intrigue : Quite possibly the nastiest game ever invented .
Your palace has four job opening , and the applicants belong to your opponents .
Before you decide whom to hire , though , each candidate must give you a cash bribe in any amount they choose .
After all have done so , you install one person into the position , banish the rest from the game , and keep all the money you received in bribes , regardless of who it was from .
And what do you do when it 's not your turn ?
Why , send your minions off to the palaces of others , where they too will vie for employment .
This game is so vicious that I gave my copy away , so I would never be temped to play it again .
I 'm not kidding .

Lifeboats :
To call this Survivor : The Boardgame would n't be too much of a stretch ... except that Survivor is a group hug compared to this .
When an ocean liner sinks , all the passengers cram onto lifeboats and sail for shore .
Every round one of the boats springs a leak , as determined by popular vote ; then , someone in the afflicted vessel gets thrown overboard , and again it 's majority rule .
Get a few games of this under your belt and you 'll quickly realize that your friends -- and democracy itself - - cannot be trusted .

Citadels :
Much less aggressive than the others on this list , but Citadels still affords opportunity for backstabbing .
Every round the players secretly adopt roles as they attempt to build up their city .
One role is the Assassin , who forces an opponent to lose his turn ; another is the Thief , who steals another 's savings .
But as these knaves target a role rather than a specific player -- and no one knows for sure what role the other players have taken -- there 's an element of guesswork that defuses tensions a bit .
This is one of my all - time favorite games , and can be played by up to 7 players .

Junta :
The bad news is that this game really only works for exactly seven people , and requires four or more hours to complete ; the good news is that if you can assemble a group of willing players ... oh , man .
The seven ruling families of a small Banana Republic must decide how to divvy up the foreign assistance they receive from an unnamed , no-questions - asked superpower each year .
One player is the President , and has the largest say in how the cash is split ; but if the other players do n't like the budget , they can always foment a coup and have El Presidenteshot at dawn .
I have some great memories of playing this game , and some others I have worked hard to suppress .

Sticheln :
This is my favorite trick - tacking game -- and I like trick taking games a lot .
Each player has a " Misery Suit " -- while most cards he takes are worth one point , cards in his Misery Suit are worth negative points equal to the value of the card .
Sure the game is enjoyable for its elegance and exceptional design , but the real fun comes from watching your opponent 's face as you cheerfully hand over a - 12 point card .

Illuminati : At one point this was my Favorite Game Ever .
Maybe it still is , but I would n't know because I have n't played it in a decade , after hurling the dice across the room when a roll did n't go my way .
The game of global conspiracies , Illuminati put players in charge of secret societies -- The UFOs , The Network , The Cult of Cthulhu , etc. -- and attempting to control organizations ranging from OPEC to the Boy Scouts .
And if someone nabs a group before you do , why , you just attack him personally and wrest away control .

Nuclear war :
This is not a good game .
That said , played with the right group it can be a barrel of fun .
Let fly with your nuclear arsenal , and attempt to be the last man standing in an irradiated world .
It is what we gamers dismissive refer to as a " Take That Game " -- meaning that , in lieu of strategy of tactics , all it really offers you is the opportunity to initiate or perpetuate grudges with your opponents -- but if you do n't take it seriously , and do imbibe non-trivial amounts of alcohol , you can still have a blast with it .
Update : Someone asked for my opinion on Killer Bunnies .
To my mind , it 's just Nuclear War in fur : a mediocre game that can nonetheless provide for an entertaining evening if everyone is in the mood for tit - for - tatism and can overlook the game 's randomness .
Of course , if you want to play a negotiation game you really can't beat the great - grandpappy of the genre : Diplomacy .
Imagine Risk if , instead of winning battles by dice rolls , you had to do it by convincing the other players to gang up on your target .
Diplomacy will be re-released by Avalon Hill early this year ; if you can't wait , or like your wheeling - and - dealing with a bit more theme , check out Game of Thrones , a similar game set in George R. R. Martin 's fantasy world .

Thanks Brad and all the BB contributors for fine bein ' humans ... honored that you are fellow citizens .
In Colorado the dem Governor Ritter stood by the side of the slim - margin dem loser for Secretary of State ( Gordon , who is still uber state senator ) and announced paper at precincts for our state voting method .
Which pissed - off Coffman ( scandal - plagued GOPer who " won " as Secretary of State , and who tried to steer CO to only Diebold / Premier equipment ) , most of the County Clerks ( who now seem only to hold secret meetings and pray for mail ) , and the equipment vendors .
Bold leadership ?
Political payback ?
No other choices ?
Still , even though the state dems co-opted the issues of a movement started years ago by a handful of damned - dedicated election activists , our efforts may have had something to do with it .
Happy Birthday ...

Attlatl : Had n't heard about Ritter 's decision , but as a CO voter , I 'm thrilled - tried to vote on paper in '06 but got the provisional ballot BS - it was either touch screen or my vote did n't count .
Here 's what the AP /9 News article said about the plan that SOS Coffman backs : " ... people who have moved frequently , do n't have a permanent address and have n't voted by mail before could be left out a mail election .
" This burden will fall hardest on minority , low - income and young voters .
" Another GOP vote suppression tactic .
No bill has yet passed to make the new paper - based voting law , but one is expected in several days - something to watch closely .
Thanks for the tip .

You , Winter Patriot , and all the great members back then set me off in a new direction and helped to change my life and become more active in election fraud issues , and especially anti-war protest .
I still regret not having met you in Crawford .

[ Sound cue : The Beatles White Album --- uh , CD --- track 18 " Birthday " ]
" You say it 's your birthday
It 's my birthday too -- yeah ... "
The birthday of Hope ---
In Individuals taking responsibility for finding out what 's really going on behind the curtains -- and getting that information out -- when the people who usurp power make deals with those who were supposed to be keeping the curtains open and shining that light .
Without this knowledge , we cannot have the Democratic Republic the United States was designed to be .
How perfect is it that the information you have most sought to reveal is the corruption of the essence of the " Freedom " Mr. Bush pretends to uphold ---
Our Freedom exists only so long as our Choice , represented by our Vote , is properly counted .
So , it was the 24th of January , 2004 , eh ?
On the 25th of January , 2004 , I too was born as " OnePerson MakingADifference " .
On that day , I hit send , and hundreds of people received the following message from knowbush@msn.com : Welcome to the Inaugural Message of
Know Bush
Based on the belief that The Truth Shall Set You Free .
As an introduction , you know me .
I am your friend , your neighbor , your family , your customer , someone I 've shared moments with .
We probably do n't agree on everything , but we 've smiled together .
All I ask is that you , and the people you share this with , be open and willing to know more than you have , and vote .
It has never been more important .
( So now keep reading ... )
Today 's Fact is :
When Bush went to Ground Zero shortly after September 11 , he threw his arm around a tired , retired firefighter at the scene and assured him and the other rescue workers he was with them .
In August 2002 , he pocket vetoed $ 150 million in emergency first responder grants .
Thank you for paying attention .
Now pass it on .
So , Brad , I guess there was something in the air ( and not on the airwaves ) .
And I look forward to the day we can truly celebrate our successes because enough people have realized their responsibility in demanding that we keep that Democratic Republic alive :
Yes we 're going to a party party
Yes we 're going to a party party
Yes we 're going to a party party .
HAPPY BIRTHDAY !

Last week , I posted about California ’s proposed Big Brother Thermostat proposal , where they were planning to mandate that all new thermostats allowed the state utility companies to shut off your A/C if it was an “ emergency ” .
They ’ve backed down on this one , but only slightly :
As initially proposed , these programmable thermostats would have deferred in emergencies to a radio signal from utilities , wresting control from customers .
After public protests , Chandler said the commission staff has suggested letting customers choose whether to accept the emergency control . …
“ The consumer or customer can override the emergency control , ” with the change , Chandler said . …
However , the thermostat will still include a radio control component that utilities could use with consumers ’ consent .
That component will be a mandatory part of the thermostat , which ca n’t be removed by the consumer .
Critics say they fear that requiring new homes to include a radio - controlled thermostat will make it easier to enforce mandatory controls later .
Fundamentally , nothing has changed .
They still have decided to take control of your thermostat , and I think the critics ’ point is quite valid .
This is n’t the end of the road .
When major power grabs do n’t work , you take minor power grabs .
The destination does n’t change , only the length of the step .
What I said last week does n’t change .
If you get stuck with one of these thermostats , disable it .
And even though they ’ve softened their position , you should still contact your representative .
We all know that this is but one step on a defined path for the regulators , and it is still important to let them know you ’re not fooled .
Taking the exit polls that CNN has posted for the South Carolina Democratic primary , Obama pulled 24 % of the non-black vote , which made up about 45 % of the democratic votes cast in SC .
On a day when Edwards supporters are feeling disappointed and dejected there 's a bit of good news .
Nobody has mentioned that John Edwards came in second among non-black voters , pulling about 5 % more than Hillary Clinton .
OpEdNews did a statistical analysis of the exit poll data CNN reported here , looking at the vote by race and age chart .
We found that , combining the age ranges , Edwards pulled 51.1 % and Hillary pulled 48.9 % of the non-black voters who did not vote for Obama .
The numbers are close , but since these are exit polls , with a much bigger sample size , they mean something .
Who knows what this means ?
Can Edwards use this in some way to build his case for Super - Tuesday ?
Does it suggest that in states where the black population is lower , like California , Edwards will do much better , at least , than Hillary ?
What do you think ?
Welcome to Fortress Britain , a fortress that will keep people in as well as out .
Welcome to a state that requires you to answer 53 questions before you 're allowed to take a day trip to Calais .
Welcome to a country where you will be stopped , scanned and searched at any of 250 railways stations , filmed at every turn , barked at by a police force whose behaviour has given rise to a doubling in complaints concerning abuse and assaults .
Three years ago , this would have seemed hysterical and Home Office ministers would have been writing letters of complaint .
But it is a measure of how fast and how far things have gone that it does nothing more than describe the facts as announced last week .
We now accept with apparent equanimity that the state has the right to demand to know , among other things , how your ticket has been paid for , the billing address of any card used , your travel itinerary and route , your email address , details of whether your travel arrangements are flexible , the history of changes to your travel plans plus any biographical information the state deems to be of interest or anything the ticket agent considers to be of interest .
There is no end to Whitehall 's information binge .
The krill of personal data is being scooped up in ever - increasing quantities by a state that harbours a truly bewildering fear of the free , private and self - determined individual , who may want to take himself off to Paris without someone at home knowing his movements or his credit card number .
Combined with the ID card information , which comes on stream in a few years ' time , the new travel data means there will be very little the state wo n't be able to find out about you .
The information will be sifted for patterns of travel and expenditure .
Conclusions will be drawn from missed planes , visits extended , illness and all the accidents of life , and because this is a government database , there will be huge numbers of mistakes that will lead to suspicion and action being taken against innocent people .
Those failing to provide satisfactory answers will not be allowed to travel and then it will come to us with a leaden regret that we have in practice entered the era of the exit visa , a time when we must ask permission from a security bureaucrat who insists on further and better particulars in the biographical section of the form .
Ten , 15 or more years on , we will be resigned to the idea that the state decides whether we travel or not .
Who pays for the £ 1.2 bn cost over the next decade ?
You will , with additional charges made by your travel agent and in a new travel tax designed to recoup the cost of the data collection .
But much of the money will go to Raytheon Systems , the US company that developed the cruise missile and which , no coincidence , has embedded itself in Labour 's information project by supporting security research at the party 's favourite think - tank , the Institute for Public Policy Research .
The odour that arises from the Home Office contract with Raytheon is as nothing compared to that created last week when the Home Secretary and Prime Minister used the announcement of the ' E - borders ' scheme as well as increased security at shopping centres , airports and railway stations to create an atmosphere that would push MPs to double the time a terrorist suspect can be held without trial .
It also helped to divert attention from the mess in another Home Office database concerning upwards of 10,000 security guards who may be illegal immigrants .
On detention without trial , no new arguments have been produced by Gordon Brown .
He wo n't say how many days he wants and he wo n't answer David Davis , the shadow Home Secretary , who points out that all the necessary powers to keep people in jail after a large - scale attack are provided in the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 .
To this , Brown replies that declaring a state of emergency would give terrorists ' the oxygen of publicity ' .
How does he square this absurd statement with the high alert being sounded by police , politicians and spies over the past two weeks , which has given the greatest possible publicity to the power of the Muslim extremists to change our lives ?
The truth is that while his government limps , heaves and splutters with an incompetence only matched by its unearthly sense of entitlement , the Prime Minister has become fixated with this issue as though it were a virility test .
So his chief Security Minister , Lord West of Spithead , who had voiced his doubts about raising detention without trial on Radio 4 , was hauled into Number 10 to have his thoughts rearranged .
Less than an hour later , he appeared like an off - duty ballroom dancing champion and adjusted his conviction as though it was no more than a troublesome knot in his very plump , very yellow silk tie .
He will not resign of course .
What is a mere principle placed against his recent elevation to the Lords and the thrilling proximity to power ?
How have we allowed this rolling putsch against our freedom ?
Where are the principled voices from left and right , the outrage of playwrights and novelists , the sit-ins , the marches , the swelling public anger ?
We have become a nation that tolerates a diabetic patient collapsed in a coma being tasered by police , the jailing of a silly young woman for writing her jihadist fantasies in verse and an illegal killing by police that was prosecuted under health and safety laws .
Is it simply that the fear of terrorism has stunned us ?
The threat is genuine and the government is right to step up some security measures , but let us put it into perspective by reminding ourselves that in the period since 7/7 , about 6,000 people have been killed on our roads .
And let 's not forget the bombings , assassinations , sieges , machine - gunning of restaurants and slaughter that occurred on mainland Britain during the IRA campaign .
We survived these without giving up our freedoms .
Or is there some greater as yet undefined malaise that allows a sinister American corporation to infiltrate the fabric of government and supply a system that will monitor everyone going abroad ?
I cannot say , but I do know that an awful lot depends on the 40 or so Labour MPs needed to defeat Brown 's proposals on pre-trial detention .
They should be given every encouragement to defy the whips on the vote , which is expected within the next fortnight
It is important that the press has moved to the side of liberty .
The Daily Mail , which I wrongly excluded from the roll of honour last week , attacked Jacqui Smith for ' her utter contempt for privacy ' and warned against the travel delays and inevitable failure of another expensive government database .
And Timothy Garton
Ash , who has so far stayed above the fray , wrote in the Guardian last week that 'we have probably diminished our own security by overreacting , alienating some who might not otherwise have been alienated ' .
Labour MPs should listen to these voices .
The Prime Minister is found of quoting Churchill , so I will again : ' If you will not fight for the right when you can easily win without bloodshed , if you will not fight when your victory will be sure and not costly , you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all the odds against you and only precarious chance for survival .'

Apparently , the New World is n't all that intrepid explorer Christopher Columbus discovered ; seems we may also have him to thank for spreading the pathogen that causes syphilis — along with news of the Americas — to Europe .
A new study provides what scientists say is the most convincing evidence to date that the Italian adventurer and some of his crew contracted the disease during their voyage to the New World — and unwittingly introduced it to the old one circa 1493 .
The research culminates centuries of debate over whether the disease stemmed from bacteria that originated in the Old or New worlds .
Researchers from Emory University in Atlanta report in the online journal PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases that they used phylogenetics — the study of the evolutionary link between organisms — to study 26 geographically scattered strains of a family of bacteria known as Treponemes , which are behind the sexually transmitted disease syphilis as well as related nonvenereal infections such as yaws .
They found that the venereal syphilis - causing strains arose relatively recently in humans and are closely related to an ancient infection isolated in South America that gives rise to yaws .
" That supports the hypothesis that syphilis — or some progenitor — came from the New World , " said lead study author Kristin Harper , an Emory molecular genetics researcher .
According to the researchers , the origin of syphilis has been hotly debated since the first recorded epidemic of the disease in Europe in 1495 .
Most of the scientific evidence in recent years had been gleaned from the bones of members of past civilizations in both the Old and New worlds ; bones were considered credible markers since chronic syphilis causes skeletal lesions .
But skeletal analysis was hobbled by an inability to accurately determine bone age and a lack of supporting epidemiological evidence .
Another potential hitch is that Treponema bacteria cause disorders that share similar symptoms but are transmitted differently .
Syphilis is sexually transmitted , for instance , whereas yaws and endemic syphilis are tropical conditions that are spread by skin - to - skin or oral contact .
One hypothesis is that Treponema subspecies from the tropical Americas morphed into the more virulent venereal , syphilis - causing strains to survive in the cooler European climes .
Scientists say the study is significant because of the large number of strains analyzed , including two species of yaws found in isolated inhabitants of Guyana in South America .
" Syphilis was a major killer in Europe during the Renaissance , " said co-author George Armelagos , a skeletal biologist at Emory who has been studying syphilis for three decades .
" Understanding its evolution is important not just for biology , but for understanding social and political history .
It could be argued that syphilis is one of the most important early examples of globalization and disease , and globalization remains an important factor in emerging diseases . "
LUNAR ECLIPSE LUNAR ECLIPSE FOR MORE INFORMATION FOR MORE INFORMATION
News from SPACE.com Science and space news on USATODAY.com On Wednesday night , Feb. 20 , for the third time in the past year , the moon will become completely immersed in the Earth 's shadow , resulting in a total lunar eclipse .
As is the case with all lunar eclipses , the region of visibility will encompass more than half of our planet .
Nearly a billion people in the Western Hemisphere , more than 1.5 billion in Europe and Africa , and perhaps another half - billion in western Asia will be able to watch — weather permitting — as the brilliant mid-winter full moon becomes a shadow of its former self and morphs into a glowing coppery ball .
Almost everyone in the Americas and Western Europe will have a beautiful view of this eclipse if bad weather does n't spoil the show .
The moon will be high in a dark evening sky as viewed from most of the United States and Canada while most people are still awake and about .
Local conditions
The only problematic area will be along the Oregon and northern California coast , where the first partial stage of the eclipse will already be underway when the moon rises and the sun sets on Wednesday evening .
But if you have an open view low to the east , even this situation will only add to the drama , for as twilight fades , these far - Westerners will see the shadow - bitten moon coming into stark view low above the landscape .
And by late twilight observers will have a fine view of the totally eclipsed lunar disk glowing red and dim low in the eastern sky .
Alaskans will also see the moon rise during the eclipse ; in fact , much of western Alaska will see the moon rise while completely immersed in the Earth 's shadow .
For Hawaiians , moonrise unfortunately comes just after the end of totality , with the moon gradually ascending the sky and its gradual emergence from the shadow readily visible .
Western Europe and Africa also will get a good view of the eclipse , but at a less convenient time : before dawn on Thursday morning , Feb. 21 .
Total triangle Moreover , this eclipse comes with a rare bonus .
The planet Saturn ( magnitude +0.2 ) and the bright bluish star , Regulus ( magnitude + 1.4 ) will form a broad triangle with the moon 's ruddy disk .
Careful watchers will notice the moon changing its position with respect to the star and planet as it moves eastward through the Earth 's shadow .
Saturn 's position will also depend somewhat on your location .
Seen from North America , the great ringed planet will be 3.5 degrees above and to the left of the moon 's center at mid-totality ( 3:26 Universal time February 21st ) .
At the same moment , Regulus will sit just 2.8 degrees above and to the right of the moon .
Some old - time astronomy buffs may remember from 40 years ago a total lunar eclipse with the moon sitting only about a degree from Spica — a gorgeous celestial tableau !
More recently , in 1996 , a totally eclipsed moon passed within 2 degrees of Saturn .
But this upcoming double event will be the only one of its kind occurring within the next millennium !
Colors and brightness
There is nothing complicated about how to view this celestial spectacle .
Unlike an eclipse of the sun , which necessitates special viewing precautions in order to avoid eye damage , an eclipse of the moon is perfectly safe to watch .
All you 'll need to watch are your eyes , but binoculars or a telescope will give a much nicer view .
A careful description of the colors seen on the totally eclipsed moon and their changes is valuable .
The hues depend on the optical equipment used , usually appearing more vivid with the naked eye than in telescopes .
The French astronomer , Andre Danjon , introduced the following five - point scale of lunar luminosity ( " L " ) to classify eclipses : L = 0 : Very dark eclipse , moon almost invisible , especially in mid-totality .
L = 1 : Dark eclipse , gray or brownish coloration , details distinguishable only with difficulty .
L = 2 : Deep red or rust - colored eclipse , with a very dark central part in the shadow , and outer edge of the umbra relatively bright .
L = 3 : Brick red eclipse , usually with a bright or yellow rim to the shadow .
L = 4 : Very bright copper-red or orange eclipse , with a bluish very bright shadow rim .
Examine the moon at mid-totality and also near the beginning and end of totality to get an impression of both the inner and outer umbra .
At mid-totality , the darkness of the sky is very impressive .
Faint stars , which were completely washed - out by the brilliant moonlight prior to the eclipse , become visible and the surrounding landscape takes on a somber hue .
As totality ends , the eastern edge of the moon begins to emerge from the umbra , and the sequence of events repeats in reverse order until the spectacle is over .
Unless airborne volcanic aerosols or other unusual atmospheric effects influence its appearance , the moon 's disk should appear moderately bright , especially right around the beginning and end of totality .
The lower part of the moon will likely appear brightest and glowing a ruddy or coppery hue , while the upper half of the moon should look more gray or chocolate in color .
Eclipse schedule
The eclipse will begin when the moon enters the faint outer portion , or penumbra of the Earth 's shadow .
The penumbra , however , is all but invisible to the eye until the moon becomes deeply immersed in it .
Sharp - eyed viewers may get their first glimpse of the penumbra as a delicate shading on the left part of the moon 's disk about 20 minutes before the start of the partial eclipse ( when the round edge of the central shadow or umbra , first touches the moon 's left edge ) .
During the partial eclipse , the penumbra should be readily visible as a dusky border to the dark umbral shadow .
The moon will enter Earth 's much darker umbral shadow at 1:43 on Feb. 21 by Greenwich or Universal time , which is 8:43 p.m. on Feb. 20 in the Eastern time zone , 7:43 p.m. Central time , 6:43 p.m. Mountain time and 5:43 p.m. Pacific time .
Seventy - eight minutes later the moon is entirely within the shadow , and sails on within it for 51 minutes ( about average for a total lunar eclipse ) , until it begins to find its way out at the lower left ( southeastern ) edge .
The moon be completely free of the umbra by 9:09 p.m. Pacific time or 12:09 a.m. ( Feb. 21 ) Eastern time .
The vaguer shading of the inner penumbra can continue to be readily detected for perhaps another 20 minutes or so after the end of umbral eclipse .
Thus , the whole experience ends toward 12:30 a.m. for the East ( with the re-brightened moon now sloping down along the high arc it describes across the sky ) , or during the mid-evening hours for the West .
For Europe and Africa , the mid-point of this eclipse occurs roughly between midnight and dawn on the morning of Feb. 21 , and as such the moon will still be well placed in the western sky .
At the moment of mid-totality ( 3:26 UT ) , the moon will stand directly overhead from a point in the Atlantic Ocean roughly several hundred miles to the northeast of the coast of Suriname .
There will be a partial eclipse of the moon that will be visible across much of Europe and Asia on the night of Aug. 16 - 17 .
About 81 % of the moon 's diameter will become immersed in the umbra , leaving only the upper part of the moon visible .
In 2009 , there will be four lunar eclipses , one a slight partial and the three others which will be of the penumbral variety meaning that at best only a vague hint of a light shading or smudginess on the moon 's disk might be detected — if anything at all .
But not until Dec. 21 , 2010 will there be another total lunar eclipse ; that one too will again favor the Americas .
So although we 've had a veritable plethora of total eclipses of late , keep in mind that after next Wednesday , you 'll have to wait almost three years until your next chance to see another .

Yepsen : Obama 's Superb Speech Could Catapult His Bid Obama speech was ' moving ' and separated him from the pack , writes David Yepsen .
Nov. 12 , 2007  --
The six leading Democratic presidential candidates showed up for the Iowa Democratic Party 's big Jefferson Jackson Dinner on Saturday night , and five of them gave very good speeches .
Barack Obama 's was excellent .
It was one of the best of his campaign .
The passion he showed should help him close the gap on Hillary Clinton by tipping some undecided caucusgoers his way .
His oratory was moving , and he successfully contrasted himself with the others — especially Clinton — without being snide or nasty about it .
That was an important thing for him to do .
Historically , the Iowa party 's " JJ " dinner is a landmark event in Democratic presidential caucus campaigns .
All the key party activists , donors and players are present .
This year , about 9,000 of them showed up .
( Most were from Iowa , though there was some grumbling that Obama packed the place with ringers from Illinois .
Joe Biden even greeted them in his speech .
The charge that they brought in outsiders was denied by the Obama people , who were nevertheless pleased they beat the other candidates in the noise war inside Veterans Memorial Auditorium . )
What 's important is n't the hoopla .
It 's what the candidate does on the stage and while all did quite well , Obama was particularly impressive .
Should he come from behind to win the Iowa caucuses , Saturday 's dinner will be remembered as one of the turning points in his campaign here .
For example :
• He said the Iraq war " should have never been authorized and should have never been waged , " a shot at the votes Clinton and most of the others cast in favor of it .
• Obama took another dig at the Clinton era when he said " we have a chance to bring the country together to tackle problems that George Bush made far worse and that festered long before George Bush took office . "
• He tweaked Clinton for not taking questions at some of her events by saying : " Not answering questions because we 're afraid our answers just wo n't be popular just wo n't do it . "
( Clinton is also currently vexed by controversy over her staff trying to plant questions with Iowans . )
• He said that " telling Americans what they think they want to hear instead of telling the American people what they need to hear just wo n't do it . "
Translation : Obama is often inclined to say things party interest groups do n't want to hear , like the need for school reform , merit pay negotiated with teachers ' unions , more efficient cars or money to rebuild the military .
There were other contrasts , but his coup de grace came with this : " When I am the nominee of this party , the Republican nominee will not be able to say I voted for the war in Iraq , or that I gave George Bush the benefit of the doubt on Iran , or that I support Bush - Cheney policies of not talking to leaders that we do n't like . "
Obama also asked Democrats to move to a new era in their party .
He said : " I do n't want to spend the next year or the next four years refighting the same fights that we had in the 1990s , " a reference to the polarization of the Clinton years .
" I do n't want to pit red America against blue America , " he added .
Obama also did something else he rarely does :
He invoked Martin Luther King Jr. and adopted the cadence and uplifting touches of a traditional black preacher 's sermon .
His speech was also noteworthy because of the hour it was given and the poor timing .
He did n't start until after 11 p.m. and was the last one to speak — after most of the crowd had been sitting for four hours .
That 's because the Iowa party did a disservice to the candidates by also loading up the program with Iowa politicians .
They just are n't in the same league with their presidential candidates .
For a lover of political oratory , it was a little like listening to a long Beethoven symphony while having some kid play a Tonette between movements .
Alabama station drops broadcast of 60 Minutes expose on political prosecution scandal Larisa Alexandrovna

Print This Email This Update : Station 's president issues statement Stan Pylant , President & General Manager of WHNT Channel 19 issued the following statement to RAW STORY Monday morning : Sunday night at approximately 6 pm , WHNT lost the network feed of 60 Minutes for twelve minutes at the beginning of a segment on former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman .
Upon investigation , WHNT learned that our station 's CBS receiver that allows us to receive programming from the CBS network 's feed failed .
WHNT engineers responded as quickly as possible to diagnose the problem and were able to restore the feed at 6:12 pm .
WHNT aired the segment in its entirety last night at 10:15 pm during our late news and it is currently posted on WHNT.com as well .
We apologize to all of our Tennessee Valley viewers for the interruption and we can assure you there was no intent whatsoever to keep anyone from seeing the broadcast .
CBS 's 60 Minutes broadcast Sunday regarding the alleged political prosecution of Democratic Alabama governor Don Siegelman went dark in the northern third of Alabama last night .
According to WHNT - TV , the local CBS affiliate , the issue was caused by a technical malfunction .
" We apologize that you missed the first segment of 60 Minutes tonight featuring a report titled , ' The Prosecution of Don Siegelman , ' " a WHNT story said .
CBS News  which owns 60 Minutes  denied any problem on their end .
Scott Horton of Harpers magazine reported late last night that CBS was directly pointing back at the local outlets as the cause of the problem .
" I contacted CBS News in New York and was told that ' there is no delicate way to put this : the WHNT claim is not true .
There were no transmission difficulties .
The problems were peculiar to Channel 19 , which had the signal and had functioning transmitters . '
I was told that the decision to blacken screens across Northern Alabama ' could only have been an editorial call . ' "
WHNT , Channel 19 of Huntsville , Alabama , issued a press release shortly after the broadcast .
We apologize that you missed the first segment of 60 Minutes tonight featuring " The Prosecution of Don Siegelman . "
It was a techincal ( sic ) problem with CBS out of New York .
We are working ( click to read rest ) with them right now to see if we can re-broadcast the segment .
Please be patient with us during this time .
We are doing our best to correct the problem .
After Horton 's report , Channel 19 issued another account of the problem :
We apologize that you missed the first segment of 60 Minutes tonight featuring a report titled , " The Prosecution of Don Siegelman . "
NewsChannel 19 lost our program feed from CBS .
Upon investigation , WHNT has learned that the CBS receiver that allows us to receive programming from CBS failed .
WHNT engineers responded as quickly as possible to restore the feed at 6:12 p.m .
Our sincere apologies to our viewers across the Tennessee Valley .
The network re-aired the broadcast during their 10 pm news .
The interview is available on the CBS website .
The White House has put pressure on CBS to kill the show , those close to the case say .
Journalists covering the story have been attacked .
The case 's most prominent whistleblower , Dana Jill Simpson , recently testified to Congress , under oath , about Rove 's involvement in politicizing the Bush Justice Department .
Her house mysteriously caught fire after she came forward .
WHNT in Huntsville Alabama was purchased by Oak Hill Capital Partners from the New York Times Company early last year .
Oak Hill is owned by the Bass brothers , Bush fundraisers at the " Pioneer " level  raising over $ 100,000 for the Bush - Cheney campaigns in both 2000 and 2004 .
Lee Bass is perhaps the best known member of the Bass family for his role in George W. Bushs failed energy venture called Spectrum 7 and later for his bailing out of Harken Energy .
The Oak Hill connection emerged last night on Democratic Underground .
RAW STORY has been at the front of the Siegelman story , and was the first to reveal detailed information about former Bush Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove 's role in the scandal .
The 60 Minutes broadcast , along with our most recent story , appears below .
Lobbyist pressured to recant story about Abramoff meeting Rove on street corner Part I of this series explored the long - term involvement of two men -- GOP consultant Bill Canary and Alabama Attorney General William Pryor -- in the events leading to the imprisonment last summer of former Alabama Democratic governor Don Siegelman .
That train of events began in 1998 , when Canary managed Pryor 's campaign for re-election as Alabama attorney general .
Immediately afterwards ,
Pryor began the investigation of Siegelman that eventually led to the newly - elected governor 's conviction on corruption charges in 2006 .
Canary 's wife , Leura Canary , federalized Pryor 's investigation in 2001 , after President George W. Bush appointed her as US Attorney for the Middle District of Alabama .
Closely tied to Pryor , whose campaign was advised by her husband , Canary also appointed the wife of the Attorney General 's lawyer and close advisor , Christopher Weller , as her first assistant .
As Canary 's investigation proceeded , Siegelman 's potential Republican challengers began to hammer him hard on ethics issues , drawing heavily on leaks from the Pryor and Canary investigations to do so .
In a letter to the Department of Justice requesting Leura Canary 's recusal , Siegelman 's lawyer noted that he had traced the leaks to a source in Bill Canary 's office .
There is no evidence that the Justice Department ever investigated any of these leaks .
In the 2002 race for Alabama governor , Bill Canary advised the campaign of Siegelman 's Republican opponent , Rep. Bob Riley .
Pryor ensured Riley 's victory in that extremely close race when he declared that unsealing the ballots for a recount would be a crime .
The following April , Pryor was nominated by George W. Bush to serve as a federal judge on the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals .
He was eventually installed by a recess appointment , against the objections of Senate Democrats .
Bill Canary , Karl Rove , and the 2002 Elections Karl Rove is known to have worked with Bill Canary on numerous political races in Alabama , beginning in 1994 and including William Pryor 's campaign in 1998 .
Canary and Pryor both enjoyed a close political and social relationship with Rove  who went on to become a senior adviser to the president , before Bush 's " brain " resigned earlier this year .
Two Republican lawyers who have asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation allege that Canary and Rove also worked together on the 2002 Alabama governor 's race .
One of the lawyers is close to the Republican National Committee in Alabama .
According to the lawyers , Rove and Canary initially supported Republican Lieutenant Governor Steve Windom in his bid for the nomination to challenge Governor Siegelman but then switched their allegiance to Rep.
Bob Riley after his victory in the primary .
The Windom campaign was well known to be sluggish , however , prompting many observers to wonder just how serious an undertaking it really was .
By 2002 , George W. Bush was president and Karl Rove was working in the White House as his special assistant with the highest level of security clearances .
Rove , however , did not lose his security clearances , even after he was identified as one of the sources in the CIA leak case , in which the cover of covert CIA officer , Valerie Plame Wilson was exposed to journalists in 2003 as an apparent act of reprisal against her husband Joseph Wilson .
Rove could not be reached for comment for this article .
A call placed to the White House for forwarding information was answered but not returned .
Windom , after being told about the article and the name of this publication , said , " Im not interested , thanks . 
According to the Alabama RNC source , Rove met regularly with operatives for the Riley campaign .
The source 's allegations are confirmed in part by campaign disclosure forms , which show that Windom paid Canary as a consultant between 1999 and early 2001 and later received large contributions from Canary 's business partner , a pattern that is duplicated with Riley and Canary .
According to public records , Windom paid Canary 's firm $ 38,022 for consulting and polling between 1999 and 2001 .
At the same time , PACs associated with Canary 's business partner , Patrick McWhorter , donated heavily to Windom 's campaign , contributing $ 149,000 in 2001 and another $ 75,000 in 2002 .
After Windom lost the primary , PACs associated with McWhorter and Canary switched their donations to Bob Riley , giving him $ 85,000 in the days immediately preceding the November election .
After the election victory , Windom emerged immediately as a close confidant of Riley's , advising him on the appointment of a new Insurance Commissioner , Walter A. Bell , and other matters .
Canary also emerged as a key Riley advisor .
Public records also show that at the same time Canary was consulting for Bob Riley 's campaign , his lobbying group , the Business Council for Alabama , donated $ 678,000 to the campaign of his client .
This was the third largest donation the campaign received , exceeded only by those from the Republican National State Elections Committee , for $ 2,475,000 , and from Bob Riley himself , who contributed $ 1,070,000 to his own campaign .
Rove on the Corner Rove 's meetings with Riley campaign operatives are said to have taken place on street corners in Washington at prearranged times .
" Riley 's people went up to DC and had a couple of meetings with [ Rove ] , " one of the Republican attorneys stated .
In addition , Rove and his wife purchased a property in Rosemary Beach , Florida in November of 2002 , about 2 - 1/ 2 hour drive from Alabamas capital 
Montgomery , a little over an hour 's drive from Mobile , and less than an hour by jet .
" He would never discuss anything on the phone .
He would tell you to meet him at some corner and then you get there and sure enough he is standing in the middle of the intersection waving at you . "
Riley did not return calls seeking comment .
These allegations are similar to those made by consultant Marc Schwartz in The Architect : Karl Rove and the Master Plan for Absolute Power by James Moore and Wayne Slater , describing a meeting that took place in March of 2002 : " I gotta meet Rove , " Jack Abramoff told Schwartz one afternoon as they talked in the backseat of the lobbyist 's car .
Abramoff 's driver , Joseph , was working his way through the crowded streets of Washington .
The lobbyist gave Joseph a location for a rendezvous , and he set a course in the direction of the White House .
" Really ? " Schwartz asked .
" We 're going to the White House ? "
" No . No .
We do n't do that , " Abramoff answered .
" Why not ? " Schwartz joked .
" I 'm sure George would want to see me . "
He explained to Schwartz why they were not going to see Karl Rove at the White House .
" They 've got movement logs over there and everything , and we like to keep things kind of quiet .
So just watch .
You 'll really get a kick out of it . "
A few minutes later , Abramoff pointed through the front windshield at an approaching street corner and turned to smile at Schwartz .
" You recognize him ? " the lobbyist asked his client .
" Son of a bitch , " Schwartz muttered .
" He 's just out in the middle of the street . "
" Uh - huh . "
Moore told RAW STORY that Schwartz tried to backtrack on his remarks after his book 's publication .
" After telling us a story with great detail about being in a car with Jack Abramoff as he met with Karl Rove on a Washington street corner , Marc Schwartz then clammed up , " Moore said last week .
" When our book , The Architect , was published and national news political correspondents realized Schwartz had told the only first hand story of a meeting between Rove and Abramoff , Schwartz began to get phone calls .
" His approach was to dissemble and deny his own words , which was not very productive since we were in possession of notes and the conversation had been recorded , " Moore added .
" He got numerous calls from network television news producers but refused to sit for a TV interview citing concerns about his business and professional life in El Paso , claiming GOP political connections in his work that Rove could pressure to harm Schwartz 's income . "
The Hatch Act Under the Hatch Act of 1939 , federal employees are prohibited from engaging in partisan political activity .
The Act provides an exemption , however , for an employee paid from an appropriation for the Executive Office of the President .
According to former Nixon counsel and legal Scholar John Dean , Rove would have been exempt .
" The Hatch Act does not apply to the president 's immediate staff , " Dean told RAW STORY last week .
Marthena Cowart , Director of Communications for the Project for Government Oversight , concurred , saying in an early Thursday phone conversation that " it is because [ Karl Rove ] is paid via the Appropriations Committees , so yes , he would be exempt . "
Yet the Hatch Act was one reason given by the White House to explain why email accounts on Republican National Committee servers were used by White House senior aides in preference to White House email accounts  they claimed they did n't want to use federal resources for political campaigns .
Although the use of these these accounts had been known for some time , they came under increased scrutiny last April as a result of the US Attorneys scandal " because some White House aides used them to help plan the U.S. attorneys ' ouster .
Democrats were questioning whether the use of the GOP - provided e-mail accounts was proof that the firings were political . "
" The Republican National Committee set up the accounts for about 20 Bush aides , such as Karl Rove and his deputies , who get involved in politics , spokesman Scott Stanzel told AP earlier this year .
" Having the GOP create non-White House addresses and provide separate BlackBerries , laptops and other communications gear was designed to avoid running afoul of Hatch Act rules barring federal employees from engaging in political activities with government resources or on government time , " he added .
Rove 's resignation had no effect on the ongoing Office of Special Counsel probe of alleged Hatch Act violations , however a spokesman noted , " Once a person leaves government service , they are out of our jurisdiction . "
A Web of Rovian Connections Since most of the Riley campaign 's services were provided by local Alabama firms , the few payments it made to companies that operated on a national level stand out sharply .
The most eye - catching of these is a payment of $ 100,000 in November 2002 , which went to Mentzer Media Services of Towson , MD for a last - minute advertising campaign .
A very similar payment of $ 85,000 had gone to the same firm from Steve Windom 's campaign just before the June 2002 primary .
Mentzer Media is best known for having handled the advertising for the two most prominent attack groups of the 2004 presidential election -- the Progress for America Voter Fund and the Swift Boat Veterans .
Progress for America was founded in 2001 by Tony Feather , a former Bush - Cheney 2000 political director who had known Karl Rove since the 1970's and had worked with him on political campaigns in the 1980's and 1990's .
During the year leading up to the 2004 elections , PFA solicited soft - money donations and poured $ 29 million into supporting Bush 's reelection campaign , $ 27 million of which went to Mentzer Media .
Most of that was spent on a massive last - minute advertising campaign featuring an ad in which Bush comforted a girl whose father had died on 9/11 .
Almost as much -- $ 19 million -- was paid to Mentzer by the Swift Boat Veterans for ads attacking John Kerry .
The Swift Boat Veterans and PFA were linked in other ways besides their use of Mentzer Media , both employing the same legal expert on election law and the same media advisor .
There were widespread suspicions at the time that Rove was closer to both groups than campaign laws allowed .
For example , the New York Times noted that the primary backers of the Swift Boat Veterans were wealthy Texans , including " two men with ties to the president and his family -- one a longtime political associate of Mr. Rove 's .
... Mr. Rove , Mr. Bush 's top political aide , recently said through a spokeswoman that he and Mr. [ Bob ]
Perry were longtime friends , though he said they had not spoken for at least a year .
Mr. Rove and Mr. Perry have been associates since at least 1986 , when they both worked on the gubernatorial campaign of Bill Clements . "
Salon.com further pointed out that " Rove had already convinced Perry to begin raising money to elect state judges -- funds used to help launch the Texas Civil Justice League .
The Civil Justice League was Rove 's initial surrogate organization and carried the message that trial lawyers were bad people who were screwing up the business climate with frivolous lawsuits .
The chorus singing about the evils of lawyers in Texas was later joined by Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse ( an organization that Rove helped grow and with which he maintains close contact today ) , and yet another front group called Texans for Lawsuit Reform .
...
Thus an entirely artificial movement , conceived and funded by Rove , was used to change the state 's judicial system and , of course , became an essential step in Rove 's master plan to elect Bush governor and then president . "
When Karl Rove started working with William Canary in Alabama in 1994 , it was as a direct extension of the strategy for electing pro-corporate Republican judges that he had begun in Texas .
Rove 's first major victory in Alabama was the election of Judge Perry Hooper in a race that was decided only after a year - long legal battle resulted in the disqualification of 2000 absentee ballot , making Hooper the victor by a mere 262 votes .
When viewed in the context of a long - term plan to make the Republican Party dominant in Alabama , events in that state in 2002 take on the appearance of being as much a part of what Salon calls " Rove 's master plan " as any in Texas .
Beyond that , the electoral strategy that was carried out in Alabama in 2002 might be seen as a trial run for Rove 's successful national election strategy of 2004 .

Though my beat is usually Japan , this item from China was just too weird to pass up .
How weird is too weird ?
Try " beyond Japanese weird " , and that 's saying something !
The Breast Massage Robot is the subject of a patent application for a robotic device which , according to the developers , is " capable to give physical massage to human breast the way professional massagers do . "
Wait a minute , there are professional breast massagers ??
I do n't recall taking that college course ... at least , not on campus .
Maybe I 'm wrong , but bizarre breast products seem to be designed by men while practical breast products are designed by women ... that sounds about right , actually .
In this case , the designer is listed on the patent application as " Wang Wei " - no snickering , please - and though I can't say whether Wang is male or female , I 'm confident it 's the former .
I can just imagine Wang and his group of nerdy interns , burning the midnight oil as they struggle to strap their Breast Massage Robot prototype onto a pilfered store mannequin ... what , you thought they 'd test it on a live girl ??
Dollars to donuts , Wang & Co. rarely get out of Mom 's basement long enough to even talk to a real woman .
Or be slapped by one , which would be the likely result of any testing requests .
But I digress .
Let 's talk about the Breast Massage Robot .
More of a " Bra From Hell " than an actual robot , this scary - looking device somewhat resembles a pair of egg - beaters secured to a restrictive metal frame .
Ah yes , the ladies will be lining up to get their shot at Beelze - Boob !
Check it out :
Freaky ... pastel tints ( yes , tints ) notwithstanding .
But wait - according to Wang 's patent application , women want and need the Breast Massage Robot .
He lists , and I 've preserved his exact words , 8 different consumer groups identified through costly market research - which probably means they cruised the local market and accosted the female customers :
1. Girls who are reaching or having reached puberty , hope to improve the growth of breast .
2. Women who received surgery in the breast , desire to have a faster and better recovery .
3 . Mothers , who are nursing babies , want to release the pain and to accelerate the secretion of breast milk .
4 . Female who is having the period , want to release the swelling pain of breasts .
5. Women who want to lower the incidence of mastopathies .
6. Women , who are under pressure , want to relax themselves .
7. Women who want to improve the quality of their sex activities .
8. Women who want to have pretty breasts .
While it 's likely that many pubescent girls do indeed , who 's going to pay for the little princess 's er , growth inducer ?
Not likely .
He left the room so fast , the drop in air pressure made my ears pop .
I 'd like to give the Wang Gang the benefit of the doubt on this , but what post - operative woman is going to test her fresh stitches against The Breastinator ?
Starring Areola Schwarzenipple .
This sounded somewhat reasonable until it dawned on me thatperform the same function - without all the whirring , clanking and making you look ridiculous .
Gee , I always heard that a common side - effect of " that time of the month " was breast tenderness .
Maybe the tenderness comes from overuse of Wang 's Mangler .
Maybe I 'm being given a variation of the " headache " excuse .
Wang states that .
That 's a lot of mastopathies , whatever they are !
I 'm sure Wang & Associates have conducted extensive clinical trials to show that their soon - to - be - maybe - hopefully patented device does indeed lower the ...
Wang ?
He was here a minute ago ... As do we all .
But not like this .
Now you just KNOW a guy wrote this one in .
The same guy , by the way , who said that " love juice " is a great source of low - fat protein and also makes a wonderful face toner .
I 'm not that guy but truth be told , we 're all randy rascals who think alike .
I would imagine that would include , well , ALL women .
Come to think of it , all men as well ... that is , all men would like all women to have pretty breasts .
What did you think I meant ?
Anyway , it 's quite the list .
I personally think the Wangmeister ran out of target markets after number 5 but wanted to extend the list to 8 - the number of Business Prosperity in Chinese culture .
Sorry Dubya , even a list of 888 consumer groups wo n't make the Breast Massage Robot fly - though looking at those twin props , flying is definitely in the range of possibility .
Wang has provided a professionally shot grainy video so that whatever passes for a Patent Review Board in China is clear on the intended function of Wang 's Folly : to mechanically massage breasts while enlarging Wang 's , er , personal bank account .
Yep , I was right ...
Beijing People 's Department Store # 182 , we 've found your missing mannequin :
By the way , Wang 's company is officially known as the " Beijing BUBBY Robot Technologies CO. , LTD . "
Seriously .
I think it 's pronounced , .
Is n't that precious ?
You may have assumed that I 'm more than cynical about the success of Wang Wei's Breast Massage Robot , even if he somehow manages to get it patented .
Or find investors .
Stranger things have happened , and China is a newly industrialized nation whose people are longing to embrace modern technology .
China 's women , on the other hand , may decline to be embraced by the Motorized Melon Mauler .
In that case , it 's back to the drawing board for Wei Wang - led there , by the ear , by his Mom .

The men have now been released on bail
The men were arrested last year in a hotel room in the city of Bauchi .
Prosecutors read out a letter from New York based Human Rights Watch calling for the court to respect the men's right to " free association " .
The men were originally accused of sodomy , which could lead to the death penalty under Sharia , but the charges were reduced .
Prosecutor Yusuf Adamu said HRW was " grossly misinformed " about the case and invited a representative of the organisation to attend the trial .
Under Sharia law a man must dress like a man and woman must dress like a woman
Prosecutor Yusuf Adamu
The HRW letter was sent to the Federal Ministry of Justice in the capital , Abuja , who forwarded it on to the Bauchi state governor .
The letter said the Nigerian government had signed up to two conventions that enshrined the right to free association and freedom from harassment .
" Human Rights Watch is grossly misinformed .
This case is not about the right to free association , " Mr Yusuf said .
" Under Sharia law a man must dress like a man and woman must dress like a woman . "
The 18 are charged with indecent dressing and vagrancy .
When the letter was read out the defendants looked relieved and happy , the BBC's Shehu Saulawa in Bauchi says .
But prosecutors have asked the court to write a response to HRW which could now delay the case .
Ancient customs
In the west , this case has focused attention on Nigerian attitudes to homosexuality , which is illegal in the country .
But the BBC's Alex Last in Nigeria says perhaps it is more a reflection of current attitudes within northern Nigeria to old local customs .
They are largely engaged in doing what was considered to be women's ' work and could sometimes be hired as entertainers for parties .
Being a Dan Daudu , however , did not necessarily say much about a person 's sexual preferences , our correspondent says .
But eight years ago Nigeria 's northern states reintroduced some of the harsher penalties of Islamic law which had been removed under colonialism .
It was a response by politicians to a wave of popular discontent in the Islamic north against political corruption and social injustice .
This new tougher Sharia has largely failed to end such problems but there is now , perhaps , more of a willingness to target groups who appear to behave in ways that run counter to today 's more puritan practice of Islam , our correspondent says .
Prince Harry Fighting in Afghanistan - Drudge Report Blows His Cover ( Photos , Video )
, number three in line to the British throne , has been entrenched with the U.K.
Army in Afghanistan since December , according to the U.K. Ministry of Defense .
He has been fighting the Taliban for the past two months .
According to Chief of the General Staff , , Harry has been fully involved in operations and has received no special treatment .
The royal prince , age 23 , is the grandson of Queen Elizabeth , son of Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana .
The lieutenant has been in the British Army since 2005 .
His regiment went to Iraq last year and he was denied the opportunity to serve with his men .
Apparently that decision has been reversed , or was a diversionary tactic to ensure Harry 's safety on the battlefield .
The Drudge Report broke the news internationally on the heels of German newspaper Bild .
A women 's magazine , New Idea actually wrote about the situation in January .
They deny intentionally breaching a news blackout and the story went virtually unnoticed until this week .
Prince Harry has spent the last 10 weeks in the dangerous Helmand province , having arrived on Christmas Eve .
It is possible that his orders will be rescinded and he will be removed from the front lines , based upon the leak that has blown a carefully guarded secret .
" In deciding to deploy him to Afghanistan , it was my judgment that with an understanding with the media not to broadcast his whereabouts , the risk in doing ( so ) was manageable , " Dannatt said .
" Now that the story is in the public domain , the chief of staff and I will take advice from the operational commanders about whether his deployment can continue . "
World news reports on Friday morning indicate that Prince Harry is being removed from combat because the safety of his men has now been compromised .
We 've got more photos of Prince Harry and a video after the jump .
Check out Prince Harry on the video .
After months of sledging fellow Democratic candidate Barack Obama , Hillary Clinton has drawn a bead on a slightly more unusual target - her daughter 's profession .
During a scheduled economic discussion at a restaurant in the US state of Ohio on Tuesday , Senator Clinton rubbished wealthy investment bankers and hedge fund managers , saying they they were n't doing " real work " .
Senator Clinton 's daughter , Chelsea , works for New York - based hedge fund Avenue Capital Group and previously held a post with international management consulting group , McKinsey and Company .
Who is the Best Democrat Candidate , and why they should run as an independent if they do not get nominated .
( By a guy who hates the mainstream media ’s faked polls )
I ’ve given a lot of support to the Republican candidate Ron Paul .
I had to actually register as a republican to vote for him in the MD primary because thats where the real battle will be won or lost , basically I think that if Paul wins the nomination , he will win the presidency , which I also think no other person on the republican side can do .
But getting back on track here , I hate the idea of party affiliations because I feel it ’s stupid to vote for some one in your party out of some misguided loyalty .
Republicans vote republican , democrats vote democrat , I ’m not saying everyone does that , but a lot of people do and a two party system is what we currently have and are stuck with .
So let ’s ignore the important things like , you know , positions on the issues , Paul does n’t come off as being a total douche - bag like other so called ‘ front runners ’ .
But hold on one second Skippy , just because we got one good person who could get our country back on track running on the republican side , lets take a look at the Democrat side of things , shall we ?
Democratic Candidates :
We all want fair and balanced right ?
Well I ’ll have to be honest with you ( very few ) readers , I know very little about most of the democratic candidates because I ’ve been following the other side of things much more closely , so I ’m not going to cheat by looking up people on Google or Wiki and try to play it off like I know what the hell I ’m talking about , I ’ll just list them and tell you what I know , or think I know about them .
Sound fair ?
Stephen Colbert : Sorry , Steve , not this year , besides , I ’d have to vote for you on the republican ticket I saw you on… wait a second … I know your game sir , you want the nomination on both sides , Colbert Vs. Colbert .
Genius .
Simply Genius .
Hillary Clinton :
Was n’t she president once before ? … oh wait , that was he husband , my mistake .
Kidding aside , I thought bill did a pretty good job in office but could she ?
She supports , or pretends to support universal healthcare which is an idea I like .
We live in a time when no one should have to go without being able to get treatment just because they poorer than the next man .
But sorry Hillary ,
You ’ve been caught being dishonest on more than one occasion and I get the feeling that you would n’t end or prevent a spreading of this war just to maintain the status quo .
Mike Gravel : I have n’t heard much about him , if you do n’t have a group of supporters to promote your ideas then what do you have ?
Sorry Mike .
John Edwards : I rooted for him and Kerry last time around .
Sort of like I rooted for the democrats to win congress and hoped for some kind of change would happen , so much for that .
Anyway , I do n’t know why , but he reminds me of Al Gore .
I think that in another time and place , when we did n’t have so much controversy revolving around the election that this guy could get a nomination and win .
So , sorry John , it seems you are caught in a cross fire between the Mainstream media ’s insistence of a Giuliani vs. Clinton and all hardcore supporters of lesser known candidates trying to prevent that from happening .
Chris Dodd : Sorry , Chris who ?
Barack Obama : Darn you Mr Obama , for your first and last name was unrecognized by my spell checker .
( kidd )
I am very glad that there is n’t this huge issue with a black man running ( and doing it well ) for president .
He has some pretty good ideas on getting the public more involved in how the government is run , for example letting people review and comment on bills online before they get approved .
That would certainly improve things and I hope someone out there takes notice of those Ideas and actually runs with them .
But to me , he seems too much like a politician .
So again , sorry Barack , if I do n’t know if you say things because you truly believe them or if you say things you think people want to hear .
It ’s one thing to be a politician but it ’s something else to be seen as a politician .
Joe Biden : Why ?
From this limited exposure I seen of him , I ask myself why is he running ?
He ’s saying exactly what everyone else is , except that he does not stand out from the crowd .
I thought the idea was to run for president if you shared a different view than other people and hoped to garnish support for those views but I guess now it ’s supposed to be that five clones stand up and we are supposed to pick the best dressed one ?
Sorry Joe , I guess you ’re not looking to be president but maybe you ’re shooting for a vice presidency ?
To serve the nominee sort of like that mini-me character from austin powers movies .
Bill Richardson : I listened to him one night on T.V. speaking to collage kids .
Seems like a smart guy who know a thing or two .
Made some good points on the benefits of line item veto powers and why he supports them but he , like so many others , seems to be interested in continued middle - east conflict .
So , sorry Bill , I ’ve had enough of the sandbox .
Dennis Kucinich : ( Dramatization ) “ Mr. Kucinich , did you vote for the patriot act ? …
No ?
Did he just say No !?
He did … he friggin ’ said N !
Do you believe that ?!
Why in god ’s name not man , it has the word PATRIOT in it ! ” ( End Dramatization )
His reply : “ Because I actually read it . ”
Thank you sir , thank you for doing the job we hired you for .
Hmm .
I might actually have to pull out my check list for this guy .
Item
One – does his current job well – Check .
Item
Two – believes in what he says – Check .
Item
Three – wants to end and prevent another middle east war .
– Check .
Item Four – discounted by the mainstream media but has a large , vocal , and growing following – CHECK .
Wow .
Mr. Kucinich you clearly win out over the rest .
With that said , if one of the douches from the republican side takes the nomination , I can all but guarantee that most of the paul supporters will start supporting you and I truly hope that the same goes for your first line supporters switching over to Paul ’s camp in the event you do not get nominated .
We do not live a fair world , the stinging cold truth is the powers that be have already chosen who they think should run against who and force feed that down the throats of american citizens .
Those prophecies tend to be self - fulfilling .
We are trying our damnedest to prevent that , but should it happen , what are we , as the supporters , supposed to do ?
I need to ask … should you both lose the party nominations , would both of you see that we need to keep you running because hope elsewhere is dim ?
Would you consider running together as independents ?
A Paul / Kucinich or Kucinich /
Paul independent run could not be ignored by the media .
They would have to except that the Giuliani vs. Clinton would be a three sided race .
Even then , they may not win , but the message will not die , and americans will wake up .
Then perhaps four years later , someone else will step up to the plate .
But , that is assuming the winner of this election does not lead us into total economic collapse and a third world war .
Nobody would be left to vote …
For Peace …

CONFUSION is the watchword on Capitol Hill , at least where the fiscal stimulus package is concerned .
Unfortunately , matters are n't much clearer at the Federal Reserve .
As Tim Duy notes at Mark Thoma 's blog , it is unclear whether the economy is simply grazing an economic downturn and inflation therefore looms as a serious threat , or if a more substantial contraction is in the cards and deflation is a possibility .
The Cleveland Fed 's analysis of federal funds futures contracts reveals the market is expecting interest rate cuts of anywhere from 25 to 100 basis points by the conclusion of the March Fed meeting .
Mr Duy adds some interesting thoughts about the nature of the international adjustment in progress , but I was most interested to read his comments on the political machinations affecting the Federal Reserve 's behaviour at the moment :
Consider also Senator Dodd ’s meeting today with Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , in which Dodd reached a certain understanding : '' The chairman is committed to using the tools available , '' said Dodd , a Connecticut Democrat .
'' It 's been evidenced already , and I 'm confident he 'll continue . ''
Giving Bernanke the benefit of the doubt , he likely did n’t commit to additional easing .
But Dodd is certainly leveraging market expectations to set the path toward additional easing .
Also note that Dodd is holding up three Fed governor nominees , including the current Governor Randall Krozner .
Senator Reid is also drawing a line in the sand on nominees .
Indeed , I am surprised that we currently hear so little commentary about the possible erosion of Fed independence ...
Mr Duy notes that the central bank may have invited such activity by failing to embrace a greater regulatory role during the latter stages of the housing bubble , when the extent of the shakiness in mortgage markets became clear .
The Fed has also contributed to the erosion of the wall between itself and the political world by injecting itself into debates over fiscal policy .
Despite these failures , central bank independence remains vital in maintaining a reasonable monetary policy and price stability .
This is something a number of prominent leaders and journalists seem to have lately forgotten .
A year ago , George Will complained in the Washington Post about democratic lawmakers seeking rate cuts from a stubborn Fed .
( In retrospect , those lawmakers may have had a point ) .
Following Mr Bernanke 's surprise 75 basis point cut two weeks ago , America 's newspapers were filled with reprimands for the chairman .
Many wondered whether Mr Bernanke 's seeming commitment to high equity prices did n't justify a stronger oversight role for the Congress .
And the current edition of The New Republic contains a piece by the magazine 's editors that wistfully remembers a time when President Lyndon Johnson could browbeat and physically threaten a Fed chairman into monetary easing .
But that same chairman , William McChesney Martin , earned the ire of Richard Nixon , who blamed the Fed 's policies for his defeat in the presidential election of 1960 .
Had the central bank not enjoyed independence during his later presidency , there can be little question that Mr Nixon would have used his authority to obtain favourable shifts in policy from the central bank .
Every president would , and practically no president would find it in his interest to make monetary policy tighter .
No central banker is perfect .
They lack perfect foresight , perfect models , and in many cases , perfect motives .
This state of affairs is preferrable to one where political leaders , whose motives are clear and consistent , can force , in words or actions , a Fed chairman to adopt a certain policy .
That way lies inflation .
A team of Boston College researchers led by Asst. Prof. Vidya Madhavan ( Physics ) has identified an alternative explanation for the microscopic origins of the “ glue ” that binds electrons during high - temperature superconductivity , according to results published in the December 13 edition of the scientific journal Nature .
Investigating the hotly - debated issue in high temperature superconductivity research , Madhavan and her colleagues identified a signature of the quantum entity known as spin , as opposed to the vibrational energy previously identified as a potential explanation for the “ glue ” that binds electrons .
“ The fact that this signature exists is important because it is a potential candidate for this glue that binds electrons in a state of high temperature superconductivity , ” said Madhavan , a condensed matter experimentalist who has been at Boston College for the last five years .
“ By applying our research tool – scanning tunneling microscopy – to a material that has not been studied before , we have a new window on this critical question of what holds electrons together during superconductivity , ” Madhavan said .
Despite their discovery 20 years ago , high temperature superconductors still hold many mysteries for scientists .
The promise of superconductivity is the ultra - efficient transmission of electricity – which could ultimately redefine energy use and countless other processes .
Achieving a state of superconductivity – that point where typically unjoinable electrons bind – only happens at extremely cold temperatures , about 100 degrees Kelvin – some five times colder than what we experience at 32 degrees Fahrenheit .
It took Madhavan and her team of Boston College collaborators – Francis C. Niestemski , Shankar Kunwar , Sen Zhou , Prof. Hong Ding , and Prof. Ziqiang Wang on campus , along with the University of Tennessee ’s Pengcheng Dai and Shiliang Li – eight months of experimentation in their Higgins Hall laboratory .
There , the team used scanning tunneling microscopy ( STM ) to examine how electrons behave in a superconducting material when super - cooled with liquid helium and probed with a flow of miniscule nanoamperes of electric current .
advertisement
Most high temperature superconducting materials studied until now were “ hole - doped ” which means that electrons were removed from the copper - oxide planes – the areas responsible for superconductivity – leaving
behind holes which then proceed to superconduct .
But there is another family of materials known as electron - doped superconductors , where electrons are added to the copper oxide planes .
Scientists suspect that electron - doped materials should be similar to hole - doped materials since superconductivity occurs in the same copper - oxide planes in both materials .
But there have been very few studies of these electron - doped materials .
Using hole - doped materials , researchers have found signs that lattice vibrations , or phonons , were involved in superconductivity and may even be the unknown “ glue ” that pairs up the electrons .
Madhavan ’s team made the first foray into studying an electron - doped material ( known as PLCCO ) using a STM , which relies on a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon called “ tunneling . ”
STM allowed the researchers to make images and study the electronic properties of materials at the scale of single atoms .
The STM measurements revealed a signature of excitations that might originate from spins rather than lattice vibrations , confirming for the first time theories that spin excitations should be considered as the “ glue ” so critical to high temperature superconductivity .
Madhavan likens the team ’s discovery to finding just one small part of a large jigsaw puzzle .
But in the arena of superconductivity research , small discoveries are important as they move the field forward incrementally toward the discovery of a guiding microscopic theory that can explain superconductivity or the elusive glue at its core .
That there might not just be a single explanation for electron coupling means scientists will need to reevaluate possible explanations of the nature of superconductivity as they endeavor to unlock the physical mysteries behind a promising , yet elusive phenomenon .
“ To see the work of Boston College Physics Department faculty and researchers published in the journal Nature is recognition of the outstanding , high - quality work being done by Professors Madhavan , Ding and Wang , ” said Prof. Michael Naughton , chairman of the Physics Department .
“ This is the latest advance to emerge from the natural sciences at Boston College and reflects the results of our strategic investment in facilities and faculty in these areas . ”
Feb. 6 , 2008  --
A mother of five who says she was sexually harassed and assaulted while working for Halliburton / KBR in Iraq is headed for a secretive arbitration process rather than being able to present her case in open court .
A judge in Texas has ruled that Tracy Barker 's case will be heard in arbitration , according to the terms of her initial employment contract .
Barker says that while in Iraq she was constantly propositioned by her superior , threatened and isolated after she reported an incident of sexual assault .
Barker 's attorneys had argued that Halliburton / KBR had created a " boys will be boys " atmosphere at their camps and that sort of condition is not the type of dispute that she could have expected to be within the scope of an arbitration provision .
District Judge Gray Miller , however , wrote in his order that " whether it is wise to send this type of claim to arbitration is not a question for this court to decide . "
" Sadly , " wrote Judge Miller , " sexual harassment , up to and including sexual assault , is a reality in today 's workplace . "
Barker says it was a reality at Halliburton / KBR .
From the moment she arrived at the Halliburton / KBR camp in Basra , Iraq , she says she was treated like a sex object .
" When I arrived in Basra , there were about five men that worked on the camp for the company I worked for and they were waiting for me , " Barker told ABC News in an exclusive interview that aired last December .
" I was told they wanted to see what I look like , " she said , " to make sure I was decent looking before they approved my transfer . "
Tracy says her KBR boss in Basra repeatedly propositioned her and threatened her .
" The manager of the camp kept making gestures of how if I wanted my safety to exist on the camp , that I needed to sleep with him , and that 's all he kept saying to me , " said Barker .
Tracy says her co-workers were not much better .
She says when she first arrived at her new office , it looked more like a fraternity house than a place of business .
" On my way into the office , there was pictures of prostitutes and animals having sex pasted in the hallway , " she said .
" Our office was just wallpapered with pornography .
There was not one space of wall at all . "
Tracy says she inquired from her male co-worker where her workplace was located .
" My co-worker told me that ' you can either sit at the end of my desk or on the floor because that 's where the women sit that work with me , ' " Barker said .
When Tracy tried to report the co-worker to her manager , she says the manager 's gestures toward her only got worse .
" If I do n't feel safe , I can come to his room and get a backrub or sleep with him , " Barker says she was told .
Barker 's case had also involved a claim of sexual assault against a State Department employee .
Those claims have been severed from her case against Halliburton / KBR and transferred to the Eastern District of Virginia .
As in similar cases , KBR had moved for Tracy 's claim to be heard in private arbitration , instead of a public courtroom , as provided under the terms of her original employment contract .
In arbitration , there is no public record or transcript of the proceedings , meaning that Tracy 's claims will not be heard before a judge and jury .
Halliburton which has since divested itself of KBR referred calls for comment to KBR .
KBR issued a statement late yesterday saying , " As part of her employment contract with KBR , Ms. Barker agreed to arbitrate all claims in the event a conflict arose .
The court 's decision enforcing her agreement is consistent with rulings from other courts in the upholding arbitration agreements between employers and employees .
Arbitration is the last step of KBR's Dispute Resolution Program .
The vast majority of employment disputes at KBR , approximately 96 % , are resolved through this program without resort to arbitration .
KBR remains committed to ensuring the arbitration process is fair to all employees . "
Halliburton and KBR had also sought to have Barker pay for their costs of defending their right to arbitrate .
That request was denied .

It is billed as the best pop culture collection ever assembled -- ranging from the gun used to kill the assassin of U.S. President John F. Kennedy to the Wicked Witch of the West ’s hat from “ The Wizard of Oz . ”

Collected over the past 25 years by South Florida property developer Anthony Pugliese , the collection , which also includes a whip and the holy grail from “ Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade , ” will be put up for auction next month in Las Vegas .
Arlan Ettinger , president of New York - based auction house Guernsey ’s , said the collection of 850 lots could fetch more than $ 5 million when it goes under the hammer at The Palms Resort and Casino on March 15 and 16 .
“ This collection is as good as it gets , ” said Ettinger , with “ The Maltese Falcon ” resin statuette sitting on his desk alongside the gun used to kill Kennedy ’s assassin Lee Harvey Oswald and the “ Braveheart ” sword from the Oscar - winning film .
“ Most collections have one or two great things and then things trail off from there , ” he said .
“ This collection , there would have to be 100 items here , any one of which would be a star attraction anywhere else . ”
He said the Colt Cobra revolver used by Jack Ruby to kill Oswald in 1963 , just days after Oswald was arrested for assassinating Kennedy , could fetch several million dollars alone .
The initials of detectives who handled the gun are scratched on it .
“ The whole world saw that unfold live and here ’s the very gun and the hat that Jack Ruby was wearing , ” said Ettinger , adding that the tag tied to Oswald ’s toe to identify his corpse and a lock of his hair were also to be auctioned .
Also up for grabs is the jacket worn by Beatle John Lennon in the “ Imagine ” video , the wedding dress worn by pop star Madonna in her “ Like a Virgin ” video , a “ Superman ” costume worn by Christopher Reeve , and an Andy Warhol paint brush .
Ettinger said Pugliese was selling his collection , which he had kept in a large vault at his offices , because it “ had been his passion , but now has taken a back seat ” to a green housing development he was working on .
Other items to be auctioned include a Federal Bureau of Investigation badge that belonged to the bureau ’s founder J. Edgar Hoover , a wig worn by Elizabeth Taylor for “ Cleopatra , ” and the leather jacket worn by actor Brandon Lee when he was accidentally shot and killed while filming “ The Crow . ”
PORTLAND , Maine -
When Steve Kahn got a $ 26,000 tax bill on his airplane , he thought Maine Revenue Services had made a mistake .
Kahn lives , works , and keeps his plane in Massachusetts .
But the bill was no error .
It was part of the agency 's efforts to collect taxes on aircraft owned by out - of - state residents , even though they bought their planes elsewhere and brought them to Maine only to visit .
A number of other states , from Florida to Washington , are doing the same as they grapple with budget shortfalls and as the Internet makes it easier to track the comings and goings of aircraft .
Many pilots are outraged .
" At best what Maine is doing is underhanded and devious ; at worst it is illegal , " Kahn said .
" Either way , it 's wrong . "
Maine officials say they are simply enforcing the state 's laws when they send bills , into six figures , to out - of - state plane owners .
At issue in Maine is the state 's use tax , which applies to many goods and services bought out of state that are not subject to sales tax .
In the case of airplanes , tax officials say , the law allows them to collect a 5 percent use tax from people who did not pay sales taxes on their planes if they brought their plane to Maine for more than 20 days , excluding time for maintenance and alterations , in the first year of ownership .
" We 're charged with administering the law , " said David Bauer , a tax policy analyst with Maine Revenue Services .
" We did n't write it . "
Use taxes have been on the books for decades , but the first time tax lawyer Jon Block saw the state go after somebody who lives and keeps their plane out of state was three years ago .
Block , with the Pierce Atwood law firm in Portland , represents seven people from Massachusetts , Connecticut , Maryland , and Florida who got bills this year ranging from about $ 16,000 to $ 175,000 .
His clients mostly fly to Maine on business or to visit vacation homes .
" These people are dumbfounded , " Block said .
" They feel like they 've been taken to the cleaners . "
He contends that in addition to being unfair , the wording of Maine 's use - tax law makes his clients exempt from the tax .
Other states are also stepping up efforts to collect use , lease , and property taxes from out - of - state plane owners , said Louis Meiners , president of Advocate Aircraft Taxation Co. of Naples , Fla. , a consulting firm for aircraft owners with 1,600 clients nationwide .
Florida assesses a 6 percent use tax on plane owners who did n't pay sales tax on their planes and bring them to Florida even once within six months of the purchase date .
Washington state assesses a use tax of up to 8.9 percent if a plane is in Washington for more than 90 days in any continuous 12 - month period .
Illinois is assessing taxes on out - of - state plane owners , as well , Meiners said .
These days , the Internet makes it easier for tax collectors to track the whereabouts of planes on the Internet or through FAA records , Meiners said .
Some plane owners have received letters of inquiry and bills from multiple states demanding payment or proof that they have paid sales taxes in their home states , he said .
" What we have is a real potential for double - taxation and triple - taxation and endless taxation in the way the states try to enforce it . "
Kahn , a partner in a Boston financial - services company , did not pay a sales tax when he bought his plane five years ago because Massachusetts exempts planes .
He often flies to Rockland , Maine , to visit his vacation home .
He also flies as a pilot in the national Angel Flight program to pick up patients in rural Maine and bring them to Boston - area hospitals free of charge .
He has appealed his tax bill .
If his appeal fails , he could take the case to court .
" I do n't mind paying taxes when I owe them , but this is underhanded , " he said .

What Scientology Wo n't Tell You

IBM researchers this week announced they 've made major strides in nanotechnology by studying how to build storage and other computing devices out of components no bigger than a few atoms or molecules .
Researchers at the company 's Almaden Research Center in San Jose , Calif. , report in Science that magnetic anisotropy could eventually be used to store information in individual atoms , paving the way to pack as much as 150 trillion bits of data per square inch , 1,000 times more than current data storage densities .
In other words , the ability to store data in individual atoms could lead to devices capable of storing the equivalent of 30,000 movies in a device the size of an iPod .
Anisotropy measures how far a magnet 's pull reaches in any single direction .
" Every atom has a magnet inside , " says Cyrus Hirjibehedin , a researcher at the Almaden lab , noting that the magnetic orientation of an atom is called its " spin . "
" We want to understand the properties of an atom and were able to measure the anisotropy for a single atom in a particular environment . "
IBM Almaden researchers used the company 's scanning tunneling microscope to manipulate individual iron atoms and arrange them with atomic precision on a specially prepared copper surface ; scientists previously were unable to measure the magnetic anisotropy of a single atom .
IBM used the microscope to determine the orientation and strength of the magnetic anisotropy of each iron atom .
" Now we have a means for understanding anisotropy , " says Andreas Heinrich , manager of Almaden 's Scanning Tunneling Microscopy lab .
The next step , he says , is fashioning a system in which the atom 's spin is stable enough to be used for data storage -- something that scientists may achieve in several years or , Heinrich says , may not even be possible .
" Our job is to jump ahead , " he adds .
" We hope to make a drastic change rather than incremental improvements . "
Another Science report describes research by scientists at IBM's Zurich Research Laboratory in Switzerland on ways to use a single molecule to perform many of the same functions now carried out by silicon .
The study indicates that it 's possible to turn a single molecule into a switch without disrupting its outer shell - - a significant step toward building computing elements at the molecular scale that are vastly smaller and faster , and use less energy than today 's computer chips and memory devices .
Switches inside computer chips turn the flow of electrons on and off and , when put together , form the logic gates that make up the electrical circuits of the computer processors .
Having ever - smaller switches allows the circuits to be shrunk to ever - tinier sizes , making it possible to crowd more circuits into a processor , boosting speed and performance .
Researchers at IBM and elsewhere previously demonstrated switching within single molecules , but the molecules would change their shape when switched , making them unsuitable for building logic gates for computer chips or memory elements .
Next up for the Zurich research team : building a series of these molecules into a circuit , and then figuring out how to link them to make a molecular chip .
NBC ’s efforts to salvage its Golden Globes exclusive fell apart Friday when the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. announced that it would allow all media outlets to carry live coverage of Sunday ’s news conference announcing the winners .
The move by the association , which hands out the accolades , came after a financial dispute between NBC and Dick Clark Productions Inc. , the company contracted to produce the original Golden Globes telecast .
The decision means that the Writers Guild of America will not picket the event , opening the door to possible appearances by actors and directors .
But it may be too late to restore any glamour to the ceremony , which has gone through a dizzying series of incarnations in recent weeks resulting from the politics of the writers strike .

Once the kickoff to the awards season , this year ’s show has been reduced to a half - hour news conference .
Presenters will include Mary Hart of “ Entertainment Tonight , ” Lara Spencer of “ The Insider ” and Jim Moret of “ Inside Edition . ”
NBC was originally slated to be the exclusive broadcaster of the news conference , with Nancy O’Dell and Billy Bush of “ Access Hollywood ” as hosts .
But after signing off on that format , Hollywood Foreign Press President Jorge Camara said Friday that the group would allow other television outlets to carry it live as well .

The abrupt turn was triggered by a demand by Dick Clark Productions for NBC to pay what it called a “ nominal license fee ” for its coverage Sunday , which includes a two - hour “ Dateline ” special on the Globes nominees .
“ NBC wanted to have an exclusive three - hour broadcast special disguised as a news conference that would bar all other media , ” Dick Clark Productions said in a statement .
NBC executives refused , saying it was inappropriate .
The network , which said the company had demanded a license fee “ north of seven figures , ” added that it was considering legal action to address a possible breach of contract by the production company .

“ We are feeling very strongly that this was not handled legally or correctly by them , ” said an NBC executive , who called the license fee request insulting .
The executive declined to be named while discussing financial specifics of the deal .
The network , facing a hole in its schedule , still plans to broadcast the news conference after its “ Dateline ” special .
( In Los Angeles , KNBC - TV Channel 4 will show the announcement of the winners live at 6 p.m. , followed by “ Dateline ” at 7 p.m. and then a 9 p.m. rebroadcast of the Globes announcement . )
But what already was likely to be a lackluster event for the network now faces competition from other outlets .
CNN , E ! and TV Guide Network also plan to cover the announcement .

Times staff writers Maria Elena Fernandez and Martin Miller contributed to this report .
With Ruby 1.9 adding Fibers ( Coroutines ) and the recent popularity of Erlang and Actors , a group of little known concepts entered the Ruby programming world .
To get an overview of what 's available in the Ruby space when it comes to concurrency , we talked to long - time Ruby community member MenTaLguY .
He 's been involved in Ruby concurrency and threading for a long time , such as with the fastthread library which improves threading with 1.8.x MRI .
Recently he 's been dabbling in Rubinius and is also a member of the JRuby team .
InfoQ : What is your Actors library for Ruby about ?
MenTaLguY : I 've written two ( released )
Actors libraries , actually .
One is in the Omnibus concurrency library , and one is part of the Rubinius stdlib .
Both are Ruby implementations of the Actor Model , the concurrency model popularized by Erlang .
Concurrency , in the sense of running code in parallel , is n't actually that hard to do .
The big problems arise when different threads of control need to share a resource or otherwise communicate .
If you do n't pick some simple formal model for structuring that communication , it 's nearly impossible to write code that is correct or even necessarily meaningful , even if it superficially appears to " work " .
Related Sponsored Content Demystifying Microservices for Jakarta EE & Java EE Developers
" Actors " are one such model .
An actor is made of a mailbox and a thread .
At its discretion , an actor - thread can wait for specific sorts of messages to show up in the mailbox and then " act " on whichever one it gets , possibly sending messages to other actors .
In this way , driven by the voluntary and explicit exchange of messages , threads can communicate in a way that is relatively easy to reason about .
InfoQ : How does it relate to Ruby 's threading system or Ruby 's new Fibers / Coroutines ?
MenTaLguY :
My actors libraries simply associate a mailbox with every Ruby thread to make an actor of every one , but that is n't the only way to approach actors in Ruby .
Fibers are simply cooperatively - scheduled tasks within a single thread , and you can base actors on those , too , as Tony Arcieri did in his Revactor library .
His approach has some advantages since Fibers are lighter - weight than full threads and you do n't need to worry about preemption .
On the other hand , sometimes you do need full threads ( and sometimes the Ruby stdlib forces them on you ) .
Tony and I have been having some vigorous and productive design discussions ; the plan is to make our actor implementations as compatible as possible , and to provide a simple object protocol that any other actor implementation can use to play along too .
From the outside , actors can all duck - type the same -- you 're always just submitting messages to a mailbox after all .
For the most part it should n't matter whether it's a thread or a fiber or something running in another Ruby VM that will be picking them up .
In principle an actor - duck could even be backed by an Erlang process somewhere ( e.g. via Scott Fleckenstein 's Erlectricity ) .
InfoQ : I saw some of your recent commits to the Rubinius repository , such as this commit dealing with Actors .
Are Actors used in Rubinius ?
MenTaLguY : Not as part of its implementation ( which is one of the reasons I moved them from core to stdlib ) .
I do n't think they 're needed at that level .
InfoQ : Any chance Actors or their mailbox implementation are ( or could be ) used in the message passing Multi-VM IPC that Evan recently added to Rubinius ?
MenTaLguY : Actors are n't used to implement the MVM IPC mechanism , but we would like to use MVM IPC behind the scenes to allow actors in different VMs to communicate with one another .
InfoQ : What 's the current state of Rubinius threading ?
What 's used - userspace threads / kernel threads , some m:n mix of both ?
MenTaLguY :
We use userspace threads within a VM , but each VM runs in a separate kernel thread .
Right now , if you want to use all of your CPUs , spawn a VM or two for each one .
Evan wants to do m:n threading within a VM eventually , but Ruby presents a lot of technical hurdles to clear on that front .
Even Ruby 1.9 hobbles its native threads so that they are effectively userspace threads .
It could be that only the Ruby implementations originally built atop native - threaded runtimes ( XRuby , JRuby , IronRuby ) ever have full support for native threads .
Native threads might not end up being so important if MVM can be made lightweight enough or communication between CPUs becomes expensive enough ( the world gets more NUMA by the day ) .
However , there is one case where native threads are impossible to escape : poorly - designed IO APIs that do n't support asynchronous operations .
Perversely , in those cases you need multiple native threads , not to utilize multiple cores , but to sit there and do nothing .
Sometimes , you have no choice but to delegate a victim thread to wait for a blocking call to finish , while the rest of your code gets on with its life .
Hopefully we will see less of such APIs in the future .
Tony 's Revactor library offers one ray of hope on that front : it brings actors to bear on IO , so that the execution of your code can be driven by IO events rather than waiting uselessly in blocking calls or suffering inversion of control and turning into a giant explicit state machine .
At the moment it is tied to MRI 1.9 , but hopefully we can port it or get something similar on other Ruby implementations as well .
InfoQ : Rubinius seems to be shipped with a wealth of concurrency ideas and tools - threads , actors , multivm + message passing IPC , etc .
MenTaLguY :
At this point in history , concurrency is a particularly important concern , and I think Rubinius reflects that .
InfoQ : One of these tools I noticed are Channels - what role do they play in Rubinius ?
( I noticed that the fast debugger uses Channels to notify the debugger thread , etc ) .
MenTaLguY : Channels are the basic communication primitive in Rubinius ; everything else is implemented atop them .
The fundamental concurrency model is more or less the asynchronous pi calculus minus replication and a few common extensions like non-deterministic choice ( which potentially requires channel operations to be centrally arbitrated ) .
I advocated pi calculus channels because of their simplicity , which generally translates to performance and maintainability .
Now , the pi calculus is good to use directly for " local " ( intra - VM ) things , but it is not so good for implementing distributed ones because in the pi calculus both ends of a channel are mobile .
When writes are asynchronous , you can kind of fire and forget over the horizon , but reading from a channel is a synchronous operation , and if a channel gets into the hands of multiple readers those readers must rendezvous somewhere to do their reads .
Not a good thing if they 're particularly distant from one another !
That is one reason why I 'm interested in actors for larger - scale things .
Actor mailboxes are a bit like channels in the asynchronous calculus , except that only the ( asynchronous ) write end is independently mobile ; the read end is firmly tied to a specific local agent and no special " long - distance " coordination is required .
InfoQ : Ruby 1.9 added Fibers / Coroutines - how would they be implemented in Rubinius ?
MenTaLguY : I think Fibers could be implemented atop Rubinius Tasks without too much trouble ; Fibers and Tasks are fairly similar .
InfoQ :
Do you have any views / opinions about Fibers / Coroutines ?
Would you use them - and for what ?
MenTaLguY : I think they are a fine alternative to explicit state machines , particularly as coroutines give you more freedom when using library code .
However , a state machine can still be better if it is small enough or in situations where it would be appropriate to use something like Ragel to generate it for you .
InfoQ : Is it correct that you now have commit rights for JRuby ?
What are your interests in JRuby or what are you working on there ?
MenTaLguY : Yes .
My principal interest is concurrency : the combination of Ruby and native threads presents some interesting challenges .
So I 've been fixing concurrency bugs and working out what kind of concurrency guarantees we should offer in general .
I would also eventually like to properly expose the Java concurrency facilities to Ruby , hopefully in a portable way ( this is partly the mission of the Omnibus Concurrency library ) .
InfoQ : What other project are you involved in ?
MenTaLguY : Aside from occasionally contributing patches to Shoes , I 'm working on quite a few libraries behind the scenes , most of which will be announced / released when they 're ready .
However , I can point out one which I released recently , although it 's not been formally announced yet : the ' case ' gem , which gives you pattern matching for arrays , structs , and arbitrary predicates with the case - match operator in Ruby .
require ' rubygems '
require ' case '
Foo = Case :: Struct.new :a , :b
def example ( arg )
case arg
when Foo[ : blarg , Object ] # matches any Foo with .a == : blarg
# ...
when Foo[10 , 20 ] # matches only a Foo with .a == 10 and .b == 20
# ...
when Foo # matches any Foo
# ...
when Case :: Any [ String , Array ] # matches either a String or Array
# ...
# matches a three - element array with initial elements 1 , 2 :
when Case [ 1 , 2 , Object ]
# ...
# matches any Integer > 10 :
when Case :: All [ Integer , Case.guard { |n| n > 10 } ]
# ...
end
end
Both Tony and I use the case - match operator ( === ) in our actor libraries to select the sorts of messages to wait for , so this gem can be quite useful there .

9/11 families criticized for ' silent ' settlement in negligence case Jason Rhyne
Published : Monday October 8 , 2007

Print This Email This Five Maryland families , all of whom agreed to an out - of - court settlement with the airline industry over their loved ones ' deaths on Sept. 11 , are drawing some pointed criticism for agreeing to keep silent about what they learned during the course of the lawsuit .
The families , who chose not to receive money through the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund , say they pursued a legal route in hopes that their suits would give them a better understanding of the security breakdowns that allowed the tragedy to occur .
But whatever knowledge they gained , they 're not allowed to talk about it .
In accordance with the agreement , which includes an undisclosed but substantial financial payment from American Airlines and security screening companies at Dulles International Airport , the families are barred from disclosing anything they have learned about airline - related failures and lapses on Sept. 11 .
The deal also allows the companies to dodge any admission to negligence .
" This bothers me more than most settlements of this nature , " writes conservative blogger Edward Morrissey , who calls the deal " inimical to the plaintiffs ' stated motives . "
" The families who sued , who opted out of the VCF to do so , insisted that the money was not important to them , " Morrissey continues .
" They wanted answers to how the failures occurred , and decided that their separate lawsuits could provide more answers than government investigations .
Apparently they have somehow been satisfied as a result of that process  but cant tell us why . "
" If truth was that important to them , " he asks , then " why do they now choose silence and a payoff instead of revealing the deficiencies of the system that led to the deaths of almost 3,000 people ? "
Shaun Mullen , of the blog The Moderate Voice , says he is with Morrissey in " having problems with the hold - out families , who to put the most charitable face on their litigation saw their seemingly altruistic intentions undercut by their not being able to get paid if they talked . "
" I really did n't go into it for the money , " Irene Golinski , one of the litigants whose husband was killed at the Pentagon , told the Washington Post .
" I went into it for the answers . "
Christine Fisher , however , another plaintiff in the suit , said in the Post that part of the reason she had chosen to eschew an award from the Victim Compensation Fund was the possibility of receiving a larger amount through the legal system .
" It was a financial decision , but it was also an emotional and accountability decision , " she told told the paper .
According to the Baltimore Sun , the money will be used by the families to establish foundations in their lost loved ones ' names .
The group 's lead attorney , Keith Franz said in a press release that the fundamental goal of the lawsuit was to gain " answers as to how 9/11 was allowed to happen , " continuing that his clients wanted " the airlines and security companies responsible for protecting the public to step up and share responsibility . "
Writing at Captain's Quarters , Morrissey said the information gleaned from the lawsuits should be made public .
" These particular families are not the only people with standing on 9/11 , he said .
" If the depositions revealed failures , we should all know about them , if the truth really does mean more than the money . "
Precise information about was found may never be released , but the Post did try to ascertain a rough estimate by asking Christine Fisher to grade " how much she has learned about the private companies ' actions " on Sept. 11 on a scale from one to ten .
" Seven to eight , " Fisher responded .
The following video clips are from CBS News , broadcast on October 3 , 2007 .
This Behind the Scenes article was provided to LiveScience in partnership with the National Science Foundation .
In mid-February , at the height of Austral summer , the sun in the Antarctic never sets .
Nor did the work ever stop for University of Hawaii oceanography professor Chris Measures and his team of trace - metals oceanographers , who worked around the clock measuring dust from the decks of the Scripps Insitution of Oceanography research vessel Roger Revelle .
The researchers affixed bouquets of trumpet - shaped filters to the ship ’s mast to trap dust from the air , and for every degree of longitude , they sampled the sea , plunging a contraption of cylindrical bottles to the depths of the upper ocean , screening water for remnants of dissolved dust and the trace amounts of iron and aluminum they contain .
Measures is taking part in a leg of the Climate Variability - CO2 repeat hydrography program ( CLIVAR ) , a series of cruises funded by the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration seeking to document and comprehend the ocean ’s role in climate change .
CLIVAR research cruises have surveyed representative sections of the ocean on a decadal scale since the 1990s , focusing primarily on better understanding the carbon cycle .
In collaboration with William Landing at Florida State University , Measures is running an adjunct program for trace metals on CLIVAR .
Since receiving NSF support in 2003 , Measures and Landing have led dust - measuring teams on six CLIVAR cruises in the Atlantic , Pacific , Southern and Indian oceans .
Which all begs the question , what exactly does dust have to do with carbon ?
Unlike land plants , aquatic plants can permanently remove carbon dioxide from atmospheric circulation ; some sink to the ocean floor after death , and the carbon in their bodies remains subsumed in the deep ocean for thousands of years .
Dust , as a process , holds a place in the ocean carbon cycle as a source of iron for those plants .
As chemical oceanographers , Measures and Landing are interested in how chemicals enter and cycle through the oceans .
They are particularly interested in iron , a micronutrient necessary for plant growth .
Just as pill supplements are a way to get vitamins into human bodies , dust from continental deserts is one way to get iron into the oceans , where phytoplankton use the dissolved form of iron , along with inputs like carbon dioxide , to process sunlight and make food for themselves .
In quantifying dust deposition , the researchers hunt for trace amounts of iron and aluminum in the water column .
Aluminum is not directly used by plants , but it exists in proportion to iron in desert dust , and its presence in the oceans shows the origins and the paths of iron , long after the iron has been absorbed by plants .
For all the effort the researchers spent collecting water and running samples in their shipboard laboratory , not much iron or aluminum was to be found off of Antarctica .
Even by trace metal standards , where concentrations are measured in nanograms ( billionths of a gram ) per liter , there were only the slightest traces of iron .
Low iron levels have long been suspected of limiting productivity in the Southern Ocean ; as a region , it has an unusual excess of general nutrients that are , in most oceans , completely consumed by plants .
It ’s not the amount of iron that matters to Measures ’ team , so much as what the existing iron can illuminate about process .
While inland Antarctica receives rains sparse enough to qualify as the world ’s largest desert , much of the continent ’s dirt is locked under ice , and prevented from becoming dust .
What iron exists in these waters comes from two additional sources .
In shallow sections , iron may be churned up from underwater plateaus and continental shelves .
Throughout the ocean , iron can be recycled from the breakdown of dead materials .
Knowing the sources of iron , and how much each contributes , helps in creating accurate climate prediction models .
Given the dearth of iron in the Southern Ocean , some have even suggested adding a fourth , artificial source of iron .
Earlier this fall , a conference at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution spotlighted “ iron - seeding ” as a potential vehicle for carbon sequestration .
The theory is simple : dump iron in the ocean where plant productivity is iron - limited , and it will encourage plant growth .
More plants would take in more carbon dioxide and , on death , more carbon dioxide will sink out of the reach of atmospheric circulation .
While greater ocean productivity has coincided with major drops in CO2 during past ice ages , iron - seeding experiments are so far yielding more caveats than green lights .
Adding iron has stimulated plant production , but it has also altered other parts of the biological pump .
In iron - saturated conditions , for instance , the dominant phytoplankton use less silica ; being lighter , they sink less directly , throwing off the efficiency of the carbon pump .
Some members of CLIVAR ’s trace metals team have worked on iron - seeding experiments , but their work on CLIVAR cruises focuses on the existing world .
From the CLIVAR series , and from an upcoming cruise series for chemists called GEOTRACES , Measures , Landing and colleagues are pooling efforts to create an unprecedented map that shows the distribution of chemicals in the oceans .
For weeks , the team plodded through their time at sea .
They raised and lowered the air filters in a daily ritual , ran vials of seawater through yards of plastic tubing .
They warmed their stiff fingers over mugs of espresso , entranced by a perpetual dusk that faded to blue - black nights as they steamed north .
Every so often , they found minute traces of earth metals which , while invisible , hold one in a set of many keys to understanding how people are changing the planet .

JAKARTA ( Reuters ) - A 6.6 magnitude earthquake hit Indonesia off the coast of Sumatra island on Sunday , the U.S. Geological Survey reported .
The earthquake , which struck at 9:46 a.m. EST , was 96 miles ( 154 km ) southwest of Padang , Sumatra , and was centered at a depth of 21.7 miles , the USGS said .
Indonesia ’s meteorology and geophysics agency said that authorities have issued no local tsunami warning .
Indonesia suffers from frequent earthquakes .
The archipelago lies on an area of intense seismic activity where a number of tectonic plates collide .
In a report made public on Tuesday , a review panel found that there were too few American officials in Iraq to enforce the rules that apply to Blackwater and other security contractors .
It also found that the conduct of the contractors had undermined the broader mission of ending the insurgency and establishing a democratic government in Iraq .
Ms. Rice approved a number of the review panel ’s recommendations intended to strengthen oversight of the security contractors , including a revision of the rules for the use of deadly force to bring them more in line with the military ’s rules of engagement , and creation of review panels to investigate every incident involving the injury or killing of a civilian .
The panels could refer possible instances of wrongdoing to the Justice Department .
The contractors would also undergo more rigorous training in Iraqi culture and language .
The other report was an audit of the State Department ’s oversight of DynCorp , released Tuesday , which found that records tracking hundreds of millions of dollars paid to the company were in “ disarray . ”
Interviews with administration officials , auditors and outside experts show that the use of contractors has grown far beyond what department officials imagined when they first outsourced critical security functions in 1994 and hired private security guards to protect American diplomats in Haiti , which was thrown into turmoil by civil strife .
Today , the Bureau of Diplomatic Security , the small State Department office that oversees the private security contractors in Iraq and elsewhere , is overwhelmed by its responsibilities to supervise the contractors , according to former employees , members of Congress and outside experts .
They say the office has grown too reliant on , and too close to , the 1,200 private soldiers who now guard American officials overseas .

Reid plans Thanksgiving Senate session to prevent recess appointments RAW STORY
Published : Friday November 16 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Democrats are refusing to be made turkeys over the holidays by a lame duck president , a capitol newspaper reports .
" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) has decided to keep the chamber in session over the Thanksgiving break to block President Bush from making any unsavory recess appointments while Senators are out of town , " Erin P. Billings reports for Roll Call .
Reid explained Friday , " With the Thanksgiving break looming , the administration informed me that they would make several recess appointments .
I indicated I would be willing to confirm various appointments if the administration would agree to move on Democratic appointments . "
" They would not make that commitment , " the Senate Majority Leader added .
Excerpts from article : #
In a statement inserted in the record Friday , the Majority Leader said he will hold the Senate in a series of pro forma or nonvoting sessions to prevent the controversial practice .
In the statement , Reid argued that nominations need to get on track , and that Bush has not met the Democrats halfway in agreeing to Democratically backed nominees to important commissions .
 While an election year looms , significant progress can still be made on nominations ,  Reid said .
 I am committed to making that progress if the President will meet me halfway .
 But that progress cant be made if the President seeks controversial recess appointments and fails to make Democratic appointments to important commissions .
Senate sources said Reid made the decision after he was unable to strike a deal with White House officials that would have allowed swift consideration of several key Democratic picks for the executive branch .
In his statement , Reid points to the Federal Communications Commission , Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Nuclear Regulatory Commission as examples where Democratic choices have not been moved along .
 Up until recently , the President has generally discharged that obligation ,  Reid said .
 In the last several months , however , the administration has been stalling progress on Democratic appointments . 

Abstract Contrary to popular assumption , DRAMs used in most modern computers retain their contents for seconds to minutes after power is lost , even at operating temperatures and even if removed from a motherboard .
Although DRAMs become less reliable when they are not refreshed , they are not immediately erased , and their contents persist sufficiently for malicious ( or forensic ) acquisition of usable full - system memory images .
We show that this phenomenon limits the ability of an operating system to protect cryptographic key material from an attacker with physical access .
We use cold reboots to mount attacks on popular disk encryption systems — BitLocker , FileVault , dm- crypt , and TrueCrypt — using no special devices or materials .
We experimentally characterize the extent and predictability of memory remanence and report that remanence times can be increased dramatically with simple techniques .
We offer new algorithms for finding cryptographic keys in memory images and for correcting errors caused by bit decay .
Though we discuss several strategies for partially mitigating these risks , we know of no simple remedy that would eliminate them .

Frequently asked questions
Experiment guide
Political news analysis and a few predictions to keep posts interesting .
Forget the election , ’08 is about impeachment .
Impeachment investigations now will lead to the resignation of Bush and Cheney and put the current candidates on warning .
Find out why we have to insist on impeachment from the woman who wrote the book on it .
Former Congresswoman and author , Elizabeth Holtzman is a voice of reason in these unreasonable times .
If Burt Rutan ever read science fiction , he might recognize himself .
A strong - willed , technically skilled , maverick spaceship builder with a healthy disdain for bureaucracy and a libertarian streak a mile wide , the 64 - year - old Rutan could have stepped from the pages of a Robert Heinlein novel .
Rutan first came to fame in 1986 as the revolutionary designer of Voyager , the first airplane to circle the globe nonstop without refueling .
No fewer than six Rutan - designed craft are in the Smithsonian ’s aerospace collection , including his most famous design to date : SpaceShipOne .
In 2004 , SpaceShipOne was the first — and so far only — private manned spacecraft to fly above Earth ’s atmosphere in a suborbital arc .
Rutan , with his company Scaled Composites , is now trying to capitalize on the success of SpaceShipOne by building SpaceShipTwo for Virgin Galactic , a space tourism company founded by another famous maverick , Richard Branson .
Virgin Galactic plans to offer well - heeled tourists short suborbital trips into space by 2009 .
Ticket prices for the ride have been set at $ 200,000 per passenger , and to date , about 200 people have bought seats .
Looking a little like a futuristic corporate jet , SpaceShipTwo will be almost three times as large as SpaceShipOne , featuring a roomy passenger cabin with seating for six and a two - person cockpit .
But the basic design is the same as SpaceShipOne — launched from an airplane , a hybrid solid / liquid–fueled engine will send the spacecraft arcing above the atmosphere .
As the craft begins to fall back to Earth , hinged segments of its wings will rotate until they are perpendicular to the rest of the wings , automatically forcing the vehicle into the correct attitude during reentry .
DISCOVER spoke to Burt Rutan about his inspiration for SpaceShipOne , what SpaceShipTwo passengers can expect to get for their money , why the future of spaceflight does n’t belong to NASA — and the aftermath of a recent explosion at one of Rutan ’s test facilities during a test of rocket motor components that killed three people and severely injured three others .
SpaceShipOne is different from any other spacecraft ever flown .
How did you come up with the design ?
I was working at Edwards [ Air Force Base in California ] when [ test pilot ]
Mike Adams was killed flying the X - 15 there .
He had instrument confusion and did n’t line the vehicle up straight during reentry , and it broke up .
I focused on that because if we ’re going to be flying members of the public , we need a generic solution to that sort of accident .
What is the future of NASA , given the rise of the private space travel industry ?
NASA is using government money to try to do several things at once .
It is trying to keep the shuttle flying , and every time it has an accident , it adds thousands more engineers and programmers who do more and more work .
The more you fly , the more man-hours it takes to fly , rather than less .
At the same time , NASA is trying to go out and develop something that can service the space station and also go to the moon and to Mars .
This means we have a whole new generation of designers at NASA who are precluded from going out and looking for breakthroughs .
They are forced into building a shuttle replacement using hardware from the ’60s and ’70s .
They are using for the second - stage rocket engine essentially the same engine that was on the Saturn [ upper stages ] , which is a very low - tech steel - cased engine .
They do this because it would cost more to go out and invent something new , because to invent something new you have to try things that you do n’t know will work .
They worry that if things do n’t work , Congress and the taxpayers may look at a failure as a waste of taxpayers ’ money rather than a normal thing that happens when you are doing research .
That ’s why I do n’t feel inappropriate in pronouncing NASA naysay , because they are forced to do that .
Sometimes it seems as if NASA does n’t do anything right .
Do you feel that way ?
No , no .
NASA does hundreds of wonderful things .
They send robots all over the solar system .
They have scientists doing all kinds of stuff .
Some of it is good work .
The stuff that JPL [ the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California ] does is fabulous work .
People think I ’m a NASA critic .
That ’s not true .
I ’m just saying what they are doing on [ the manned space program ] is not looking for the breakthroughs that are needed .
The breakthroughs are likely to come from folks who go out and try some new stuff .
But I have a tremendous amount of respect for what JPL does .
NASA did some phenomenal research during the 1960s in response to [ Yuri ] Gagarin [ the first cosmonaut ] , and very quickly we were driving cars and playing golf on the moon .
That is something that made me very proud to be an American who sent taxpayer funds to that NASA .
How will private spaceflight succeed as an industry ?
Not by making [ private ] spaceflight twice as safe as government spaceflight , or 10 times as safe , but 100 or 600 times as safe .
By 1931 , after a few years ’ experience of flying scheduled airlines , those planes were operating at roughly 600 times the safety of the space shuttle .
I look at safety not in terms of fatalities per passenger - mile , but when you get in and close the door , what is the risk of dying on this flight ?
In 1931 , for commercial airlines the risk was 1 in 33,000 .
For manned spacecraft it has been about 1 in 70 .
I believe that to have an expanding business that wo n’t be hindered by people ’s fear of flying you have to be as safe as the airliners .
Is there a role for the FAA in maintaining safety in space , as the administration now has for airplane travel ?
The current solution is to let people fly at their own risk .
Show them the safety record for the spacecraft they are flying on and have them sign a waiver that says they know this is dangerous and that they are willing to take the risk .
The FAA only gets involved when it comes to the people on the ground , the public who are n’t choosing to be passengers .
The FAA is obliged to enforce rules of operation so that people do n’t have something coming through their roof and killing them .
I do n’t believe that [ the FAA ’s involvement should be so limited ] — the problem is that spacelines will be much more at risk from a lethal liability climate than if they did have FAA approval on their spacecraft safety .
How does SpaceShipTwo compare with Russia ’s old Soyuz capsule , which has already carried five private passengers into space ?
I could n’t compare it to a Soyuz .
It ’s OK for a space tourist like Anousheh [ Ansari , who visited the International Space Station in 2006 ] to go into orbit in a very small capsule with tiny windows and three people crammed in .
Because there you can have a destination that ’s big and spacious .
Ultimately there will be some really cool stuff , like a resort hotel in orbit .
However , for the industry we ’re starting now , for suborbital flight , there is no destination , so the spacecraft you go up in has to be large and spacious .
That ’s why SpaceShipTwo is much bigger than SpaceShipOne :
It needs to be because you want those six people to be floating around and enjoying themselves .
What will a trip in SpaceShipTwo be like for a passenger ?
Well , my job is not going to be running a spaceline or selling tickets or flying .
My job is to build a spaceship that is affordable and safe enough to fly the public .
We are working very hard to optimize the experience , because if you do n’t give people the best experience , they will go somewhere else for their spaceflight .
What do you mean by “ optimize the experience ” for the passenger ?
I do n’t want to indicate everything that entails because we ’d just as well let our competitors find out about it at the latest possible moment !
But some of the things we have talked about are that the ships will be large with large windows .
It will be a large cabin .
The details on how that ’s done we will be proving in test flights .
I would n’t be surprised if at that time we discovered other features that would add to the experience .
Looking out the window , what would I see ?
We will likely be flying downrange a couple of hundred miles instead of going straight up and down like we did with SpaceShipOne .
So the view will depend on where you fly .
The photographs of space taken by our astronauts have been published all over the place .
But the eye is a much more dynamic mechanism than any camera or pictures .
It ’s a more exciting view in person than looking at the photographs .
Of course , I personally am sick and tired of hearing people talk like that : I want to see it myself !
How will passengers prepare for flight ?
We will use the launcher [ the airplane used to carry SpaceShipTwo to high altitude ] to simulate the reentry .
By doing a descending return [ with SpaceShip­Two still attached to the launcher ] , we can actually expose the passengers to high reentry g-loads and also give them a real experience of what this gentle and slow buildup of g’s during reentry is like .
I think during your day or two of training , you will likely go up in the launch airplane and do some floating around in the cabin .
You ’ll do it in the same seats and windows in the cabin that you ’ll go up in .
I think you ’ll be able to just show up at the spaceport and training facility two or three days before your flight .
Will passengers on SpaceShipTwo be able to take pictures ?
I do n’t think you ’ll want to .
I think there will likely be video cameras mounted in the cabin taking pictures of you .
I say you wo n’t want to take pictures because when you go to the Grand Canyon , you walk out to the guardrail and look out there .
You usually do n’t approach with your camera in the on position and walk up and take a picture .
You usually see people enjoying it with the best lenses we have , which are our eyes .
Then before leaving , you take some pictures so you can show your friends at home .
The problem with a suborbital spaceflight experience is that it is relatively short .
You would certainly be taking snapshots if you were spending a couple of weeks in a resort hotel on orbit .
But for suborbital flight I think it will be better if the pictures you see are pictures of you watching , documenting your experience .
It ’s something that will be automatically done , rather than you fumbling with your camera .
What do you say to those who argue that what you ’re doing is not really contributing to space exploration , it ’s just providing expensive entertainment for the rich ?
Look at personal computers or how the Internet grew : Something done for fun turned out to be as necessary as electricity and water .
It ’s because creative people saw what was there and discovered a better use for it .
I think we will find that if we reach our goal of flying 100,000 people in the first 10 or 12 years on SpaceShipTwo , along with others out there with their different spaceships , you are going to get some unforeseen creativity , someone who will figure out something as important as the Internet .
What are the most difficult technological bugs facing you in the development of SpaceShipTwo ?
If I told you that , it would be very revealing to my competition !
I would love it if Jeff Bezos [ the founder of Amazon.com and Blue Origin , a rival spaceflight company ] came out and told me the two most difficult things about developing his suborbital ship .
Do you have any advice for someone coming out of college who wants to design spacecraft ?
I would say that you do n’t have to be stuck working for NASA anymore , and that is good news .
When I got out of college , America built and flew into space five different launch systems in seven years .
We ’re now talking 13 years to do one launch vehicle , and it ’s going to be based on hardware that is 30 and 40 years old .
So my advice would be , let ’s just hope that there will be a bunch of companies like mine developing new rocket launchers , spaceships , and boosters , like we did in the ’60s .
I personally think there will be a lot of jobs .
Is there a private space race going on ?
Of course there is ; the biggest competitors are the Russians .
Just like in 1961 with Gagarin , the Russians have beat us on the first salvo with Dennis Tito [ the world ’s first space tourist ] .
Who would have thought in the 1960s that the first capitalists to sell tickets to let the public fly would be the damned Russians ?
Who would have thought that ?
Does n’t that piss you off ?
Well , we ’re going to do something about that .
Who are your competitors ?
Virgin Galactic , which will be operating SpaceShipTwo , will be only one of several spacelines .
The competitors for Virgin include the Russians , Bezos ’s Blue Origin , and possibly Rocketplane Kistler .
And likely a couple of others who are smart enough not to tell people what they are doing !
What will spaceflight look like a century from now ?
A century is a relatively short period of time .
Let me stick my neck out a little bit further and say that in 300 or 400 years , a large majority of people will go to a planet and not return back to the Earth .
We will colonize .
Lewis and Clark went out and back .
But most of the people who followed them went to California and stayed there .
In a hundred years , I believe you will see such an enormous reduction in the costs of transportation around our solar system that there will be a lot of travel .
I ’d like to see affordable transportation into space in my lifetime .

Subject : Fair Huntington
A truly remarkable record of a particular time -- right up to and including the appearance of Huntington , Long Island and what seems to be a distinctly conservative - looking neighborhood housing a family with a precocious kid who has a particularly smart mouth .
His somewhat older father seems to be charmed by anything the kid has on his mind and which is duly expressed with exuberance .
Once the cast of characters are basically overlooked ( save for Grandma , who makes the only really sane comments in this picture , when speaking of an inglorious past ) we are treated to a virtual time capsule of a visit to the Westinghouse Pavilion of the famed ' 39 World 's Fair in Flushing Meadows , NYC .
Of all things , I 'm most taken with the sound of the pavilion itself -- hearing period gears and bills gnashing and chimbing .
One gets a real sense for the pre-60's world of heavy equipment , a strong , hopeful gaze at the future , and endless fun thinking about the possibilities of life with technology .
I love the comment about the three - way bulb - an invention long taken for granted and now bound for extinction .
I must say some of the comments above , from other site visitors , are incendiary and downright hateful - some speculating , with malice , as to the possible ethnicity of certain characters , which is nonsense and not the least helpful .
I 'll note that no one of " judic " origin would have been allowed to buy property in that Huntington neighborhood .
I doubt that family would have permitted the same to marry into the family .
In summary , it is for the viewer to decide whether the corporate propaganda can be balanced with the more social - leaning aspect of certain labor movements of the time .
The fact is , America 's investment into industrial technology continued , and the country expanded and prospered , for at least a while and in its broadest sense .
And Westinghouse was at the forefront of America 's inventive spirit -- something to be quite proud of within an historical context .
The background story of a marriage thwarted seems a touch mean - spirited , as if a loathsome devil had been totally washed out of any connection to this family , now that his leftist , humorless , and greedy values had been played up for the slanted story .

Before you whip out your GPS finder , go to Flushing Meadows Park .
Take the # 7 train to 111th Street in Queens .
Walk south on 111th Street four blocks .
The site marker is on the opposite side of the New York State Pavilion from the Unisphere .
This film presents an optimistic look at industry and private / corporate enterprise , as well as easily discredited stock Socialist arguments against the same , all framed by a visit to the 1939 / 40 World 's Fair in New York .
Should be required viewing for everyone , during these days of farmed - out industry and neglect of the very industrial / transportation infrastructure promoted in the film .
The digs at the Works Progress Administration and government attempts at managing the depressed economy of those times are priceless .

Subject : We 're Not In Indiana Anymore Toto !
Mom , Dad and Junior travel from Indiana to New York to see the 1939 World 's Fair .
Luckily , Mom 's mother lives in a Long Island suburb so can stay with her and the daughter of the Indiana clan ( Babs ) who 's been living with granny for a while .
Luckier yet , granny lives in a beautiful home and has a maid --- a large black woman straight out central casting .
Just your average American Depression - era family !
Babs ex-boyfriend from Indiana works at the fair as a Westinghouse spokesman .
But Babs has moved on and now has a new boyfriend --- an artist , if you know what I mean .
Worse yet , a MODERN artist .
No good can come of this --- and it does n't .
Babs ' ex offers to show the family around the fair --- it was good of Westinghouse to let him blow an entire day escorting old friends around .
It gives him a chance to educate Junior , who thinks he 'll graduate into a jobless future --- or , as he puts it , straight to the WPA .
With ill - concealed
digs at the New Deal , he teaches Junior the wonders of free enterprise .
The only thing you need is optimism !
When Babs and her new boyfriend show up , things go south in a ... New York minute !
Since he 's an artist he's also , naturally , a socialist and sneers as boyfriend No. 1 describes the wonderful electrical machinery on display .
One such display is of a
ribbon - making machine .
How many workers does that replace , the commie creep wants to know .
Consulting a little notebook , boyfriend No. 1 responds that over 1,000,000 people are employed in the textile industry .
Ouch !
Of course , you can't blame him for not knowing that 30 years later the domestic textile industry will have been globalized out of existence .
Nor can he be blamed for not knowing that Westinghouse , his employer , would cease to exist as an independent
compnay and be swallowed up by a company from the nation which would bomb Pearl Harbor a couple of years after this film was made .
" You Can Be Sure If It 's .... Toshiba ! "
Needless to say , by the end of our little drama , Babs realizes what a jerk she 's been dating , Junior has his faith in America restored and they all , presumably , return to the safety of Indiana , where artists vote Republican and paint pictures of actual things .

Subject : The Middleton's - looking back 70 years .
I agree with Spuzz my favorite Internet Archive reviewer below .
These people act almost as if they come from another planet .
Have we changed in the USA so much ?
Did our Great Grandparents really act and live like this ?
Jim ( the Westinghouse Talking Head ) does look like a highly self repressed type that is just chaffing under the bit and is ready to explode if the right conditions exist .
He is in the Capitalist Rat Race and I think he is beginning to succumb to the pressure of the free market system he worships so much .
I think he secretly wants to throttle Babs in a murder suicide incident .
The pseudo intellectual Hebrew looking Commie boyfriend would fit in nicely with Obama 's left wing Kenyan Cabinet .
If he were alive today he would be a prime candidate for Secretary of Labor or Education .
What is the deal with the ring ?
Is that a standard trick in the 30s to get girls to go to bed with you ... a bogus engagement ring ?
Wow .... maybe men are getting stupider because none of my degenerate hymen popping buddies from school EVER thought of that .
Bab 's looks pretty hot to me .
I will bet she is wild in the sack after you overcome her suppressed sexuality .
She is a bit anorexic though .
It could be the Depression though and the lack of food .
My main question is this :
Did people really sit at dinner like this back in the 30s ?
Everything is so formal and the men ALWAYS are wearing 3 piece suits - even to the FAIR !

Subject : Not a " Fair " representation of the FAIR I have been wanting to see this film ever since the mid 1980s .
At that time , there was really good a documentary about the " 1939 & 40 NY World 's Fair " [ narrated by Jason Robards ] and they showed some of the more " tolerable " clips from THIS " Middleton " movie .
This film however , shows hardly anything of the fair itself -- just the actors portraying " naive Americans " who believe all other countries besides the USA are " trash " or something !
My dad [ who was a kid back then ] did n't like this film either , but he said that alot of people DID think & act this way back then .
I AM a conservative and I LOVE nostalgia as much as anyone and I 'm NOT a " trouble maker " either !
But THIS film is unbelievably irritating & corny propaganda .
The scene where they infer that ANYONE who " draws abstract drawings is evil " is one of the stupidest numb - skulled ideas I 've ever heard !!
If this film had lots & lots & lots of ACTUAL FOOTAGE of the " fair " itself , THAT might be worth it !
But no , this is 95 % " fake American family drama " with 5 % reference to the fair .
Not a " fair " representation of that great FAIR , I think .
All the people who love to WHINE about President Bush should be forced to sit thru THIS film .
They 'd just LOVE living in a USA that THIS film portrays , heh heh .

Garrett 's violin dates from the 18th Century
Garrett explains
" I fell down a flight of stairs and landed on my violin case , " he told the BBC .
" When I opened it up , it was a total mess . "
Garrett , 26 , likened the accident to " losing a dear friend " .
The 230 - year - old instrument will spend the next eight months in a workshop , with a repair bill of around £ 60,000 .
" I think it 's worth the money , " said Garrett .
" You want to have the best repair possible done , which is never the cheapest solution .
" Certain instruments just work very well with the violinist ...
I just loved the violin very , very much . "
In the meantime , Garrett has been offered the use of a Stradivarius , worth an estimated £ 2.5 m , for a Valentine 's Day concert in London .
It has been loaned by London - based dealers J&A Beare , who have arranged for the instrument to be flown in from Milan , Italy .
" I 've already got it here , " Garrett said after rehearsals at the Barbican .
" It 's a beautiful instrument and it will sound perfect tomorrow . "
Prodigy
German - born Garrett first came to attention as a child prodigy , and he played as a soloist with the London Philharmonic before he was 10 .
He paid his own way for the course , supplementing his income by modelling for the likes of Vogue and Armani .
The broken violin was made by Italian craftsman GB Guadagnini , who referred to himself as an " alumnus of Stradivarius " .
Garrett said he bought the 1772 violin for $ 1 million ( £ 510,000 ) in 2003 .
The star said his accident came as he tried to make an early getaway from the Barbican Centre last year .
" I left the concert after the first half because my family was there and we wanted to grab dinner , " he said .
" The stairs were very slippery and I still had my concert shoes on .
I had my violin over my shoulder , but I slipped and landed on my violin case .
" I 'm not happy about it at all , but it kind of saved my life . "
1 Ubari Oasis ( Libya )
Ubari is an oasis city in South - Western Libya , in the Targa valley .
It lies between the Messak Sattafat plateau and Idhan Ubari sand dunes and lakes .
The oasis is the second centre after Ghat for Kel Ajjer Tuareg .
Neighbouring villages include Germa , and In Garran .
The water is salted like the dead sea , but swimming into it is rather not a good idea as it is very dirty .
2 Huacachina ( Peru )
Shimmering beneath the scorching sun of the Peruvian desert is an extraordinary sight – a tiny settlement , complete with lagoon , lush palm groves , carob trees , cafes , neatly clipped lawns , 100 - strong population and even the odd swimming pool .
For thousands of years , Huacachina , otherwise known as the ‘ oasis of Americas ’ – there is only one – has been a beacon of green , hidden deep amid hundreds of miles of barren desert .
Huacachina serves as a resort for local families from the nearby city of Ica , and increasingly as an attraction for tourists drawn by the sport of sandboarding on sand dunes that stretch several hundred feet high .
3 Ein Gedi ( Israel )
4 Chebika Oasis ( Tunisia )
En Gedi is the largest oasis along the western shore of the Dead Sea .
The springs here have allowed nearly continuous inhabitation of the site since the Chalcolithic period .
The area was allotted to the tribe of Judah , and was famous in the time of Solomon ( Josh 15:62 ) .
Today the Israeli kibbutz of En Gedi sits along the southern bank of the Nahal Arugot .
Chebika belongs to the collection of unlikely desert oases of the mountains north of the great Tunisian chotts .
Least famous , Chebika offers perhaps the most effective and dramatic experience among them .
Where the mountains rise , Chebika lies .
Most of the year it is so exposed to the sun that it once was known as Qasr el - Shams , Castle of the Sun .
5 Timia Oasis ( Niger )
Timia Oasis , located on the Aïr Mountains ( northern Niger ) , is billed as the most beautiful oasis in the country for a reason .
It is not quite the image of a pool of water amidst the sand - dunes with a couple of palm - trees on either side .
Instead it is a rich network of lush gardens in the middle of some of the most hostile terrain on earth - as true an oasis as you ’ll ever find .
Oranges and pomegranates hang from branches and can be plucked ( for a fee ) and eaten on the spot .
Date palms and citrus trees , and beneath the cool of the spreading leaves , any number of herbs , cereals and garden vegetables are grown .
The Tuareg who tend the gardens export their produce all over the Aïr region - indeed in some cases all over Niger .
After the searing heat of the Sahara , the Timia Oasis is the perfect rest - stop for a group of travellers , and time is well spent exploring the refreshing shade of the carefully - groomed orchards .
6 Gaberoun ( Libya )
Gaberoun is an oasis with a large lake located in the municipality Sabha in the Libyan Sahara .
The old Bedouin settlement by the western shore of the lake has been abandoned , and now lays in ruins .
A rudimentary tourist camp is located on the northeastern shore , including an open patio , sleeping huts , and a souvenir shop ( attended by a touareg in full costume ) in the winter .
The lake is very salty , swimming can be pleasant despite the salt water crustaceans .
Mosquitoes are abundant , especially in the summer .
October to May is considered the best time to visit as the climate is milder .
7 Herðubreiðarlindir ( Iceland )
On Herðubreið , situated in the Highlands of Iceland in the midst of the desert of Ódáðahraun –a very big lava field originating from eruptions of the volcano Trölladyngja– , lies an oasis called Herðubreiðarlindir with a camp ground and famous hiking trails .
In former times , outcasts lived there who had been excluded from Icelandic society because of crimes they had committed .
For years there have been urban legends about a " brown sound " or " brown note , " a frequency so low that it 'll literally cause you to shit yourself .
Not only has this elusive weapon been sought by governments , but it also crops up in science fiction .
Just think about what this insidious weapon could do in the hands of an evil villain !
It turns out the legend was born after several real - life tests of the Republic XF - 84H " Thunderscreech " airplane in 1956 , which earned the honor of being the loudest airplane ever built .
Find out more about the poop plane and the quest for the sound of brown inside .

The problem with the Thunderscreech was that the supersonic propeller blades would cause rapid - fire shockwaves , even when the plane was sitting on the ground .
Test pilots refused to take it up , and officials would order it to be towed far from the test center before firing up the engines , and only one of the two prototypes ever flew , logging only 10 hours .
Why ?
Because those shockwaves would case nausea , spasms , seizures , and loosening of the bowels .
What a ride .
You can hear the otherworldy banshee wail of one here .
So the word spread that the soundwaves generated by the engines were causing the pooping , and like a game of telephone , soon folks began believing there was a secret low frequency that could unlock the human sphincter .
NASA performed tests of low frequencies because they were worried their astronauts might start crapping out upon launch .
They mounted cockpit seats on vibration tables that were blasted with 160 decibels in the range of 0.5 hertz to 40 hertz , but no one sounded off into the brown .
Even more recently companies have built extremely massive subwoofers that have failed to make anyone prairie dog it , despite the massive amounts of low frequencies being pumped out .

Although this has n't stopped it from seeping into poopular culture , probably most famously in Transmetropolitan , where Spider Jerusalem carries a Bowel Disruptor that operates on the brown note principle .
It even has settings from " diarrhea " to " prolapse . "
Ouch .
Although it was probably ripped off from Steve Meretzky 's ( of Infocom fame ) The Superhero League of Hoboken computer game from 1994 , Spider put it to a lot better use .
In fact , Ben Folds used the brown note with Improv Everywhere in a 1996 concert hoax involving diapers and chocolate syrup .
Now that 's entertainment .
Mythbusters even tackled the legend on an episode , and they recorded no poop at all .

So , until science comes up with a new method for causing uncontrollable evacuation , bowel disruptors will sadly remain science fiction and not fact .
Which is a real pity , because we sure could have used one during the upcoming presidential elections .
We 'll have to just stick to vomit guns .

On 29 October , the Israeli army forced more than 200 Palestinians from their homes in the village of Khirbet Qassa , Hebron District .
The small village was established in the 1950s and most of its residents are refugees from the village of Beit Jibrin .
The new Tarkumiya checkpoint , which lies very close to the Green Line , is being built near the village .
The villagers lived in tents and caves and gained a livelihood from raising sheep and goats .
Since construction began on the Separation Barrier , separating the village from the rest of the West Bank , the army has harassed the residents and denied them access to the grazing fields and other facilities that lie beyond the Barrier .
About a year and a half ago , the army warned the residents that it intended to demolish their homes on the grounds that they were built without a permit .
On 25 October , the army left demolition orders under stones at the entrances to homes in the village .
On 29 October , soldiers in jeeps and bulldozers began to demolish the tents and caves without giving the residents leave to remove their possessions .
According to testimonies villagers gave to B'Tselem , soldiers beat a villager who tried to protect his flock , which he kept in one of the caves .
Only after an officer intervened was he allowed to evacuate his livestock .

The army loaded the water containers and feeding troughs onto a truck and deposited them beyond the Barrier .
Much of the residents ' property was crushed and buried among the ruins .
After the army 's action , the officer told the residents that they had to leave the site by noon the next day , and that they would be arrested and their livestock confiscated if they did not obey .
The following afternoon , patrols of the Nature Reserves and Parks Authority came and forced the residents to leave .
Most of the residents are now homeless and have had to find temporary housing in the nearby town of Idhna .

Update ( 4/25/14 ) :
An FDA advisory panel has recommended banning the kind of devices used on students at the Rottenberg school .
Update ( 9/4/12 ) : Jennifer Gonnerman wrote this update in New York magazine to her epic 2007 Mother Jones exposé on torture at the “ school of shock . ”
Rob Santana awoke terrified .
He ’d had that dream again , the one where silver wires ran under his shirt and into his pants , connecting to electrodes attached to his limbs and torso .
Adults armed with surveillance cameras and remote - control activators watched his every move .
One press of a button , and there was no telling where the shock would hit — his arm or leg or , worse , his stomach .
All Rob knew was that the pain would be intense .
Every time he woke from this dream , it took him a few moments to remember that he was in his own bed , that there were n’t electrodes locked to his skin , that he was n’t about to be shocked .
It was no mystery where this recurring nightmare came from — not A Clockwork Orange or 1984 , but the years he spent confined in America ’s most controversial “ behavior modification ” facility .
In 1999 , when Rob was 13 , his parents sent him to the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center , located in Canton , Massachusetts , 20 miles outside Boston .
The facility , which calls itself a “ special needs school , ” takes in all kinds of troubled kids — severely autistic , mentally retarded , schizophrenic , bipolar , emotionally disturbed — and attempts to change their behavior with a complex system of rewards and punishments , including painful electric shocks to the torso and limbs .
Of the 234 current residents , about half are wired to receive shocks , including some as young as nine or ten .
Nearly 60 percent come from New York , a quarter from Massachusetts , the rest from six other states and Washington , D.C. The Rotenberg Center , which has 900 employees and annual revenues exceeding $ 56 million , charges $ 220,000 a year for each student .
States and school districts pick up the tab .
The Rotenberg Center is the only facility in the country that disciplines students by shocking them , a form of punishment not inflicted on serial killers or child molesters or any of the 2.2 million inmates now incarcerated in U.S. jails and prisons .
Over its 36 - year history , six children have died in its care , prompting numerous lawsuits and government investigations .
Last year , New York state investigators filed a blistering report that made the place sound like a high school version of Abu Ghraib .
Yet the program continues to thrive — in large part because no one except desperate parents , and a few state legislators , seems to care about what happens to the hundreds of kids who pass through its gates .
In Rob Santana ’s case , he freely admits he was an out - of - control kid with “ serious behavioral problems . ”
At birth he was abandoned at the hospital , traces of cocaine , heroin , and alcohol in his body .
A middle - class couple adopted him out of foster care when he was 11 months old , but his troubles continued .
He started fires ; he got kicked out of preschool for opening the back door of a moving school bus ; when he was six , he cut himself with a razor .
His mother took him to specialists , who diagnosed him with a slew of psychiatric problems : attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder , post - traumatic stress disorder , bipolar disorder , and obsessive - compulsive disorder .
Rob was at the Rotenberg Center for about three and a half years .
From the start , he cursed , hollered , fought with employees .
Eventually the staff obtained permission from his mother and a Massachusetts probate court to use electric shock .
Rob was forced to wear a backpack containing five two - pound , battery - operated devices , each connected to an electrode attached to his skin .
“ I felt humiliated , ” he says .
“ You have a bunch of wires coming out of your shirt and pants . ”
Rob remained hooked up to the apparatus 24 hours a day .
He wore it while jogging on the treadmill and playing basketball , though it was n’t easy to sink a jump shot with a 10 - pound backpack on .
When he showered , a staff member would remove his electrodes , all except the one on his arm , which he had to hold outside the shower to keep it dry .
At night , Rob slept with the backpack next to him , under the gaze of a surveillance camera .
Employees shocked him for aggressive behavior , he says , but also for minor misdeeds , like yelling or cursing .
Each shock lasts two seconds .
“ It hurts like hell , ” Rob says .
( The school ’s staff claim it is no more painful than a bee sting ; when I tried the shock , it felt like a horde of wasps attacking me all at once .
Two seconds never felt so long . )
On several occasions , Rob was tied facedown to a four - point restraint board and shocked over and over again by a person he could n’t see .
The constant threat of being zapped did persuade him to act less aggressively , but at a high cost .
“ I thought of killing myself a few times , ” he says .
Rob ’s mother Jo-Anne deLeon had sent him to the Rotenberg Center at the suggestion of the special - ed committee at his school district in upstate New York , which , she says , told her that the program had everything Rob needed .
She believed he would receive regular psychiatric counseling — though the school does not provide this .
As the months passed , Rob ’s mother became increasingly unhappy .
“ My whole dispute with them was , ‘ When is he going to get psychiatric treatment ? ' ” she says .
“ I think they had to get to the root of his problems — like why was he so angry ?
Why was he so destructive ?
I really think they needed to go in his head somehow and figure this out . ”
She did n’t think the shocks were helping , and in 2002 she sent a furious fax demanding that Rob ’s electrodes be removed before she came up for Parents ’
Day .
She says she got a call the next day from the executive director , Matthew Israel , who told her , “ You do n’t want to stick with our treatment plan ?
Pick him up . ”
( Israel says he does n’t remember this conversation , but adds , “ If a parent does n’t want the use of the skin shock and wants psychiatric treatment , this is n’t the right program for them . ” )
Rob ’s mother is not the only parent angry at the Rotenberg Center .
Last year , Evelyn Nicholson sued the facility after her 17 - year - old son Antwone was shocked 79 times in 18 months .
Nicholson says she decided to take action after Antwone called home and told her , “ Mommy , you do n’t love me anymore because you let them hurt me so bad . ”
Rob and Antwone do n’t know each other ( Rob left the facility before Antwone arrived ) , but in some ways their stories are similar .
Antwone ’s birth mother was a drug addict ; he was burned on an electric hot plate as an infant .
Evelyn took him in as a foster child and later adopted him .
The lawsuit she filed against the Rotenberg Center set off a chain of events : investigations by multiple government agencies , emotional public hearings , scrutiny by the media .
Legislation to restrict or ban the use of electric shocks in such facilities has been introduced in two state legislatures .
Yet not much has changed .
Rob has paid little attention to the public debate over his alma mater , though he visits its website occasionally to see which of the kids he knew are still there .
After he left the center he moved back in with his parents .
At first glance , he seems like any other 21 - year - old : baggy Rocawear jeans , black T - shirt , powder - blue Nikes .
But when asked to recount his years at the Rotenberg Center , he speaks for nearly two hours in astonishing detail , recalling names and specific events from seven or eight years earlier .
When he describes his recurring nightmares , he raises both arms and rubs his forehead with his palms .
Despite spending more than three years at this behavior - modification facility , Rob still has problems controlling his behavior .
In 2005 , he was arrested for attempted assault and sent to jail .
( This year he was arrested again , for drugs and assault . )
Being locked up has given him plenty of time to reflect on his childhood , and he has gained a new perspective on the Rotenberg Center .
“ It ’s worse than jail , ” he told me .
“ That place is the worst place on earth . ”
One Punishment Fits All
The story of the Rotenberg Center is in many ways a tale of two schools .
Slightly more than half the residents are what the school calls “ high functioning ” : kids like Rob and Antwone , who have diagnoses like attention - deficit disorder , bipolar disorder , post - traumatic stress disorder , and other emotional problems .
The other group is even more troubled .
Referred to as “ low functioning , ” it includes kids with severe autism and mental retardation ; most cannot speak or have very limited verbal abilities .
Some have behaviors so extreme they can be life threatening : chomping on their hands and arms , running into walls , nearly blinding themselves by banging their heads on the floor again and again .
The Rotenberg Center has long been known as the school of last resort — a place that will take any kid , no matter how extreme his or her problems are .
It does n’t matter if a child has been booted out of 2 , 5 , 10 , or 20 other programs — he or she is still welcome here .
For desperate parents , the Rotenberg Center can seem like a godsend .
Just ask Louisa Goldberg , the mother of 25 - year - old Andrew , who has severe mental retardation .
Andrew ’s last residential school kicked him out after he kept assaulting staff members ; the Rotenberg Center was the only place willing to accept him .
According to Louisa , Andrew ’s quality of life has improved dramatically since 2000 , when he was hooked up to the shock device , known as the Graduated Electronic Decelerator , or ged .
The Rotenberg Center has a policy of not giving psychiatric drugs to students — no Depakote , Paxil , Risperdal , Ritalin , or Seroquel .
It ’s a policy that appeals to Louisa and many other parents .
At Andrew ’s last school , she says , “ he had so many medicines in him he ’d take a two - hour nap in the morning , he ’d take a two - hour nap in the afternoon .
They ’d have him in bed at eight o’clock at night .
He was sleeping his life away . ”
These days , Louisa says she is no longer afraid when her son comes home to visit .
“ [ For him ] to have an electrode on and to receive a ged is to me a much more favorable way of dealing with this , ” she says .
“ He ’s not sending people to the hospital . ”
Marguerite Famolare brought her son Michael to the Rotenberg Center six years ago , after he attacked her so aggressively she had to call 911 and , in a separate incident , flipped over a kitchen table onto a tutor .
Michael , now 19 , suffers from mental retardation and severe autism .
These days , when he comes home for a visit , Marguerite carries his shock activator in her purse .
All she has to do , she says , is show it to him .
“ He ’ll automatically comply to whatever my signal command may be , whether it is ‘ Put on your seatbelt , ’ or ‘ Hand me that apple , ’ or ‘ Sit appropriately and eat your food , ' ” she says .
“ It ’s made him a human being , a civilized human being . ”
Massachusetts officials have twice tried to shut the Rotenberg Center down — once in the 1980s and again in the 1990s .
Both times parents rallied to its defense , and both times it prevailed in court .
( See “ Why Can’t Massachusetts Shut Matthew Israel Down ? ” page 44 . )
The name of the center ensures nobody forgets these victories ; it was Judge Ernest Rotenberg , now deceased , who in the mid-’80s ruled that the facility could continue using aversives — painful punishments designed to change behavior — so long as it obtained authorization from the Bristol County Probate and Family Court in each student ’s case .
But even though the facility was n’t using electric shock when this ruling was handed down , the court rarely , if ever , bars the Rotenberg Center from adding shock to a student ’s treatment plan , according to lawyers and disability advocates who have tried to prevent it from doing so .
Since Evelyn Nicholson filed her lawsuit in 2006 , the Rotenberg Center has faced a new wave of criticism and controversy .
( See “ Nagging ?
Zap .
Swearing ?
Zap , ” page 41 . )
And again , the facility has relied heavily on the testimonials of parents like Louisa Goldberg and Marguerite Famolare to defend itself .
Not surprisingly , the most vocal parent - supporters tend to be those with the sickest children , since they are the ones with the fewest options .
But at the Rotenberg Center , the same methods of “ behavior modification ” are applied to all kids , no matter what is causing their behavior problems .
And so , while Rob would seem to have little in common with mentally retarded students like Michael and Andrew , they all shared a similar fate once their parents placed them under the care of the same psychologist , a radical behaviorist known as Dr. Israel .
Dr. Israel ’s Radical Behavior
In 1950 , matt israel was a Harvard freshman looking to fill his science requirement .
He knew little about B.F. Skinner when he signed up for his course , Human Behavior .
Soon , though , Israel became fascinated with Skinner ’s scientific approach to the study of behavior , and he picked up Walden Two , Skinner ’s controversial novel about an experimental community based on the principles of behaviorism .
The book changed Israel ’s life .
“ I decided my mission was to start a utopian community , ” he says .
Israel got a Ph.D. in psychology in 1960 from Harvard , and started two communal houses outside Boston .
One of the people Israel lived with was a three - year - old named Andrea , the daughter of a roommate .
The two did not get along .
“ She was wild and screaming , ” Israel recalls .
“ I would retreat to my own room , and she ’d be trying to pull away and get into my room , and I ’d have to hold the door on one side to keep her from disturbing me . ”
When company would come over , he says , “ She would walk around with a toy broom and whack people over the head . ”
Through experiments with rats and pigeons , Skinner had demonstrated how animals learn from the consequences of their actions .
With permission from Andrea ’s mother , Israel decided to try out Skinner ’s ideas on the three - year - old .
When Andrea was well behaved , Israel took her out for walks .
But when she misbehaved , he punished her by snapping his finger against her cheek .
His mentor Skinner preached that positive reinforcement was vastly preferable to punishment , but Israel says his methods transformed the girl .
“ Instead of being an annoyance , she became a charming addition to the house . ”
Israel ’s success with Andrea convinced him to start a school .
In 1971 , he founded the Behavior Research Institute in Rhode Island , a facility that would later move to Massachusetts and become known as the Judge Rotenberg Center .
Israel took in children nobody else wanted — severely autistic and mentally retarded kids who did dangerous things to themselves and others .
To change their behavior , he developed a large repertoire of punishments : spraying kids in the face with water , shoving ammonia under their noses , pinching the soles of their feet , smacking them with a spatula , forcing them to wear a “ white - noise helmet ” that assaulted them with static .
In 1977 , Israel opened a branch of his program in California ’s San Fernando Valley , along with Judy Weber , whose son Tobin is severely autistic .
Two years later , the Los Angeles Times reported Israel had pinched the feet of Christopher Hirsch , an autistic 12 - year - old , at least 24 times in 30 minutes , while the boy screamed and cried .
This was a punishment for soiling his pants .
( “ It might have been true , ” Israel says .
“ It ’s true that pinches were being used as an aversive .
The pinch , the spank , the muscle squeeze , water sprays , bad taste — all those procedures were being used . ” )
Israel was in the news again in 1981 , when another student , 14 - year - old Danny Aswad , died while strapped facedown to his bed .
In 1982 , the California Department of Social Services compiled a 64 - page complaint that read like a catalog of horrors , describing students with bruises , welts , and cuts .
It also accused Israel of telling a staff member “ to grow his fingernails longer so he could give an effective pinch . ”
In 1982 , the facility settled with state officials and agreed to stop using physical punishments .
Now called Tobinworld , and still run by Judy Weber , it is a $ 10 - million - a - year organization operating day schools near Los Angeles and San Francisco .
The Rotenberg Center considers itself a “ sister school ” to Tobinworld , and Israel makes frequent trips to California to visit Weber .
The two were married last year .
Despite his setback in California , Israel continued to expand on the East Coast — and to generate controversy .
In 1985 , Vincent Milletich , an autistic 22 - year - old , suffered a seizure and died after he was put in restraints and forced to wear a white - noise helmet .
Five years later , 19 - year - old Linda Cornelison , who had the mental capacity of a toddler , refused to eat .
On the bus to school , she clutched her stomach ; someone had to carry her inside , and she spent the day on a couch in a classroom .
Linda could not speak , and the staff treated her actions as misbehaviors .
Between 3:52 p.m. and 8 p.m. , staffers punished her with 13 spatula spankings , 29 finger pinches , 14 muscle squeezes , and 5 forced inhalings of ammonia .
It turned out that Linda had a perforated stomach .
She died on the operating table at 1:45 a.m .
The local district attorney ’s office examined the circumstances of Vincent ’s death but declined to file any charges .
In Linda ’s case , the Massachusetts Department of Mental Retardation investigated and found that while Linda ’s treatment had “ violated the most basic codes and standards of decency and humane treatment , ” there was insufficient evidence to prove that the use of aversives had caused her death .
By the time Linda died , Israel was moving away from spatulas and toward electric shock , which , from his perspective , offered many advantages .
“ To give a spank or a muscle squeeze or a pinch , you had to control the student physically , and that could lead to a struggle , ” he says .
“ A lot of injuries were occurring . ”
Since shocking only required pressing a button , Israel could eliminate the need for employees to wrestle a kid to the ground .
Another benefit , he says , was increased consistency .
It was hard to know if one staff member ’s spatula spanking was harder than another ’s , but it was easy to measure how many times a staff member had shocked a child .
Israel purchased a shock device then on the market known as sibis — Self - Injurious Behavior Inhibiting System — that had been invented by the parents of an autistic girl and delivered a mild shock that lasted .2 second .
Between 1988 and 1990 , Israel used sibis on 29 students , including one of his most challenging , Brandon , then 12 , who would bite off chunks of his tongue , regurgitate entire meals , and pound himself on the head .
At times Brandon was required to keep his hands on a paddle ; if he removed them , he would get automatic shocks , one per second .
One infamous day , Brandon received more than 5,000 shocks .
“ You have to realize , ” Israel says .
“ I thought his life was in the balance .
I could n’t find any medical solution .
He was vomiting , losing weight .
He was down to 52 pounds .
I knew it was risky to use the shock in large numbers , but if I persevered that day , I thought maybe it would eventually work .
There was nothing else I could think of to do … but by the time it went into the 3,000 or 4,000 range , it became clear it was n’t working . ”
This day was a turning point in the history of Israel ’s operation — that ’s when he decided to ratchet up the pain .
The problem , he decided , was that the shock sibis emitted was not strong enough .
He says he asked sibis ‘s manufacturer , Human Technologies , to create a more powerful device , but it refused .
“ So we had to redesign the device ourselves , ” he says .
He envisioned a device that would start with a low current but that could increase the voltage if needed — hence its name , Graduated Electronic Decelerator or ged — but he abandoned this idea early on .
“ As it turns out , that ’s really not a wise approach , ” he says .
“ It ’s sort of like operating a car and wearing out the brakes because you never really apply them strongly enough .
Instead , we set it at a certain level that was more or less going to be effective for most of our students . ”
Thirty years earlier , O. Ivar Lovaas , a psychology professor at ucla , had pioneered the use of slaps and screams and electric jolts to try to normalize the behavior of autistic kids .
Life magazine featured his work in a nine - page photo essay in 1965 with the headline , “ A surprising , shocking treatment helps far - gone mental cripples . ”
Lovaas eventually abandoned these methods , telling cbs in 1993 that shock was “ only a temporary suppression ” because patients become inured to the pain .
“ These people are so used to pain that they can adapt to almost any kind of aversive you give them , ” he said .
Israel encountered this same sort of adaptation in his students , but his solution was markedly different :
He decided to increase the pain once again .
Today , there are two shock devices in use at the Rotenberg Center : the ged and the ged - 4 .
The devices look similar and both administer a two - second shock , but the ged - 4 is nearly three times more powerful — and the pain it inflicts is that much more severe .
The Mickey Mouse Club
Ten years ago , Israel hung up a Mickey Mouse poster in the main hall , and he noticed that it made people smile — so he bought every Mickey Mouse poster he could find .
He hung them in the corridors and even papered the walls of what became known as the Mickey Mouse Conference Room .
Entering the Rotenberg Center is a bit like stepping into a carnival fun house , I discovered during a two - day visit last autumn .
Two brushed - aluminum dogs , each nearly 5 feet tall and sporting a purple neon collar , stand guard outside .
Giant silver stars dangle from the lobby ceiling ; the walls and chairs in the front offices are turquoise , lime green , and lavender .
Israel , 74 , still holds the title of executive director , for which he pays himself nearly $ 400,000 in salary and benefits .
He appears utterly unimposing : short and slender with soft hands , rounded shoulders , curly white hair , paisley tie .
Then he sits down beside me and , unprompted , starts talking about shocking children .
“ The treatment is so powerful it ’s hard not to use if you have seen how effective it is , ” he says quietly .
“ It ’s brief .
It ’s painful .
But there are no side effects .
It ’s two seconds of discomfort . ”
His tone is neither defensive nor apologetic ; rather , it ’s perfectly calm , almost soothing .
It ’s the sort of demeanor a mother might find comforting if she were about to hand over her child .
Before we set off on our tour of the facility , there ’s something Israel wants me to see : Before & After , a homemade movie featuring six of his most severe cases .
Israel has been using some of the same grainy footage for more than two decades , showing it to parents of prospective students as well as visiting reporters .
They ’ve already mailed me a copy , but Israel wants to make sure I watch it .
An assistant slips the tape into the vcr , Israel presses the remote , and we all stare at the screen :
1977 : An 11 - year - old girl named Caroline arrives at the school strapped down onto a stretcher , her head encased in a helmet .
In the next shot , free from restraints , she crouches down and tries to smash her helmeted head against the floor .
1981 : Janine , also 11 years old , shrieks and slams her head against the ground , a table , the door .
Bald spots testify to the severity of her troubles ; she ’s yanked out so much hair it ’s half gone .
Both girls exhibit autistic behaviors , and compared with these scenes , the “ After ” footage looks almost unbelievable : Janine splashes in a plastic pool , while Caroline grins as she sits in a chair at a beauty salon .
“ Most people have n’t seen these pictures , ” Israel says , setting down the remote .
“ They have n’t seen children like this , so they can not imagine .
These are children for whom positive - only procedures did not work , drugs did not work .
And if it was n’t for this treatment , some of these people would not be alive . ”
The video is extremely persuasive : The girls ’ self - abuse is so violent and so frightening that it almost makes me want to grab a ged remote and push the button myself .
Of course , this is precisely the point .
Considering how compelling the “ After ” footage is , I am surprised to learn that five of the six children featured in it are still here .
“ This is Caroline , ” one of my escorts says an hour or two later as we walk down a corridor .
Without an introduction , I would not have known .
Caroline , 39 , slumps forward in a wheelchair , her fists balled up , head covered by a red helmet .
“ Blow me a kiss , Caroline , ” Israel says .
She does n’t respond .
A few minutes later , I meet 36 - year - old Janine , who appears in much better shape .
She ’s not wearing a helmet and has a full head of black hair .
She ’s also got a backpack on her shoulders and canvas straps hanging from her legs , the telltale sign that electrodes are attached to both calves .
For 16 years — nearly half her life — Janine has been hooked up to Israel ’s shock device .
A couple years ago , when the shocks began to lose their effect , the staff switched the devices inside her backpack to the much more painful ged - 4 .
Rogue Science
In 1994 , matthew israel had just 64 students .
Today he has 234 .
This astonishing rate of growth is largely the result of a dramatic change in the types of students he takes in .
Until recently , nearly all were “ low functioning , ” autistic and mentally retarded people .
But today slightly more than 50 percent are “ high functioning , ” with diagnoses like add , adhd , and bipolar disorder .
New York state supplies the majority of these students , many of whom grew up in the poorest parts of New York City .
Yet despite this change in his population , Israel ’s methods have remained essentially the same .
Israel has long faced criticism that he has not published research about his use of electric shocks in peer - reviewed journals , where experts could scrutinize it .
To defend his methods , he points to a bibliography of 110 research articles that he ’s posted on the Rotenberg Center website .
This catalog seems impressive at first .
Studied more closely , however , it is not nearly so convincing .
Three - quarters of the articles were published more than 20 years ago .
Eight were written or cowritten by Lovaas , the ucla - affiliated behaviorist .
One of America ’s leading autism experts , Lovaas long ago stopped endorsing painful aversives .
And Lovaas ’ old studies focus primarily on children with autism who engage in extreme self - injury — not on troubled teens who have been diagnosed with adhd or add .
But then , it would be hard for Israel to find contemporary research supporting his program , because the practice of treating self - abusive kids with pain has been largely abandoned .
According to Dr. Saul Axelrod , a professor at Temple University and an expert on behavior modification , “ the field has moved away from painful stimuli because of public outcry and because we ’ve devised better techniques , ” including determining the cause of an individual ’s self - abuse .
Another expert Israel cites several times is Dr. Brian A. Iwata , a consultant on the development of sibis , the device Israel modified to create his ged .
Now a professor of psychology and psychiatry at the University of Florida , he ’s a nationally recognized authority on treating severe self - abuse among children with developmental disabilities .
Iwata has visited the Rotenberg Center and describes its approach as dangerously simplistic : “ There appears to be a mission of that program to use shock for problem behaviors .
It does n’t matter what that behavior is . ”
Iwata has consulted for 25 states and says there is little relationship between what goes on at Israel ’s program and what goes on at other facilities .
“ He may have gotten his Ph.D. at Harvard , but he did n’t learn what he ’s doing at Harvard .
Whatever he ’s doing , he decided to do on his own . ”
Paul Touchette , who also studied with B.F. Skinner , has known Israel since the 1960s when they were both in Cambridge .
Like Israel , Touchette went on to treat children with autism who exhibit extreme self - abuse , but he is n’t a fan of Israel ’s approach either .
“ Punishment does n’t get at the cause , ” says Touchette , who is on the faculty of the University of California - Irvine School of Medicine .
“ It just scares the hell out of patients . ”
Over the decades , Touchette has followed Israel ’s career and bumped into him at professional conferences .
“ He ’s a very smart man , but he ’s an embarrassment to his profession , ” Touchette says .
“ I ’ve never been able to figure out if Matt is a little off - kilter and actually believes all this stuff , or whether he ’s just a clever businessman . ”
Big Reward Store
At the rotenberg center , an elaborate system of rewards and punishments governs all interactions .
Well - behaved kids can watch TV , go for pizza , play basketball .
Students who ’ve earned points for good behavior visit a store stocked with dvd players , cd s , cologne , PlayStation 2 , Essence magazine , knockoff Prada purses — anything the staff thinks students might want .
But even more prized is a visit to the “ Big Reward Store , ” an arcade full of pinball machines , video games , a pool table , and the most popular feature , a row of 42 - inch flat - screen TVs hooked up to Xbox 360s .
Students like the “ brs ” for another reason — it ’s the only place many can socialize freely .
At the Rotenberg Center , students have to earn the right to talk to each other .
“ We had to wait until we were in brs to communicate with others , ” says Isabel Cedeño , a 16 - year - old who ran away from Rotenberg in 2006 after her boyfriend , a former student , came and got her .
“ That was the only time you really laughed , had fun , hung around with your friends .
Because usually , you ca n’t talk to them .
It was basically like we had to have enemies .
They did n’t want us to be friendly with nobody . ”
Students live grouped together in homes and apartments scattered in nearby towns and are bused to the facility ’s headquarters every morning .
They spend their days in classrooms , staring at a computer screen , their backs to the teacher .
They are supposed to teach themselves , using self - instruction programs that include lessons in math , reading , and typing .
Even with breaks for gym and lunch , the days can be incredibly dull .
“ On paper , it does look like they ’re being educated , because we have lesson plans , ” says former teacher Jessica Croteau , who oversaw a classroom of high - functioning teens for six months before leaving in 2006 .
But “ to self - teach is not exciting .
Why would the kids want to sit there and read a chapter on their own without any discussion ? ”
Croteau says teachers have to spend so much time monitoring misbehaviors there ’s often little time left for teaching .
Whenever a student disobeys a rule , a staff member must point it out , using the student ’s name and just one or two rote phrases like , “ Mark , there ’s no stopping work .
Work on your task , please . ”
Each time a student curses or yells , a staffer marks it on the student ’s recording sheet .
Teachers and aides then use the sheet to calculate what level of punishment is required — when to just say “ No ! ” and when to shock .
Employees carry students ’ shock activators inside plastic cases , which they hook onto their belt loops .
These cases are known as “ sleds , ” and each sled has a photo on it to ensure employees do n’t zap the wrong kid .
Behaviorism would seem to dictate that staff shock students immediately after they break the rules .
But if employees learn about a misbehavior after it has occurred — by , say , reviewing surveillance footage — they may still administer punishment .
Rob Santana recalls that Mondays were always the most stressful day of the week .
He would sit at his desk all day , trying to remember if he had broken any rules over the weekend , waiting to see if he ’d be shocked .
Employees are encouraged to use the element of surprise .
“ Attempt to be as discreet as possible and hold the transmitter out of view of the student , ” states the employee manual .
This way , students cannot do anything to minimize the pain , like flipping over their electrodes or tensing their muscles .
“ We hear the sound of [ a staffer ] picking up a sled , ” says Isabel , the former student .
“ Then we turn around and see the person jump out of their seat . ”
Employees shock students for a wide range of behaviors , from violent actions to less serious offenses , like getting out of their seats without permission .
In 2006 , the New York State Education Department sent a team of investigators , including three psychologists , to the Rotenberg Center , then issued a scathing report .
Among its many criticisms was that the staff shocked kids for “ nagging , swearing , and failing to maintain a neat appearance . ”
Israel only disputes the latter .
As for nagging and swearing ?
“ Sometimes a behavior looks innocuous , ” he says , “ but if it ’s an antecedent for aggression , it may have to be treated with an aversive . ”
New York officials disagreed , and in January 2007 issued regulations that would prohibit shocking New York students for minor infractions .
But a group of New York parents filed a federal lawsuit to stop the state from enforcing these regulations .
They prevailed , winning a temporary restraining order against the state , one that permits the Rotenberg Center staffers to continue using shock .
The parents ’ case is expected to go to trial in 2008 .
When they talk about why they use the shock device , Israel and his employees like to use the word “ treatment , ” but it might be more accurate to use words like “ convenience ” or “ control . ”
“ The ged — it ’s two seconds and it ’s done , ” says Patricia Rivera , a psychologist who serves as assistant director of clinical services .
“ Then it ’s right back to work . ”
By contrast , it can take 8 or 10 employees half an hour or longer to restrain a strong male student : to pin him to the floor , wait for him to stop struggling , then move his body onto a restraint board and tie down each limb .
Restraining five or eight kids in a single day — or the same student again and again — can be incredibly time - consuming and sometimes dangerous .
Even with the ged , the stories both students and employees tell make the place sound at times like a war zone :
A teenage boy sliced the gym teacher across the face with a cd .
A girl stabbed a staffer in the stomach with a pencil .
While staff have been contending with injuries ever since Israel opened his facility , the recent influx of high - functioning students , some with criminal backgrounds , has brought a new fear : that students will join forces and riot .
Perhaps tellingly , among high - functioning kids most of the violence is directed at the staff , not each other .
“ Our Students Have a Tendency to Lie ”
Rotenberg staff place the more troubled ( or troublesome ) residents on 1:1 status , meaning that an aide monitors them everywhere they go .
For extremely violent students , the ratio is 2:1 .
Soon after I arrived , right before I set off on my tour , a small crowd gathered — it seemed that almost the entire hierarchy of the Rotenberg Center was going to follow me around .
That ’s when I realized I ’d been put on 5:1 .
As I began to roam around the school with my escorts , my every move monitored by surveillance cameras , I realized it would be impossible to have a private conversation with any student .
The best I could hope for would be a few unscripted moments .
Ten years ago , a reporter visiting Israel ’s center would have been unable to talk to most students ; back then few of them could speak .
These days , there are more than 100 high - functioning kids fully capable of voicing their views , and Israel has enlisted a few in his campaign to promote the ged .
“ If we had only [ severely ] autistic students , they could n’t talk to you and say , ‘ Gee , this is really helping me , ' ” Israel says .
“ Now for the first time we have students like Katie who can tell you it helped them . ”
In the world of the Rotenberg Center , Katie Spartichino is a star .
She left the facility in the spring of 2006 and now attends community college in Boston .
Around noon , a staff member brings her back to the facility to talk to me .
We sit at an outdoor picnic table away from the surveillance cameras but there ’s no privacy : Israel and Karen LaChance , the assistant to the executive director for admissions , sit with us .
Katie , 19 , tells me she overdosed on pills at 9 , spent her early adolescence in and out of psych wards , was hooked up to the ged at 16 , and stayed on the device for two years .
“ This is a great place , ” she says .
“ It took me off all my medicine .
I was close to 200 pounds and I ’m 160 now . ”
She admits her outlook was less rosy when she first had to wear the electrodes .
“ I cried , ” she says .
“ I kind of felt like I was walking on eggshells ; I had to watch everything I said .
Sometimes a curse word would just come out of my mouth automatically .
So being on the ged s and knowing that swearing was a targeted behavior where I would receive a [ GED ] application , it really got me to think twice before I said something disrespectful or something just plain - out rude . ”
As Katie speaks , LaChance runs her fingers through Katie ’s hair again and again .
The gesture is so deliberate it draws my attention .
I wonder if it ’s just an expression of affection — or something more , like a reward .
“ Do you swear anymore ? ” I ask .
“ Oh , God , all the time , ” Katie says .
She pauses .
“ Well , I have learned to control it , but I ’m not going to lie .
When I ’m on the phone , curse words come out . ”
The hair stroking stops .
LaChance turns to Katie .
“ I hope you ’re not going to tell me you ’re aggressive . ”
“ Oh , no , that ’s gone , ” Katie says .
“ No , no , no .
The worst thing I do sometimes is me and my mom get into little arguments . ”
For Israel , of course , one drawback of having so many high - functioning students is that he cannot control everything they say .
One afternoon , when I walk into a classroom of teenagers , a 15 - year - old girl catches my eye , smiles , and holds up a sheet of paper with a message written in pink marker : HELP US .
She puts it back down and shuffles it into her stack of papers before anyone else sees .
When I move closer , she tells me her name is Raquel , she is from the Bronx , and she wants to go home .
My escorts allow me to interview Raquel while two of them sit nearby .
Raquel is not hooked up to the ged , but she has many complaints , including that she has just witnessed one of her housemates get shocked .
“ She was screaming , ” Raquel says .
“ They told her to step up to be searched ; she did n’t want to step up to be searched , so they gave her one . ”
After 20 minutes , my escorts cut us off .
“ Raquel , you did a great job — thank you for taking the time , ” says Patricia Rivera , the psychologist .
Once Raquel is out of earshot , Rivera adds , “ Some of the things she said are not true , some of them are .
Our students obviously have a tendency to lie about things . ”
She explains that a staff member searches Raquel ’s housemate every hour because she ’s the one who recently stabbed an employee with a pencil .
The Rotenberg Center does not have a rule about how old a child must be before he or she can be hooked up to the ged .
One of the program ’s youngest students is a nine - year - old named Rodrigo .
When I see him , he is seated outside at a picnic table with his aide .
Rodrigo ’s backpack looks enormous on his tiny frame ; canvas straps dangle from both legs .
“ He was horrible when he first came in , ” Rivera says .
“ It would take five staff to restrain him because he ’s so wiry . ”
What was he like ?
“ A lot of aggression .
A lot of disruptive behavior .
Whenever he was asked to do a task that he did n’t feel like doing , he would scream , yell , swear .
The stuff that would come out of his mouth you would n’t believe — very sexually inappropriate . ”
“ Rodrigo , come here , ” one of my escorts says .
Rodrigo walks over , his straps slapping the ground .
He wears a white dress shirt and tie — the standard uniform for male students — but because he is so small , maybe 4 feet tall , his tie nearly reaches his thighs .
“ What ’s that ? ” he asks .
“ That ’s a tape recorder , ” I say .
“ Do you want to say something ? ”
“ Yeah . ”
Unfazed by the presence of Israel , Rivera , and my other escorts , Rodrigo lifts a small hand and pulls the recorder down toward his lips .
“ I want to move to another school , ” he says .
The Employee - Modification System
To understand how the Rotenberg Center works , it helps to know that it runs not just one behavior - modification program , but two — one for the residents , and one for the staff .
Employees have no autonomy .
If a staffer believes it ’s okay to shock a kid who is smashing his head against a wall , but it ’s not okay to shock someone for getting out of his chair without permission , that could spell trouble .
“ There ’s pressure on you to do it , ” a former teacher told me .
“ They punish you if you do n’t . ”
I met this former teacher at a restaurant , and our meeting stretched on for six hours .
At times it felt less like an interview than a confession .
“ The first time you give someone a ged is the worst one , ” the teacher said .
“ You do n’t want to hurt somebody ; you want to help .
You ’re thinking , ‘ This has got to be okay .
This has got to be legal , or they would n’t be doing this . ' ”
At the Rotenberg Center , it ’s virtually impossible to discuss such concerns with coworkers because there are cameras everywhere , even in the staff break room .
Staff members who want to talk to each other without being overheard may meet up in the parking lot or scribble notes to each other .
But it ’s hard to know whom to trust , since Israel encourages employees to file anonymous reports about their coworkers ’ lapses .
In addition , staff members are prohibited from having casual conversations with each other .
They cannot , for example , say to a coworker , “ Hey , did you see the Red Sox game last night ? ”
“ We do n’t want them discussing their social life or the ball games in front of the students or while they ’re on duty , ” Israel says .
“ So we ’ll sometimes actually have one staffer deliberately start a social conversation with another and we ’ll see whether the other — as he or she should — will say , ‘ I do n’t want to discuss that now . ' ”
Monitors watch these setups on the surveillance cameras and punish staffers who take the bait .
Former employees describe a workplace permeated with fear — fear of being attacked by students and fear of losing their job .
There are so many rules — and so many cameras — it ’s not easy to stay out of trouble .
Employees quit or are fired so often that two - thirds of the direct - care employees remain on the job for less than a year .
New employees must sign a confidentiality agreement promising not to talk about the Rotenberg Center — even after they no longer work there .
Of the eight ex-employees I interviewed , most did not want to be identified by name for fear of Israel suing them ; all were critical of how the ged is used .
Maybe , says one , the use of shocks was justified in a few extreme self - injurious cases , but that ’s all .
“ Say you had a hospital that was the only hospital in the nation that had chemotherapy , and they were treating people who had the common cold with it , ” she says .
“ I think the extreme to which they abuse their power has outweighed what good they do . ”
The Hard Lessons of Connie Chung
Matthew Israel has been fielding questions from journalists since the 1970s , but few have examined his operation as thoroughly — and critically — as the producers at Eye to Eye with Connie Chung did .
In 1993 , they spent six months investigating the facility .
They even found an employee willing to go inside with a hidden camera .
But Israel ended up getting the last laugh .
As he recounts the story for me , he can barely contain his glee .
“ We refused to meet with her unless the parents could be in the same room , ” he says , grinning .
“ She talked to the parents , and they really gave it to her . ”
This is no exaggeration :
When Chung tried to ask him tough questions , his parent - supporters shouted her down .
Throughout this raucous meeting , Israel had his own camera rolling , too , which turned out to be a brilliant move .
Before cbs got its 40 - minute story on the air , Israel launched a national campaign to discredit both Chung and her report .
He accused her of being “ biased ” and “ hostile , ” and to prove it , he distributed edited videotapes of her interview to media critics and cbs affiliates .
It worked .
A New York Times television critic savaged cbs , accusing it of using “ shabby tricks of the trade . ”
Suddenly the story was not about whether the school had abused students — but whether cbs had abused the school .
“ I do n’t think it was a positive thing for her career , ” says Israel , still smiling .
It ’s late in the day , right near the end of my visit , and I ’m starting to wonder why he ’s brought up this topic .
By now I ’ve spent 22 hours with Israel and his staff — wandering around the facility , meeting parents they ’ve brought in for me to interview .
But before I depart , there ’s one more place I want to see , the room where they repair the ged s. Israel and Glenda Crookes , an assistant executive director , agree to take me there .
It is just past 7 p.m. and drizzling as we climb into Israel ’s Lexus for a short drive to the maintenance building .
There , Crookes and Israel lead me down a hall , past storerooms filled with red helmets , ged sleds , batteries and their chargers .
The room at the end of the hall looks like it could be a repair shop for any sort of electronics equipment : scissors , screwdrivers , industrial - grade glue , a Black & Decker Pivot Driver .
On one desk , I spot a form called a ged Trouble Report .
The report explains that someone dropped off Duane ’s shock device because it was “ making rattling noises . ”
Crookes explains , “ Anytime a screw is loose or anything is wrong with the device , it ’s automatically sent back here . ”
A Trouble Report on another desk suggests a more serious problem : “ Jamie Z was getting his battery changed , Luigi received a shock . ”
“ What does this mean ? ” I ask .
Crookes picks up the paper , reads it , then hands it to Israel and walks away .
Her gesture seems to say , I cannot believe we just spent two days with this reporter and now this is the last thing she sees .
Israel stares at the report , then reaches into his pocket and pulls out a pair of reading glasses .
Nobody says anything .
Outside , one car after another races by , the tail end of the evening commute .
After a minute or two , Israel says , “ Well , I do n’t understand the whole of it . ”
He is still staring at the paper in his hand .
“ But there was apparently a spontaneous activation . ”
The ged , in other words , delivered a shock without anyone pressing its remote .
This moment reminds me of something Israel told me earlier about the premise of Skinner ’s Walden Two , that by changing people ’s behaviors you can help them have a better life .
But , Israel was careful to add , “ The notion was that you needed to have the whole environment under control .
With a school like this , we have an awful lot .
Not the whole environment , but an awful lot . ”
He was right ; he controls nearly every aspect of his facility .
But all of his surveillance cameras and microphones and paperwork and protocols had failed to protect Luigi , a mentally retarded resident who had done nothing wrong .

Pelosi considers floor vote on Bolten , Miers contempt citations
Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) told her Democratic colleagues on Tuesday night that the House has to consider criminal contempt citations against White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten and Harriett Miers , former White House counsel .
But Pelosi did not set a day for a floor vote on the contempt citations , and Democratic leaders are set to meet on Wednesday to review the issue .
Pelosi and the Democratic leadership had postponed consideration of the matter until the Congress completed work on the economic stimulus package .
With that legislation now out of the way , Pelosi has raised the possibility again that the House might seek a constitutional showdown with President Bush over the limits of executive privilege .
Bolten and Miers , at the direction of the White House , refused last year to comply with subpoenas from the House Judiciary Committee issued last year as part of the congressional probe into the firing of nine U.S. attorneys .
The White House claimed executive privilege .
The Judiciary panel approved criminal contempt citations against the two Bush aides last year , but the House leadership has repeatedly delayed any floor vote .
Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) has been pressing Pelosi to hold the contempt vote , and Pelosi has stated publicly that she herself favors doing so , but other Democratic leaders , including Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - Ill. ) are concerned that a loss in court on the issue could have a negative impact on the ability of future Congresses to investigate the executive branch .
The Justice Department last year claimed that the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia , Jeffrey A. Taylor , cannot go to court to enforce a contempt citation related to an executive privilege claim , a position endorsed by Attorney General Michael Mukasey .

The New York City Draft Riots of 1863
An excerpt from
In the Shadow of Slavery :
African Americans in New York City , 1626 - 1863
by Leslie M. Harris
In September of 1862 , President Abraham Lincoln announced the Emancipation Proclamation , which would take effect January 1 , 1863 , and free slaves in those states or regions still in rebellion against the Union .
If any southern state returned to the Union between September and January , whites in that state theoretically would not lose ownership of their slaves .
Despite its limits , free blacks , slaves , and abolitionists across the country hailed it as one of the most important actions on behalf of freedom in the nation 's history .
The Emancipation Proclamation brought formal recognition that the war was being fought , at least in part , on behalf of black freedom and equality .
The enactment of the Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863 capped two years of increasing support for emancipation in New York City .
Although Republicans attempted to keep abolitionists from taking a leading role in New York 's antislavery politics during the early years of the war , by 1862 abolitionist speakers drew huge audiences , black and white , in the city .
Increasing support for the abolitionists and for emancipation led to anxiety among New York 's white proslavery supporters of the Democratic Party , particularly the Irish .
From the time of Lincoln 's election in 1860 , the Democratic Party had warned New York 's Irish and German residents to prepare for the emancipation of slaves and the resultant labor competition when southern blacks would supposedly flee north .
To these New Yorkers , the Emancipation Proclamation was confirmation of their worst fears .
In March 1863 , fuel was added to the fire in the form of a stricter federal draft law .
All male citizens between twenty and thirty - five and all unmarried men between thirty - five and forty - five years of age were subject to military duty .
The federal government entered all eligible men into a lottery .
Those who could afford to hire a substitute or pay the government three hundred dollars might avoid enlistment .
Blacks , who were not considered citizens , were exempt from the draft .
In the month preceding the July 1863 lottery , in a pattern similar to the 1834 anti-abolition riots , antiwar newspaper editors published inflammatory attacks on the draft law aimed at inciting the white working class .
They criticized the federal government 's intrusion into local affairs on behalf of the " nigger war . "
Democratic Party leaders raised the specter of a New York deluged with southern blacks in the aftermath of the Emancipation Proclamation .
White workers compared their value unfavorably to that of southern slaves , stating that " [ we ] are sold for $ 300 [ the price of exemption from war service ] whilst they pay $ 1000 for negroes . "
In the midst of war - time economic distress , they believed that their political leverage and economic status was rapidly declining as blacks appeared to be gaining power .
On Saturday , July 11 , 1863 , the first lottery of the conscription law was held .
For twenty - four hours the city remained quiet .
On Monday , July 13 , 1863 , between 6 and 7 A.M. , the five days of mayhem and bloodshed that would be known as the Civil War Draft Riots began .
The rioters ' targets initially included only military and governmental buildings , symbols of the unfairness of the draft .
Mobs attacked only those individuals who interfered with their actions .
But by afternoon of the first day , some of the rioters had turned to attacks on black people , and on things symbolic of black political , economic , and social power .
Rioters attacked a black fruit vendor and a nine - year - old boy at the corner of Broadway and Chambers Street before moving to the Colored Orphan Asylum on Fifth Avenue between Forty - Third and Forty - Fourth Streets .
By the spring of 1863 , the managers had built a home large enough to house over two hundred children .
Financially stable and well - stocked with food , clothing , and other provisions , the four - story orphanage at its location on Fifth Avenue and Forty - Second Street was an imposing symbol of white charity toward blacks and black upward mobility .
At 4 P.M. on July 13 , " the children numbering 233 , were quietly seated in their school rooms , playing in the nursery , or reclining on a sick bed in the Hospital when an infuriated mob , consisting of several thousand men , women and children , armed with clubs , brick bats etc. advanced upon the Institution . "
The crowd took as much of the bedding , clothing , food , and other transportable articles as they could and set fire to the building .
John Decker , chief engineer of the fire department , was on hand , but firefighters were unable to save the building .
The destruction took twenty minutes .
In the meantime , the superintendent and matron of the asylum assembled the children and led them out to Forty - Fourth Street .
Miraculously , the mob refrained from assaulting the children .
But when an Irish observer of the scene called out , " If there is a man among you , with a heart within him come and help these poor children , " the mob " laid hold of him , and appeared ready to tear him to pieces . "
The children made their way to the Thirty - Fifth Street Police Station , where they remained for three days and nights before moving to the almshouse on Blackwell 's Islandironically , the very place from which the orphanage 's founders had hoped to keep black children when they built the asylum almost thirty years earlier .
Rioters tortured black men , women , and children .

The Irish man who castigated the mob for not helping the black children was not the only white person punished by rioters for seeming overly sympathetic to blacks .
Throughout the week of riots , mobs harassed and sometimes killed blacks and their supporters and destroyed their property .
Rioters burned the home of Abby Hopper Gibbons , prison reformer and daughter of abolitionist Isaac Hopper .
They also attacked white " amalgamationists , " such as Ann Derrickson and Ann Martin , two women who were married to black men ; and Mary Burke , a white prostitute who catered to black men .
Near the docks , tensions that had been brewing since the mid-1850s between white longshoremen and black workers boiled over .
As recently as March of 1863 , white employers had hired blacks as longshoremen , with whom Irish men refused to work .
An Irish mob then attacked two hundred blacks who were working on the docks , while other rioters went into the streets in search of " all the negro porters , cartmen and laborers . . . they could find . "
They were routed by the police .
But in July 1863 , white longshoremen took advantage of the chaos of the Draft Riots to attempt to remove all evidence of a black and interracial social life from area near the docks .
White dockworkers attacked and destroyed brothels , dance halls , boarding houses , and tenements that catered to blacks ; mobs stripped the clothing off the white owners of these businesses .
Rioters subjected black men to the most brutal violence : torture , hanging , and burning .
© Collection of the New - York Historical Society Black men and black women were attacked , but the rioters singled out the men for special violence .
On the waterfront , they hanged William Jones and then burned his body .
White dock workers also beat and nearly drowned Charles Jackson , and they beat Jeremiah Robinson to death and threw his body in the river .
Rioters also made a sport of mutilating the black men's bodies , sometimes sexually .
A group of white men and boys mortally attacked black sailor William Williams jumping on his chest , plunging a knife into him , smashing his body with stones while a crowd of men , women , and children watched .
None intervened , and when the mob was done with Williams , they cheered , pledging " vengeance on every nigger in New York . "
A white laborer , George Glass , rousted black coachman Abraham Franklin from his apartment and dragged him through the streets .
A crowd gathered and hanged Franklin from a lamppost as they cheered for Jefferson Davis , the Confederate president .
After the mob pulled Franklin 's body from the lamppost , a sixteen - year - old Irish man , Patrick Butler , dragged the body through the streets by its genitals .
Black men who tried to defend themselves fared no better .
The crowds were pitiless .
After James Costello shot at and fled from a white attacker , six white men beat , stomped , kicked , and stoned him before hanging him from a lamppost .
With these actions white workers enacted their desires to eradicate the working - class black male presence from the city .
The Longshoreman 's Association , a white labor union , patrolled the piers during the riots , insisting that " the colored people must and shall be driven to other parts of industry . "
But " other parts of industry , " such as cartmen and hack drivers , not to mention skilled artisans , also sought to exclude black workers .
The riots gave all these workers license to physically remove blacks not only from worksites , but also from neighborhoods and leisure spaces .
The rioters ' actions also indicate the degree to which the sensational journalists and reformers of the 1840s and 1850s had achieved their goals of convincing whites , and particularly the Irish , that interracial socializing and marriage were evil and degrading practices .
The riots unequivocally divided white workers from blacks .
The act of rioting may itself have released guilt and shame over former interracial pleasures .
Finally , and most simply , white workers asserted their superiority over blacks through the riots .
The Civil War and the rise of the Republican Party and Lincoln to power indicated to New York 's largely Democratic white workers a reversal of power in the nation ; black labor competition indicated a reversal of fortunes in New York City itself .
White workers sought to remedy their upside - down world through mob violence .
Ironically , the most well known center of black and interracial social life , the Five Points , was relatively quiet during the riots .
Mobs neither attacked the brothels there nor killed black people within its borders .
There were also instances of interracial cooperation .
When a mob threatened black drugstore owner Philip White in his store at the corner of Gold and Frankfurt Street , his Irish neighbors drove the mob away , for he had often extended them credit .
And when rioters invaded Hart 's Alley and became trapped at its dead end , the black and white residents of the alley together leaned out of their windows and poured hot starch on them , driving them from the neighborhood .
But such incidents were few compared to the widespread hatred of blacks expressed during and after the riots .

In all , rioters lynched eleven black men over the five days of mayhem .
The riots forced hundreds of blacks out of the city .
As Iver Bernstein states , " For months after the riots the public life of the city became a more noticeably white domain . "
During the riots , landlords drove blacks from their residences , fearing the destruction of their property .
After the riots , when the Colored Orphan Asylum attempted to rebuild on the site of its old building , neighboring property owners asked them to leave .
The orphanage relocated to 51st Street for four years before moving into a new residence at 143rd Street between Amsterdam and Broadway , in the midst of what would become New York 's predominantly black neighborhood in the twentieth century , Harlem .
But in 1867 , the area was barely settled and far removed from the center of New York City .
Black families also fled the city altogether .
Albro Lyons , keeper of the Colored Sailors '
Home , was able to protect the boardinghouse on the first day of the riots , but soon fled to the neighborhood police station to seek an escort from the city for his wife and family .
An officer accompanied the Lyons family to the Sailors ' Home , where they gathered up what belongings they could carry before boarding the Roosevelt Street ferry , which took them to Williamsburg in Brooklyn .
" From the moment they put foot on the boat , that was the last time they ever resided in New York City , leaving it forever . "
Other blacks fled to New Jersey and beyond .
By 1865 , the black population had plummeted to just under ten thousand , its lowest since 1820 .
Those blacks who remained in the city found a somewhat chastened elite eager to help New York 's black residents recover in the aftermath of the riots .
The seven - month - old Union League Club ( which had as one of its main tenets black uplift ) and the Committee of Merchants for the Relief of Colored People spearheaded relief efforts to blacks , providing forty thousand dollars to almost twenty - five hundred riot victims and finding new jobs and homes for blacks .
Just under a year later , Republican elites and New York City blacks publicly celebrated their renewed alliance .
In December of 1863 , the secretary of war gave the Union League Club permission to raise a black regiment .
The Union League Club decided to march the regiment of over one thousand black men through the streets of New York to the Hudson River , where the ship that would take them south waited .
On March 5 , 1864 , before a crowd of one hundred thousand black and white New Yorkers , the black regiment processed , making " a fine appearance in their blue uniform , white gloves and white leggings . "
They were preceded by the police superintendent , one hundred policemen , the Union League Club itself , " colored friends of the recruits , " and a band .
In a powerful display , the parade publicly linked blacks with the leaders of the new order being ushered in by the Civil War .
But the event could not completely erase the racial concerns that had been part of the draft riots , if indeed its organizers sought to .
One account said of the soldiers , " a majority of them are black ; indeed there are but few mulattoes among them , " an attempt to downplay the obvious fears of racial mixing that white workers displayed before and during the riots , fears which many white elites may have shared .
Observers also used the event to contrast the loyalty of blacks to the Union and their good behavior with the recent rioting as well as the general culture of white workers :
" The 20th is emphatically an African regiment , and to its credit be it spoken , not one of its members disobeyed orders , no one broke ranks to greet enthusiastic friends , no one used intoxicating drinks to excess , no one manifested the least inclination to leave the service , and their marching was very creditable . "
The New York elite presented the black troops as symbols of the new orderly working class they desired : sober , solemn , obedient , and dedicated to the Union cause .
But such simple symbolism obscured the complex divisions of status , class , outlook and aspiration that had been part of New York 's free black community from its inception .
As the Union Army marched south , it brought with it black and white abolitionists ( many affiliated with the American Missionary Assocition , others independent of organized efforts ) who sought to reform southern blacks during and after the war .
These largely middle - class activists carried ideas of racial uplift first promulgated in the northeast , from creating manual labor schools to moral reform to enhancing wage labor .
They encountered newly free blacks eager for educational and economic betterment , but just as certainly shaping their own definitions of independence and equality .
During the Civil War and Reconstruction years , black and white people from urban and rural areas in the north and south were challenged to create new opportunities for the freed people .
But New York City had never unified to overcome the problems of racism and fully embrace black freedom ; neither would the nation .
Rome 's Mayor Walter Veltroni will officiate at the first public viewing of " Rome Reborn 1.0 , " a 10 - year project based at the University of Virginia and begun at UCLA to use advanced technology to digitally rebuild ancient Rome .
“ Rome Reborn 1.0 " shows almost the entire city within the 13 - mile - long Aurelian Walls as it appeared in A.D. 320 .
At that time Rome was the multicultural capital of the western world and had reached the peak of its development with an estimated population of one million .

In recent years scientists , historians and archaeologists around the world have embraced 3D modeling of cultural heritage sites .
Information technology has permitted them to recreate buildings and monuments that no longer exist or to restore digitally sites that have been damaged with the passage of time .
The results can be used both in research to test new theories and in teaching to take students on virtual tours of the historical sites they are studying .
By several orders of magnitude , " Rome Reborn 1.0 " is the most ambitious such project ever undertaken .

Bernard Frischer , director of the " Rome Reborn " project and director of the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia , stated , " ' Rome Reborn 1.0 ' is the continuation of five centuries of research by scholars , architects and artists since the Renaissance who have attempted to restore the ruins of the ancient city with words , maps and images .
Now , through hard work by our interdisciplinary team , we have realized their seemingly impossible dream .
This is just the first step in the creation of a virtual time machine , which our children and grandchildren will use to study the history of Rome and many other great cities around the world .
We give special thanks to the Comune di Roma and its Museum of Roman Civilization ( Rome ) for the constant support and encouragement they gave the project from the start . "
Diane Favro , co-initiator of " Rome Reborn " and director of the Experiential Technologies Center at UCLA said , " This amazing model allows us to appreciate individual buildings of ancient Rome within a broad urban context , and thus also to understand how the modern city took shape over time .
Numerous UCLA students explored advanced technology and global resources to create the Rome Reborn model , an experience that transformed them from students into 21st century scholars . "
Gabriele Guidi of INDACO Lab at the Politecnico di Milano said , " This is the first time that engineers have succeeded in creating a hybrid computer model of an entire city based on born - digital and reborn - digital elements .
The project was an enormous technical challenge , and now that we have successfully met it , we can easily start building up a library of other city models in museums around the world . "

The " Rome Reborn " project was begun at UCLA in 1996 by professors Favro and Frischer .
They collaborated with UCLA students from classics , architecture and urban design who fashioned the digital models with continuous advice from expert archaeologists .
As the project evolved , it became collaborative at an international scale .
In 2004 , the project moved its administrative home to the University of Virginia , while work in progress continued at UCLA .
In the same year , a cooperative research agreement was signed with the Politecnico di Milano .
Many individuals and institutions contributed to " Rome Reborn " including the Politecnico di Milano ( http://www.polimi.it ) , UCLA ( http://www.etc.ucla.edu/), and the University of Virginia ( www.iath.virginia.edu).
The advisors of the project included scholars from the Italian Ministry of Culture , the Museum of Roman Civilization ( Rome ) , Bath University , Bryn Mawr College , the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche , the German Archaeological Institute , Ohio University , UCLA , the University of Florence , the University of Lecce , the University of Rome ( " La Sapienza " ) , the University of Virginia and the Vatican Museums .
The first sponsors of the project were Kirk Mathews and the Creative Kids Education Foundation .

A thermal transistor controls heat flow .
Heat passes between terminals S and D for the “ on ” state , and little or no heat passes between S and D for the “ off ” state .
G is the control terminal .

Most computers today use electrons to carry information , while theoretical optical computers use photons .
Recently , physicists from Singapore have proposed a third type of computer : a “ phononic computer , ” which would use heat , carried by phonons , to perform operations similar to its electronic counterpart .
“ Heat is very abundant and very often it is regarded as useless and harmful for information processing , ” Professor Baowen Li of the National University of Singapore told PhysOrg.com .
“ The merit of our paper is that we demonstrate that , in addition to the existing electrons and photons , the phonons can also perform a similar function .
This provides an alternative way for information processing .
Moreover , the heat can be harnessed to use . ”
Li and co-author Lei Wang from the NUS have demonstrated how to make thermal logic gates for possible use in future phononic computers , with their results published in a recent issue of Physical Review Letters .
Logic gates , one of the basic elements of computers , perform an operation on one or more logic inputs to produce a single logic output .
In electronic logic gates , the inputs and outputs are represented by different voltages .
However , in a thermal logic gate , the inputs and outputs are represented by different temperatures .
The key element of the logic gate is the thermal transistor ( which was invented by Li’s group last year ) , which works similar to how a field - effect transistor controls electric current .
The thermal transistor is composed of two terminals that are weakly coupled , plus a third control terminal .
“ Like all other theoretical modeling , we use heat bath to produce heat , which is a kind of random atomic or molecular motion , ” Li explained .
“ To conduct heat , you do n't need too much external power .
Any temperature difference will lead to heat conduction . ”
In the researchers ’ model , heat is conducted by lattice vibration .
When the vibration spectra of the two terminals are combined , their overlap determines the heat current .
For example , when the two spectra overlap , the heat can easily travel between the terminals , representing the “ on ” state .
When the vibration spectra do not overlap , very little heat ( or no heat ) passes through , representing the “ off ” state .
The “ negative differential thermal resistance ” ( NDTR ) that occurs due to the match / mismatch of vibrational spectra of the terminals ’ interface particles , makes the “ on ” and “ off ” states both stable , making the thermal logic operations possible .
“ Like we explain in our Physical Review Letters article , all these logic gate functions can be achieved only when the system has the so - called negative or super response , by which we mean that the large temperature difference ( change ) will induce the small heat current , ” Li said .
“ This is the so - called ‘ negative differential thermal resistance . ’”
The NDTR phenomenon was also discovered by Li’s group in 2006 .
The researchers demonstrate how combining thermal transistors can be used to build different thermal logic gates , such as a signal repeater .
A signal repeater “ digitizes ” the heat input , so that when the temperature is higher or lower than a critical value , the output is either “ on ” or “ off , ” but not in between .
By connecting a few thermal transistors in series , the researchers achieved a nearly ideal repeater .
Besides signal repeaters , they also demonstrated a NOT gate , which reverses the input signal , and an AND / OR gate , made from the same thermal transistor model .
While the current model simply shows the feasibility of thermal logic gates , Wang and Li predict that an experimental realization of the devices in nanoscale systems may not be too far off .
They point out that another thermal device , the solid - state thermal rectifier , was experimentally demonstrated in 2006 , just a few years after the proposed theoretical model .
“ One advantage of a phononic computer might be that we do n't need to consume a lot of electricity , ” Li said .
“ We may use the redundant heat produced by electronic devices or provided by Mother Nature to do useful work .
Another advantage is that , one day , human beings can control and use heat wisely so that we may save a lot of energy — which is a big issue nowadays . ”

Zogby ’s recent poll asking “ Whom would you NEVER vote for president ? ” was kind of mischievous , was n’t it ?
But if I were a member of the Democratic National Committee , not to mention a congressional Democrat , I ’d be sweating bullets over it .
A neat 50 % claim they would never , even under pain of waterboarding ( kidding ) , cast their presidential vote for Hillary Clinton .
“ Never say never , ” Howard Dean or the Democratic Leadership Council ’s Harold Ford might say .
That may have been right seven months ago when 46 , not 50 % , claimed they would never vote for Hillary .
But now , at a time , when other polls show her pulling ahead of Senator Obama in the Democratic race , it ’s looking more like “ Always say never . ”
Worse , her campaign is beginning to emit the stench of Bob Dole ’s 1996 Republican presidential run .
You know — hand her the nomination because it ’s owed her .
In his case , likely payback for key votes he swung the way of congressional colleagues .
In hers , out of appreciation to the Clintons for their magic touch raking in money .
Dole never had a chance because of poor funding , his caustic personality and , of course , because he was running against a popular president , Hillary ’s husband .
Meanwhile , she ’s been polling well against leading Republican candidate Giuliani .
But , as one commentator explained , it just may be because voters are becoming resigned to her .
The cynicism of such a strategy notwithstanding , Democratic leadership forgets there ’s little margin of error because of the likelihood that Republicans will engineeer widespread voter fraud again .
Hillary ’s campaign seems to have developed a mind of its own .
Is there any way to stop it before it leads the Democratic party over a cliff only to be dashed to pieces on the rocks below ?
Which is more of a threat to your health : Al Qaeda or the Department of Homeland Security ?
An intriguing new study suggests the answer is not so clear - cut .
Although it ’s impossible to calculate the pain that terrorist attacks inflict on victims and society , when statisticians look at cold numbers , they have variously estimated the chances of the average person dying in America at the hands of international terrorists to be comparable to the risk of dying from eating peanuts , being struck by an asteroid or drowning in a toilet .
But worrying about terrorism could be taking a toll on the hearts of millions of Americans .
The evidence , published last week in the Archives of General Psychiatry , comes from researchers who began tracking the health of a representative sample of more than 2,700 Americans before September 2001 .
After the attacks of Sept. 11 , the scientists monitored people ’s fears of terrorism over the next several years and found that the most fearful people were three to five times more likely than the rest to receive diagnoses of new cardiovascular ailments .
Almost all the people in the study lived outside New York or Washington and did n’t know any victims of the Sept. 11 attacks .
But more than a 10th of them reported acute stress symptoms ( like insomnia or nightmares ) right after the attacks , and over the next three years more than 40 percent said they kept worrying about a terrorist attack affecting themselves or a family member .
Their worries were understandable , given the continual warnings from Washington .
Officials repeatedly raised the color - coded level of the National Threat Advisory and sometimes explicitly warned of imminent attacks from terrorist cells supposedly operating in America .
The alert level has never dropped below yellow ( the third of the five levels ) .
About a third to a half of Americans have continued to tell pollsters that they ’re personally worried about being victims of a terrorist attack , and that an attack is somewhat or very likely within several months .
Britain planned to build a Taliban training camp for 2,000 fighters in southern Afghanistan , as part of a top - secret deal to make them swap sides , intelligence sources in Kabul have revealed .
The plans were discovered on a memory stick seized by Afghan secret police in December .
The Afghan government claims they prove British agents were talking to the Taliban without permission from the Afghan President , Hamid Karzai , despite Gordon Brown 's pledge that Britain will not negotiate .
The Prime Minister told Parliament on 12 December : " Our objective is to defeat the insurgency by isolating and eliminating their leaders .
We will not enter into any negotiations with these people . "
The British insist President Karzai's office knew what was going on .
But Mr Karzai has expelled two top diplomats amid accusations they were part of a plot to buy - off the insurgents .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The row was the first in a series of spectacular diplomatic spats which has seen Anglo - Afghan relations sink to a new low .
Since December , President Karzai has blocked the appointment of Paddy Ashdown to the top UN job in Kabul and he has blamed British troops for losing control of Helmand .
It has also soured relations between Kabul and Washington , where State Department officials were instrumental in pushing Lord Ashdown for the UN role .
President Karzai's political mentor , Sibghatullah Mojaddedi , endorsed a death sentence for blasphemy on the student journalist Sayed Pervez Kambaksh last week , and two British contractors have been arrested in Kabul on , it is claimed , trumped up weapons charges .
The developments are seen as a deliberate defiance of the British .
An Afghan government source said the training camp was part of a British plan to use bands of reconciled Taliban , called Community Defence Volunteers , to fight the remaining insurgents .
" The camp would provide military training for 1,800 ordinary Taliban fighters and 200 low - level commanders , " he said .
The computer memory stick at the centre of the row was impounded by officers from Afghanistan 's KGB - trained National Directorate of Security after they moved against a party of international diplomats who were visiting Helmand .
A ministry insider said : " When they were arrested , the British said the Ministry of the Interior and the National Security Council knew about it , but no one knew anything .
That 's why the President was so angry . "
Details of how much President Karzai was told remain murky .
Some analysts believe Afghan officials were briefed about the plan , but that it later evolved .

The camp was due to be built outside Musa Qala , in Helmand .
It was part of a package of reconstruction and development incentives designed to win trust and support in the aftermath of the British - led battle to retake the stronghold last year .
But the Afghans feared the British were training a militia with no loyalty to the central government .
Intercepted Taliban communications suggested they thought the British were trying to help them , the Afghan official said .
The Western delegates , Michael Semple and Mervyn Patterson , were given 48 hours to leave the country .
Their Afghan colleagues , including a former army general , were jailed .
The expulsions coincided with a row within the Taliban 's ranks which saw a senior commander , Mansoor Dadullah , sacked for talking to British spies .
One official claimed the camp was planned for Mansoor and his men .
The computer stick contained a three - stage plan , called the European Union Peace Building Programme .
The third stage covered military training .
Curiously , the European Union says the programme did not exist and there were no EU funds to run it .
Afghan government officials insist it was bankrolled by the British .
UK diplomats , the UN , Western officials and senior Afghan officials have all confirmed the outline of the plan , which they agree is entirely British - led , but all refused to talk about it on the record .
President Karzai's office claimed it was " a matter of national security " .
The memory stick revealed that $ 125,000 ( £ 64,000 ) had been spent on preparing the camp and a further $ 200,000 was earmarked to run it in 2008 , an Afghan official said .
The figures sparked allegations that British agents were paying the Taliban .
President Karzai's spokesman , Humayun Hamidzada , accused Mr Semple and Mr Patterson of being " involved in some activities that were not their jobs . "
The camp would also have provided vocational training , including farming and irrigation techniques , to offer people a viable alternative to growing opium .
But the Afghan government took issue with plans to provide military training , to turn the insurgents into a defence force .
Afghan government staff also claimed the " EU peace - builders " had handed over mobile phones , laptops and airtime credit to insurgents .
They said the memory stick revealed plans to train the Taliban to use secure satellite phones , so they could communicate directly with UK officials .
Mr Patterson , a Briton , was the third - ranking UN diplomat when he was held .
Mr Semple , an Irishman , was the acting head of the EU mission .
Officially , the British embassy remains tight - lipped , fuelling speculation that the plan may have been part of a wider clandestine operation .
A spokesman repeated the line used since Christmas : " The EU and UN have responded to inquiries on this .
We have nothing further to add . "
But privately , the UN maintains it had no role in setting up the camp .
Meanwhile , Mr Semple 's EU boss , Francesc Vendrell , admitted he had very little idea what was going on .
Yet the British ambassador , Sir Sherard Cowper - Coles , cut short his Christmas holiday to meet President Karzai and " spell out the Foreign Office paper - trail " which diplomats claim proves his government had agreed .
They met twice , but it was not enough to stop Mr Semple and Mr Patterson being forced to leave .
Gordon Brown has also said Britain would increase its support for " community defence initiatives , where local volunteers are recruited to defend homes and families modelled on traditional Afghan arbakai " .
Background to the proposal
* December 11
British and Afghan troops take Musa Qala , a Taliban stronghold in Helmand , after President Hamid Karzai reveals that a senior Taliban commander swapped sides .
* December 23 - 24
The acting head of the EU mission , Michael Semple , and the third - ranking UN diplomat in Afghanistan , Mervyn Patterson , hold talks with local dignitaries and Taliban sympathisers in Helmand .
Afghan secret police arrest their colleague , General Stanikzai , and seize a memory stick containing plans for training camps .
* December 25
Semple and Patterson are given 48 hours in which to leave Kabul .
* December 27
The two diplomats fly out of the Afghan capital , despite international appeals to let them stay .

If Gen. Pervez Musharraf were the democratic leader he indignantly insists he is , he would not be so busy threatening independent news outlets , arresting hundreds of opposition politicians and berating parliamentary leaders and ministers from his own party for insufficient loyalty to his arbitrary and widely unpopular policies .
But nobody takes General Musharraf ’s democratic claims seriously anymore , except for the Bush administration , which has put itself in the embarrassing position of propping up the Muslim world ’s most powerful military dictator as an essential ally in its half - baked campaign to promote democracy throughout the Muslim world .
Washington needs to disentangle America , quickly , from the general ’s damaging embrace .
Ever since his high - handed dismissal of the country ’s independent - minded chief justice in March , the general has been busily digging himself into an ever deeper political hole .
Last week , he issued a decree giving himself increased powers to shut down independent television channels , but under mounting pressure he withdrew it over the weekend .
More than 300 local political leaders in Punjab were arrested in an effort to head off protests against the decree .
Still , thousands of lawyers , journalists and political activists gathered to protest the firing , the censorship and the general ’s continued rule .
Pakistan seems to be rapidly approaching a critical turning point , with a choice between intensified repression and instability or an orderly transition back to democratic rule .
Menwith
Hill is the largest electronic monitoring station in the world
Committee chairman
The Foreign Affairs Select Committee criticised the way plans were announced as MPs left Westminster for the summer .
The RAF base at Menwith Hill in North Yorkshire will host a tracking system linked to US satellites and interceptor missiles based outside the UK .
Committee chairman Mike Gapes MP accused ministers of evading debate .
" We regret the manner and timing of the announcement .
And there 's a resulting lack of parliamentary debate on the issue , " said Mr Gapes .
" And our job as a select committee regardless of which government it is at any time is to hold the government to account and to scrutinise its behaviour and we are not happy with the way they have dealt with this issue . "
The Ministry of Defence says there was " no intention " to bury the plans .
' Lack of debate '
On 25 July , Defence Secretary Des Browne revealed in a written statement that he had approved the US request to use the base for the ballistic missile defence ( BMD ) system .
But , in a report , the Foreign Affairs Select Committee has criticised the " manner and timing " of the announcement and " the resulting lack of Parliamentary debate " on the issue .
We recommend that the government inform us of the date on which it received the formal proposal from the US to include Menwith Hill in the BMD system
Foreign Affairs Select Committee
The committee of MPs went on to demand to know the exact date approval for the plans had been given to the US .
" We recommend that the government inform us of the date on which it received the formal proposal from the US to include Menwith Hill in the BMD system , " its report said .
" We recommend that there should be a full parliamentary debate on these proposals . "
Anti-nuclear campaigners CND also criticised the announcement , calling it " outrageous " and saying it was made with " total contempt for democracy and consultation " .
Arms race hint
Washington says the aim of the anti-ballistic missile system is to confront the future threat of incoming missiles from what it calls " rogue states " such as Iran or North Korea .
But Russia has objected to the plans , believing the system is aimed at its own arsenal .
President Putin has even hinted at a renewed arms race and a revival of the Cold War .
There was absolutely no intention to ' bury ' this announcement
Ministry of Defence
UK - US military ties
In their report the MPs also warn of Russia 's renewed strength on the world stage , fuelled by high oil revenues .
Liberal Democrat leadership contender Nick Clegg said he was pleased that the " duplicitous publication " of the decision had been highlighted , adding that he believed the plans would not improve security .
" It is time for Britain to wake up to the damaging geo-strategic effects of this missile defence scheme and pull out of our deal with America .
" It will never be possible to construct a global system of governance to deal with external threats if powerful nations simply act unilaterally whenever it suits them . "
' Good for UK '
The Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) has denied it buried the announcement of the missile defence plan .
A spokesman said the government 's approach to missile defence had not changed and that in 2003 , after receiving a request from the US to upgrade the missile - tracking radar at RAF Fylingdales in North Yorkshire , the government had given Parliament the chance to debate the issue .
He added that despite the changes at the Menwith base " being minor in nature " , the government had made a written ministerial statement " to ensure that Parliament had full visibility on all elements of this issue " .
" It was also announced via an MoD press release .
There was absolutely no intention to ' bury ' this announcement . "
The defence secretary has insisted the system will be good for both UK and European security .
Speaking in July , he said it was " a building block to enhance our national and collective security " .
Mr Browne said the work at RAF Menwith Hill would support the existing UK - US missile warning mission and enable satellite data to be passed into the new US missile defence system .
Polish military to go on alert in case US satellite crashes
WARSAW , Feb 15 ( AFP ) Feb 15 , 2008
Poland is to put its military on alert amid concerns that an errant US satellite could fall to earth if Washington fails with its plans to shoot it down , Defence Minister Bogdan Klich said Friday .
Klich said that Poland was among the countries which had been warned by the United States of the risk posed by the satellite , but added that the danger was " minimal " .
Poland 's chief of staff General Franciszek Gagor said that from next week the authorities had decided to " raise the alert level to high " , in case parts of the satellite land on Polish territory .
The United States says the satellite is the size of a bus and contains a large quantity of hydrazine , an extremely toxic propellant .
The chemical could be dangerous to people on the ground if the satellite -- currently in Earth orbit but being pulled down by Earth 's gravity -- does not burn up on re-entry , it says .
Washington says a US warship will fire a surface - to - air missile at the satellite at a specific point in its orbit that ensures any Earth - bound debris will splash into the ocean .
On Friday , Christina Rocca , US ambassador to the Geneva - based Conference on Disarmament , announced that the out - of - commission spy satellite would enter the Earth 's atmosphere on or around March 6 if Washington failed to shoot it down .
Rocca said the satellite could land " in any region on the Earth 's surface between 58.5 degrees North and 58.5 degrees South latitudes " -- in other words , anywhere on the planet except the polar regions .
Washington has denied suggestions that the shoot - down plan is aimed at protecting the satellite 's technological secrets or at demonstrating US anti-satellite capability .
" This extraordinary engagement ... is not part of an anti-satellite development and testing programme , " said Rocca .
That ’s exactly what one economist argues :
Why do we subsidize mortgage interest ?
More than Social Security –the benefits of which are taxed –it ’s the most sacred cow in the Federal Budget .
But it ’s a truism that a subsidy yields higher prices .
Home sellers can charge more because buyers are effectively subsidized by their ability to deduct mortgage interest .
The purpose of the deduction is to encourage home ownership even though the deduction extends to people who hardly need government largesse .
Canada has no mortgage interest deduction and yet its rates of home ownership are comparable to those in the United States .
In other words , if we phased out the deduction , it probably would n’t reduce the rate of home ownership .
(…)
We should have a debate about whether we really need it any more and how it might be phased out without disrupting the economy and the lives of homeowners , many of whom already find themselves in turmoil because of the subprime collapse .
It ’s a radical proposal no doubt , but I think that Cooper has a point here .
To extent that taxation has to exist at all , it should exist solely for the purpose of raising revenue .
From the beginning of the income tax , though , Congress and the White House have used it as an instrument of social policy ; accomplishing things via the tax code that they ’d never be able to pull off if they actually had to pay for it .
Like Social Security , though , the Home Mortgage Interest Deduction has become a political sacred cow .
Anyone who even came close to suggesting it ’s elimination would , no doubt , find themselves buried by protesting homeowners and lobbyist from the building industry , the legal profession , and the National Association of Realtors .
All of whom will no doubt argue that such a move would destroy the housing industry .
As Nick Gillespie notes , though , Congress did something like this back in 1986 when it eliminated the deduction for credit card interest and , contrary to predictions , that industry has thrived over the past 20 years .
The leading arm of gas streaming from the Magellanic Clouds is piercing the disk of the Milky Way .
As ifreaching out with a come - hither motion , a giant gas finger emanating from two neighboringgalaxies has hooked into the starry disk of the Milky Way .
Thisextremity of hydrogen gas is actually the pointy end of the so - called LeadingArm of gas that streams ahead of two irregular galaxies called the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds .
The fate ofthese nearby galaxies , which are impacted by the Milky Way 's gravity , has beensomewhat of a mystery .
The new finger findings suggest that the MagellanicClouds will eventually merge with the MilkyWay rather than zooming past .
Locatedabout 160,000 light - years from Earth , the Large Magellanic Cloud ( LMC ) is onlyone - twentieth the diameter of our galaxy and contains one - tenth as many stars .
The SmallMagellanic Cloud resides 200,000 light - years from Earth and is about 100 times smaller than the Milky Way .
?
We ? rethrilled because we can determine exactly where this gas is plowing into the Milky Way , ? said research team leader Naomi McClure - Griffiths of CSIRO ?
sAustralia Telescope National Facility .
CalledHVC306-2+230 , the gas finger is gouging into our galaxy 's starry disk about 70,000 light - years away from Earth .
In the night sky , the contact point wouldbe nearest the Southern Cross .
Until lastyear , astronomers thought the Magellanic Clouds had orbited our galaxy manytimes .
This scenario held a gloomy outlook for the clouds , which were said tobe doomed to be ripped apart and swallowed by the gravitational goliath .
But thennew Hubble Space Telescope measurements revealed the clouds are paying our galaxya one - timevisit rather than being its lunch .
McClure - Griffiths 'results , however , are more in line with the previous tale pegging the Milky Wayand the Magellanic Clouds as long - time companions .
McClure - Griffiths remarksthat this is n't the final word and that both theories are still on the table .
By pointingout the spot of contact between the Leading Arm and our galactic disk , therecent study will help astronomers to predict where the clouds themselves willtravel in the future .
? We thinkthe Leading Arm is a tidal feature , gas pulled out of the Magellanic Clouds bythe Milky Way ?s gravity , ?
McClure - Griffiths said .
?
Where this gas goes , we ? dexpect the clouds to follow , at least approximately .?
In thedistant future , the three galaxies could become one .
A Gilroy woman who stepped into her backyard Sunday morning to chide her small dog for barking during the night was surprised to hear a deep growl - and it was n't coming from her poodle - mix .
Crouching on top of the backyard fence and staring down at her was a mountain lion cub that had apparently been sharing the backyard , and bowls of dog food , with her 2 - year - old dog , Lucy .
" I came out and said , ' Lucy , why were you barking so much ? ' " and then I heard , ' Grrrrrrrrrrrr , ' " Maria Lopez recounted in Spanish .
" I turned around and looked up and - Ay mamacita !
I was so scared .
I thought , ' What is it ? '
It looked like a baby lion .
But I thought , ' No , it ca n't be . ' "
Within minutes , Gilroy police , an animal control officer and state Department of Fish and Game wardens were at her home on the 8800 block of Carnation Lane to tranquilize and remove the 30 - pound lion , which was released hours later in a state wildlife area in Santa Clara County .
" We were just surprised , " said Lopez 's son , Ivan , 16 .
" We did n't expect a lion in our backyard , especially because there 's a lot of other houses around . "
No one knows when or how the lion got to Lopez 's backyard , which is in an urban residential area not far from the hills .
Lopez said that for the past week Lucy had been barking during the night , and generous portions of her food had been disappearing .
" She was n't getting fatter .
I thought there must be a rat or something , " Lopez said .
At 11 p.m. Saturday , Lucy was barking again and Lopez walked out to check on her but did n't see anything unusual - except that her bowl was empty .
" I thought that maybe my son forgot to feed her , so I gave her some food , " Lopez said .
The barking started again at 3 a.m .
" I thought my neighbors were going to be upset about it , " she said .
Sunday morning , after seeing the lion , she ran to her neighbor , who took one look at the spotted feline and called police .
Gilroy police Sgt. Wes Stanford said the unusual call came just before 9 a.m. Sunday .
Stanford said the cub was lying on the fence when officers arrived .
An animal control officer used a tranquilizer gun to shoot a dart into the cat from a window .
The cat jumped down into the backyard and fell asleep .
Stanford said Carnation Lane is on the western side of the city in an urban residential area that is close to the hills .
He said last year on Memorial Day , he shot and killed a 70 - pound mountain lion that was in a tree - a killing that was captured on video and prompted much criticism of the department .
" I felt terrible shooting it , " Stanford said .
But he said tranquilizing the big cat was a dangerous option because the drug might not work right away , the cat could run , and there were many people in a park nearby .
" We were all very happy today with this outcome , " he said .
Maria Lopez said her family once caught a parakeet that had visited the backyard and now owns it as a pet .
" But a lion - no , " she said .
" It was beautiful .
It was quite big .
It 's a good thing nothing bad happened .
There are lots of young children in this neighborhood . "
From now on , she said , Lucy - and her food - will spend nights indoors .
" She had her doghouse and bedding , but it 's getting cold , " she said .
The Sunstar ’s ancient twin diesels fire up like an old man clearing his throat .
Terry Herzik cocks his good ear to listen .
They are losing compression , but sound as if they should make the three - day trip .
Dawn glows faintly behind the gantry cranes and shuttered canneries that overlook Fish Harbor , a blighted abscess of Terminal Island .
Herzik climbs into the door - less wheelhouse through a window , trying not to strain a hernia he tore putting up the Christmas tree while his two sons were home from college .
His partner throws off the dock ropes .
Herzik eases the throttles down , and the battered orange - and - gray boat chugs out of the harbor .
The stink and scrape of the port slowly recede .
The sea begins to roll in big loping swells , a light wind cross - hatching the surface .
He sets the course to 240 degrees southwest .
Advertisement
Herzik dives for sea urchins and sea cucumbers , considered delicacies in Asia .
He is 61 and built solid by the work , thick in the shoulders and neck .
His hands are knots of callus , muscle and buried urchin spines .
He thought he’d be out of commercial diving years ago .
This is no job for an aging body .
Divers spend hours in icy water , dragging 300 - pound bags of urchins and sea cucumbers from the sea floor .
They are at sea for days at a time , often during bad weather , in rickety , overloaded boats .
They risk capsizing , drowning and shark attacks .
More than half of the roughly 175 full - time divers in the industry have suffered decompression sickness , the potentially fatal “ bends . ”
Like so many cowboy - types who flocked to the industry as it boomed in the 1970s and ‘ 80s , he is now heading into his senior years on a youthful dream that has grown more complicated with age .
Herzik ca n’t see a way out .
There is no 401 ( k ) in his line of work .
And his and his wife ’s financial planning was always aimed at their two sons ’ education .
They took out second loans on their Redondo Beach home to put them through 13 years of prep school in Palos Verdes , and then sent them to two of the top liberal arts schools in the nation .
Advertisement
This has allowed little for retirement , at a time of diminishing returns .
The urchin industry has been in decline for years , as local stocks are depleted and divers in Chile and eastern Russia flood the market .
Herzik tries not to contemplate whether he will still be huffing out of the port at 75 -- or , worse , dying out there , in the empty blue .
After 36 years in the business , he has a more layered relationship with his calling than in his youth .
There ’s drudgery and anxiety and a sense of mortality -- and a perennial sense of wonder exploring an offshore wilderness that few Californians ever see .
When his children were younger , they would beg to hear stories of his encounter with the great white shark off Catalina , or the sea lion that jumped into his tiny cabin when he was sleeping .
“ Dad , what ’d you see this trip ? ” the boys would ask when he walked through the door , grizzled , exhausted , smelling of diesel and ocean .
“ Anything cool happen ? ”

“ Oh , I saw a massive pod of dolphins extending to the horizon , ” he would say , grandly , and sit down and tell them about his journey .
His younger son Nick , now a 19 - year - old sophomore at Williams College in Massachusetts , recalls how proud he was when his dad brought a bunch of live sea creatures to his first - grade class : brittle stars and spider crabs and lobsters .
As he grows older , Andrew , graduating this month from Middlebury College in Vermont , marvels at his dad ’s strength and self - reliance .
“ They say you come to a point where you realize your father is mortal , ” says Andrew , 23 .
“ I have n’t .
He ’s almost indestructible in my mind . ”

Yet the sons know there is anxiety stirring in their father .
“ He knows he cannot do this forever , ” Andrew says .
Terry Herzik ’s patch of the global economy is the four Channel Islands southwest of Los Angeles .
Today Herzik and his co-diver , Gary Thompson , are headed to Santa Barbara Island , a wild , uninhabited square mile of plunging cliffs and roaring elephant seals about 50 miles off San Pedro .
The sea urchin market is overloaded right now , and his buyers do n’t want any of the spiny creatures until the quality of their roe -- the salable part of the animal , sold as uni in sushi bars -- improves .
This has put many of the 30 or so battered boats in Fish Harbor out of work .
Herzik ca n’t afford to stand down .
So on this trip , he ’s in search of “ cukes . ”
Advertisement
Warty sea cucumbers are vile - looking creatures -- the size of their namesake vegetable , wormy in texture , with no eyes and covered with black - tipped bumps .
They have no defenses against predators , but almost none will deign to eat them .
In China , sea cucumber flesh is dried as food and considered to have healing qualities .
Cukes are a gamble this time of year .
At the end of every fall , they go into hiding to perform a quirky ritual : ejecting their internal organs and growing new ones .
Herzik can only hope they are back .
Midmorning , past the rugged west tip of Catalina , the water has gone from green to deep cobalt and is smooth as oil .
Whales puff white geysers in the distance .
All that can be seen of the mainland are the snowy tops of mountains .
Advertisement
By noon , the boat is off the jagged shores of Santa Barbara Island .
Sea lions swarm the boat , watching and playing .
“ Welcoming committee ! ” Herzik says in a booming voice .
His family calls this his boat voice -- Capt. Herzik .
All around the island , waves explode through blowholes in the volcanic rock .
Thousands of elephant seals and sea lions line the shore .
Their barking cuts through the surf and wind , a forlorn sound , like children crying in a distant storm .
“ What do you say here , Gary ? ” Herzik asks , about half a mile off the island .
Thompson is a slender , compact 65 - year - old with a pencil mustache , a meticulous manner and smiling eyes .
His voice is as twangy as Herzik ’s is deep .
As a “ walk - on diver , ” he brings in his own haul and pays a cut to Herzik .
Advertisement
Thompson looks at the churning water .
“ We could be in for some exercise , ” he says .
Fishery diving is a race against time .
Divers get two hours or so underwater before they must surface and decompress for a similar spell .
They race across the sea floor like farmworkers through a row crop .
The two men lubricate their limbs with hair conditioner to squeeze into tattered wetsuits .
Thompson fires up the air compressor , which feeds the 500 - foot - long hoses they will breathe from .
The machine is so salt - crusted and beaten , it looks like a boulder covered in lichen .
It is their lifeline .
They study the water .
There is nothing beckoning about it .
A normal soul facing hours fighting currents and cold 60 feet below the surface -- only to spend the night with no warm shower and no toilet -- would kill to be back on the freeway , driving to a dreary cubicle .
Advertisement
Herzik rolls in .
About 40 feet down , he can make out a barren landscape .
An explosion of brittle stars has consumed all the visible plant life , leaving a scene of gray devastation .
The swell has stirred up a sand storm and is knocking him around .
Herzik follows the flat bedrock sea floor looking for outcroppings where the cucumbers might be sheltered .
After 20 minutes , he is vexed .
The pickings are scant .
He has hernia surgery in a week , and then Andrew ’s graduation .
He ’ll be out of the water for a month .
The pressure is on .
His wife , a nurse practitioner , has taken up a lot of the slack .
But his income is critical .
He lumbers onto the boat . .
“ I ’m trying to think of where we should go , ” Herzik tells Thompson .
He ponders trolling to San Clemente Island , five hours south .
First he ’ll try a spot 200 yards away .
“ If this spot is n’t good , we ’re going to have to do something radical , ” Thompson says .

“ I know . ”
Although fishery diving in Southern California dates to the turn of the last century , when divers harvested abalone from the reefs off Palos Verdes , most of the men in the business today started when the sea urchin trade opened in the 1970s .
Tales of good money attracted all types of mavericks : abalone divers , surfers , stoners , military frogmen , loggers , marijuana smugglers .
Herzik first heard about urchin diving in 1971 from his brother Doug , a Navy SEAL just back from Vietnam and living in Redondo Beach .
Advertisement
Herzik was working odd jobs in Maryland after dropping out of an engineering program at Texas A&M . ;
He was a quiet man , shy in groups but drawn to adventure as much as solitude .
Doug ’s pitch had immediate appeal .
He moved to Redondo Beach , and soon he and Doug bought a 34 - foot boat built for commercial diving , the Sunstar .
By the late 1970s , fishermen were landing record numbers of red sea urchin , almost exclusively for export to Japan .
What was once just a pest consuming California ’s kelp forests was becoming one of its most lucrative fisheries .
Herzik had found his groove .
He fell for a former ballet dancer , Deborah Stellar , from Redondo Beach .
They got married in 1982 .
Andrew was born two years later , and Nick four years after that .
Herzik jumped as enthusiastically into family life as he did into the urchin trade .
He struggled with the absences from home , but eventually he struck a manageable balance .
He scheduled his trips around parent - teacher conferences , birthdays , school plays , sports .
He doted on his boys .
They would become top students , avid surfers and championship water polo players .
Herzik would take up surfing -- a deceptively grueling sport to learn -- in his mid-50s just to spend time with them .

The urchin industry began to struggle in the 1990s as stocks were depleted .
Although Southern California held up better than the north , the glory days were gone .
And increasingly , divers grappled with the dangers of the job .
Two divers were killed off Mendocino when the exhaust from their air compressor came too close to the intake , poisoning them with carbon monoxide .
Three others died when their boat capsized .
Another suffocated when a boat caught his hose in its propeller .
Three had fatal heart attacks or strokes underwater ; two drowned for unknown reasons .
Several were crippled by the bends .
And one was killed by a great white shark off San Miguel Island .
Unlike recreational divers , commercial divers eschew the safety of the “ buddy system ” so that they can cover a bigger area .
Some 300 pounds of sea cucumber fall into a plastic trash can in a gelatinous phloop .
Advertisement
“ Well , that ’ll pay for expenses , ” Herzik says .
“ Tomorrow we can make money . ”
The second dive of the day was much better than the first .
Thompson surfaces after two hours underwater , grinning .
“ Now that was fun . ”
Herzik sets a cutting board over a barrel and begins to process the creatures , slicing them open and removing their sand - filled innards .
They pop like water balloons under the knife .
When he is done , he whips the boat around to the leeward side of the island for the night .
Advertisement
Thompson does his processing in the dusk .
The wind is biting cold .
In the cramped space , the two men move around each other with the smooth precision of a peaceful marriage .
In a past life , Thompson was a physicist with a doctorate from UCLA .
As night falls , they hole up in the cabin .
Herzik pours a little chardonnay , Thompson sips juice .
They watch “ Jeopardy ! ” on a tiny television .
When they are asleep , a seal circles and dips around the boat , stirring constellations in the bioluminescence .
Herzik was diving off the back side of Catalina one day in 1997 .
A giant south swell had stirred up the silt , and he could n’t see 10 feet in front of him .
He moved across gravel areas , but the urchins were thin .
He needed to find a reef .
Through the cloudy water , he saw a shadow and moved toward it .
Eight feet away , he could make it out .
Advertisement
His heart nearly exploded .
Great white .
Herzik gasped and shoved his bag of urchins in front of him .
The shark hovered , angling toward him , watching with a lifeless black eye .
It was maybe 15 feet long .
Advertisement
Herzik flailed , trying to propel himself backward .
The shark swooped his tail fin slowly and vanished into the murk .
Herzik ’s nerves screamed with adrenaline .
He was n’t safe .
He could n’t tell where the predator was .
The Sunstar was a good 250 feet away .
But Herzik could n’t know exactly unless he surfaced .
The urchin diver killed three years before was hit on the surface .
Advertisement
Herzik plowed into shore , eyes darting all the way .
In the tidal zone , the surf bashed him .
He tried to climb onto the rocks but got sucked into a crevasse and dragged over barnacles .
Finally , he scrambled onto dry land .
When his brother got back on the boat , Terry waved him down .
Doug positioned the Sunstar as close as he could and Herzik dashed toward it with Olympic speed .
He has studied shadows very closely ever since .
Advertisement
The second day out at Santa Barbara Island , Herzik is 60 feet below in clear water .
He follows rich veins of sea cucumbers , picking up every one , his bubbles rising in silver umbrellas .
He keeps his eye out for a 300 - pound black sea bass that gave him a start the day before .
Later , coiling his dive hose , he is pumped .
“ I was picking five with one hand , ” he tells Thompson .
They figure they have about 800 pounds of processed cucumber , a decent haul at $ 2 a pound .
But the marine radio bears bad news .
Fierce Santa
Ana winds are expected tomorrow , which can create dangerous seas .
Herzik weighs the second night .
“ There is a fine line between being smart and being an alarmist , ” he says .
“ I do n’t know where it is sometimes . ”
Advertisement
If they stay , they might have to wait out the winds for days .
Herzik decides to motor home .
The Sunstar is showing signs of decrepitude .
The paint is peeling , the wood is frayed .
The cleats are deeply rusted and the running lights do n’t work .
He ties two flashlights to the bow to be seen .
In the dark halfway back , Herzik realizes he ’s not getting any drive out of an engine .
Before midnight , they pass the green beacon of Angel ’s Gate lighthouse .
They enter the sprawl of cranes and lights and pull up to the darkened quay in Fish Harbor .
They transfer the barrels of cucumbers into the buyer ’s pickup .
Advertisement
The next day , Herzik determines that the transmission on one of the engines has burned out .
He ’ll have to pay $ 600 to fix it and spend hours removing the engine himself .
But he does n’t have time now .
As the winds subside , he and Thompson chug out of the harbor before dawn , on the one good engine .

Let me get this straight :
My wife and I are going to owe no federal income tax and the maniac state is going to give us $ 1,600 !?
I do n’t remember smoking crack this morning , but that ’s what the Bloomberg piece tells us !
Wow , now I know what it ’s like to be an evil U.S. corporation !
Owe no income taxes AND get a hand out !
Man , you have got to love the “ unseen hand ” of the state in collapse .
The free market .
Democracy …
Who is going to pay for all of this ?
The Chinese ?
The Japanese ?
The Saudis ?
The Kuwaitis ?
If this was any other country , I would have prefaced this post with the “ EMERGENCY ” label and then suggested that readers immediately eliminate exposure to U.S. Dollar denominated assets .
But the U.S. is like a weird and frightening carnival ride .
You know the ones I mean .
You notice the rust and loose cotter pins first .
“ Are we going to get off this thing alive ? ” might be a common thought as people strap themselves in with frayed safety belts .
As the cart takes off , maybe you catch a glimpse of the skulls tattooed on the bearded freak carnie who ’s at the controls .
You tell yourself that you did n’t see a swastika on his neck …
And away you go !
Wee !
That ’s the U.S. financial system !
That ’s the financial system to which the rest of the world is joined at the hip .
Is the cart going to go off the rails this time ?
Or will this dose of government cheese be enough to help the zombies limp through another Presidential ( s ) Election , or longer ?
Via : Bloomberg :
The Bush administration is close to completing an economic - stimulus proposal that will include $ 800 rebates for individuals and $ 1,600 for households as well as tax breaks for businesses , people familiar with the plan said .
…
The plan the administration is close to proposing includes a temporary elimination of the bottom tax rate , which is now 10 percent , and a consequent lump - sum rebate to all taxpayers , according to the people .
Businesses would get a tax break under the plan that would allow them to deduct 50 percent of the price of new equipment they purchase this year .
Small businesses would be able to deduct as much as $ 200,000 in new equipment purchases , up from the current $ 112,000 limit .

width = ” 250 ″ Tonight a smart and determined group of impeachment activists gathered in front of the Yale Club of New York City to urge Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) to hold impeachment hearings .
Nadler was scheduled to speak at the annual dinner for Citizen Action of New York , one of New York ’s leading progressive organizations , which does outstanding work on education , health care , and other important issues .
Nadler chairs the Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution , Civil Rights , and Civil Liberties , so Dennis Kucinich ’s H. Res. 333 ( recently revised as H.Res. 799 ) is before his committee , which makes him a key player on impeachment .
I stood with the impeachment activists for a while before the event began , and the response from passers - by was mostly positive , although midtown Manhattan is not a place to encourage honking !
I bought a ticket to the dinner inside hoping to speak with Nadler on behalf of the activists outside .
While Nadler arrived near the end , I did get to spend a few minutes discussing impeachment with him , although we kept getting interrupted by other guests .
I have lobbied Nadler on impeachment several times , so I did not take him by surprise and he greeted me with a friendly smile , and we covered much of the same ground .
“ When are you going to schedule hearings on impeachment ? ” I began , aiming right for the bottom line .
“ As a subcommittee chairman I ca n’t make that decision , it ’s up to Chairman Conyers , ” he replied .
“ Besides it ’s a bad idea , ” he said .
“ Why ? ” I asked .
“ It would suck all the oxygen out of Congress , and we would n’t get anything else done . ”
I suppressed the obvious snarky answer that they were n’t getting anything else done anyway , and took a different tack : “ But it ’s just one subcommittee , how can that suck all the oxygen out of Congress ? ”
“ You know how the media would jump on it , ” he replied .
I wanted to say , “ Yes and that ’s good because the American people would support the impeachment effort , ” but someone else pulled him aside .
[…]
I waited and gave it one more try .
“ Impeachment can never work , it was n’t designed for a two - party system , that ’s why we ’ve never removed a President ” he said .
“ So then we should tear up the Constitution ? ” I asked .

6417 Presidential Documents Federal Register Vol. 73 , No. 22 Friday , February 1 , 2008 Title 3 — Executive Order 13457 of January 29 , 2008 The President Protecting American Taxpayers From Government Spending on Wasteful Earmarks
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America , it is hereby ordered as follows : Section 1 . Policy .
It is the policy of the Federal Government to be judicious in the expenditure of taxpayer dollars .

An agency shall not consider the views of a House , committee , Member , officer , or staff of the Congress with respect to commitments , obligations , or expenditures to carry out any earmark unless such views are in writing , to facilitate consideration in accordance with section 2 ( a ) ( ii ) above .
All written communications from the Congress , or a House , committee , Member , officer , or staff thereof , recommending that funds be committed , obligated , or expended on any earmark shall be made publicly available on the Internet by the receiving agency , not later than 30 days after receipt of such communication , unless otherwise specifically directed by the head of the agency , without delegation , after consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget , to preserve appropriate confidentiality between the executive and legislative branches .

Suleymane Soro always grew cotton on his 17 - acre farm in Ivory Coast , supporting his wife and six children in a mud home he built himself .
It has no running water , no electricity -- and this year , little cotton .
“ We are completely discouraged , ” said Soro , who could n’t buy seeds and fertilizer after the local ginning company failed .
His profit fell two - thirds this decade , to $ 262 last year .
He turned to corn to survive .
About 6,500 miles away on 800 acres in West Texas , Kelli Merritt watches the cotton market with the same attention she devotes to shooting wild hogs that wander too close to her crop .
The pigs are easier to control .
Prices , though rising , remain 20 % below their level four years ago .
Unlike Soro , she has a safety net : U.S. subsidies that paid her $ 98,097 in 2006 .
Soro and Merritt are two faces of the more - than - $ 280 - billion farm bill pending in the Senate .
The legislation , similar to a House - passed measure President Bush threatened to veto , would continue subsidy programs that totaled $ 3.1 billion in the 2005 - 06 fiscal year .

U.S. farmers like Merritt say the payments are vital .
The World Trade Organization says they distort trade and lower prices , hurting farmers like Soro .
The U.S. is hardly the only country to support its domestic growers .
China , the largest producer , provides $ 1.4 billion in annual aid through import quotas that keep Chinese prices above those elsewhere , according to the International Cotton Advisory Committee , a Washington - based association of producing and consuming countries .
The European Union , a much smaller producer , gave its farmers $ 300 million in aid in the last crop year .
Merritt , 49 , lives in the brick house she and her ex-husband built 26 years ago .
She was in the top 17 % of recipients of U.S. cotton subsidies in 2005 , the latest year for which figures are available publicly , according to the Environmental Working Group , an organization favoring subsidy reductions that keeps a database of farm payments .
Advertisement
The top 1 % , who received 23 % of the payments that year , got an average of $ 556,716 .
Farmers around nearby Lubbock could n’t get by without the promise of government support because bankers would n’t lend growers money for the next crop , Merritt said .
The problem for farmers such as Soro is that subsidies encourage excess production , which pushes down prices , the advisory committee says .
It estimates prices would rise 10 % over three to four years if subsidies ended worldwide .
The U.S. is often singled out for criticism by Brazil and other developing nations because most of its crop is exported , said Terry Townsend , executive director of the cotton advisory committee .

Trade threats are having little effect on the U.S. farm bill debate in Congress .
Sen. Tom Harkin ( D - Iowa ) , chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee , says U.S. growers seem willing to keep their subsidies and take their chances before the WTO .
“ The votes are n’t there to change cotton programs , ” said Harkin , whose committee approved its farm bill .
The committee expects the measure to cost about $ 288 billion over five years .
Like the bill passed by the House of Representatives in July , it would create a program to subsidize cotton bought by domestic textile mills , attempting to shore up demand hurt by a shift of the global garment industry to China .
It would make only minor adjustments to existing subsidy programs .
President Bush , seeking to avoid further trade conflicts , threatened to veto the House bill , which will ultimately have to be reconciled with the Senate ’s package .

Even if U.S. production and exports were cut significantly , the poorest countries would get little benefit , said Samarendu Mohanty , associate professor at Texas Tech University in Lubbock .
Prices have fallen since 1995 , when the industry benchmark price reached a peak of $ 1.194 a pound , according to Cotlook , a British market research firm that tracks prices , supply and use .
The benchmark average this marketing year may be 71 cents a pound , up from 59 cents last year , Townsend ’s group estimated .
The drop has withered exports from nations competing with larger producers on the world market .
The value of exports from Ivory Coast fell to $ 129.3 million in 2006 , an 18 % decline since 2001 , according to the United Nations .
African nations including Ivory Coast are responsible for about 18 % of global cotton exports .
In West Africa alone , about 10 million people are dependent on the fiber , especially in regions where other crops are difficult to grow .
The rub will come when a decision has to be made about what actually to do .
Both Mr. Kibaki and Mr. Odinga claim to have won the election fairly .
Kofi Annan , the former United Nations secretary general , is mediating the talks and searching for a compromise .
That could include a power - sharing arrangement between the government and the opposition , a transitional government to serve until a new election is held , or a comprehensive audit of the election results with both sides agreeing to accept the winner .
The United Nations is also pushing for a South Africa - style truth and reconciliation commission to investigate the explosion of violence that has convulsed Kenya , which until recently was viewed as one of the most stable and promising countries on the African continent .
On Tuesday , Mr. Annan met with Kenya ’s top business leaders , who pleaded with him to speed up the negotiations because the country ’s economy had been brought to its knees .
Kenya ’s billion - dollar - a - year tourism industry has suffered immensely , with game parks and beach hotels deserted .
Agriculture has also suffered because the insecurity in the Rift Valley has blocked the flow of produce and commodities like tea and coffee .
At the end of trading on Monday , the stock market was down roughly 25 percent from where it was at the time of the election .
Business leaders estimate that the economy has already lost several billion dollars and is on track to lose several billion more .
The troubled spots in the country continue to be volatile .
In Kericho , an abundantly fertile tea-growing area in the Rift Valley , fighting raged Tuesday between members of the Kisii and Kalenjin ethnic groups .
Mobs of young men from each side have been squaring off on the hillsides , hurling rocks and shooting arrows at one another .
Residents said dozens of people were killed in the past week and hundreds of homes were burned , resulting in a new wave of displacements .
Rolls Royce have released a exclusive new special edition Phantom , the Tungsten edition .
The Rolls Royce Phantom Tungsten Edition is customized by the Rolls Royce Bespoke department and has numerous innovative features from the 101EX experimental car which is to be released next year as the Phantom Coupé .
The Phantom features a special ‘ Xirallic ’ Darkest Tungsten paint finish and a brushed aluminum bonnet as well as a pair of visible chrome - plated , stainless steel exhaust pipes .
The interior features Smoke Grey leather seats with contrasting Navy Blue hide , the dashboard is micro engraved metal with high - gloss , straight - grained East Indian Rosewood veneer .
The interior also features a starlight headliner which uses eight hundred fibre - optic lights to create the impression of a star - filled night sky .
A limited number of the Tungsten Edition Phantom ’s will be available on each continent making it an extremely rare car .

It ’s close enough .
According to this video , this Russian guy is invincible .
It ’s an amateur video , was recorded by his friend on the mobile phone .
Well , they have yogis in India who walk on fire or being dug deep underground for days , why ca n’t real supermen live in Russia ?
I am now convinced that when it comes to game design we get stupider as we get older .
This was made very clear to me the other day when my 3 - year - old nephew spent a sick - day at my house .
Apparently you 're not allowed to go to daycare when you 're still contagious , and both his parents have real , go - to - the - office jobs .
So little Carter got to play with Aunt Wendy , who works on videogames from home .
The day went pretty much as you 'd expect - chase the dogs for a while , haul the cat out from under the bed , go for a walk , put a puzzle together , color in a Spider - man coloring book .
We were having a good time , but I was starting to scrape the bottom of the barrel when I faced the inevitable " Let 's do something else . "
Finally the obvious hit me .
Let 's play some videogames !
I grabbed the first one off the top of the pile and put it in the PS2 .
Star Wars : Battlefront it is .
Carter 's father is a proper geek and has instilled in his children an appropriate adoration for all things Star Wars , so we were off and running .
I started a new game and set it to " easy . "
This kid's too smart to try the old " Here , hold this controller while I play the game " thing .
Did you know you can win the first level of Star Wars just by standing in one place , turning in constant circles and holding down the " X " button ?
Aunt Wendy got something right .
He was thrilled .
And when he heard the cheerful chimes , a signal to those of all ages that you 've won something , there was jumping around and fists in the air and lots of shouting I did n't understand .
But then the next level came up , and things started to go downhill .
The instant it began he looked confused .
It took him a few seconds to put it into words , but then he said it .
" I already won this level . "
I looked at Star Wars with new eyes .
This truly was level 2 .
He really had won the first level .
No cheating there .
But the lovingly - rendered background and setting did n't look all that different from the first level .
Honestly , how would I know this was a different level if I had n't read the words on the screen ?
I picked out some very tiny details and showed him how it was different .
He seemed unconvinced and was even more disappointed when he ran out of ammunition and could n't figure out how to reload or change guns .
It just was n't intuitive enough .
He was done .
" How about a different game ? " I tried .
He was up for that , so I grabbed the next one on my pile and stuffed it in the PS2 .
Up comes Jak and Daxter .
The cute characters caught my nephew 's attention immediately , and he was quite interested .
For a while .
Then his face clouded over and he looked at me like , who are you trying to fool ?
Dems slam diplomatic downsizing as untold cost of war in Iraq Jason Rhyne and Nick Juliano
Published : Monday December 17 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Lawmakers say war , not lack of funding , made cuts necessary Democratic presidential contender Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) and two senior members of the House Foreign Affairs committee are panning a planned slashing of the US diplomatic corps as a sad consequence of the war in Iraq .
Following the reassignment of hundreds of foreign service officers to priority embassy positions in Afghanistan and Iraq , the director general of the US foreign service , Harry Thomas , last week instructed State Department officials to identify for elimination the " least critical " ten percent of diplomatic posts .
As reported by the Washington Post , however , Congress has not allocated the additional funding to staff vacancies which account for almost one quarter of diplomatic positions around the world .
But Democratic lawmakers suggest that the root of the problem lies with Iraq , where they say the high demand for qualified diplomats has created holes in the foreign service 's presence elsewhere in the world .
" Senator Obama believes the proposed cuts to diplomatic posts are unfortunate and prove another cost of the war in Iraq , and that is why he will end the war and renew American diplomacy , " Obama spokeswoman Amy Brundage said in an email to RAW STORY .
The senator has previously called for an expansion of the diplomatic corps .
Thomas cited " severe staffing shortfalls " in a message to his department , according to the Post .
" If we can not realistically fill all of the positions currently vacant , " he wrote , " good management dictates that we ... focus on the most essential . "
Rep. Donald Payne ( D - NJ ) , a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs committee , told RAW STORY that committee membership was not told in advance of the eliminated posts .
" It was news to us when we saw the article in the paper , " Payne said in a phone interview .
" The favorable rating the US has always enjoyed has certainly plummeted around the world .
To be reducing our diplomatic presence by ten percent is a drastic move in the wrong direction . "
Payne also characterized the decision as the unfortunate but " predictable " upshot of the war in Iraq .
" They 're definitely shifting personnel to Iraq in particular and also Afghanistan , " he said .
" It 's another of the unintended consequences of the bad decision made to have that preemptive strike [ in Iraq ] ... an unintended consequence as we 've seen so many other ones . "
Rep. Brad Sherman ( D - CA ) , another senior member of House Foreign Affairs , agreed .
" This is one of the unfortunate , if somewhat underreported , effects of the war in Iraq , " Sherman said in a statement .
" Our ability to advance our interests and deal with humanitarian crises elsewhere in the world is being hobbled .
The fact that so many of our diplomats are required in Iraq is a symptom of this problem . "
From 2001 to 2004 , the foreign service had expanded by about 300 positions annually , according to the Post , but Congress has recently curtailed funds for the increased hires .
" We believe that ... we had a justified need for those additional positions in those years , " Patrick Kennedy , undersecretary of state for management , told the Post .
" On the other hand , Congress has to make choices , and they made them .
I 'm not going to say they are the wrong choices . "
He added that the recent 10 percent cuts were not necessarily permanent .
Asked about the potential of a boost in future funding from Congress to staff the posts , Payne said he could n't offer a prediction .
" We would have to certainly have a conversation with the Foreign Affairs chair and the [ House Appropriations Committee ] , " he said .
" They 'll have to determine where the money would come from , and if it would have to be taken away from some other very critical programs . "
TORONTO ( Reuters ) - A new law meant to help crack down on young Canadian street racers in their souped up cars has nabbed an octogenarian in his Oldsmobile .
The 85 - year - old man is one of 2,300 drivers across Ontario to be charged under new legislation , designed to combat “ street racing , stunts and contests ” , since it came into effect three months ago -- and he ’s the oldest .
The man was pulled over after allegedly driving 161 kilometres per hour ( 100 mph ) this week on a main highway north of Toronto , where the speed limit is 100 km/h , Ontario Provincial Police said .
“ It really does n’t matter the age of the person or whether they ’re trying to race another car , ” OPP Sgt. Cam Woolley said on Friday .
“ The consequences of the crashes and the laws of physics are always in effect . ”
Under the street racing legislation , a person is charged if they are driving 50 km/h more than the posted speed limit .
“ Street racing was probably a bad title for it , extreme driving probably would have been better , ” Woolley noted .
Under the legislation , the 85 - year - old could face a minimum C$ 2,000 ( 1,010 pound ) fine .
His license has been suspended and his car impounded for a week .
Woolley said that , in the case of the 85 - year - old , a police officer driving in a marked car saw the Oldsmobile and tried to get the driver ’s attention , honking her horn and waving .
“ He flew past her , ” said Woolley , adding he was going about 140 km/h at the time -- and then speeded up .
When he finally stopped , the man told the officer he was going to the bank and planned to go shopping , Woolley said .
“ When she informed him that his car was being impounded for a week , he said : ‘ God damn , you ’re not taking my car , are ya ? ’ ” Woolley said , adding the man later apologized for swearing , and the officer drove him to the bank .
Until this week , two 75 - year - old men were the oldest to be charged under the law .
The youngest is a 16 - year - old woman .
Most are men in their 20s .
Well , aside from the fact they ’re not tags , everybody wants to own a subreddit .
So right when they got announced , one of the first was ‘ Apple ’ and I , a macfag , joined immediately .
But now there ’s ‘ mac ’ and ‘ osx ’ subreddits .
There ’s also a ‘ video ’ to the earlier ‘ videos ’
( I joined videos when it appeared , video did not exist , it does not ) , and a ‘ webcomics ’ to the earlier ‘ comics ’ ( which specifically covers both in it ’s name field ) .
There ’s even an xkcd , because a comic that updates three times a week needs to compete with comics / webcomics .
There ’s even a ‘ meta ’ reddit ( which probably covers the earlier “ ask reddit ” but the overlay is not so simple ) , and a ‘ bestof ’ ( which I ’m ok with ) and ‘ worstof ’ reddit .
One of the most heinous crimes against reddit , in my opinion , is the ‘ xxx ’ subreddit .
You know , for porn .
Which is what nsfw has always been for , long before users made their own .
Dear redditors :
There ’s maybe 50 or 60 subreddits , is it really that god damned hard to look for the one you ’re making before you make it ?
( Edit : Someone suggested this , I would n’t leave reddit for it … yet )
On FNS , George Bush , knowing full well that the conservative base is cracking apart over McCain --- had this to say about Barack Obama :
Bush : " I certainly do n't know what he believes in .
The only foreign policy thing I remember he said was he 's going to attack Pakistan and embrace Ahmadinejad . "

Nice going , Chris .
Way to clarify Obama 's position .
And you wonder why this country is so screwed up .
He does n't even have the decency to get the only things " he really knows " about Obama correct .
It did n't take long for Obama to respond to Bush 's falsehoods .
The silence was deafening in the camps of Democratic presidential candidates yesterday over civil - rights leader Andrew Young ’s tasteless crack comparing Bill Clinton ’s and Barak Obama ’s supposed prowess with black women .
“ Bill is every bit as black as Barack .
He ’s probably gone with more black women than Barack , ” the former UN ambassador quipped on a live TV interview – immediately adding , “ I ’m clowning . ”
Clinton ’s campaign had no immediate comment , nor did Obama’s .
Jesse Jackson , who has boasted that Obama “ has my vote , ” would n’t touch the political hot potato with a 10 - foot pole .
“ He has no comment , ” spokeswoman Rashida Restaino said .
The Rev. Al Sharpton , who has n’t yet declared his choice for Dem presidential nominee , likewise had no immediate comment .
Young , the former mayor of Atlanta , made the remark after being asked what he thought of Obama during the Sept. 5 interview .
Young , who has not made an official endorsement , said , “ I want Barack Obama to be president , ” pausing for applause before adding , “ in 2016 . ”
“ It ’s not a matter of being inexperienced .
It ’s a matter of being young , ” he said .
Locally , Harlem state Sen. Bill Perkins said Young ’s comments were way out of line .
“ That ’s an insult to black women of the ugliest kind that I ’ve heard in God knows how long , and he should be ashamed of himself , ” Perkins said .

Say yes to pressure
Acupressure stimulates the same points as acupuncture , but with fingers instead of needles .
Michael Reed Gach , PhD , director of the Acupressure Institute in Berkeley , California , recommends pressing on the following three points :
The Third Eye , located between the eyebrows , in the indentation where the bridge of the nose meets the forehead .
The Heavenly Pillar , on the back of the neck slightly below the base of the skull , about half an inch to the left or right of the spine .
The Heavenly Rejuvenation , half an inch below the top of each shoulder , midway between the base of the neck and the outside of the shoulder blade .
Breathe deeply and apply firm , steady pressure on each point for two to three minutes .
The pressure should cause a mild aching sensation , but not pain .
Here are some more pressure points to try for stress relief .
Is Vodka Different ?
Reader Greg O’Neill sent along the following email :
For a long time , beginning with my first real summer job in an expensive restaurant in Toronto , I have noticed that bars ( anywhere ) generally feature the same bottles of alcohol — the iconic brands , Bacardi , Seagrams , etc .
And these major brands , especially for whiskey , rum , and gin , seem to have changed little over time .
Meanwhile , vodka is open game !
There ’s always someone gunning to be the next Absolut , Stoli , Grey Goose , etc …
So , basically , why is there such a low barrier to entry with the vodkas ( in particular ) and , on the other hand , almost no threats to monopoly of the other alcohol types ?
For example , tequila had no new brands for ages — and the recent arrival of Patron caused quite a buzz !
( with stories in the news about the “ upstart newcomer ” !!!)
I think vodka is the most popular alcohol of this group , but is there more to it than that ?
One possible explanation that comes to mind is that all vodkas basically taste the same , whereas brands of other alcohols are more distinctive .
If the early rum entrants either found the best formulas or warped consumer tastes to want their formulas , then it would be hard for new brands to break into the rum market .
In support of this theory , a quick scanning of online vodka taste tests that were done blind seems to suggest that there is no consensus on what the best tasting vodkas are ( see here , here , and here for a few examples ) .
I could n’t find any blind taste tests of rum online ( although there probably are some ) and only one blind test on tequila to test the conjecture that the popular rums and tequilas taste better .
Perhaps some curious / degenerate blog readers can undertake such tests and report the results to me .
I suspect , however , that there will be as much heterogeneity in preferences for other alcohols as there is for vodka , which would invalidate this theory .
My best guess as to the real explanation is that everyone is just a copycat — as evidenced by the fact that there are so many online blind taste tests for vodka once the first one happens .
One original - thinking person comes up with the idea to market fancy vodka , it works , and then everyone else tries to sell his own brand of fancy vodka .
Because nobody ever tried ( or maybe succeeded ) launching a new rum or gin , the copycats never thought to do it either .
Brad Trayser thinks this hypothesis is right .
He just launched a new rum called “ Kilo Kai ” with the expectation that drinkers around the world will soon be asking for a “ Kilo and Coke . ”
( Let ’s hope for his sake it fares better than Cocaine , the drink . )
If Kilo Kai succeeds , then my theory predicts a dozen copycats within a few years .
Maybe there are better explanations ?
Any ideas ?
Ronald C. Arkin , “ Governing Lethal Behavior : Embedding Ethics in a Hybrid Deliberative / Reactive Robot Architecture , ” Technical Report GIT-GVU -07011 .
Fascinating ( and long : 117 - page ) paper on ethical implications of robots in war .
Summary , Conclusions , and Future Work
This report has provided the motivation , philosophy , formalisms , representational requirements , architectural design criteria , recommendations , and test scenarios to design and construct an autonomous robotic system architecture capable of the ethical use of lethal force .
These first steps toward that goal are very preliminary and subject to major revision , but at the very least they can be viewed as the beginnings of an ethical robotic warfighter .
The primary goal remains to enforce the International Laws of War in the battlefield in a manner that is believed achievable , by creating a class of robots that not only conform to International Law but outperform human soldiers in their ethical capacity .
It is too early to tell whether this venture will be successful .
There are daunting problems
remaining :
The transformation of International Protocols and battlefield ethics into machine usable representations and real - time reasoning capabilities for bounded morality using modal logics .
Mechanisms to ensure that the design of intelligent behaviors only provide responses within rigorously defined ethical boundaries .
The creation of techniques to permit the adaptation of an ethical constraint set and underlying behavioral control parameters that will ensure moral performance , should those norms be violated in any way , involving reflective and affective processing .
A means to make responsibility assignment clear and explicit for all concerned parties regarding the deployment of a machine with a lethal potential on its mission .
Over the next two years , this architecture will be slowly fleshed out in the context of the specific test scenarios outlined in this article .
Hopefully the goals of this effort , will fuel other scientists ’ interest to assist in ensuring that the machines that we as roboticists create fit within international and societal expectations and requirements .
My personal hope would be that they will never be needed in the present or the future .
But mankind ’s tendency toward war seems overwhelming and inevitable .
At the very least , if we can reduce civilian casualties according to what the Geneva Conventions have promoted and the Just War tradition subscribes to , the result will have been a humanitarian effort , even while staring directly at the face of war .

Livingston : How did you know Trevor ?
Graham : Trevor was in grad school with Robert .
I asked Robert , " Who 's the smartest grad student in the computer science program ? " and he said " Trevor . "
I could n't believe it actually , because at the time I thought Trevor was a total goofball .
Livingston :
But you were soon convinced he was talented ?
Graham :
Trevor is a prodigy , in the original sense of the word .
When we first recruited him , we asked him to write this little piece of image - manipulating software , to kind of test him out .
For 2 weeks we heard nothing from him , and I had pretty much written him off .
Finally he sent me an email asking me to come to his office to see what he 'd done .
I went there expecting to see this new image software , and instead he 's rewritten our entire system in Smalltalk — everything I wrote , plus everything Rtm wrote .
I basically said , " OK , you 're hired .
Now go and write the damn image software , because we 're not rewriting everything in Smalltalk . "

( Updates to midday , changes byline )
NEW YORK , Feb 28 ( Reuters ) - U.S. stocks tumbled on Thursday as worries about the economy grew following a weaker - than - expected reading on gross domestic product and a warning from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke that there probably will be bank failures because of the housing slump .
Stocks opened lower after new data showing sluggish growth in the economy , measured by GDP in the fourth quarter of 2007 , and an increase in claims for jobless benefits .
Bernanke , during the second day of his semiannual testimony before a congressional committee , said there may be some failures among smaller banks that invested heavily in real estate because the housing market ’s severe problems may drain their capital .
He added , however , that the U.S. banking system overall is in good shape with the biggest banks well capitalized .

The case began when Mr. Antonini , 46 , returned to his home in Key Biscayne , Fla .
Within days , he began cooperating with American investigators , offering them insight into what they contend was an operation in which wealthy Venezuelan businessmen in south Florida plotted with officials as high up as Mr. Chávez ’s spymaster and former vice president .

Mr. Antonini may have asked for American help after Argentine investigators sought his extradition .
Two days after being caught with the cash , Mr. Antonini was seen in the presidential palace in Buenos Aires celebrating the signing of business deals with Venezuela , according to Victoria Bereziuk , an Argentine secretary who was at the palace and who was one of the passengers in the private plane with Mr. Antonini , according to Argentine investigators .
Alberto Fernández , Mrs. Kirchner ’s chief of staff , later denied her assertion , saying the Argentine government had no record of Mr. Antonini being at the palace .
What is clear is that soon after leaving Argentina he agreed to be recorded , photographed and videotaped by F.B.I. agents as he talked to a number of Venezuelans in Florida , who coaxed , cajoled and outright threatened him to keep quiet and accept falsified documents about the origin and intent of the money , American investigators contend .
The government made 41 audio recordings and eight videotapes , documents in the case show .
The surveillance took place in a series of restaurants and cafes .
In one meeting , on Aug. 23 at Jackson ’s Steakhouse in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , Carlos Kauffmann , 36 , a Venezuelan businessman , told Mr. Antonini it was not in Venezuela ’s best interest for him to have any “ problems ” in Venezuela .
A Venezuelan lawyer assured Mr. Antonini that Venezuela ’s national oil company , Petróleos de Venezuela , would pay for all legal expenses and financial penalties that might result from the suitcase scandal .
But by Sept. 7 , when Mr. Antonini met with Franklin Duran , 40 , a Venezuelan oil products tycoon and close friend , at a Quarterdeck restaurant in Fort Lauderdale , Mr. Duran was telling him that Venezuelan authorities no longer trusted Mr. Antonini and suspected that he was talking to American law enforcement .
At one point , two of the suspects , according to prosecutors , offered Mr. Antonini $ 2 million in hush money .
On another occasion , prosecutors said , Mr. Duran told Mr. Antonini that if he did not cooperate his children could be in danger .
A Minneota woman allegedly carrying a fake ID is charged with driving without a license , running a stop sign and killing four children in Tuesday ’s school bus crash in southwestern Minnesota .
According to a criminal complaint filed by the Lyon County Attorney today , Alianiss Nunez Morales , 23 , of Minneota , is accused of four counts of criminal vehicular homicide ; one count of a stop sign violation and one count of not having a Minnesota driver ’s license .
The first four counts are felonies that carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison , a $ 20,000 fine or both .
The fifth and sixth counts are misdemeanors that carry a maximum penalty of 90 days in jail , a $ 1,000 fine or both .
In addition , agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement have probable cause to believe that Morales is in the country illegally and that the name she gave authorities is not her true identity , said ICE spokesman Claude Arnold , at a morning briefing before the court appearance .
Morales told authorities that she was from Mexico , Arnold said .
Prosecutors had asked that Morales be held without bail because she is “ an extreme flight risk . ”
Prosecutors said immigration officials in Puerto Rico have talked to the grandmother of the real Alianiss Morales and showed them pictures of the defendant .
They did not recognize the woman in the pictures .
“ At present , her identity is unknown , ” said Lyon County Attorney Richard Maes .
“ She becomes an extreme flight risk . ”
Judge Leland Bush set bail at $ 400,000 without conditions or $ 200,000 with conditions .
The complaint , filed in Lyon County District Court , gave more details about the crash that occurred around 3:30 p.m. Tuesday .
Morales was driving a 1998 Plymouth minivan heading east on County Road 24 when it smashed into a school bus — with 28 students — heading south on Highway 23 .
The minivan was going at a “ fairly good speed , ” according to one witness and the bus driver .
Four Lakeview School students died and several others were injured .
Morales was among the injured .
Those killed were brothers Jesse Javens , 13 , and Hunter Javens , 9 , of Cottonwood ; Emilee Olson , 9 , of Cottonwood ; and Reed Stevens , 12 , of Marshall .
Fifteen people were hurt and taken to hospitals in Marshall , Sioux Falls and Granite Falls .
The bus driver , Dennis A. Devereaux , told authorities that when he saw the van coming , he knew that it would not be able to stop and that he did not have time to hit the brakes or speed up to avoid it .
Morales ’ van hit the bus in the center of its right side , which ripped off its rear axle .
The bus began spinning and tipping onto its left side .
The bus then spun into the path of a 2007 Chevrolet Silverado going north on Highway 23 , ultimately coming to rest atop the truck .
“ I thought the bus was gonna start on fire , ” Devereaux told authorities .
“ So I punched open the hatch and I started handing kids out the window . ”
Morales was headed to work at Norcraft Cabinetry , where she had been employed for a month .
She told authorities that she did not always drive to work and that this was her first time on that road .
According to the complaint , Morales said she stopped and when she took off , the bus hit her .
This morning , Morales entered the courthouse in a wheelchair , escorted by four law enforcement officials .
A white blanket covered her legs — her right leg was in a bandage and slightly elevated .
In the courtroom , Bush read the six charges against Morales .
She responded to questions from Bush quietly and in Spanish , through an interpreter .
Morales had to be asked to speak up .
“ Are you married ? ” “ No . ”
“ Do you live alone ? ” “ I lived with my boyfriend , but not anymore . ”
“ Do you have family in the Lyon County area ? ” “ Yes , an aunt and cousins . ”
Morales is being represented by St. Paul lawyer Manuel Guerrero , who was retained by Morales ’ sister Thursday night .
“ From what she ’s told me , she does have a defense to this , ” Guerrero said in court .
Morales ’ next court appearance is scheduled for April 21 .
ICE has put a detainer on Morales , which means that after court proceedings are done , federal immigration officials will have their own proceedings to determine her immigration status and possible deportation .
Today ’s court proceedings were held as the community of Cottonwood continues to deal with its loss .
A community of 1,150 people , Cottonwood is a close - knit town about 150 miles southwest of St. Paul .
Lakeview School , which serves Cottonwood and nearby Wood Lake , has about 585 students in kindergarten through 12th grade .
Classes at Lakeview School resumed Thursday , with the U.S. flag outside the building at half - staff .
Later that night , a community service remembering the victims drew more than 1,000 people , including Gov. Tim Pawlenty , Sen. Norm Coleman and Sen. Amy Klobuchar .
“ We are united in our grief , ” Pawlenty said at the service .
“ The arms of Minnesota embrace you tonight .
This is a terribly sad circumstance .
About as sad as it gets . ”
Now the victims ’ families are preparing for their funerals .
Visitation for the Javens brothers is 5 to 8 p.m. Sunday and 10 to 11 a.m. Monday at Lakeview School in Cottonwood .
The funeral will be at 11 a.m. Monday at the school .
Visitation for Emilee Olson is 6 to 9 p.m. Saturday and 1 to 2 p.m. Sunday at Christ Lutheran Church in Cottonwood .
Her funeral will be 2 p.m. Sunday .
Services are pending for Reed Stevens .
A fund for families of the crash victims has been set up through United Southwest Bank in Cottonwood .
Contributions should be sent to : Lakeview School Memorial Fund , c /o United Southwest Bank , P.O. Box 288 , Cottonwood , MN 56229-0288 .

The Story after the 707 " DASH 80 " Barrel Roll with Tex Johnston
The plane lands at Boeing field and Tex gets out and starts to walk away from the plane .
A Boeing official runs over to Tex and tells him Mr. Allen wants to see him now .
Mr. Allen is the president of Boeing .
So Tex heads off across the street to the Boeing Exec offices and into Mr. Allens office .
Tex walks in .
Mr Allen from behind his desk says " How are Tex ... Hows the family " ?
Tex answers the boss .
Mr Allen the says " I hear you rolled the plane today , Tex " .
Tex says quietly ..... " Yes sir I did " .
Mr Allen answers ...
" Do n't do it again ....... Bye Tex ..say hello to the wife .. " .
About the Aircraft ...
The Boeing 367-80 was the name of the " prototype " of both the 707/720 commercial transport / military tanker / military communications plane and the 717/739 ( KC - 135 etc ) military transport / tanker .
It was called the " Dash - 80 " and although 707 was eventually written on the tail ( and it was registered N70700 ) , it was n't really a 707 so much as a pre-aircraft , a basic - built demonstrator .
- The 707 and KC - 135 look similar but beside different lenghts , have different upper fuselage lobe dimensions ( ditto for the Dash - 80 ) and different alloys .
- The Dash - 80 was flown in August 2003 to Washingon , where it has been permanently retired to the big new annex of the Smithsonian 's museum of air and space .
Here it resides with Concorde and many other important aircraft .
- Tex Johnston did the barrel roll and even if test pilots back then were different , the company was stunned by it and whatever the exact conversation was like , he apparently came close to losing his job .
But the roll seems to have impressed the military and to have gotten Boeing the large contract for the KC - 135 .

PARIS  Jérôme Kerviel was too middling to be considered a loser .
Until he was charged by Société Générale with perpetrating the biggest fraud of its kind in banking history , there was nothing superlative about him .
He failed in a bid for town council in his 20s ; he never rose higher than a green belt , a midlevel rank , after years of judo training  because of his bad knees ; and he attended an average college where he earned respectable but unremarkable grades .
“ People who want to be golden boys or clever in the market do n’t come here , ” said Valérie Buthion , the director of the University of Lyon ’s economic and financial engineering department , where Mr. Kerviel earned a master ’s degree in market finance .
“ The showoffs do n’t come . ”
As they sought to explain how a low - level trader caused a $ 7.2 billion loss , Mr. Kerviel ’s former bosses at Société Générale , one of France ’s oldest and most venerated banks , portrayed him as a “ brilliant ” trader who eluded sophisticated detection systems .
Bat die - off in Northeast baffles scientists Mystery ailment spreads fast in caves in N.Y. and Vermont
Bats in New York and Vermont are mysteriously dying off by the thousands , often with a white ring of fungus around their noses , and scientists in hazmat suits are crawling into dank caves to find out why .
" White nose syndrome , " as the killer has been called , is spreading at an alarming rate , with researchers calling it the gravest threat in memory to bats in the United States .
" This is definitely unprecedented , " said Lori Pruitt , an endangered - species biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Bloomington , Ind .
" The hugest concern at this point is that we do not know what it is . "
A significant loss of bats is chilling in itself to wildlife experts .
But - like the mysterious mass die - offs around the country of bees that pollinate all sorts of vital fruits and vegetables - the bat deaths could have economic implications .
Bats feed on insects that can damage dozens of crops , including wheat and apples .
" Without large populations of bats , there would certainly be an impact on agriculture , " said Barbara French of Bat Conservation International of Austin , Texas .
White nose syndrome has afflicted at least four species of hibernating bats , spreading from a cluster of four caves near Albany last winter to more than a dozen caverns up to 130 miles away .
Alan Hicks , a wildlife biologist with the New York Department of Environmental Conservation , said he fears a catastrophic collapse of the region 's bat population and is urgently enlisting experts around the country to find the cause .
It is not even clear if the fungus around the bats ' noses - something scientists say they have never seen before - is a cause or a symptom .
It may be a sign the bats are too sick to groom themselves , said Beth Buckles , a veterinary pathologist at Cornell University .
The die - offs could be caused by bacteria or a virus .
Or the bats could be reacting to some toxin or other environmental factor .
Whatever it is , afflicted bats are burning through their winter stores of fat before hibernation ends in the spring , and appear to be starving .
The Northeast has generally had mild winters in recent years .
But Hicks said he doubts that is the culprit in some way , since there are no reports of large die - offs in warmer states .
Nor are there any known links between what is wiping out the bees and what is killing the bats .
The cause of the bee deaths is still a mystery , though scientists are looking at pesticides , parasites and a virus not previously seen in the United States .
Researchers said there is no evidence the mysterious killer is any threat to humans .
Scientists venturing into the caves wear hazardous - materials suits and breathing masks primarily to protect the bats , not themselves .
Hicks said it is possible that a cave explorer introduced the problem in the Albany - area caves and that it spread from there .
" It could have been some caver in Tanzania with a little mud on his boot , and a week later he 's in a cave in New York , " he said .
New York officials are asking people to stay out of bat caves in case humans are unwittingly spreading the problem .
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is asking people not to enter caves with gear or clothing used in any New York and Vermont cave within the past two years .
The first inkling of trouble came in January 2007 , when a cave explorer spotted an unusual number of bat carcasses around the mouth of a cave in the hills west of Albany .
Within a month , people in the area were calling in with reports of bats flying outside in the middle of the day .
" We did n't know anything other than bats were coming out , and they were just dying on the landscape , " Hicks said .
" They were crashing into snowbanks , crawling into woodpiles and dying . "
By winter 's end , 8,000 to 11,000 bats were presumed dead in the four caves .
The mystery affliction has spread much farther this winter .
Death counts are not in yet for this winter since afflicted bats die slowly .
But Hicks said there are 200,000 or more bats hibernating in caves where white nose has been detected .
Hicks recently led a team of scientists into an abandoned mine in the Hudson Valley town of Rosendale , about 80 miles north of New York City .
He directed his headlamp on a cluster of seven brown bats , smaller than mice , hanging high on the limestone wall .
Four had the telltale white flecks on their muzzles .
He tapped one of the afflicted bats with a long stick , and it fell , already dead .
Another groggily spread its papery wings on Hicks ' gloved hand .
The sickly bat was put into a cardboard takeout - soup container to be put to death and studied , since it was doomed anyway .
A group of Indiana bats , a federally protected endangered species , was spotted hanging lower down in the mine for cooler air , a common strategy for sick bats .
Hicks whispered grimly : " These guys are toast . "
As record labels are dramatically increasing lawsuits over music piracy , a University of Arkansas law professor argues that the law 's automatic punishment of illegal downloading violates the First Amendment .
In his recent article , " Copytraps , " assistant professor Ned Snow emphasizes that Internet users who mistakenly believe that it is legal to download music from a Web site - when , in fact , it is illegal - face harsh penalties for downloading .
If a copyright holder has not authorized the downloading , regardless of a Web site 's representations or appearance , the downloader is liable and can be fined a minimum of $ 750 per downloaded song .
This automatic punishment , Snow argues , represents a penalty for innocent Internet users who have no means to know that the material offered on a Web site infringes a copyright .
Internet users face a sort of " copytrap " when they encounter a Web site that falsely represents the downloading as legal .
With no way to know whether a Web site 's representation is true , a downloader is likely to be deceived and thus face harsh penalties under the law .
" The very potential for copytraps , with automatic penalties assessed against the innocent downloader , raises First Amendment concern , " Snow said .
" The First Amendment comes into play because downloading is a form of speech .
Downloading is the same as copying , and copying is a form of expression . "
Because downloading is a form of expression , the First Amendment protects the act of downloading when the downloader has permission to make a copy .
Snow contends that the First Amendment protects the act of legal downloading .
Legal downloading , however , is chilled by the potential for " copytraps , " Snow argues .
The automatic and severe punishment of innocent downloaders makes Internet users reluctant to download material that seems legal .
" Internet users who are aware of the law or who have fallen victim to a ' copytrap , ' are much more wary of sites purporting to offer legal downloads , " Snow said .
This reluctance or wariness is the essence of Snow 's argument , that " copytraps " may inhibit users from downloading legal material , and that inhibition represents a restraint on speech protected by the First Amendment .
Furthermore , Snow says that most Internet users trust Web sites to determine the legality of downloading .
" Most Internet users continue to download without inhibition , " he said .
" We have n't seen significant decreases in legal downloading .
But that fact does n't matter in the eyes of the law .
First Amendment law makes it clear that the possibility of inhibition is sufficient to find a law unconstitutional .
And that possibility is glaringly evident in the download context . "
Snow points out that the automatic punishment of copyright law applies to whatever expression may be downloaded .
Stories , pictures and videos are all subject to strict punishment under copyright law .
Given that the very structure of the World Wide Web is predicated on users ' ability to copy or download , the potential for punishing innocent downloaders is vast .
Snow says that the extent of risks that Internet users assume by downloading is only beginning to be seen , as illustrated by the recent EMI v. Thomas case , in which a federal jury delivered a $ 222,000 verdict against a 30 - year - old Minnesota woman for file - sharing .
According to the New York Times , since 2003 record labels have threatened lawsuits against approximately 30,000 people .
Many settle out of court for , on average , about $ 4,000 , as indicated by a record - industry trade association .
Snow 's article is available for free download at ssrn.com/abstract=1019577 .
It is presently under review for publication .

For the first time in the nation ’s history , more than one in 100 American adults is behind bars , according to a new report .
Nationwide , the prison population grew by 25,000 last year , bringing it to almost 1.6 million .
Another 723,000 people are in local jails .
The number of American adults is about 230 million , meaning that one in every 99.1 adults is behind bars .
Incarceration rates are even higher for some groups .
One in 36 Hispanic adults is behind bars , based on Justice Department figures for 2006 .
One in 15 black adults is , too , as is one in nine black men between the ages of 20 and 34 .
The report , from the Pew Center on the States , also found that only one in 355 white women between the ages of 35 and 39 are behind bars but that one in 100 black women are .
I think this is a temporary offer only , and I do n't have many more details than what is in the product page , but it looks like Acer is making a limited laptop series available now with Ubuntu Linux pre-loaded .
You just have to go to a Dick Smith store and look for product code .
The picture here is the same as the one on the site , but I am told it 's not exactly the same as the model being offered .
They are some late 2004 Acer Aspire 4315 - 100508 Ci models , based on an Intel Celeron M 540 1.86 GHz Processor , 512MB DDR2 RAM , 80 GB 5400 RPM SATA HDD , 14.1 " Widescreen Display , DVD +CDRW Combo Drive , Intel Media Accelerator X3100 Graphics Card and wireless LAN .
The laptops are running Ubuntu 7.10 .
What 's more interesting is the price : NZ $ 699 , making it a great value when compared to the ASUS Eee PC , which has only a 4 GB flash memory for storage and costs the same .
This should be a good introduction to Linux machines if you do n't feel inclined to install this system on your own hardware .

School Suggests Students Who Support Gay Rights Are an " Illegal Organization "
PONCE DE LEON , FL - A Florida high school has been trampling the First Amendment rights of students who support equal rights for gay people , according to a federal lawsuit filed today by the American Civil Liberties Union .
In its lawsuit , the ACLU described an atmosphere of fear and censorship at Ponce de Leon High School , where the school board 's attorney says even expressions like a rainbow sticker may mean students are members of an " illegal organization . "
" All any of us wants to do is be able to talk about gay rights issues without having to be scared , " said Heather Gillman , a 16 - year - old junior at the school .
" Nobody should have to worry about being kicked out of school just for having a rainbow sticker on your notebook . "
The ACLU sent a letter in November to the school board 's attorney on behalf of Gillman , asking for clarification as to whether a variety of symbols and slogans , such as the rainbow flag or " I support my gay friends , " would be allowed at the school .
The school district replied that it would not allow any expressions of support for gay rights at all because such speech would " likely be disruptive . "
The district then went even further , claiming that such symbols and slogans were signs that students were part of a " secret / illegal organization . "
The letter was sent after Gillman and other students approached the ACLU about an atmosphere in which students say they were routinely intimidated by school officials for things like writing " gay pride " on their arms and notebooks or wearing rainbow - themed clothing .
According to students , problems began in September when a lesbian student tried to report to school officials that she was being harassed by other students because she is a lesbian .
Instead of addressing the harassment , students say the school responded with intimidation and censorship .
" Because the Supreme Court has held that students have a right to free speech at school unless that speech disrupts the educational process , many administrators think they can just slap the label ‘ disruptive ' on anything they do n't like and get away with stomping on students '
First Amendment rights .
The law does n't work that way , " said Benjamin James Stevenson , a staff attorney for the ACLU of Florida .

US Inflation Understated in Official Statistics - Prices are the Cart , Money Supply is the Horse
The sad truth is that despite the best efforts of monetary economists everywhere , fundamental misconceptions about inflation remain entrenched in government , business , and the media .
In an exchange earlier this week on CNBC , a guest explained that rising oil prices can not cause inflation because prices for other goods must fall as spending is diverted to pay for more expensive oil .
That explanation prompted host Becky Quick to ask : “ If rising oil prices do not cause inflation , then what does ? ”
Since that question was left unanswered on the air , I thought I would take the time to answer it here .
Inflation has only one cause and that is the Federal Reserve itself .
In the United States , the supply of money and credit is regulated by the Fed .
Since inflation is by definition an increase in the supply of money and credit , only the Fed can create it .
If the money supply were held constant , increases in some prices would be offset by decreases in others .
The result would be no overall inflation .
In fact , without government created expansions of the money supply , the natural tendency of prices would be to decline as technology allowed for more efficient production of goods and services .
So while most regard the Fed as the primary inflation fighter , in reality it is the sole inflation creator .
The main problem for consumers is that most inflation is not detected by the Fed 's preferred measuring tools .
As a result , inflation has been allowed to grow unchallenged .
For example , on Wednesday the government told us that consumer prices as measured by the CPI rose by only 2.8 % over the past year .
My estimate is that the actual rise was at least three times as great .
The report showed that energy prices only rose by only 5.3 % .
Given that crude oil prices are up over 35 % and heating oil prices are up 20 % during that time period , how is it possible that energy prices are up only 5 % ?
Are other energy costs falling to compensate -- firewood perhaps ?
The same CPI report claimed that medical costs rose by 4.6 % .
As a small business owner , I can't remember the last time my company 's health insurance premiums rose less than 5 % per year , and they typically rise at an annual rate of more than twice that .
Perhaps the most incredulous of all the data in this week 's CPI report is that food prices only rose by 4.5 % during the past year .
I do n't know where the guys at the Bureau of Labor Statistics buy their groceries , but I 'm spending at least 15 % - 20 % more for food this year than last .
Wheat prices alone have practically doubled in the past year !
The last time I checked , people tend to eat a lot of wheat .
Does anyone really believe food prices are only up 4.5 % ?
As the U.S. dollar weakens , a few analysts are beginning to wonder whether we will now be “ importing ” inflation as the cost of imported goods rises to reflect the lower value of the dollar .
Once again , Wall Street still does n't get it .
Our inflation problem is home grown .
The reason the dollar is losing value in the first place is that we are creating too many of them .
Since our biggest export is U.S. dollars , which foreign central banks have been foolishly monetizing , if anything it is our nation that exports its inflation to the rest of the world .
My guess is that right now inflation is already as bad as anything we experienced back in the 1970's .
Some may argue that rising prices for food and energy are being offset by falling prices for such things as cell phones , iPods , digital cameras , plasma TV , etc .
However , back in the 1970's , prices for similar items , such as television sets , clock radios , digital watches , calculators , etc. were also falling in price .
However , despite such price declines , the more honest CPI yardsticks we used at that time still recorded double digit annual gains .
Still , the intoxicating effects that inflation has on nominal asset prices and GDP figures will eventually fade .
When this happens Wall Street will sober up to the reality that the U.S. economy has actually been mired in recession for years , and that U.S. stocks have been in a stealth bear market all along .
Priced in gold , euros , or Canadian dollars , ( which are more accurate ways to adjust for inflation than phony government numbers ) both the U.S. stock market and U.S. GDP have declined by approximately 58 % , 17 % and 21 % respectively since January 2000 .
No wonder the government and Wall Street hang their hats on official inflation measures .
Like a student allowed to grade his own report card , he can ditch his classes , not do his homework , flunk his exams , yet still bring home straight A's .
As long as Wall Street and the media continue to represent government inflation numbers as if they had any validity whatsoever , inflation is only going to get worse .

24 Apr 08 , 14:24 2007 Inflation
For work purposes I need to know the Inflation of 2007 in the US .
Not the CPI , but the Inflation .
Any idea of the real number ?
and source ?
Thank you in advance .

12 May 08 , 12:27 Excellent explanation of Inflation
You really hit the nail on the head .
I completely agree that inflation is consistently understated and that the Fed is greatly responsible for the deterioration of the dollar .
This issue is never brought up in main stream media and the vast majority of Americans are completely in the dark when it comes to understanding the causes of inflation and how it works .
Carmella DeCesare Sexiest Athlete Wife 2007 ( PHOTOS )
, Playboy Miss April 2003 and Playmate of the Year 2004 , married Tampa Bay Buccaneers NFL quarterbackin April 2007 .
She was recently named Sexiest Athlete Wife of 2007 bymagazine online .
Runners up includedwifeand 's wife ,
The model and former WWE diva had a brush with the law back in 2004 , when she was arrested for assaulting another women in a bar catfight .
The assaulted woman , Kristen Hine , had previously dated Jeff Garcia and had placed a restraining order against DeSesare .
The model ended up doing 24 hours of community service , was put on one year of probation and payed a small fine .
DeCesare is said to have put her Playboy modeling behind her now that she has married Garcia .
She would like to get a job with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers organization doing sideline interviews .
The couple are expecting their first child in April .
No story about Carmella would be complete without some gorgeous photos on next page .

It was a genius who thought of in - theater advertising .
There is a captive audience and the large theater screen is hard to ignore .
And unlike other mediums , depending on the movie , it can be assured that the advertising will reach intended audiences .
Which is why the National Guard is running advertising during some of the more popular blockbuster movies .
I was surprised , though , by my reaction to the new National Guard / Three Doors Down music video - cum - advertisement .
I was upset , visibly so .
Why ?
The military cannot afford to give armor to soldiers in Iraq or give proper medical care for the wounded , yet they are paying Three Doors Down to cavort in a music video in an advertisement ?
How much money was wasted providing for their large entourage during the filming of this music video ?
I froze my ass off in Iraq because there were not enough winter coats to keep my squad warm , yet they have the resources to dump on a very slick advertisement ?
Not to mention that it is tax - payer money that is funding this .
Thank you , Uncle Sam , I am glad to know where your priorities lie .
Stocks fell sharply today , led lower by the financial sector , with the Dow Jones industrial average declining more than 200 points and closing below 13,000 .
It was the Dow ’s lowest close since the depth of the markets ’ plunge in August .
The retreat started after Citigroup was downgraded to “ sell ” by a Goldman Sachs analyst , who warned that the company ’s write - downs of assets tied to complex debt instruments could reach $ 15 billion by the end of next year ’s first quarter .
Citi has already announced $ 8 billion to $ 11 billion in fourth - quarter write - downs .
The analyst ’s report hit a raw nerve among investors , reigniting fears of a credit squeeze as financial giants struggle to dig out from poor bets on securities tied to subprime home loans .
Shares of all the top brokerage firms were down , keeping pace with a 17.6 percent plunge for financial companies for the year .
Citi ’s stock dipped 5.9 percent , to $ 32 , near a four - year low .
Staggering financials dragged down the Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index , which dipped 1.8 percent to 1,433.27 .
The Dow closed down 218.35 , or 1.7 percent , at 12,958.44 .
Basic Techniques and Personal Impressions
Like hot - air balloons , cluster balloons are flown in the very early morning , when winds are calm .
In some areas , it is also possible to fly in the evening , in the hour or two before sunset .
Preparations for a morning flight flight start before dawn .
The balloons range in size from four to seven feet ; depending on the mix of sizes , anywhere from 50 to 150 balloons may be needed .
It takes a crew of fiften to twenty people about an hour and a half to inflate the balloons .
Special hoses and manifolds are used to inflate the balloons to the desired size , based on the volume of the helium tanks .
The inflated balloons are sealed using tape and cable ties , and are tied with nylon twine .
You watch the balloons swell and sway and grow taut and huge in the darkness , then get attached to their strings and tied down to sandbags , like a field of giant flowers blossoming there in the dark .
There 's a lot for everyone to do .
It 's wonderful to have friends who will drive out into the countryside in the middle of the night , just to help you fly !
After all the balloons are inflated and secured to sand bags , the cluster balloons is " assembled " .
Simply attaching all the balloons directly to the pilot would result in tangled strings , making it difficult to reliably cut away balloons for maneuvering .
Instead , the balloon are attached in groups of four or more to the ends of long nylon straps called risers ; the risers are then attached to the pilot 's harness .
Different length risers are used to hold the balloons at different heights , in layers .
More balloons are attached directly to the pilot 's harness .
There 's a sense of anticipation as the balloons are attached to you , and you grow lighter and lighter .
The balloons are so big , it 's like being a child again , and small .
You 're paying attention to the details , making sure everything is being rigged correctly .
But even after you 've done it many times before , there 's still something a bit unreal to it .
You wonder : am I really doing this ?
The pilot is in a harness designed for paragliding , which includes a rear - mounted emergency parachute .
The pilot can stand up in the harness to take off or land ; there 's also a little seat built into it , for greater comfort while flying .
Bags of water ballast hang beside the pilot , and are used to maneuvering ( see below ) .
The pilot also carries an altimeter / rate - of - climb instrument , a GPS and a two - way radio .
After you go through your checklist of equipment , the crew attaches the last of the balloons to your arms , legs and feet .
It 's not necessary to attach them that way -- it 's just fun to feel the pull of the balloon strings wrapped around your hands , and the weightless sensation of your legs being pulled out behind you , with your toes just brushing the ground ....
With the pilot tethered to the ground , the amount of ballast is adjusted so that the cluster balloon is just slightly buoyant , with just a pound or two of net lift .
This allows for an initial rate of ascent of 100 - 200 feet per minute .
Crew prepare to release the ground tether at the pilot 's signal .
The tether is released , and up you go ....
The ground below drops away .
If you 're at a balloon festival , the crowd is cheering for you , and you wave to them .
And your balloons lift you smoothly and silently into the sky .
To control the altitude of the cluster balloon , the pilot takes off with more balloons than needed to lift his or her weight , and carries ballast ( water or sand ) to balance out most of this excess lift .
To level out or descend , the pilot releases or bursts balloons .
To slow the descent or ascend again , the pilot releases ballast .
The number of times the cluster balloon can ascend or descend is limited by the amount of ballast and extra balloons carried .
The balloon may also gain a certain amount of lift during the flight due to solar heating of the balloons .
Dropping ballast to make yourself lighter , you let the balloons lift you higher and higher .
A cluster balloon moves in whatever direction the wind carries it .
However , as in a hot - air balloon , the direction of flight in a cluster balloon can be controlled to some degree by using the different wind directions that exist at different altitudes .
During the early morning , it is not uncommon to have a variety of different wind directions available at different altitudes , so a good amount of " steering " may be possible .
Launching a toy balloon prior to flying allows the pilot to see the wind directions that exist at different altitudes , in order to plan the flight .
During the flight , the pilot can watch any nearby hot - air balloons , to note their direction of motion at different altitudes .
A portable GPS unit is also useful .
There 's nothing as serene and beautiful as floating a mile or two above the earth with a huge , colorful balloon bouquet .
To make best use of the limited number of changes in rate of ascent / descent available , the pilot often starts the flight by an ascent to altitude , noting the wind directions at different altitudes on the way up .
Latex balloon clusters have been flown as high as 20,000 feet ; however , for a recreational flight , a maximum altitude of 3,000 - 5,000 feet is more common .
After reaching the maximum desired altitude .
the pilot levels out , and then descends to the altitude that had the wind direction that will take him in the direction he desires .
Usually , the pilot tries to head away from cities and particularly airports , toward areas where there are suitable fields for landing and good road access for the chase crew .
The pilot may change altitude several more times during the flight to adjust course .
You float over the clouds .
A hot - air balloon flies alongside you .
You drift over hills and valleys , over woods and orchards .
On approach to landing , the pilot levels out at 100 feet or less , heading in the direction of an appropriate field or open area .
The chase crew is directed out ahead of the balloon to meet it at landing .
This is the most challenging part of the flight , since the greatest risk of injury is from striking powerlines or other obstacles at landing .
Considerations in landing are similar to those in a hot - air balloon , except that it is more difficult to rapidly change rate of ascent or descent , and the number of landing attempts is limited by the available ballast .
If crew are present at landing , they can easily stop the motion of the balloon by grabbing the pilot 's harness , or by use of a drop line .
If crew are not present , the pilot can land and stabilize the balloon by himself in light winds .
In windier conditions , the pilot may have to cut away or burst many balloons to stop from dragging .
Coming in over the trees , ready to throw a drop line to the crew , who you hope are there -- it 's not more than 10 mph of wind , but you really do n't want to drag several hundred feet at 10 mph through a cornfield ....
And there they are , and you thrown the line , and someone grabs it and slows you down , and you burst a few balloons to drop in gently to the ground .
It 's good to be on the ground .
After the flight , the balloons are deflated .
Some types of latex balloons are safely reusable for several flights ; others can only be used once .
Balloons that are being discarded are burst rather than released , for environmental reasons and to avoid creating a hazard to aircraft .
Before putting things away , if you 've landed somewhere suitable and the wind has not come up , it 's fun to let everyone on the crew get into the harness go up on tether .
A few of them are a little apprehensive , but everyone is smiling by the time they 're done .
And then you deflate the balloons , and put everything away , already thinking about the next time you will fly .

I do n't really know what to say about this PIA press ad from a bygone era ...
Except , remember when you could do bold graphic image solutions in advertising without offending anyone ?
Yeah , neither can I .

BAGHDAD – Women are being killed by militia groups in southern Iraq for not conforming to strict Islamic ways , the police say .
And increased threats from militia groups are driving many women away from their homes .
Basra police chief Gen. Jalil Hannoon has told reporters and Arab TV channels that at least 40 women have been killed during the past five months in the southern city .
" We are sure there are many more victims whose families did not report their killing for fear of scandal , " Hannoon said .
The militias dominated by the Shia Badr Organization and the Mahdi Army are leading imposition of strict Islamic rules .
The enforcement of these rules comes at a time when British troops have left Basra , the biggest town in the south , to the Iraqi government .
The Shia - dominated Iraqi government is seen as providing tacit and sometimes direct support to militias .
The Badr Organization answers to the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council ( SIIC ) , the Shia bloc in the Iraqi government .
The Mahdi army is the militia of anti-occupation Shia cleric Moqtada al - Sadr .
Women who do not wear the hijab are becoming prime targets of militias , residents say .
Many women say they are threatened with death if they do not obey .
" Militiamen approached us to tell us we must wear the hijab and stop wearing make - up , " college student Zahra Alwan , who fled Basra for Baghdad , recently told IPS .
" They are imitating the Iranian Revolution Guards , and we believe they receive orders from the Islamic Republic [ of Iran ] to do so . "
Graffiti in red on walls across Basra warns women against wearing make - up and stepping out without covering their bodies from head to toe , Alwan said .
" The situation in Baghdad is not very different , " Mazin Abdul Jabbar , a social researcher at Baghdad University , told IPS .
" All universities are controlled by Islamic militiamen who harass female students all the time with religious restrictions . "
Jabbar said this is one reason that " many families have stopped sending their daughters to high schools and colleges . "
Earlier this year Iraq ’s Ministry of Education found that more than 70 percent of girls and young women no longer attend school or college .
Several female victims were accused of being " bad " before they were abducted , residents say .
Most abducted women are later found dead .
The bodies of several were found in garbage dumps , showing signs of rape and torture .
Several bodies had a note attached saying the woman was " bad , " according to several residents who did not give their name .
A Shia cleric in Baghdad spoke to IPS on the condition of anonymity to defend such killings .
" We are an Islamic country and we must commit to the restrictions of our religion , " he said .
" We must not allow corruption to invade our families under the flag of freedom and such nonsense . "
Sunni clerics offered a different view .
" It is against Islamic regulations for women to expose their hair and bodies , " Sheik Tariq al - Abdaly told IPS in Baghdad .
" But this is not an Islamic state , and so all we can do is to advise women , same as we advise men , to follow those regulations .
In any case , punishment for such mistakes should certainly be much less than execution . "
Iraqi liberals are deeply frustrated by the lack of personal freedom .
" We are so disappointed with the loss of what there was of Iraqi women ’s achievements under a regime [ of former president Saddam Hussein ] that we saw as retarded , " Salim Mahmood of the Iraqi Communist Party in Baghdad told IPS .
" The Americans promised they would make Iraq a symbol of liberty and prosperity .
Now it has neither . "
Human behavior is notoriously complex , and there 's been no shortage of psychologists and psychological theories venturing to explain what makes us tick .
Why do we get irrationally jealous ?
Or have midlife crises ?
Why do we overeat to our own detriment ?
Why do we find ourselves often strongly attracted to certain physical traits ?
Numerous theories abound , but few are perhaps as novel and thought - provoking as those suggested by a new book with a long title : Why Beautiful People Have More Daughters : From Dating , Shopping , and Praying to Going to War and Becoming a Billionaire -- Two Evolutionary Psychologists Explain Why We Do What We Do. Written by Satoshi Kanazawa and Alan S. Miller , the book finds answers not in ids , egos and superegos , but in the evolution of the human brain .
Written in snappy prose , their argument is essentially that our behavior — our wants , desires and impulses — are overwhelmingly shaped by the way our brain evolved 10,000 + years ago , and one consequence is that our ancestral brain is often responding to a world long ago disappeared , not the modern , fast - changing world in which we live .
This disconnect can lead us to be out of sync , to act in ways that seem inexplicable or counter - productive , even to ourselves .
These arguments belong to new field called " evolutionary psychology , " and we were fortunate to interview Satoshi Kanazawa ( London School of Economics ) and delve further into evolutionary psychology and the ( sometimes dispiriting ) issues it raises .
Have a read , check out the book , and also see the related piece that the Freakonomics folks recently did on this book .
Please note that the full interview continues after the jump .
DC : In a nutshell , what is “ evolutionary psychology ” ?
( e.g. when did the field emerge ?
what are the basic tenets / principles of this school of thinking ? )
SK : Evolutionary psychology is the application of evolutionary biology to human cognition and behavior .
For more than a century , zoologists have successfully used the unifying principles of evolution to explain the body and behavior of all animal species in nature , except for humans .
Scientists held a special place for humans and made an exception for them .
In 1992 , a group of psychologists and anthropologists simply asked , “ Why not ?
Why ca n’t we use the principles of evolution to explain human behavior as well ? ”
And the new science of evolutionary psychology was born .
It is premised on two grand generalizations .
First , all the laws of evolution by natural and sexual selection hold for humans as much as they do for all species in nature .
Second , the contents of the human brain have been shaped by the forces of evolution just as much as every other part of human body .
In other words , humans are animals , and as such they have been shaped by evolutionary forces just as other animals have been .
DC : Evolutionary psychology portrays us as having impulses that took form long ago , in a very pre-modern context ( say , 10,000 years ago ) , and now these impulses are sometimes rather ill - adapted to our contemporary world .
For example , in a food - scarce environment , we became programmed to eat whenever we can ; now , with food abounding in many parts of the world , this impulse creates the conditions for an obesity epidemic .
Given that our world will likely continue changing at a rapid pace , are we doomed to have our impulses constantly playing catch up with our environment , and does that potentially doom us as a species ?
SK : In fact , we ’re not playing catch up ; we ’re stuck .
For any evolutionary change to take place , the environment has to remain more or less constant for many generations , so that evolution can select the traits that are adaptive and eliminate those that are not .
When the environment undergoes rapid change within the space of a generation or two , as it has been for the last couple of millennia , if not more , then evolution ca n’t happen because nature can’t determine which traits to select and which to eliminate .
So they remain at a standstill .
Our brain ( and the rest of our body ) are essentially frozen in time -- stuck in the Stone Age .
One example of this is that when we watch a scary movie , we get scared , and when we watch porn we get turned on .
We cry when someone dies in a movie .
Our brain cannot tell the difference between what ’s simulated and what ’s real , because this distinction did n’t exist in the Stone Age .
DC : One conclusion from your book is that we 're something of a prisoner to our hard - wiring .
Yes , there is some room for us to maneuver .
But , in the end , our evolved nature takes over .
If all of this holds true , is there room in our world for utopian ( or even mildly optimistic ) political movements that look to refashion how humans behave and interact with one another ?
Or does this science suggest that Edmund Burke was on to something ?
SK : Steven Pinker , in his 2002 book The Blank Slate , makes a very convincing argument that all Utopian visions , whether they be motivated by left - wing ideology or right - wing ideology , are doomed to failure , because they all assume that human nature is malleable .
Evolutionary psychologists have discovered that the human mind is not a blank slate , a tabula rasa ; humans have innate biological nature as much as any other species does , and it is not malleable .
Paul H. Rubin ’s 2002 book Darwinian Politics :
The Evolutionary Origin of Freedom gives an evolutionary psychological account of why Burke and classical liberals ( who are today called libertarians ) may have been right .
As a scientist , I am not interested in Utopian visions ( or any other visions for society ) .
But it seems to me that , if you want to change the world successfully , you cannot start from false premises .
Any such attempt is bound to fail .
If you build a house on top of a lake on the assumption that water is solid , it will inevitably collapse and sink to the bottom of the lake , but if you recognize the fluid nature of water , you can build a successful houseboat .
A houseboat may not be as good as a genuine house built on ground , but it ’s better than a collapsed house on the bottom of the lake .
A vision for society based on an evolutionary psychological understanding of human nature at least has a fighting chance , which is a much better than any Utopian vision based on the assumption that human nature is infinitely malleable .
DC : So give us a hint .
Why do beautiful people actually have more daughters ?
SK : The basic idea is this :
Whenever parents have genetic traits they can pass on to their children that are more valuable for boys than for girls , then they have more sons than daughters .
Conversely , whenever parents have genetic traits they can pass on to their children that are more valuable for girls than for boys , then they have more daughters than sons .
Physical attractiveness -- being beautiful -- is good for both boys and girls , but it ’s much more advantageous for girls .
Physical attractiveness of a woman is one of the most important considerations for men when they select both long - term and short - term mates , but a man ’s physical attractiveness is important for women only when she ’s looking for short - term mates .
Women like to have affairs with good - looking men , but they do n’t necessarily want to marry them , unless of course they are also rich and powerful .
So beautiful daughters will be more likely to take full advantage of their physical attractiveness than beautiful sons .
Beautiful daughters are more likely to pass on their genes successfully to the next generation than beautiful sons , because they are more likely to find themselves in stable marriages to desirable spouses .
In a representative sample of 3,000 young Americans , those who are “ very attractive ” had 36 % greater odds of having a daughter compared to everyone else .
Similarly , studies have found that big and tall parents are more likely to have sons , and short and thin parents are more likely to have daughters , because body size is more of an advantage to men than to women .
Women are attracted to big and tall men much more than men are attracted to big and tall women .
DC : In the book you debunk the notion of “ midlife crisis . ”
Why ?
SK : We do n’t debunk its existence ; we believe it exists .
But we suggest that it might exist for different reasons than people think .
Midlife crisis is a mystery for evolutionary psychology , because there is really no reason for middle - aged men to change their behavior suddenly when they reach middle age .
So we speculate in the book that middle - aged men may engage in a constellation of behavior which we associate with the phrase “ midlife crisis , ” not because they are middle - aged , but because their wives are .
When their wives reach menopause , it means that , not only is the wife ’s reproductive career over , but so is the husband ’s , unless , of course , he can find a younger mate to replace ( or , as often happened throughout evolutionary history , add to , since humans are naturally polygynous ) the menopausal wife .
We believe that “ midlife crisis ” might be a reflection of middle - aged men ’s attempt to attract younger women because their wives are no longer reproductive .
So we hypothesize that a 50 - year - old man married to a 25 - year - old wife will not undergo midlife crisis , whereas a ( very rare ) 25 - year - old man married to a 50 - year - old wife will .
And , of course , evolutionary psychology can explain why there are very few young men married to middle - aged women .
If you want to know , you have to read the book !
DC : Finally , what are some of the remaining mysteries in evolutionary psychology ?
Are there things that you still do n’t know , questions for which you still do n’t have answers ?
SK : There are many questions for which we do n’t yet have answers .
We devote our last chapter to discussing some of these questions .
For example , why do most middle - class people in western industrial nations have so few children ?
Most middle - class Americans can easily raise five or six children , and feed , clothe , and shelter them all very well .
Yet most couples only want ( and have ) two children .
This is a mystery for evolutionary psychology .
A related mystery is the fact that there seems to be a genetic transmission of fertility from parents to children , so that parents who have many siblings tend also to have many children themselves .
This makes absolutely no sense from an evolutionary psychological perspective .
If your parents had many children , that means you have many brothers and sisters who carry some of your genes , so you can afford not to have many children yourself .
Conversely , if you are an only child , nobody else besides you carries half of your genes , so you have to have many children to spread your genes , to compensate for your parents ’ lack of reproductive success .
So there should really be a negative correlation between your parents ' fertility and your own , but all the demographic studies show that the correlation is positive .
Only children tend to beget only children .
This is a mystery .
Sir Edmund Hillary was made an honorary Nepalese citizen

Trust has helped build hospitals , clinics , bridges , airstrips and nearly 30 schools .
He was made an honorary Nepalese citizen in 2003 .
Prayer ceremonies are being held in Nepal to pay tribute to Sir Edmund , the charity says .
' Quintessential Kiwi '
Announcing Sir Edmund 's death in Auckland after a brief illness , New Zealand 's prime minister described him as a " heroic figure who not only ' knocked off '
Everest but lived a life of determination , humility and generosity " .
Before reaching base camp , ascent team walked 175 miles ( 282 km ) from Kathmandu and spent three weeks acclimatising On May 26 initial attempt came within 300 ft ( 91 m ) of summit , with final bid two days later Five man team helped Hillary and Norgay to precarious point high up mountain where pair spent night in tent Next morning they set out at 0630 , reaching summit 1130 Source : Royal Geographical Society
" The legendary mountaineer , adventurer , and philanthropist is the best - known New Zealander ever to have lived , " Ms Clark said in a statement .
" But most of all he was a quintessential Kiwi . "
" He was ours - from his craggy appearance to laconic style to his directness and honesty .
All New Zealanders will deeply mourn his passing . "
Ms Clark said Sir Edmund 's exploits would " continue to inspire new generations of New Zealanders , as they have for more than half a century already " .
The BBC's Greg Ward in Auckland says Sir Edmund was arguably the most respected man in New Zealand .
His death has prompted an immediate outpouring of sympathy , with messages of condolences flooding in from around the globe , our correspondent says .
Tenzing Norgay 's son called the death a great loss for humanity .
Race to the summit
The British adventurer and environmentalist , Pen Hadow , said Sir Edmund 's death " closes one of the great chapters of planetary exploration " .
" He was physically and metaphorically at the pinnacle of high adventure , " the Dartmoor - based Arctic and Antarctic explorer told the Press Association .
Born in Auckland 19 July 1919 , Sir Edmund began climbing mountains in his native country as a teenager and soon earned renown as an ice climber .
To my great delight I realised we were on top of Mount Everest and that the whole world spread out below us
Sir Edmund Hillary
' My climb with Hillary ' Sir Edmund : Your tributes
By the time he attempted his ascent of Everest in 1953 as part of an expedition led by the British climber , Sir John Hunt , seven previous expeditions to the top of the mountain had failed .
After a gruelling climb up the southern face , battling the effects of high altitude and bad weather , Sir Edmund and Tenzing Norgay managed to reach the peak at 1130 local time on 29 May .
" I continued hacking steps along the ridge and then up a few more to the right ... to my great delight I realised we were on top of Mount Everest and that the whole world spread out below us , " Sir Edmund said .
The two men hugged each other with relief and joy but only stayed on the summit for 15 minutes because they were low on oxygen .
Sir Edmund took several photographs of the scenery and of Tenzing waving flags of Britain , Nepal , the UN and India .
News of the conquest of Everest did not reach the outside world until 2 June , the eve of the Queen Elizabeth II 's coronation .
He was knighted by the Queen for his achievement in 1953 , and 42 years later was awarded her highest award for chivalry - the Order of the Garter .
What factors are involved in creating a good business plan ?
Is it the length of the plan ?
The information it covers ?
How well it ’s written , or the brilliance of its strategy .
No .
The following illustration shows a business plan as part of a process .
You can think about the good or bad of a plan as the plan itself , measuring its value by its contents .
There are some qualities in a plan that make it more likely to create results , and these are important .
However , it is even better to see the plan as part of the whole process of results , because even a great plan is wasted if nobody follows it .
Planning is a process , not just a plan
A business plan will be hard to implement unless it is simple , specific , realistic and complete .
Even if it is all these things , a good plan will need someone to follow up and check on it .
The plan depends on the human elements around it , particularly the process of commitment and involvement , and the tracking and follow - up that comes afterward .
Successful implementation starts with a good plan .
There are elements that will make a plan more likely to be successfully implemented .
Some of the clues to implementation include :
Is the plan simple ?
Is it easy to understand and to act on ?
Does it communicate its contents easily and practically ?
Is the plan specific ?
Are its objectives concrete and measurable ?
Does it include specific actions and activities , each with specific dates of completion , specific persons responsible and specific budgets ?
Is the plan realistic ?
Are the sales goals , expense budgets , and milestone dates realistic ?
Nothing stifles implementation like unrealistic goals .
Is the plan complete ?
Does it include all the necessary elements ?
Requirements of a business plan vary , depending on the context .
There is no guarantee , however , that the plan will work if it does n’t cover the main bases .
Uses of business plans
Too many people think of business plans as something you do to start a company , apply for a loan , or find investors .
Yes , they are vital for those purposes , but there ’s a lot more to it .
Preparing a business plan is an organized , logical way to look at all of the important aspects of a business .
First , decide what you will use the plan for , such as to :
Define and fix objectives , and programs to achieve those objectives .
Create regular business review and course correction .
Define a new business .
Support a loan application .
Define agreements between partners .
Set a value on a business for sale or legal purposes .
Evaluate a new product line , promotion , or expansion .
No time to plan ?
A common misconception
“ Not enough time for a plan , ” business people say .
“ I ca n’t plan .
I ’m too busy getting things done . ”
A business plan now can save time and stress later .
Too many businesses make business plans only when they have to .
Unless a bank or investors want to look at a business plan , there is n’t likely to be a plan written .
The busier you are , the more you need to plan .
If you are always putting out fires , you should build fire breaks or a sprinkler system .
You can lose the whole forest for too much attention to the individual trees .
Keys to better business plans
Use a business plan to set concrete goals , responsibilities , and deadlines to guide your business .
A good business plan assigns tasks to people or departments and sets milestones and deadlines for tracking implementation .
A practical business plan includes 10 parts implementation for every one part strategy .
As part of the implementation of a business plan , it should provide a forum for regular review and course corrections .
Good business plans are practical .
Business plan “ don’ts ”
Do n’t use a business plan to show how much you know about your business .
Nobody reads a long - winded business plan : not bankers , bosses , nor venture capitalists .
Years ago , people were favorably impressed by long plans .
Today , nobody is interested in a business plan more than 50 pages long .

A federal judge in San Diego , California , sentenced defense contractor Brent Wilkes to 12 years in prison Tuesday for bribing then - Rep. Randy " Duke " Cunningham , federal prosecutors said .
Defense contractor Brent Wilkes at the federal courthouse in San Diego Tuesday .
A California jury found Wilkes guilty of bribery , conspiracy , money laundering and 10 counts of wire fraud in November .
He was accused of providing more than $ 700,000 to Cunningham in exchange for the Southern California Republican 's help steering more than $ 70 million in defense contracts to Wilkes and another contractor , Mitchell Wade .
In addition to handing down the prison term , U.S. District Judge Larry Burns ordered Wilkes to pay fines totaling more than $ 1.1 million , said Debra Hartman , a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney 's office in San Diego .
Wilkes ' lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
Prosecutors accused Wilkes , 53 , of paying off a $ 500,000 note on Cunningham 's California home ; picking up the tab for vacation outings , private jet travel and limousines ; buying Cunningham a $ 14,000 speedboat ; and having an employee line up prostitutes for himself and the lawmaker during a two - night stay in Hawaii .
Before pleading guilty to bribery in 2005 , Cunningham sat on a House Appropriations subcommittee that oversaw defense spending .
The one - time Navy fighter ace is serving an eight - year , four - month prison term and has been cooperating with federal agents .
Wade pleaded guilty to related charges in 2006 .
Wilkes and long - time friend Kyle " Dusty " Foggo , the former executive director of the CIA , also faced trial on charges Foggo corruptly pressured subordinates to award contracts to Wilkes and his company , ADCS Inc .
But prosecutors moved to dismiss the charges against Foggo in Tuesday 's hearing , and have agreed to let the case be transferred to a federal court in Virginia , where he lives .
Foggo resigned from the spy agency in 2006 , days before federal agents raided his home .
Prosecutors accuse Wilkes of providing him with " lavish " gifts , including a $ 44,000 stay at a castle in Scotland , in exchange for his influence .

Apart from The Pirate Bay guys , most tracker administrators are acutely aware of the risks they expose themselves to , and do everything they can to hide in the shadows .
We speak to a tracker owner to find out the kind of measures these guys take in order to protect their identities .
In most countries around the world , the legality of running a tracker is still uncertain , in that definitive court decisions have not been made .
Even in the US , the last two big trackers to be shut down , LokiTorrent and EliteTorrents , were n’t shut down by a court , but thanks to the mainstream media , public perception is that these sites are operating illegally .
The lawyers of the MPAA , RIAA and IFPI maintain they ’re illegal so that ’s often enough to cost an admin , if his identity is compromised , lots and lots of worry , and probably money too , regardless of his status under the law .
It seems that being an admin these days is more about keeping an identity secret rather than acting within the law , as more often than not , old fashioned threats take down torrent sites , not legal action .
TorrentFreak spoke to the admin of a BitTorrent tracker to find out how he stays safe , not sorry .
Introduction
“ I ’m fairly paranoid and I find that ’s a good start point ” he told us .
“ I ’m probably overly cautious , but if that ’s what it takes for me to sleep right , that ’s cool .
I ’m nothing special and not a huge target but I do n’t leave much to chance , even though I do n’t have much to worry about compared to the really big boys .
I do n’t claim to be an expert on security , I ’m self taught only , but I ’m happy to share my precautions with you ( and happy to hear from others on where I need to improve ! ) .
I know of admins who run their trackers from their parents residential ISP account with little extra care at all , so any protection is better than nothing ! ”
Below , our admin gives a breakdown of some of the measures he takes to stay safe .
Although an experienced security aware user might spot some holes in this series of measures , it ’s interesting to see the lengths to which people will go to protect themselves when seemingly , others take few precautions .
This article is entirely consistent with the admin ’s message , but at his insistence , it has been re-written by TorrentFreak :
Identity is Everything ,
If you never tell anyone , no - one will ever know
If the authorities / MPAA / RIAA do n’t know who I am or where I live , they ca n’t threaten me .
When I ’m working on the site I use either an encrypted connection via an Internet connection available in these premises ( my name is n’t on the bill , adding another layer of confusion ) , or a secure VPN over a local open wireless network .
For me , hiding my activities from any ISP accounts even remotely linked to me is important , as I do n’t want any ISP to be able corroborate anything specific about what I do .
If approached by a 3rd party for information ( with a request like “ can you confirm that such - and - such connected here at XX : XX time ” , for example ) , they know little or nothing about what I ’m doing , throwing any gathered evidence into doubt .
I think the recent OiNK bust was quite a wake up call .
I for one was laboring under the misconception that copyright issues are mainly civil and I really only thought through evading civil actions .
Once the police get involved , they can find out pretty much anything about you from anyone .
Thanks to what we learned about the OiNK bust , my improved security measures should save me from the police too , in the small chance they are interested in a relatively small fish like me .
Registering a Domain
The WHOIS for the site ’s main domain is protected , for that added layer of annoyance , although even this is n’t foolproof .
Our main domain name is n’t owned by anyone who has anything to do with the site , so it ’s pointless threatening that person , even if they find out who it is .
It might not stop them making threats so just in case the domain owner complies , other domain names point to our server too and every user is aware of these .
None of the domains are owned by me .
Paying for Stuff Online
When we need to pay for something we use disposable credit cards , and the same via PayPal .
We also have a few other PayPal accounts scattered around which we run unverified , then dump when PayPal start asking questions .
‘ We ’ is a term I ( we ! ) get into the habit of using often , it ’s less focused than ‘ I ’ .
Using Email
Use a few varied accounts and try not to ‘ cross contaminate ’ them by doing * any * personal stuff on them at all , site business * ONLY *!
If your email address typed into Google returns results other than to do with the site , you are taking risks .
Ideally a search would produce nothing at all .
In addition , I always hide my IP when I pick up or send email .
Security When Using Other Sites
They ’re not , but I act as if all file - sharing forums are insecure .
I work on the basis that someone on the staff could be a security risk so I make a policy of never discussing site business on other sites , unless I ’m asking general questions .
I ’d certainly never say “ I ’m the admin of etc- torrents , hi ! ” on an open forum and wherever possible I use other aliases .
Find a good host you can trust who does n’t ask for much verification of identity
Our site has had a few hosts since it began a few short years ago .
The first was a friend of a friend of a friend who accepted us with no formal contract or ‘ paperwork ’ , paid from any old PayPal account .
For a while we just got users to donate directly to the host which meant I did n’t need to get involved at all .
The second and third hosts were people who had established ( anonymous ) reseller accounts with big ISPs .
As long as they got their money , they did n’t ask any awkward questions like : ‘ What ’s your name and address and credit card number ? ’
I communicate with any host using disposable email addresses ( or something like Hushmail ) combined with some sort of anonymizing system previously mentioned .
I guess even more precautions could be taken , but time is time and we all have to do some productive work in the end !
Server Location
I would never choose a host in my own country and I ’d never put a server in a country where my worst anti-piracy enemy is located , the legal wheels turn too easily .
But if the wheels do turn really easily and your host hands over your personal details , you will have been clever enough to make sure that they never had the correct information in the first place .
Pay your host on time and be a good customer , you need him onside .
Online Identity
Ok , so I may be a proud super admin ( j/k ! ) but I ’m not too keen to spread my nick around carelessly or needlessly .
I try to resist the ego trip , even though it can be fun using your ‘ power ’ to get stuff you would n’t normally have access to !
Remember , even online nicknames can be a source of identification over time .
In my opinion , any admin who features himself on Facebook or MySpace in a way that could be linked back to his torrent activities , really needs a psychiatric evaluation .
But I know of a couple who do and so far , they ’ve survived .
Maybe I ’m crazy , and they ’re all sane .
It ’s possible !
Security on the Site , Choosing and Dealing with Staff
Any logging on the server or control panel info excludes staff members details , so a rogue moderator with a grudge ca n’t get any useful information , should someone try to make it worth their while to provide it .
No -one on the site knows anything really useful about me , even within my own team .
None of us have ever met in real - life , but I make it my business to learn as much about them as possible , just in case .
The very closest people to me on the site know my first name , I guess that ’s ok ?
Wrong !
I never let anyone know anything important about me , no matter how small .
Small clues can easily add up to answers when put together like a jigsaw .
Let people think they know your real name if you like , it ’s functional and no - one really gets hurt .
For the survival of the site I believe it ’s acceptable for me to lie about my country of origin , my age , marital status and even my sex , but beware , pretending to be a girl will get you LOTS of attention !
Look after the small things and everything else looks after itself .
It ’s also a good move to encourage my staff to be security conscious too but I do n’t force my regime onto them .
I find that when choosing staff it ’s best to never let people with inflated egos get close to you – they tend to have big mouths too .
They generate tension and trouble and YOU will become a target with their boasting and trigger happy attitude .
I like quiet , considered staff because i’m paranoid !.. but this style does n’t suit everyone .
Try making other forum accounts and act like a normal user on them .
You ’d be surprised at what people will tell you about your own site that you did n’t already know when they think they are n’t talking to anyone important .
Site Donations
Anonymous PayPal accounts ( or in a 3rd party ’s name ) are completely desirable .
Although I suggest a level of transparency in showing users how much money in donations are received , making these records public provides a level of evidence of financial income to the site and you just know that this would be used against you at some point , should the shit hit the fan .
If you know and trust your host , why not let users donate directly to him ?
Do n’t Break the Law !
Running a tracker is a gray area in most country ’s laws but I try to stick to some basic guidelines to not show blatant disregard for things that are surely illegal in most places .
Under no circumstances would I seed any copyright works on my own tracker .
I saw an admin recently who had uploaded 4tb of warez and was showing off his stats for all to see .
Why take the risk ?
If you get a DMCA type takedown request , take the torrent down !
The Pirate Bay guys are going crazy at me now I guess ( they ’re entitled to hold their own style of course ! ) but I see no point in doing anything unnecessary to annoy copyright holders , especially us small guys who do n’t have many resources .
Do unto others as you ’d have done to you !
Try and make good contacts at other torrent sites as they can be a valuable source of information .
Try to stay out of conflict with others and be known as a problem solver , not a problem maker .
A good reputation is a must to maintain admin karma ;)
No -one wants online enemies , especially in huge numbers !
People with a grudge and keyboard can really fuck you up .
Do n’t badmouth people to others unnecessarily , you have no idea who they know , who they might tell and what it could lead to .
A few basic tips to hopefully keep the right side of the law
1 . If you ca n’t be identified , they ca n’t do anything against you personally .
2. Always respond to proper takedown requests .
Be courteous , do n’t make enemies .
3 . Never seed anything yourself and do n’t operate a seedbox .
If others operate them on your tracker , that ’s up to them .
4 . Do n’t run any kind of pay - to - download service unless you like police attention .

Final Thoughts About Being Anonymous
Being as anonymous as I can is a must for me and it helps me feel safe .
It ’s probably already past a healthy stage and it does have drawbacks .
A few of my staff I love , I really do , they ’re great guys but I can never let them know my true identity , which is sad for me because maybe we could become more to each other than just text on a screen .
If I thought even one person knew who I was , my confidence in security would fall dramatically .
Being anonymous can be a quite lonely experience as you struggle to keep the very things that make you an individual , private , while constantly having to view people that probably do n’t deserve it , with suspicion .
But in the end you gotta keep the torrents going , so it ’s all good .
Clinton Campaign Staffers Not Going Without Pay Clinton said staff offered to go without pay , but they 're not .
Feb . 7 , 2008  --
So it turns out the Clinton campaign may not be so cash - strapped after all — at least not at this very moment .
After offering on Wednesday to go without paychecks to help save precious campaign resources , senior staff members on Hillary Clinton 's campaign are in fact not going without pay during the month of February , ABC News has learned .
" It 's not happening , " said a source familiar with the situation .
Clinton 's campaign has been shouting from the rooftops all day about its online fundraising efforts since Super Tuesday .
Clinton's Money
The campaign announced today that it raised more than four million dollars online in the 24 hours after polls closed on Tuesday — the biggest single haul in one day ever for the campaign .
" We are gratified for this tremendous outpouring of support , " said Clinton Campaign Internet Director Peter Daou .
That outpouring is the reason that a handful of senior staff who had offered to go without pay on Wednesday have been told today that they will not need to skip paychecks .
One longtime Democratic consultant not affiliated with any campaign wondered if perhaps the whole thing was n't a big stunt to garner media attention and look like an " underdog . "
" I 'd take this revelation as a sign that they planned this whole thing , " the consultant said .
The source familiar with the situation also believes Senator Clinton will not need to loan herself any more cash .
On Wednesday it was revealed that Hillary Clinton had given her campaign an infusion of $ 5 million back in January .
Clinton argued today her decision to loan her campaign money should not be seen as a sign that her campaign is in financial trouble .
" We were outraised in January which we took steps immediately to address , " she told ABC News ' Jake Tapper today .
" Since Tuesday we 've raised millions of dollars on the Internet .
So we 're going to be fine .
And you know my staff is so dedicated that they stepped up and said we want to do our part .
I did my part .
But we 're going to be in very good financial shape , people are rallying around .
And I think by the end of the week we 're going to be back on track , " she said .
The Clinton campaign has enough money on hand now to launch television advertising in multiple states .
Ads are going up this week in Virginia , Maryland and Washington , D.C. , which all vote next Tuesday .
The campaign is also advertising in Washington state , Maine , and — to a lesser degree — in Nebraska .
Those three states vote this weekend .
Next week the campaign will begin advertising for upcoming battles in Wisconsin , Texas and Ohio .
The Clinton campaign is putting a lot of emphasis on the primaries in Texas and Ohio , hoping that victories in those states — with their high delegate counts — will help put Clinton over the top .
It may be a risky strategy , says the Democratic strategist not affiliated with Clinton .
" Other than Maine they will have a tough couple of weeks .
So they 're saying the only thing that counts is Texas and Ohio .
That 's helpful but it also sets them up to have to win there . "

Asians , not whites , hurt most by race - conscious admissions
The long - running debate over affirmative action in college admissions just got more complicated , thanks to a new study that challenges the common assumption that whites are hurt most when colleges take applicants ' race and ethnicity into account .
The study , published by the University of California - Los Angeles last week in the scholarly journal InterActions , suggests that it is mainly Asian - Americans — not whites — who are held to a higher standard when top colleges use affirmative action .
Where such institutions have been banned from considering applicants ' race , the study finds , enrollment of Asian - Americans has increased while admissions of whites remained flat or , in some cases , declined .
The study , an analysis of long - term enrollment trends at several exclusive public universities , found that the Asian - American share of enrollment increased :
• More than 15 % at the University of Texas at Austin after a 1996 federal court ruling barred consideration of race in admissions .
• More than 15 % at the University of Florida after Gov. Jeb Bush persuaded the state university system 's governing board to vote in 2000 to end race - and ethnicity - conscious admissions .
• More than 20 % at the University of California - Berkeley , more than 10 % at UCLA and more than 30 % at the University of California - San Diego after that state 's voters passed a 1996 ballot measure barring the use of affirmative - action preferences by public colleges and other state agencies .
Although David Colburn and his two co-authors consider themselves advocates of affirmative action , he acknowledged their numbers show " Asian - Americans were discriminated against under an affirmative - action system . "
Colburn 's assessment is in keeping with other research that has suggested that Asian - Americans are regarded as overrepresented on college campuses and therefore held to higher standards to keep their numbers down .
The white applicants covered by this study fared no better in the absence of affirmative action than before .
In fact , the number of white admissions in some cases dropped because of increased competition from Hispanics and from Asian - Americans .
This report comes as efforts are under way in Arizona , Colorado , Missouri , Nebraska and Oklahoma to ban the use of affirmative action by public colleges and state agencies .
Similar measures easily won approval in California , Michigan and Washington .
The authors of the new study seem to be hoping that their conclusions will erode white voters ' support for such measures .
Their report says their findings " can hardly be satisfying " to " those who campaigned for the elimination of affirmative action in the belief that it would advantage the admission of white students . "
The study even predicts a white backlash against race - neutral admissions policies if Asian - Americans continue to make gains .
Most leading Asian - American advocacy groups have supported affirmative action .
When the U.S. Supreme Court last weighed in on the legality of colleges ' use of affirmative action in admissions in two University of Michigan rulings in 2003 , 28 Asian - American organizations signed a legal brief urging the court to uphold such policies given the educational benefits of diversity .
( A 5 - 4 majority of justices agreed with such logic . )
In the long term , it 's unclear what impact this new study will have on the views of Asian - Americans — or the views of the courts .
If colleges are using race - conscious admissions policies to limit enrollments of Chinese- , Vietnamese - , Indian - and Japanese - Americans , will they be able to continue convincing the courts that their intent is the promotion of diversity ?

MYO -X Myostatin Inhibitor Reviews - What Is It ?
Author : Eric Lander | Last Updated Date : 02.03.2020
WARNING : DO NOT BUY MYO -X Myostatin Inhibitor Until You Read This Review !
Is it a Scam ?
Does It Really Work ?
Check Ingredients , Side Effects and More !
Myostatin is a catabolic - limiting factor of athletic performance , muscle growth , and aging .
It means that hormone myostatin that exists in our bodies , works to limit our muscle tone , muscle growth , strength , and body shape .
When we have too much myostatin , our muscle mass shrinks , strength decreases , fat deposits grow , and the body becomes formless .
A product that works to reduce blood myostatin levels is called Myostatin Inhibitor .
One of them is known as MYO -X Myostatin Inhibitor .
This product claims to help you build muscles and improve your body shape .
It has been studied at the University of Tampa Human Performance Laboratory by Lowery , et al. , according to the manufacturer .
MHP-s myostatin inhibitor was demonstrated to boost muscle growth in athletes .
However , this study was very limited and the product needs more research .
The manufacturer of MYO -X Myostatin Inhibitor is Maximum Human Performance .
It is a badly known company that does n't seem to offer other products of the kind .
Let us have a look at how the supplement works .
Ingredients of Myostatin Inhibitor - Does It Really Work ?
Is It a Scam ?
The manufacturer of MYO -X Myostatin Inhibitor does not bother itself too much as to inform their potential customers of the ingredients used in this supplement .
As far as I understand it is a steroid product , thus , it can be dangerous with its side effects .
The components can be also harmful , so , the user has the right to know what he is putting into his body .
By the way , MYO -X Myostatin Inhibitor is meant for males only .
MYO - X is available in the form of a powder which has to be mixed with a full glass of water thoroughly .
The powder has a vanilla flavor .
One container of the product contains 300 grams , equal to 30 scoops .
The only goal of MYO -X Myostatin Inhibitor is to block one 's body 's production of myostatin .
Myostatin is a hormone responsible for the regulation of the muscle growth .
In fact , it decreases this process .
Weightlifting decreases myostatin level in the blood , thus it promotes muscle growth .
The level of myostatin increases with age and causes muscle loss .
MYO -X Myostatin Inhibitor is said to combine a number of natural ingredients which work by blocking myostatin , however , they are not listed on the official website of the supplement .
The formula of the product also contains synthetic chemicals .
I managed to find out that its most active ingredient is fertilized egg yolk powder .
According to the manufacturer of MYO -X Myostatin Inhibitor , this ingredient is able to inhibit myostatin production .
However , it cannot totally block myostatin production .
Lower production of myostatin theoretically means that your body can potentially grow muscles , but only if you follow a well - balanced exercise routine .
Each scoop of MYO -X Myostatin Inhibitor contains the following ingredients : a small amount of protein , fat , carbs , sugars , sodium , and cholesterol .
It also contains some minerals and vitamins , including Vitamin A ( 45 % Daily Value ) and Iron ( 4 % ) Daily Value ) .
The bottom of the ingredient section is particularly interesting .
It lists the MYO - X proprietary formula , which makes only 6.6 grams of the 10 gram scoop .
It 's too little , I must admit .
The proprietary formula contains fecunded G. Gallas Domesticus Yolk Isolate , as it was already mentioned .
This actually powdered form of fertilized egg yolk is not as effective as claimed on the official website .
We will ensure in this by looking at the real users ' testimonials in the next part of this review .
Thus , you are not expected to experience massive muscle gains or to boost your testosterone levels to the fantastic levels .
Customer Reviews - Does It Have Any Side Effects ?
The manufacturer of MYO -X Myostatin Inhibitor does not mention any possible side effects or adverse reactions associated with the use of this product , however , they can occur , at least because of the difficult functioning of the supplement .
It should be taken into account that this inhibitor is not natural , thus , it can potentially be harmful for the human health .
What I know is that MYO -X Myostatin Inhibitor can cause a bleeding nose and rupture of tendons but I am sure that there are more side effects .
The reason lies in the action mechanism of myostatin's inhibitors .
The matter is that the inhibitors are involved in a lot of signaling pathways .
They do n't interact with myostatin only .
Besides , there is a problem of the quality of the compounds contained in the product .
There are certain concerns about the dosing too .
The main ingredients in the supplement have not undergone clinical trials , thus they are not scientifically proven as effective and safe .
Still , the best way to learn whether the product works is to look at what real users are writing about it .
" MYO - X Myostatin Inhibitor did n't do a thing .
It has a great taste but it is not worth the money it costs .
From what I have learnt , myostatin inhibitors do n't work if they are broken down by the digestive system .
This may be the case with me . "
" Save your money .
MYO X Myostatin Inhibitor does n't work at all .
I gave it a try and took two scoops a day but it did n't make any noticeable gains .
It seems that every muscle building supplement is ineffective nowadays .
They are trying to earn money only . "
" After taking MYO - X myostatin inhibitor for two days , just like the manufacturer recommended , I experienced very bad things .
My blood pressure was too high , I was shaky , jittery , and was sweating excessively .
Stay away from this stuff . "
Where To Buy MYO -X Myostatin Inhibitor ?
The product can be bought from the official website , as well as from a number of retail stores .
The price may differ depending on where you are buying the supplement .
Amazon sells MHP MYO -X Myostatin Inhibitor , Vanilla ( 300 Grams ) by Maximum Human Performance for $ 53 .
It is n't available on Walmart or GNC .
My Final Summary
I do n't think that MYO -X Myostatin Inhibitor is the best way to get a body of your dream as it has many disadvantages .
First of all , it does n't work as claimed .
Secondly , this product can cause a number of dangerous side effects .
MYO -X Myostatin Inhibitor is associated with a big number of negative reviews from real users .
Even though it is available on many websites and is affordable , I cannot recommend MYO -X Myostatin Inhibitor to usage .
There are many other muscle - building supplements on the market for you to choose from .
Affordable Alternative
I study a lot of different supplement designed for boosting endurance , physical performance and muscle growth .
And I can say that there is one worthy alternative on the market .
It is called CrazyBulk Winsol ( Winidrol ) .
It is one of the best supplements for body builders available in present day market .
This supplement claims to build lean muscle in a short period of time and without any side effects which usually occur when using similar products .
The best part about it is that you do n't have to take it too excessively but still you will be able to achieve the desired body shape with better stamina faster .
Winsol also improves vascularity and blood circulation , provides a lot of energy and decreases the recovery time after a workout .
I recommend reading my review about Winsol .

TheGardenLady received this question from Maryjane :
I summer in Maine under white and Norway pines .
The soil is acidic .
I want to plant flowers .
What suggestions can you make for raised beds ?
How lovely to summer in Maine and create your own flower gardens .
Your letter does not say whether you want to plant annual or perennial flowers to enjoy during the summer .
Do you want a show garden or a cutting garden ?
Or do you want to plant flowering shrubs like azaleas , hydrangeas or roses ?
There are many annual and perennial flower suggestions for flower beds .
To decide what you would like that grows well in your area , it would be nice to walk around and see what is growing nicely in your neighborhood .
Besides the soil acidity , you have to consider the amount of sun or shade where your beds will be located ; so looking at your neighbors gardens or public gardens will let you know which plants are most successful and which plants you like .
Since you are writing to TheGardenLady at this time , you apparently want to get an early start on choosing your plants or seeds and wo n’t have the time to look .

An ambitious program announced Thursday by a coalition of government agencies could lead to the end of animal testing to evaluate the safety for humans of new chemicals and drugs .
Three agencies — the Environmental Protection Agency , the National Toxicology Program and the National Institutes of Health — have signed a " Memorandum of Understanding " to develop and implement the new methods .
The collaboration is described in today 's edition of the journal Science .
The agreement is a " milestone " says Martin Stephens of the Humane Society of the United States .
" We believe this is the beginning of the end for animal testing .
We think the ( conversion ) process will take about 10 years . "
The agencies acknowledge that full implementation of the shift in toxicity testing could take years because it will require scientific validation of the new approaches .
The Humane Society and other activist groups have long protested the use of animals to test the safety of chemicals , particularly those used in cosmetics and other personal products .
The agencies noted that the public 's " unease " with animal testing , in addition to a growing number of new chemicals and high testing costs , fueled the new collaboration .
Although there are no actual figures , Stephens says his " best guess " would be that about 10 million animals a year are used in toxicity testing , mostly mice , rats , rabbits , guinea pigs , and then lesser numbers of dogs , monkeys and other species .
Historically , toxicity has been identified by injecting chemicals into animals and seeing whether they were harmed .
" It was expensive , time - consuming , used animals in large numbers , and it did n't always work , " says Francis Collins , director of the NIH 's National Human Genome Research Institute .
The new systems the agencies hope to use rely on human cells grown in test tubes and computer - driven testing machines .
They allow the scientists to examine potentially toxic compounds in the lab rather than injecting them into animals .
The EPA has begun evaluating 300 chemicals using the new methods .
The first phase should be finished this year , says Robert Kavlok , director of the National Center for Computational Toxicology .
Thousands of chemicals can be tested at one time under a method that uses a 3 - by - 5 - inch glass tray with 1,536 tiny wells , each a fraction of a millimeter across , says Christopher Austin , director of NIH 's Chemical Genomics Center .
A few hundred human cells grown in a test tube go into each well .
Then , guided by a computer , the testing machine drips a different chemical into each well .
After a while , the machine shines a laser through each well to see how many cells remain .
A computer analyzes the toxicity of each compound based on how the cells react .
By comparison , it 's taken the EPA 30 years to rigorously test 2,500 potentially toxic compounds , says Elias Zerhouni , director of the NIH .
All the data produced will be put into a public database .
" We think it is very important for the entire public worldwide to have access to these very precious experimental results , " Kavlock says .
The agencies ' agreement is the fruit of work begun in 2005 by the EPA and the National Toxicological Program to speed up toxicological testing .
That resulted in a report by the National Research Council last year laying out how quicker testing might be done .
The federal agencies will start their efforts with compounds previously tested on animals to confirm that the cell - based tests are accurate , Collins says .
Animal testing wo n't disappear overnight , but the agencies ' work signals the beginning of the end , Zerhouni says .
The testing shift began to take shape when scientists realized the same methods drug companies used to test compounds for therapeutic purposes could also be used to see whether they harmed cells .
It 's a wonderful example of what scientists always hope for , Collins says .
" You develop a technology for one purpose , and you realize , ' Goodness !
We can use it for something else ! ' "
He likened it to the evolution of the military 's data transmission projects of the 1970s , asking , " Who would have thought that would result in the Internet and the Web ? "
Enlarge By Mike Groll , AP Professor Jonathan Dordick holds a biochip designed to mimic human reactions to potentially toxic compounds .
The chip holds hundreds of tiny white dots loaded with human cell cultures and enzymes .
Scientists hope the chips can do away with the need to use animals to test new blockbuster drugs or wrinkle creams .

Monks who make world 's best beer have a message By Noelle Knox , USA TODAY BRUSSELS 
Inside the sanctuary of the abbey of St. Sixtus of Westvleteren is a beer lover 's dream and a businessman 's nightmare .
Brother Michiel loads beer into the trunk of a Corvette at the St. Sixtus Abbey in Belgium .
By Yves Logghe , AP Piety , not profit , is what these monks seek .
The St. Sixtus monks break every rule in Business 101 except attention to quality .
And therein may lie the secret of their success in brewing a beer that some rank among the world 's best and that is so hard to get there 's a black market for it .
St. Sixtus brews three beers .
The Westvleteren 12 is a strong , dark beer with a 12 % alcohol content .
It is consistently ranked among the top five beers in the world by RateBeer.com , a website for beer enthusiasts with 26,500 members .
In the latest survey , it reclaimed the No. 1 spot from AleSmith Barrel Aged Speedway Stout .
The Westvleteren monks also make a dark beer with an 8 % alcohol content ( ranked ninth by RateBeer.com ) , and a blond beer with a 6 % alcohol content .
This is heady stuff compared with a can of Coors , which has 4 % alcohol .
" It 's a great beer .
Very rich , very strong .
...
There 's a lot of inherent complexity , tastes of dates , raisins , cocoa , " explains Joseph Tucker , executive director for RateBeer .
" They 're not compromising any kind of flavor profile to save a few pennies .
Most commercial brewers are in the business of making money , to serve their investors , and they compromise taste . "
While craft brewing in the USA is still relatively new , the abbey in Westvleteren has been making beer since 1836 , passing the tradition from monk to monk over the ages .
No reason to change
The doorbell sounds with a loud chime .
Brother Joris , head of the brewery , answers , dressed in the Cistercian habit of white robe with a black , hooded outer robe , gray socks and leather sandals .
His dark hair is cropped short .
He wears a plain watch with a black band .
It 's one of the 72 brewing days of the year , but the abbey is still quiet and peaceful .
Brother Joris leads the way past aluminum tanks and the bottling room , where a team of five monks is at work .
During the next five to eight weeks , as the beer ages in tanks and then in bottles , potential customers will call the abbey 's " beer phone , " which has a recorded message that tells them when the beer will go on sale ( 36 times a year , for as long as stock lasts ) .
On the first day the beer goes on sale , cars start lining up at the abbey at 5:15 a.m. , says Brother Joris .
The gates open at 10 a.m. , and buyers are limited to two cases per car .
" Not to be resold " is stamped on the receipts , but customers regularly disregard the monks ' wish , and the coveted beer is exported , unlabeled and without permission , to America and elsewhere .
While the machinery is more modern today — it was last updated in 1989 — the philosophy is the same .
" As monks , the rule is pray and work .
These are the two pillars of a Trappist life , " Brother Joris explains .
" If you prayed 24 hours a day you 'd go nuts .
So there has to be a balance between work and monastic life .
So that balance is there .
We earn our living .
There 's no reason to change that , or make more money . "
St. Sixtus brews just 60,000 cases of beer a year .
The famous Westvleteren 12 sells for about $ 33 a case , the blond 6 is the cheapest at $ 23 for 24 bottles .
That makes enough money to cover the costs of maintaining the abbey , where 28 monks work .
There 's also a little extra to help the needy .
The brewery currently is running at maximum capacity .
And the monks are not interested in raising prices or production , because that would require hiring more outside workers ( they have three ) and working with distributors .
" At that moment it would cease to be what it is now , an integrated part of our existence , " he explains .
Brother Joris , 45 , joined St. Sixtus 12 years ago .
Before that , he was a captain in the Belgian police force .
" We are separated from the world , but we encounter the world in ourselves , " he says .
" You do not become a saint by entering a monastery . "
A tradition of beermaking There are six Trappist monasteries in Belgium making beer and one in The Netherlands .
Several of them rank in RateBeer 's top 50 .
Only the abbey of Achel brews less than St. Sixtus , while the Abbey of Notre - Dame de Scourmont , which makes the Chimay beer , is the largest .
But the monks at St. Sixtus do n't see any of the Trappist beers as competition .
" The first Benedictine value , we follow the rule of St. Benedict , is humility , " Brother Joris says .
" Humility begins with not comparing oneself with another .
" We make one Trappist ale .
There are seven Trappist breweries :
Each of them has its own character , reflects its own community .
They 're all good .
What 's the point of beginning to compete ? "
Nor do they care that they are again the top - ranked beer .
" Being No. 1 is not news .
It 's a website .
There are other professional beer - tasting contests and beer awards that are more valuable than being No. 1 on a website , " he adds .
But they do n't participate in those contests either .
" It 's more trouble , " he says , " packing the bottles and shipping them . "
No marketing , no competition , no increase in prices or production .
It 's enough to make a capitalist cry .
Illegally imported Westvleteren beer , for example , sells for $ 8 to $ 12 a bottle in specialty bars and restaurants in the USA .
" We bought all the rest of it we could get that was left from the distributors , " says Michael Roper , owner of the Hopleaf bar in Chicago .
Roper 's bar sold out of Westvleteren two weeks ago .
Supply has dried up under pressure from the monks to stop illegal exports , he says .
" Westvleteren is a great beer , and I 'm very saddened I do n't have any more , and I did n't even save any for myself and now I 'm thinking , ' What was I thinking ? ' " Roper says he would love to see it in his bar again .
" But I also understand they 're not a brewery .
It 's a spiritual community , " he says .
" I do n't think their mission is the same as Anheuser - Busch . "
Brother Joris agrees .
In fact , he agreed to be interviewed only because he wanted to warn Americans against buying illegally imported Westvleteren .
" My message is , people should know that the beer arrives there in a very un - Trappist - like way , " he says .
" It 's the result of a lot of maneuvering in the dark before it actually shows up there . "
Such underhanded tactics go against the Benedictine values under which the monks work .
The St. Sixtus abbey also has no way of vouching for the quality of the beer , which is sensitive to temperature and light , when it arrives .
Nor are they insured to export beer to the United States .
" I would advise your readers not to ask for or buy Westvleteren , " he says .
" You do not support the Trappist cause by buying Westvleteren in the United States .
So if you want to support the Trappist cause , you drink one from the other six ( breweries ) , which are legally imported . "
Conjuring gemstones from thin air sounds like one of the alchemist ’s more ambitious projects .
But that is what a team of chemists from China is claiming to have achieved by making small diamonds from carbon dioxide .
“ We are changing a waste gas into gems , ” claims Qianwang Chen , head of the team producing the diamonds at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei , Anhui province .
The team claims its method could be cheaper and more efficient than some existing methods of synthesising diamonds , which require pressures of up five million atmospheres and temperatures that reach 1400 °C .
Chen and his colleagues make their diamonds by reacting CO 2 with metallic sodium in a pressurised oven at only 440 °C and 800 atmospheres .
“ This is the lowest temperature reported so far for diamond synthesis , ” he says .
After 12 hours , the grains of diamond can be separated from the sodium carbonate , graphite and unreacted CO 2 that remain .

Small gemstones
Metallic sodium is a hazardous material , as it reacts violently with water vapour .
To ensure that it all gets used up , the team starts with an excess of CO 2 .
“ We have now undertaken the procedure more than 80 times without any safety problems , ” says Chen .
In the online edition of the Journal of the American Chemical Society ( DOI : 10.1021/ ja035177 )
Chen ’s team reports that the first diamonds reached diameters of about a quarter of a millimetre .
While that is far too small for gems in wedding rings and necklaces , it is ideal for use in industrial cutting tools and abrasives .
But since the group ’s paper was accepted by the journal , they have improved the process to the point at which it can be used to make small gemstones .
“ We can grow diamonds as large as 1.2 millimetres , ” Chen says .
“ They are transparent and colourless , and so could be used as gems . ”
“ Horrifically nasty ”
While the Chinese process works at a more reasonable temperature , 800 atmospheres is “ still a horrifically nasty pressure to work at ” , says Alison Mainwood at King ’s College London , who chairs the UK ’s Diamond Research Network .
She doubts whether the Chinese process will seriously challenge today ’s industrial diamonds because the diamonds it yields are so small and gritty : “ I ’m sure it could be improved , but I doubt to the point where it could become a rival . ”
De Beers , the largest diamond - mining company in the world , says that while it welcomes advances in the technology of diamond making , manufactured gems should be kept distinct from natural ones .
“ We hope that any organisation involved in diamond synthesis would openly and transparently declare any such product as being synthetic and clearly distinct from natural gem diamond , ” the company says .
In the Middle East in the last three days , there have been several undersea , international communications cables that have been cut .
On Wednesday , 30 January 2008 , two major , undersea communications cables were cut off the Egyptian coast , in the eastern Mediterranean .
( 1 ) The story has received prominent play in the international news cycle .
Various explanations have been floated in the mainstream news media as to the cause - the most popular culprit being a " ship anchor " .
In any event , communications in the region have been severely disrupted , all the way from Egypt to India , and most points in between .
Then on Friday , 1 February 2008 , an undersea cable in the Persian Gulf , running between Oman and Dubai , was also cut " causing severe phone line disruptions and compounding an already existing Internet outage across large parts of the Middle East and Asia " according to the International Herald Tribune .
( 2 ) There was also a report on Friday , 1 February 2008 , of yet another undersea , fiber optic communications cable between Suez and Sri Lanka that has been cut .
The reporting is a bit confused ; however , given that the Persian Gulf is geographically distant from the Suez , this appears to represent a fourth undersea cable that has been cut .
( 3 ) So let 's see if we can figure this story out .
I will say up front that I am well and thoroughly skeptical of the " ship anchor " explanation that has been so prominently advanced in the mainstream news media .
Yes , ships do sometimes drag their anchors and dragging anchors can cause damage , true enough .
But to have three undersea cables -- or is it actually four cables ? -- cut in the same region in just a two day span , strains credulity ; the more so , when we look at how the damage has played out across the region .
Two countries in particular stand at conspicuously opposite ends of the continuum of communications disruption .
1 . The website , internettrafficreport.com/asia.htm , reports that as of Friday , 1 February 2008 , internet traffic routing through / from / to Iran has been cut to zero .
Packet loss is 100 % . ( 4 ) 2 .
Whereas CNN reported on Thursday , 31 January 2008 , that internet traffic to Israel has been unaffected because Israel uses a " different route " .
The same CNN article also reports that Lebanon and Iraq have been " spared the chaos " .
( 5 ) So , the sudden , unprecedented round of undersea , communications cable cutting in the Middle East leaves Israel and Iraq still connected , while completely shutting down the Iranian internet .
Funny how that works , is n't it ?
As it happens , the two actors in the international arena in recent years whose rhetoric has expressed the most animus for Iran are the United States and Israel .
They have also been by far the most bellicose , Zionist - NeoCon propaganda notwithstanding .
Israel and the United States have repeatedly committed military aggression against other countries in the region , and have made many thinly veiled threats of war against Iran .
In this decade , the United States has militarily invaded and occupied first Afghanistan , then Iraq , where its forces remain , bogged down in bloody wars of attrition .
In the same period , Israel has bombed Syria , bombed and invaded Lebanon , and placed the Palestinian territories under a merciless blockade / occupation / assault .
Parallel with these international war crimes , the United States and Israel have repeatedly rattled their sabres against Iran .
Which brings the discussion back around to the instant spate of undersea , communications cable cutting in the region that has uniquely brought Iranian internet communications to a complete halt , while sparing Israel , which has a different internet route than any of the cut cables , and Iraq , where the American military occupation is bogged down .
As it happens , the U.S. Navy has for decades had special operations teams that go out on submarines and deploy undersea , on the seabed itself , specifically for cutting or tapping communications cables .
The U.S. Navy divers go out through special airlocks and use very sophisticated equipment .
This has all been thoroughly documented in the excellent book , Blind Man 's Bluff : The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage , by Sherry Sontag and Christopher Drew ( New York : Public Affairs , 1998 ) .
For the uninitiated it seems bizarre and unlikely , but the plain fact of the matter is that American military divers really go out onto the seabed from special submarines outfitted with airlocks and they actually cut undersea communications cables -- then patch in sophisticated surveillance equipment -- then they splice the cables back together .
That is if the motive is espionage .
If the purpose of the operation is garden variety sabotage , then simply cutting the cable suffices .
It 's like something out of a spy novel thriller , but the U.S.
Navy really does have submarines and deep diving , special operations personnel who specialize in precisely this sort of operation .
So cutting a few undersea cables in two or three days is well within the operational capabilities of the United States Navy .
Couple this little known , but very important fact , with the reality that for years now we have seen more and more ham - handed interference with the global communications grid by the American alphabet soup ( NSA , CIA , FBI , HoSec ) and major tel - comms .
Would the tel - comms and the American military and alphabet soup agencies collude on an operation that had as its aim to sabotage the Iranian communications network , even if that entailed collateral damage to other countries in the region ?
The honest answer has to be : sure , maybe so .
Who can really tell ?
I mean , after all , we are living in a bizarro world now , a world of big and bigger lies , a world of 24/7 propaganda , a world of irrational and violent policies enacted against the civilian population by multinational corporations and military and espionage agencies the world over .
We see the evidence for this on every hand .
Only the most myopic among us remain oblivious to these realities .
In light of the American Navy 's demonstrated sea - floor capabilities and espionage activities , the heavy American Navy presence in the region , and the many veiled threats against Iran by both the Americans and the Israelis , suspicion naturally falls on them both .
It may be that this is what the beginning of a war against Iran looks like .
Or maybe we are merely seeing a dry run , a practice run , for a planned , upcoming war against Iran .
The cables that have been cut are among the largest communication pipes in the region , and clearly represent major strategic targets .
Whatever the case , it is crystal clear that we are not looking at business as usual .
On the contrary , we are looking at distinctly unusual business , that much is obvious .
The explanations being put forth in the mainstream news media for these several cut , undersea communications cables absolutely do not pass the smell test .
And by the way , the same operators who cut undersea cables in the Persian Gulf , Mediterranean Sea and possibly the Suez as well , presumably can also cut underwater cables in the Gulf of Mexico or Great Lakes or ... you see my point .
This could be a multipurpose operation , in part a test run for isolating a country from the international communications grid .
Iran today , the USA tomorrow ?
What 's that you say ?
I do n't understand how the world works ?
That kind of thing can't happen here ?
In any event , if the cables have been intentionally cut , then that is an aggressive act of war .
I 'm sure the Iranians have gotten that message , and are actively making counter preparations against a possible imminent attack .
I 'm looking at the same telegram as they are , and I know I would be , were I in their shoes .

A view of the lunar eclipse from Japan 's northernmost main island of Hokkaido on Aug. 28 , 2007 .
The Earth 's shadow crept across the moon 's surface slowly eclipsing it and turning it to shades of orange and red during second total lunar eclipse this year .
As ifscanning the moon 's surface for impact blemishes were not enough , NASAnow plans to visualize its internal imperfections to solve longstanding mysteries about the moon 's insides .
NASA saidthis week that it selected the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory ( GRAIL ) mission from two dozen proposals .
GRAIL 's twin spacecraft are slated to launcharound Sept. 6 , 2011 and , after a few weeks of settling into orbit , map thelunar gravity field for 90 days .
Scientistshope to use the data to pick apart its insides from crust to core , much like a medical X - ray that shows the insides of a person .
" We 'relooking forward to the data , " Michael New , GRAIL 's lead project scientist , told SPACE.com .
" It 's really going to open up new understandingof the particular history and internal structure of the moon . "
Crust tocore
NASApreviously launched a mission to map Earth 's gravitational fields , calledGRACE — the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment .
Over the years , it measured minutedifferences in gravitational pull at different points around our planet , revealing glacial melt , migrating magma and tectonic plate movement , among othercuriosities .
Similarly , GRAIL will measure gravity at different points around the moon , which shouldreveal any gravity differences as slight as 1 million times weaker than the Earth 's overall gravity .
New saidthe data will be about 1,000 times better than any other measurements of lunargravity , explaining that such data can be processed to peer beneath the moon ' ssurface and locate any significant structures related to early lunar history .
" We 'retalking about things like relaxation of lunar crust to ?
a big lava flow , " New said .
" The other thing that may become a little clearer will be alittle bound on the size of any lunarcore , if there is one . "
Bestingthe competition
GRAIL beat out23 elaborate competitors in NASA 's Discovery mission selection process , andwill cost at least $ 375 million for the whole package — design , launch andstaffing included .
" GRAILalso offers to bring innovative Earth studies techniques to the moon as a precursorto their possible later use at Mars and other planets , " said Alan Stern , NASA 's associate administrator for science , at this week 's American GeophysicalUnion 's 2007 meeting .
New saidthe money is set aside in NASA 's budget , which means intricate engineering ofGRAIL 's twin spacecraft can begin .
" Themoney 's there , " he said .
" Unless something really horrifichappens — like another Katrina — we have money in our budget to support mission allthe way out . "
The LunarReconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) , set to launch in 2008 , willprecede GRAIL 's spaceshot .
LRO will scan the moon 's pockmarked surface forfuture robotic and human landing sites and will be accompanied by anotherspacecraft , called the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite ( LCROSS ) mission — which will impact the lunar south pole to search for polar water .
" AsNASA moves forward with exploration endeavors , our lunar science missions willbe the light buoy leading the path for future humanactivities , " said Jim Green , NASA 's planetary divisiondirector in Washington , D.C .
LockheedMartin Space Systems in Denver will build GRAIL and NASA 's Jet PropulsionLaboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , will manage GRAIL 's mission .

A RECESSION in America is a worry that the latest data on American employment will do much to deepen .
January 's non-farm payroll numbers showed a surprise drop of 17,000 , the first decline since August 2003 , according to figures released by the Bureau of Labour Statistics on Friday February 1st .
Forecasters had hoped for a rise of 80,000 , partly owing to good weather during the survey and partly because earlier data had been more upbeat ; the figures did n't oblige .
As usual with American jobs data , not all the numbers pointed in the same direction .
Optimists could take heart from an upward revision to December 's payroll numbers and from a small fall ( from 5 % to 4.9 % ) in January 's unemployment rate ( a figure calculated from a separate survey of households ) .
But pessimists could focus on a slippage in average hours worked , often an early indicator of bad times to come as firms slowly cut back their output .
The data added to the debate about the Federal Reserve 's recent cuts in interest rates of 1.25 percentage points .
Some commentators claim that the weak jobs count vindicated the Fed 's pre-emptive move , others saw it as more evidence that the America 's central bank had acted too tardily .
The chance of a further half - point cut at the Fed 's next meeting in March increased in response to the news .
The weak payroll number was driven by further falls in employment at construction companies and manufacturers .
But while that might have been expected , the big surprise was a 11,000 drop in professional and business - services employment .
One crumb of comfort for those worried about the state of the economy is that the payroll count is notoriously volatile .
It is derived from a survey , which questions 160,000 businesses and government entities accounting for a third of total non-farm payrolls .
Despite a large sample size the initial payroll count is somewhat sketchy and subject to significant revision .
Between 2003 and 2006 the first estimate was revised by an average of 51,000 jobs each month .
These revisions occur because , in January ( as with other months ) , only about 56 % of businesses have responded to the survey by the time of its first release .
Furthermore , the Bureau of Labour Statistics has to guess at the number of jobs created by new companies — the so called birth - deaths figure .
The unemployment rate is calculated from just 60,000 households , a small fraction of the total of 110 m .
But it is not subject to the same drastic revisions as it receives over 90 % of survey responses by the time of release .
A recent study by Congress 's joint economic committee found that the unemployment rate is “ the most useful indicator of recession ” and the payroll count has “ little value ” as a guide to economic turning points .
If that is so the news is ominous .
The study found the unemployment rate increases by 0.12 percentage points in the first three months of recession .
A sharp rise in unemployment in December outpaced the improvement in January giving an average rise over the past two months of 0.13 points .
In Face of Pressure From Opposing Protesters , Council Votes to Rescind Letter to Marines Center
Protestors from both sides were present outside the City Council chambers before the council met and inside once Tuesday 's meeting began .
Police reported that two adults and two juveniles were arrested over the course of the day in relation to the protests .
Contributing Writer
After a large - scale protest outside City Council chambers that began early yesterday morning , the Berkeley City Council decided not to send an apology to the Marine Corps but rather to make clear their support for members of the military .
After more than two hours of public comment , the City Council decided in a 7 - 2 vote to clarify their support and respect for military service members but ultimately found no need to apologize to the Marine Corps for the language that described them as " unwelcome and uninvited intruders . "
" I do n't think we owe anyone an apology , " said Councilmember Max Anderson .
Tonight 's meeting comes after a vote two weeks ago by the City Council to send a controversial letter to the Marine Corps , as well as to offer Code Pink protestors a more permanent location outside the Downtown military recruiting center .
Councilmembers Gordon Wozniak and Betty Olds voted against the clarification because it did not include the apology .
The final decision , which came early this morning , was received by applause and cheers by members of Code Pink , the anti-war organization that also was given a parking space to have a space to protest .
" I think they did the right thing .
They clarified the language , they made it clear that they had no intention of offending the military , " said Code Pink activist PhoeBe sorgen .
" You can correct it without apologizing . "
But some pro-military supporters say that even with the council 's final decision , protesting the entire day was worth the time .
" It was definitely worth it .
If I understand correctly , they voted not to do an apology - that 's disgusting , " said Debbie Lee , a resident of Surprise , Ariz .
whose son was the first Navy Seal killed in Iraq .
" The pressures will continue to be applied . "
Over 100 speakers , both in favor of and against City Council 's decisions last week , trickled into the chambers for several hours as city employees guided groups in from the outside , where they listened and responded to the meeting , which was audible on speakers outside the chambers .
State Assemblyman Guy Houston , R - San Ramon , also made an appearance after threatening last week to remove $ 3.3 million dollars in state funds for street maintenance .
Houston brought up the Solomon Act , which states that if a city restricts access to military recruitment to colleges and universities , federal dollars can be stripped , he said .
" There is precedent with this ( and ) we intend to go forward with this bill , " he said .
Security was tightened last night as barricades were set up at the bottom steps of the city chambers , separating the anti-war protestors from the pro-military side .
After council members received more than 20,000 phone calls and e-mails in the past two weeks , police guarded doors and the entrance to the chambers .
Local business officials said they were unhappy about the negative effects Code Pink protests were having on their business .
" You made the wrong decision on this , " said Mark McCloud , the president of the Downtown Business Association .
" I urge you to rescind the resolution you made . "
Wozniak said an apology should be made since the council 's decisions last week were insulting to the Marines .
" I think we have failed our city and embarrassed our city , " he said . " ...
We did not ask our citizens whether they agreed with this .
We did not ask people locally whether they wanted the Marines .
We did it in a sense of arrogance , and I think that 's what we should apologize to our citizens for . "

Plants are some of the most beautiful and abundant things on earth .
There is just something so calming about standing in a dense forest taking in all of the amazing trees with their dizzying heights .
Plants are not just for show either ; they provide much of the oxygen we breathe while we offer them our exhaled carbon dioxide in return .
Here is our top 10 list of coolest plants .
10 . Aloe Plant
Aloes are succulent plants that need very little attention in the garden and give a nice show whether in bloom or not .
Their healing and first aid properties from the semi-sticky fluid within the stems is well known .
Aloe has been added to burn - healing products for years which can be taken gingerly from a plant itself .
9. Amorphophallus ( Misshapen Penis Plant )
As is normal of this plant family , these species develop an elongate or oval ‘ sheath ’ , which usually envelops the flower itself .
The flower can have different colors , but mostly brownish - purple or whitish - green .
On the inside , they contain ridges or warts , functioning as insect traps .
Despite all of that information that describes the plant itself , it emits a foul odor smelling of rotting fish .
8. Nepenthes ( Pitcher Plant )
Pitcher plants are carnivorous plants whose prey - trapping mechanism features a deep cavity filled with liquid known as a ‘ pitfall trap ’ .
It has been widely assumed that the various sorts of pitfall trap evolved from rolled leaves , with selection pressure favoring more deeply cupped leaves over evolutionary time .
Basically , prey flies or crawls in , and can not possibly get out .
7. Rafflesia arnoldii
Although technically a member of the plant kingdom , Rafflesia challenges traditional definitions of what a plant is because they lack chlorophyll and are therefore incapable of photosynthesis .
And according to all accounts of those who have gotten close enough to tell they have an odor similar to a carcass in advanced decomposition .
Get one for your home today !
6. Dracunculus vulgaris ( Dragon or Voodoo Lily )
The odor that bursts from the flower on the day it opens smells somewhat like rotting meat attracting flies as its chief pollinator , an attribute that needs consideration when you decide where to plant this flower .
Fortunately the odor dissipates after the first day , allowing you to enjoy the exotic beauty of this unusual plant !
The 10 - 12 inch flowers range in color from deep maroon to nearly black and last for 7 - 10 days .
The lovely green foliage appears in March but the flowers wait until early May to make its appearance .
5. Sundew
Sundews are found throughout the world .
These unique carnivorous plants attract their victims with a glistening morsel of nectar , or so the insect thinks !
Once the insect gets stuck , the tendrils will close around the victim to sting and release an enzyme to start the digestion process .
These plants make watching the action far easier as well .
4. Hydnora africana
The only portion of Hydnora that appears above the ground is the upper portion of the flower .
Most of the flower is below the soil surface .
The flower is thick and succulent in texture .
The portion of the flower above the ground surface is tubular and has three openings , one of which is shown in the image .
These plants are parasitic and emit quite harsh odors .
Looks Like Audry 2 , huh ?
3. Welwitschia mirabilis
An adult welwitschia consists of two leaves , a stem base and roots .
That is all !
Its two permanent leaves are unique in the plant kingdom .
They are the original leaves from when the plant was a seedling , and they just continue to grow and are never shed .
They are leathery , broad , strap - shaped and they lie on the ground becoming torn to shreds .
The stem is low , woody , hollowed - out , and sturdy .
It grows to about 500 mm in height .
2. Stinking Titan Arum ( Corpse Flower )
A flower taller than a man , stinking strongly of putrefying roadkill and colored deep burgundy to actually mimic rotting flesh … sounds like something fun to witness , does n’t it ?
But Indonesia ’s titan arum — or “ corpse flower ” as known by locals — is a real , if rare , phenomenon , pollinated in the wild by carrion - seeking insects .
1. Venus Fly Trap
The leaves of Venus ’ FlyTrap open wide .
On the leaves are short , stiff hairs called trigger hairs ; when anything stimulates them , the two lobes of the leaf snap shut trapping whatever is inside .
The trap will shut in less than a second .
When the leaves close over food , the cilia , finger - like projections , keep larger insects inside .

Return to Fallujah
Three years after the devastating US assault , our correspondent enters besieged Iraqi city left without clean water , electricity and medicine
By Patrick Cockburn
Fallujah is more difficult to enter than any city in the world .
On the road from Baghdad I counted 27 checkpoints , all manned by well - armed soldiers and police .
“ The siege is total , ” says Dr Kamal in Fallujah Hospital as he grimly lists his needs , which include everything from drugs and oxygen to electricity and clean water .
The last time I tried to drive to Fallujah , several years ago , I was caught in the ambush of an American fuel convoy and had to crawl out of the car and lie beside the road with the driver while US soldiers and guerrillas exchanged gunfire .
The road is now much safer but nobody is allowed to enter Fallujah who does not come from there and can prove it through elaborate identity documents .
The city has been sealed off since November 2004 when United States Marines stormed it in an attack that left much of the city in ruins .
Its streets , with walls pock - marked with bullets and buildings reduced to a heap of concrete slabs , still look as if the fighting had finished only a few weeks ago .
I went to look at the old bridge over the Euphrates from whose steel girders Fallujans had hanged the burnt bodies of two American private security men killed by guerrillas “ “ the incident that sparked the first battle of Fallujah .
The single - lane bridge is still there , overlooked by the remains of a bombed or shelled building whose smashed roof overhangs the street and concrete slabs are held in place by rusty iron mesh .
The police chief of Fallujah , Colonel Feisal Ismail Hassan al - Zubai , was trying to show that his city was on the mend .
As we looked at the bridge a small crowd gathered and an elderly man in a brown coat shouted : “ We have no electricity , we have no water . ”
Others confirmed that Fallujah was getting one hour ’s electricity a day .
Colonel Feisal said there was not much he could do about the water or electricity though he did promise a man that a fence of razor wire outside his restaurant would be removed .
Fallujah may be better than it was , but it still has a very long way to go .
Hospital doctors confirm that they are receiving few gunshot or bomb blast victims since the Awakening movement drove al - Qa’ida from the city over the past six months , but people still walk warily in the streets as if they expected firing to break out at any minute .
Colonel Feisal , a former officer in Saddam Hussein ’s Special Forces , cheerfully admits that before he was chief of police , “ I was fighting the Americans ” .
His brother Abu Marouf , a former guerrilla commander , controls 13,000 fighters of the anti-al - Qa’ida Awakening movement in and around Fallujah .
The colonel stressed that the streets of Fallujah were now wholly safe but his convoy drove at speed and was led by a policeman , his face hidden by a white balaclava , on top of a vehicle holding a machine gun and frantically gesturing oncoming vehicles out of the way .
The police station is large and protected by concrete and earth barriers .
Just as we reached the inner courtyard we saw signs that the battle against al - Qa’ida may be over but arrests go on .
From another part of the police station there emerged a line of 20 prisoners , each with his eyes covered by a white blindfold , gripping the back of the clothes of the prisoner in front of him .
The prisoners reminded me of photographs of men blinded by gas in the First World War stumbling along behind a single man who could see and who , in this case , was a prison guard .
There are new buildings in the main street .
I used to eat at a kebab restaurant called Haji Hussein , which was one of the best in Iraq .
Then , as the occupation went on , I started attracting a lot of hostile stares .
The manager suggested it might be safer if I ate upstairs in an empty room , and soon after it was destroyed by an American bomb .
It has now been rebuilt in gaudy colours and seemed to be doing good business .
At one time Fallujah had a population of 600,000 , but none of the officials in the city seemed to know how many there are now .
Col Feisal is hopeful of investment and took us to a white , new building called the Fallujah Business Development Centre , which had been partly funded by a branch of the US State Department .
Tall American soldiers were guarding a business development conference .
“ It has attracted one American investor so far , ” said a uniformed American adviser hopefully .
“ My name is Sarah and I am in psychological operations , ” said another US officer and proudly showed us around a newly established radio Fallujah .
At the other end of the city we crossed over the iron bridge built in about 1930 and now the only link with the far side of the Euphrates .
There is a modern bridge half a mile down river but it has been taken over by the American army and , say locals , used as a vehicle park .
On the far side of the bridge , past beds of tall bullrushes where people escaping the city during the sieges of 2004 tried to hide , there is a building eviscerated by bombs on one side of the road .
On the other side is the hospital whose officials US commanders used to accuse of systematically exaggerating the number of those killed by American bombing .
When I asked what the hospital lacked Dr Kamal said wearily : “ Drugs , fuel , electricity , generators , a water treatment system , oxygen and medical equipment . ”
It was difficult not to think that American assistance might have gone to the hospital rather than the business development centre .
Colonel Feisal said things were getting better but he was mobbed by black - clad women shouting that their children had not been treated .
“ Every day 20 children die here , ” said one .
“ Seven in this very room . ”
The doctors said that they were tending their patients as best they could .
“ The Americans provide us with nothing , ” said one mother who was cradling a child .
“ They bring us only destruction . ”

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A Democratic proposal to curb rising home foreclosures by changing bankruptcy law failed a key test vote in the U.S. Senate on Thursday .
In a largely party - line vote , Republicans blocked the measure from moving ahead , although lawmakers said it may be reconsidered later , possibly with amendments .
As proposed , the bill would let bankruptcy judges erase some mortgage debt ; spend more money on fixing abandoned properties and funding debt counseling ; and give businesses a tax break .
The White House had threatened to veto the bill .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a plan to give the U.S. economy a $ 146 billion election - year boost through tax rebates and other measures to stave off a possible recession by boosting business and consumer spending .
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) and House Minority Leader John Boehner speak at a press conference about the passage of a bipartisan economic stimulus package by the House of Representative on Capitol Hill in Washington , DC January 29 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Joshua Roberts
The plan , which passed by a vote of 385-35 and is backed by President George W. Bush , includes tax rebates of up to $ 600 for individuals and $ 1,200 for married couples , plus $ 300 per child .
The legislation also includes tax breaks to encourage business investment in new equipment .
It now goes to the Senate , where Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said it would be taken up quickly .
The Nevada Democrat said he expects a number of amendments to be offered to the bill .
But backers of the House bill are concerned that demands in the Senate to spend more for roads and other programs will slow down the legislation .
Lawmakers are aiming to get a bill to Bush ’s desk by mid-month and any changes in the Senate would mean further negotiations with the House and the White House to work out their disagreements .
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said the Senate should approve the House - passed version to avoid delays .
“ This is not a time to get into some kind of testing of wills between the two congressional bodies .
This is a time to show that we can rise above partisanship , do something important , and do it quickly , ” McConnell said .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , a California Democrat , and House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio , also urged the Senate to accept the House - passed package that the two leaders negotiated with the White House .

Lawmakers are hoping the rebates and business incentives will spur consumer and corporate spending and keep the economy from dipping into a recession ahead of the November presidential and congressional elections .
U.S. economic growth is expected to slow this year in the face of a downturn in the housing market , a subprime mortgage crisis , a tightening credit market and rising oil prices .
ALTERNATIVE OFFERED IN SENATE
The House plan would cost the federal treasury nearly $ 146 billion this year and almost $ 15 billion next year , according to the latest estimates by the Joint Tax Committee .
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus , a Montana Democrat , has offered an alternative that would provide a flat $ 500 rebate to all eligible people , $ 1,000 for couples and $ 300 per child .
Seniors with Social Security and other income of at least $ 3,000 would also be eligible for the rebates .
While most economists expect the U.S. economy to slow significantly this year , it is unclear whether a full - blown recession is in the offing .
Stronger - than - expected orders in December for U.S. - made durable goods , which include big - ticket items such as aircraft and appliances , suggested the economy may not be as bad as some had thought .
The Commerce Department said new orders for the long - lasting goods rose 5.2 percent last month , well above the 1.5 percent increase forecast by economists in a Reuters poll .
The economic outlook could become clearer on Friday when the government releases the January employment report .
In December the unemployment rate jumped to 5 percent , from 4.7 percent in November .
Investors were unnerved by a scant 18,000 new jobs created in December .
They are expecting that a modest 63,000 new jobs were created this month .
The Senate Finance Committee is set to consider its proposal on Wednesday .
That plan , with an estimated cost of about $ 156 billion , would also extend unemployment insurance benefits and provide some additional business tax breaks .
A proposed $ 500 per individual and $ 1,000 per couple rebate in the Senate package would go to all tax filers who report at least $ 3,000 in income for 2007 .
Seniors with Social Security income also would be eligible for the rebate .
Under the House - passed measure , low - income individuals who did not earn enough to pay income taxes would get a $ 300 rebate , plus the child credit .
The House proposal would phase out rebates for individuals earning more than $ 75,000 in taxable income and for married couples earning more than $ 150,000 .
The Senate proposal has no income caps .

It combines PyGame , PySight , a projector and lasers .
You point the laser at Marshie and the isight camera detects if the laser is on target , and if so , he blows up .
Very cool stuff indeed .
His game depends on the Macintosh PySight library for video capture , but is otherwise cross platform .

For years , blue - ribbon panels of experts have sounded the alarm about a looming shortage of scientists , mathematicians and engineers in the U.S. -- making dire predictions of damage to the national economy , threats to security and loss of status in the world .
There also seemed to be an attractive solution : coax more women to these traditionally male fields .
But there was not much public discussion about the reasons more women are not pursuing careers in these fields until 2005 , when then Harvard University president Lawrence Summers offered his personal observations .
Blackwater critics to Pentagon : Do n't say we did n't warn you Jason Rhyne
Published : Monday December 24 , 2007
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Defense and legal experts issued two years worth of warnings to the Pentagon about its heavy reliance on Blackwater Worldwide and other private security firms in Iraq -- and watched as the Defense Department continued to expand its use of the contractors , according to a new report .
In a series of memos , letters and in - person meetings with high - level officials in the US and Iraq , critics had warned of a " lack of control " over the private guards , writes the the Washington Post 's Steve Fainaru .
But despite a growing number of incidents in which Blackwater employees allegedly shot and killed Iraqi civilians , the US government was slow to act .
" We set this thing up for failure from the beginning , " a retired Marine colonel who advised Iraqi military forces in 2004 told the Post .
" We 're just sorting it out now ... I still think , from a pure counterinsurgency standpoint , armed contractors are an inherently bad idea , because you cannot control the quality , you cannot control the action on the ground , but you 're held responsible for everything they do . "
Pentagon and State Department officials did not take " substantive action to regulate private security companies until Blackwater guards opened fire Sept. 16 at a Baghdad traffic circle , killing 17 Iraqi civilians and provoking protests over the role of security contractors in Iraq , " according to the Post .
More than a year prior , however , the paper says that US intelligence officials on Iraq 's National Intelligence Committee had been urged to reign in Blackwater .
" Maj. Gen. Hussein Kamal , who heads the [ Iraqi ] Interior Ministry 's intelligence directorate , called on U.S. authorities to crack down on private security companies , " reports the Post .
" U.S. military officials told Kamal that Blackwater was under State Department authority and outside their control , according to notes of the meeting .
The matter was dropped . "
After a 2006 Pentagon order authorizing contractors to use deadly force took effect , the American Bar Association and the US Chamber of Commerce both criticized the move .
" But neither the military nor the State Department set guidelines for regulating tens of thousands of hired guns on the battlefield , " writes Fainaru .
" Oversight was left to overburdened government contracting officers or the companies themselves , which conducted their own investigations when a shooting incident occurred . "
A senior State Department official told the paper that he was not aware of any significant warnings .
Michael Arrighi , a private security manager in Iraq since 2004 , said that Pentagon attention to the free - for - all conduct of contractors had been woefully late in arriving .
" The reality is the military has not had any oversight on this issue until recently , " Arrighi said .
" We could hire the Rockettes and give them guns , and they would n't know .
It was a total wasteland . "
The contractors have earned few friends in Iraq , added Arrighi .
" They 're universally despised in the Green Zone , " he said .
" ' Universally despised ' is probably a kind way to put it . "

To give her full credit ( and she surely deserved it ) , Andre Norton seldom wrote a book that seemed as if she had phoned it in .
She played on similar themes , settings , characters , plots , but she made them seem fresh .
She managed her tropes with great skill , and kept the pages turning with tireless energy .
Once in a great while however , she missed her usual mark .
Wheel of Stars , for me , was a slog to get through .
It never quite committed to a particular genre , for one thing .
At first blush it seems to be headed toward a classic cursed - village plot , but then it swerves off into a confused melange of time travel ( or possibly parallel worlds ) , Atlantis or Mu or some other undefined sunken world , reincarnation , mind powers and clairvoyance , astrology , and ancient wars between good and evil .
And finally , as if that ’s not enough , it throws in a cave full of bodies in cold sleep .
Topped off by the fastest romance that I ’ve seen in the Norton canon .

We 're not exactly sure why , but we never really had a feeling that Asus would n't be able to move a copious amount of these things .
Nevertheless , DigiTimes has it that Asus actually sold through 350,000 Eee PCs in a single quarter , beating industry expectations by a solid 50,000 units .
Also of note , the report mentions that Asus is planning to launch the little bugger into Best Buy stores in the US while also kicking off sales in Japan next year , so there should plenty of opportunities to grab one if you 've somehow missed out thus far .
April 9 , 2007 Electric engines have a very unsexy image ; environmentally friendly hybrids and plug - in vehicles could n't be further from the minds of most high performance motorsport fans .
The battery - powered Killacycle , however , is raising eyebrows at the dragstrip after smashing the electric vehicle quarter - mile speed record with a very respectable 8.168 seconds @ 155.78 mph earlier this week .
Video here .
The bike is fuelled entirely by the world 's most powerful Li-Ion battery cells ; the M1 from A123 Systems .
990 of the small , rechargeable cells combine to produce a 375 volt , 1575 amp , 7.5 kW / hr battery pack .
The bike 's peak output is over 350 horsepower , compared to the approximately 240 horsepower of this year 's MotoGP missiles .
Top - fuel drag bikes , which make over 1000 horsepower and out - accelerate an F14 jet fighter with their massive power and grip , are currently running times about two seconds quicker than the Killacycle - but each run down the strip for these animal machines burns over 4 gallons of expensive , explosive NitroMethane .
The Killacycle , by comparison , uses about 7 cents worth of electricity per run , will make about 7 runs between charges , and takes about 10 minutes on the charger to fully prime .
Check out this YouTube video of the Killacycle setting its recent world record .
The sound is amazing , like an enormous electric drill .
Most of the sound is actually created by the tyres and chain .
We wish owner / designer Bill Dube , rider Scott Pollacheck and the rest of the Killacycle team all the best as they work on breaking into the " magic 7s " in the coming months .
Someday in the distant future , your grandkids will be hugging their Microsoft Robot Friend , browsing the Weboverse on Internet Explorer 29 , and going to a rock concert held by Steve Ballmer 's head , and they 'll have never known the evil , nasty Microsoft we grew up with .
Starting today , Microsoft has dropped a bit of a bombshell on the computing community by jumping on the " open " bandwagon and altering the way they do business with third - party developers .
According to a wordy press release issued by the company , the Redmond giant will begin embracing an open attitude by publishing documentation for all of its " high - volume product " APIs free of charge , will detail patents it holds and applications that cover its protocols ( to avoid nasty , Linux - like mixups , we assume ) , and will provide a " covenant not to sue open source developers for development or non-commercial distribution of implementations of these protocols . "
Sound like big news ?
They 've got a lot more to say on the matter -- hit the read link and learn all about cuddly new Microsoft .
In November , you ’ll be able to buy a new laptop that ’s spillproof , rainproof , dustproof and drop - proof .
It ’s fanless , it ’s silent and it weighs 3.2 pounds .
One battery charge will power six hours of heavy activity , or 24 hours of reading .
The laptop has a built - in video camera , microphone , memory - card slot , graphics tablet , game - pad controllers and a screen that rotates into a tablet configuration .
And this laptop will cost $ 200 .
The computer , if you had n’t already guessed , is the fabled “ $ 100 laptop ” that ’s been igniting hype and controversy for three years .
It ’s an effort by One Laptop Per Child ( laptop.org ) to develop a very low - cost , high - potential , extremely rugged computer for the two billion educationally underserved children in poor countries .
The concept : if a machine is designed smartly enough , without the bloat of standard laptops , and sold in large enough quantities , the price can be brought way , way down .
Maybe not down to $ 100 , as O.L.P.C. originally hoped , but low enough for developing countries to afford millions of them — one per child .
The laptop is now called the XO , because if you turn the logo 90 degrees , it looks like a child .
O.L.P.C. slightly turned its strategy when it decided to offer the machine for sale to the public in the industrialized world — for a period of two weeks , in November .
The program is called “ Give 1 , Get 1 , ” and it works like this .
You pay $ 400 ( www.xogiving.org).
One XO laptop ( and a tax deduction ) comes to you by Christmas , and a second is sent to a student in a poor country .
APPLE boss Steve Jobs yesterday unveiled the computer giant 's latest eye - catching innovation : one of his shits in a simple white box .
The billionaire pioneer said he was inspired after the company developed the world 's thinnest laptop computer .
“ We took most of the useful things out of it and doubled the price .
The early demand has been incredible .
“ I was then struck by an amazing idea : How much would you pay for one of my shits in a box ? ”
Jobs said that the first 100 shits will be his , but because of his busy schedule most of the mass market shits will be built in the Far East and carry his personal endorsement .
Carl Knutz , an early adopter of San Andreas , California , said he would pay $ 1,999 for the shit , but only if it was ultra-slim and back - lit and unable to run the most commonly available software programmes .
He said : “ I want a shit in a box that sets me apart from the crowd and tells people that I am young , hip , and creative . ”
Bobby Killitz , 23 , also of San Andreas , said he would hold on to see if Steve Jobs would produce a cheaper shit later this year after the initial frenzy had died down .
He said : “ I think within six months he will either halve the price of the shit or lay two of his logs in there for the same price .
He ’s pulled that kind of trick before . ”
HAVING narrowly escaped with his life from the theocrats of his native Iran , Afshin Ellian likes the relaxed , cerebral atmosphere of Leiden , the Dutch town where he now teaches law .
But this 40 - year - old professor is disillusioned by a Europe which he says has become too soft - minded in its dealings with Islam .
It is a sign of the times , he thinks , that the country where he settled 17 years ago is about to say goodbye to Ayaan Hirsi Ali , a Somali - born Dutch politician who has sharply criticised the Muslim tradition in which she was raised .
Having got into trouble because she once fibbed to the Dutch immigration authorities , Miss Hirsi Ali is moving to America .
Some of Mr Ellian 's criticisms of Europe are philosophical : it is too cynical and mercantilist a place to wage a war of ideas in defence of the Enlightenment .
Some are personal : “ Five years ago , my Afghan sister - in - law emigrated to the United States , where she now works , pays taxes and takes part in public life .
If she had turned up in Europe , she would still be undergoing treatment from social workers for her trauma — and she still would n't have got a job or won acceptance as a citizen . ”
Among Europeans of Middle Eastern heritage , Mr Ellian 's views are rather unusual .
But they would draw applause from many Europe - watchers in the United States , in whose eyes the mishandling of Islam has become the latest and gravest of Europe 's self - inflicted wounds .
During the cold war , America used to berate its European friends for underestimating the Soviet threat and failing to spend enough money on their own defence .
A little later , Europe was rightly scolded for not doing enough to stop the bloodshed in its own Balkan backyard .
These days , the handling of Islam is near the top of the long list of subjects on which the American consensus differs sharply , and increasingly , from the European one .
A different view
Two recent events have crystallised American views .
Late last year , when Muslims in many of France 's slum - suburbs erupted in almost uncontrollable violence , this was seen as proof of Europe 's failure either to give the newcomers a decent economic life or to confront extremism successfully .
Then , earlier this year , Danish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad caused worldwide riots .
This was a sign both of official Europe 's weakness in defence of free speech — but also , for some Americans , of a godless continent 's failure to understand the depth of other people 's faith .
In running their economies , observes Charles Kupchan , one of Washington 's veteran Europe - watchers , the Europeans know what is needed but lack the firmness to do the right thing .
When it comes to Islam , they just do n't know what to do .
It does not cheer America that , in several parts of Europe , some Muslims have found a political voice in alliance with the anti-establishment left .
Britain's “ Stop the War ” movement , which organised huge rallies against the war on Saddam Hussein 's regime , is a curious partnership between supporters of the international Muslim Brotherhood and largely non-believing socialists .
Tariq Ramadan , a Swiss - based scholar who has also taught at Oxford University , has won a large following with his mixture of loyalty to Islam 's holy texts and opposition to global capitalism .
In some transatlantic squabbles , the American message has been delivered more in sorrow than in anger .
We wish you Europeans would do the right thing ( about labour markets , say , or farm subsidies ) both for your own sake and for the sake of the global economy — but in the end it will be your loss if you do n't .
But when it comes to the handling of radical Islam , the argument is getting more rancorous .
That is partly because Americans see a threat to their own security from a Europe whose citizens can travel easily to the United States .
The September 2001 attacks , remember , were planned in Hamburg .
Europe has become a “ field of jihad ” , and it may be the part of the world where America faces the greatest threat from Islamic extremism .
So says Daniel Benjamin , a former White House adviser who is now a terrorism - watcher at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies , a think - tank .
Mr Benjamin makes a demographic projection of a kind more often heard on American lips than European ones .
The Muslim population of the European Union 's existing 25 members may on present trends double from about 15 m now to 30 m by 2025 .
And that leaves out EU - applicant Turkey , with an almost entirely Muslim population of around 70m .
To be sure , it is by no means clear just how many Muslims there are in Europe .
In France , whose secular authorities never ask a religious question on a census form , the number of people of Muslim heritage is generally given as 5 m , or 8 % of the population .
But that is only an educated guess .
Some studies , extrapolating from the difference in birth rates , say the figure might rise to 20 % of the population by 2020 .
Well , maybe .
In a forthcoming book , two scholars at America 's Brookings Institution , Jonathan Laurence and Justin Vaisse , say this estimate is much too high .
It underestimates the relative fecundity of non-Muslim Frenchwomen ( compared with , say , their Italian sisters ) and the fact that Muslims seem to have fewer babies the longer they have been in France .
In fact , there is something weirdly paradoxical about the Muslim scene in every major European country .
The secular French state has given mosques and clerics a privileged role as representatives of Islam ; yet France 's Muslims are as lax in attending their mosques as Catholics are about going to church ( though Muslims are better at private prayer and observing religious fasts ) .
In Germany , the great majority of the country 's Muslims have their origin in Turkey .
German
Turks tell pollsters that they are happy with their host country , and with the principle of separation of church and state ; but they also seem to be growing more fervent in their attachment to Islam .
In one survey of German Turks , 83 % said they were “ rather ” or “ strictly ” religious , and the number of those who think women should cover their head is rising .
Britain 's authorities , both national and local , have devoted much attention to making the country 's nearly 2 m Muslims feel more at home .
But Muslims remain at the bottom of the economic pile .
The main reason is that , compared with British Hindus and Sikhs , or even French Muslim women , very few of Britain 's Muslim women — mostly from Pakistan or Bangladesh — go out to work .
Yet some Muslim sub - groups , such as the Ismailis who came from southern Asia via East Africa , have soared ahead .
Islam itself is no barrier to economic advancement .
Amid all the confusion , there is one clear trend among European Muslims .
Islam is increasingly important as a symbol of identity .
About a third of French schoolchildren of Muslim origin see their faith rather than a passport or skin colour as the main thing that defines them .
Young British Muslims are inclined to see Islam ( rather than the United Kingdom , or the city where they live ) as their true home .
It does not help that all Europeans , whatever their origin , nowadays find themselves “ identity - shopping ” as the European Union competes with the older nation - states for their loyalty .
No wonder many young European Muslims find that the umma— worldwide Islam — tugs hardest at their heart - strings .
The argument gets blunter
In the short run , at least , there seems little chance of Europeans and Americans finding a common language over Islam .
As many non-Muslim Europeans see things , it is American foreign policy — in Iraq , above all — that has radicalised their Muslim compatriots .
If European Muslims are anti-Western , they say , it is largely because of the Bush administration 's misdeeds .
In its gentler moments , the administration is sensitive to European touchiness .
Americans must be “ careful and modest ” in telling other parts of the world how to solve questions of identity and religion , says Daniel Fried , the State Department 's top man for European affairs .
But , in his careful , modest way , Mr Fried makes some firm points about Europe 's difficulties in absorbing Muslim newcomers .
Europeans , he thinks , are still too inclined to see these Muslims as “ unwanted foreigners ” .
In facing a challenge like Muslim immigration , “ exclusionary nationalism will not help . ”
At the same time , Mr Fried fears , some European governments are not very adept at distinguishing between peaceful piety and the more violent kind .
He insists that the United States has a “ deep and legitimate interest ” in the battle of ideas between Islam 's moderates and extremists in all parts of the world — and that it will do its best to support the moderate ones in Europe .
Yet , for Europe 's angriest Muslims , their host countries ' gravest sin lies precisely in their alignment with America — both as partners in the global capitalist system and as supporters , in varying degrees , of American foreign policy .
So the suggestion that America may have something to teach Europe about how to make Muslims feel more comfortable ( and therefore less extreme ) looks at first sight rather strange .
It is , in fact , by no means absurd .
Whatever the defects in Muslim eyes of American foreign policy , the United States has a substantial Muslim population which on the whole seems pretty comfortable there , and has produced some of the world 's best Islamic thinkers .
That spectacular Middle East - looking mosque at the top of this article is in fact in Dearborn , Michigan .
For the same reason as in France — the fact that the state does not like asking questions about religion — the United States has a hard time estimating the size of its Muslim population : the guesses range between 3 m and 7 m .
But , whatever the precise number , America 's Muslims neither see themselves , nor are seen by other Americans , as being radically at odds with American society .
When Americans scold Europe for its “ exclusionary nationalism ” , it is partly because they feel that their country has more successfully embraced a variety of religions , including Islam .
Some American Muslims would quibble with that claim : polls show a rising percentage of Americans with negative views about Islam , and Muslim organisations report a rising number of incidents of harassment or discrimination .
But , broadly speaking , freedom to practise and preach Islam is protected by the American system .
If America is better at absorbing its Muslims , this may to some degree be a matter of luck .
The majority of Muslim Americans are either upwardly mobile migrants from southern Asia or Iran , or black American converts who lack any personal links to Islam 's heartland .
Many European cities , on the other hand , contain an exceptionally volatile Muslim under - class which is poor , alienated and intertwined ( by family ties ) with the hungriest and angriest parts of the Muslim world .
But it is not just luck .
The difference between America and Europe in dealing with Islam reaches down to some basic questions of principle , such as the limits of free speech and free behaviour .
America 's political culture places huge importance on the right to religious difference , including the right to displays of faith which others might consider eccentric .
In the words of Reza Aslan , a popular Iranian - American writer on Islam , “ Americans are used to exuberant displays of religiosity . ”
So the daily prostrations of a devout Muslim are less shocking to an American than to a lukewarm European Christian .
American society is open to religious arguments — and to new approaches to old theological questions — in a way that Europe is not .
In general , Americans are more optimistic — or less gloomy — about Islam than Europeans .
A poll published this week by the Pew Research Centre says that Americans who see Muslim - Western relations as “ generally bad ” outnumber those who take the opposite view by 55 % to 32 % .
Not exactly cheery .
But in Germany the pessimists are ahead by 70 % to 23 % , in France by 66 % to 33 % , and in Britain by 61 % to 28 % .
Some things are off - limits even in America .
In Britain , for example , members of the radical ( but non-violent )
Hizb ut - Tahrir movement have appeared on television to express their rejection of the principles of liberal democracy and secular justice .
That is unlikely to happen in America .
Nor would it be possible , in any American context , to argue for the superiority of sharia — Islamic law — over laws passed by elected law - makers .
But the right to say almost anything on most other subjects is deeply entrenched in America .
This means that , whatever weapons the parties in America 's religious arguments try to use , they do not usually include attempts to deny the other side 's right to speak .
The result is that there is more space for hard religious argument .
No law restrains that quite large body of American thought which is critical not just of extreme readings of Islam but of Islam itself — arguing that the warrior ethos of the faith 's earlier centuries was one of its essential features , not just a regrettable excess .
But the American system also guarantees the rights of those who argue for the opposite view : that Islam is basically a peaceful , universalist faith which restricts rather than enjoins the use of violence .
This does not mean that America has a monopoly of wisdom in distinguishing peaceful Muslim citizens from the other sort .
During the 1990s , a Washington - based group called the American Muslim Council and its leader , Abdurahman Alamoudi , were hailed by the American government as valuable people to talk to .
In 2004 , Mr Alamoudi was given a 23 - year jail term on terrorism - related charges .
But one merit of the American system is that , even when hard questions arise about the trade - off betweeen freedom of speech and security , there is a robust legal culture which enables people to fight back if their rights are infringed .
Last year some American Muslims who had been detained in New York state on returning from a conference in Canada promptly filed a lawsuit against the federal authorities — and they were helped to do so by the American Civil Liberties Union .
The idea that freedom is the cornerstone of politics is one reason why people like Mr Ellian , that Iranian who fled to Leiden , look hopefully towards America .
His argument goes as follows .
Islam 's sacred texts can be read either in a spirit of militant intolerance or in a spirit of altruism — and the latter can prevail only in conditions of hard , open - ended debate in which nobody holds back for fear of giving offence .
America 's free - speech culture may have a better chance of fostering such a debate than European political correctness .
It 's starting to change
There is no shortage of robust debate among European Muslims , but it is more about politics — especially left - wing politics — than about theology .
In Belgium , Muslims now have about a quarter of the seats in the regional government of Brussels .
In the municipal politics of Britain and the Netherlands , some radical Muslims quite often find themselves doing political business with other anti-establishment groups on the secular left , to the dismay of older immigrants .
During a recent contest in east London , the candidate for the new Respect party — a young Muslim lawyer — was chided by his co-religionists for sharing a platform with homosexuals .
But Abdurahman Jafar held his ground : “ We want equality for Muslims and we would seem insincere if we did n't stand together with other minorities who face discrimination . ”
The rhetoric that emerges from this sort of politics in a variety of European countries is not always attractive to American ears , since one of the few common denominators between angry Muslims and secular leftists is hostility to America .
But , given a choice between pious self - segregation and plunging into public affairs , many European Muslims are choosing the latter .
In places like Amsterdam , coalition - building between Muslims and others is producing some positive results .
Ahmed Aboutaleb , a Moroccan - born city councillor in Amsterdam , is proud of the fact that he was handsomely re-elected this year — on a moderate centre - left ticket — by a combination of native Dutch votes as well as those of Muslim immigrants .
He says that the relatively benign inter-ethnic climate in Amsterdam reflects the town hall 's efforts to make all races and religions feel part of a “ united camp ” .
As a result , he claims , the risk of some new incident setting off a general upsurge of tit - for - tat violence between Christians and Muslims ( as happened when the film - maker Theo van Gogh was murdered by a Muslim extremist in 2004 ) has been greatly reduced , at any rate in Amsterdam ( though he admits the risk is still rather higher in other Dutch cities ) .
Of course , this does not mean that there is no longer any cause to feel concern about Europe 's ability to absorb its assorted Muslim peoples .
The latest study of the 900,000 Dutch Muslims , by Amsterdam University , suggests that the feelings of “ indignation and humiliation ” experienced by Muslims are worsening , not fading away .
Such feelings are especially strong among second - generation Muslims , who believe they have a solid claim to a comfortable place in Dutch society but still reckon they are being rejected .
The good news is that not everybody who harbours these feelings is retreating into the margins of extremism and violence .
A process of political assimilation is , hesitantly but visibly , taking place .
This will change the politics of Europe .
It may affect Europe 's relations with the outside world .
But , in the process , Muslims will also change — and perhaps settle into their new homelands as comfortably as most American Muslims have done .
Tom Ray had studied evolution in the real world , but found it a frustrating subject .
He wanted to be able to watch its effects on thousands of generations of organisms , evolving there in front of him .
Years before , an MIT computer hacker had introduced him to the idea of self - replicating computer code in a virtual machine .
He wondered if he might be able to build some kind of artificial life or a - life software , that would let him run experiments in evolution .
He built a computer program to model a virtual computer similar to the one in the Core Wars game , and called his virtual world Tierra .
However , Ray added a new feature to the virtual world that had been missing from Core Wars : mutation .
Computers are generally programmed in textual languages of words , symbols and numbers that humans can understand -- languages like C , Java and BASIC .
However , the integrated circuit at the heart of the machine only understands a much simpler language of binary numbers .
To add two numbers together , you might need to read them from memory into spaces called registers , add the two registers together , and then write the result out to memory again .
Each of those small steps would be represented by a series of binary numbers .
Your web browser software consists of millions of binary instructions .
They were assembled automatically by software called a compiler , following instructions written in the original programming language -- the " source code " .
It 's possible to write machine code directly , but only if the program is fairly small .
The programs in Core Wars and Tierra are only a few tens of bytes , maybe a couple of hundred at most , and are written in machine language .
Ray altered the Tierra system to simulate a computer with a slight flaw .
Every now and again , the machine code instruction which copied data between memory cells would randomly flip one of the bits during copying .
If the data being copied was the machine code of the program itself as it tried to reproduce , the result would be a slightly different mutant program .
High - end computers use special error - correcting memory , specifically to avoid bits getting flipped .
They do this because if you flip bits in the machine code of a piece of software , it will almost certainly crash .
Conventional wisdom before Tierra was that randomly flipping bits of a machine code program could never result in improvement to that program -- the chances against it were astronomical .
Like in the real world , Tierra had natural selection .
Mutant programs that crashed were eliminated as unfit .
In addition , a process called The Reaper would pick off the oldest programs to free up space -- meaning this new virtual world had death , as well .
Ray decided to start his Tierra system off with a population of the most simple programs possible .
He wrote a piece of code that simply copied itself elsewhere in memory then spawned the copy .
It was 80 bytes long , so he named it 80 .
He spread a few 80s through the Tierra system 's memory , and started the clock .
For the first few thousand generations , nothing much of interest happened .
There were a few minor mutations that did n't break the code , but that was about it .
Before long , though , there were a number of 81s - - mutants with an extra byte of program code .
A little later , a 79 appeared .
Because the 79 had one less byte of code , it took less time to reproduce , and was more successful than the 80 or 81 .
It began to take over the Tierra ecosystem .
Next , something astonishing happened .
A 45 appeared .
Ray was initially mystified ; he 'd written the simplest code he could imagine and it was 80 bytes .
A 79 seemed reasonable , but how could a 45 reproduce in only just over half the space ?
Examining the code of 45 provided the answer -- and a new surprise .
The 45 was a parasite : instead of reproducing itself , it hunted for the reproductive code of an 80 , then called that code .
It was almost like a biological virus , which reproduces by inserting its DNA into a host cell and using the cell 's reproductive apparatus to build more viruses .
No parasite code had been written at any stage in Tierra 's development , and the system had not been designed to support parasites ; the fact that one program could make use of code in another was an accident .
Yet the system had reproduction , death , natural selection and mutation , and that seemed to be enough to cause parasites to appear from nowhere .
Suddenly Tierra was an ecosystem in balance .
If there were too many 45s , then the 80s would die out , unable to compete ; and then the 45s would die out too , unable to reproduce without a host .
It turned out that the 79s were immune to the 45 parasite .
Ray placed some 45s in a Tierra world heavy with 79s , and soon a new 51 parasite appeared which was able to use 79s to reproduce .
If the system was left running long enough , parasites of parasites began to appear .
Then came another surprise : after a long period of mutation and natural selection , another new program appeared .
This was a 22 , and it was completely self - contained , not a parasite .
Somehow Tierra had evolved a program that was smaller than any human being had managed to come up with .
The power of evolution had been demonstrated , but Ray was curious to see which elements of the system were required for evolution to work , and what ranges of frequency of mutation resulted in rapid evolution .
He tried turning off mutation completely , out of curiosity -- and was amazed to find that evolution carried on happening anyway !
It turned out that sometimes , two programs attempting to reproduce would choose the same location for their offspring , and would interact during reproduction .
One of the programs might be overwriting the same memory as the other , slightly behind , and then die from old age or be killed by another program .
The result would be a hybrid , with part of the code of one program and part of the code of the other .
Similar hybrids would occur if a parasite was busy reproducing using a host program , and that host program died .
In sexual reproduction in the real world , the male and female genetic material from the two sets of chromosomes gets spliced together via recombination .
Now it seemed Tierra had recombination too ; and recombination alone , with no mutation , was enough to lead to evolution through natural selection .
Whereas Biomorphs were bred by changing the parameters of a fixed algorithm , Tierra 's equivalent of DNA described operations to perform .
Like real DNA , it could alter the processes at work within the organism , change how it reproduced , and have a direct result on its evolutionary fitness .
Tierra , unlike Biomorphs , did not need a human to guide it .
