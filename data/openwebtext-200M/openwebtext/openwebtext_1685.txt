Printer Friendly ... PatchDiff2 Analysis and Decompilation Author : RolfRolles # Views : 10948
Now that PatchDiff2 is open - source , I release my IDB and the initial decompilation that I did .
You can find it here .
I met the author , Nicolas Pouvesle , at RECon 2008 , who told me of his upcoming plans to release this plugin .
He mentioned that the license would be friendly towards reverse engineering , so I asked him if I could decompile the plugin and release the source code .
We must have miscommunicated , because I could have sworn he gave me the green light .
When it was released , I spent about three days reverse engineering and decompiling it , resulting in the workproduct linked above .
I had intended to spend an extra couple of days on the decompilation to make sure it was functionally equivalent , if not byte - perfect ( which is always the ultimate goal ) .
After I finished the initial phase of the decompilation , I sent it over to Nicolas to solicit his feedback .
He informed me that releasing the source code would violate PatchDiff2's EULA .
Therefore , I abandoned the project .
As it stands , I never even tried to compile the source code , so I 'm afraid it 's not worth much beyond the mere curiosity .
Still , I 'm releasing this hoping that somebody might find it interesting .
The IDB itself is very thorough , e.g. all structures are recovered .
Enjoy .

Impressive decompilation , thanks for sharing !
DOUGLAS -
It was no fiesta on the Arizona - Mexico border for the driver of a shipment of pi�atas that looked like Disney characters .
U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Rob Daniels says officers at the Douglas port of entry stopped a tractor - trailer coming from Mexico for further inspection on Friday .
Officers found the tractor - trailer was loaded with papier - mache items , including 108 pi�atas in the likeness of Disney characters on their way to Thornton , Colo .
Officers seized the shipment for violation of intellectual property rights .
Assistant port Director Eli Villareal says the pi�atas may seem innocent , but shipments of illegal merchandise on a national scale can undermine the U.S. economy and " is a vital element in national security . "
The DZero detector at Fermilab .
As if potentially helping explain why the universe is made of matter were not enough , a trio of Fermilab theoretical physicists say a new DZero result could give weight to the belief that the story of matter has a sequel beyond the Standard Model .
The DZero collaboration at the lab 's Tevatron collider found that when particles called B mesons decay , they give rise to pairs of muons significantly more often than to pairs of antimuons .
Although the difference was just 1 percent , it was a much greater preference for the creation of matter versus antimatter than previous experiments had found -- and one too big for the Standard Model of particles and forces to explain .
This imbalance , known as asymmetry , is important because it explains why matter and antimatter , created in equal amounts in the big bang , did n't simply annihilate each other ; instead matter came to dominate , allowing people and planets to exist .
What caused the DZero result 's large deviation from Standard Model predictions is just as earth - shaking a mystery .
The answer could point to the completion of the Standard Model , missing only the theorized Higgs boson particle , or the creation of a new story line for a host of new particles in the saga of how matter in the universe behaves .
In their quest for a full explanation , scientists debate whether they are simply missing a chapter in the Standard Model or if they need a sequel that goes beyond the model , potentially including extra dimensions or a theory called supersymmetry that would double the number of known particles .
For those who believe the Standard Model is nearly complete , the discovery of the Higgs boson -- a theoretical particle that imparts mass to all the other particles - would close out the final chapter .
But for others who think that undiscovered physics properties exist - so - called new physics -- a sequel to the Standard Model is needed .
Bogdan A. Dobrescu , Patrick J. Fox , and Adam Martin fall into this camp .
They say the DZero data hint that not just one , but five Higgs bosons may exist , and that those Higgses interact with other particles more strongly than previously predicted .
Dobrescu , Fox , and Martin published the paper CP violation in Bs mixing from heavy Higgs exchange in arXiv , the particle physics repository of preprint publications .
While a single Higgs particle can exist within the framework of the Standard Model , the existence of whole families of Higgs bosons requires a Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model , in which every particle has a yet undiscovered superpartner of a heavier mass , requires the existence of whole families of Higgs bosons .
The fact that DZero found 1 percent more muons than antimuons produced in high - energy collisions between protons and antiprotons could be attributed to new particles , Martin says , particularly to five Higgs particles with similar masses -- three of neutral charge and one each of positive and negative charge .
This configuration is called the two - Higgs doublet model .
It ’s too early to tell definitively whether new physics beyond the Standard Model is at play , but the implications are there .
Fox equates the DZero data to a man in a dark room finding a box of matches ; he can look around , but still ca n’t see as clearly as if he had found the light switch .
To test their theory of why the DZero data shows such a large deviation from Standard Model predictions , physicists need to predict how the existence of a five - Higgs - boson world would affect other particles and then conduct experiments to find those effects .
Indirect evidence , such as refined measurements of the DZero data or searches at the Tevatron and the Large Hadron Collider for a meson decaying to a pair of muons or to a tau , could add more light to the room and reveal whether the next volume in the saga of the understanding of matter does indeed involve multiple Higgs bosons .
While the Tevatron can perform these indirect searches , it is too early to tell yet if the Higgs bosons would have masses the Tevatron can detect or would only be within reach of the higher - energy LHC .
You can hear more about the DZero asymmetry result and its possible implications for the universe and for research at the LHC during the one - hour science radio program " The World Revealed " on Carnegie - Mellon University 's WRCT 88.3 FM .
About six minutes into the WAV file of the station 's hourly programing begins the interview with Stefan Söldner - Rembold , a University of Manchester professor and co-spokesman of DZero ; Manfred Paulini , a Carnegie - Mellon University professor and member of CDF and CMS ; and Patrick Fox and Adam Martin , Fermilab theorists .
Update , June 18 , 2010 :
The DZero asymmetry result and how its sister experiment , CDF , will respond to it has been the talk of the blogosphere .
The study of the difference in the production of pairs of muons and pairs of antimuons in the decay of B mesons requires an extremely complicated analysis .
In essence , physicists must sort through hundreds of millions of collisions daily to analyze two very large data sets of particle decays and determine the difference to an incredible level of precision .
Because of the analysis ’ complexity , cross checking the DZero analysis requires a nearly duplicate analysis , not something that simply looks at the same underlying physics process .
Complexity also breeds debate , and sometimes rumors .
In particular , two rumors seem to have gained traction : that CDF already did a comparable study to DZero ’s that negates the DZero claim of a 1 percent predisposition of muons over antimuons , and that CDF for technical reasons cannot conduct an analysis that could confirm or deny the result .
First , did CDF already rule out the DZero result ?
No
As mentioned in the blogs Not Even Wrong and Resonaances , the CDF collaboration did release a sin( 2beta_s ) result a few weeks ago that looked at CP violation states and found the discrepancy between the amount of particles that decayed to matter versus antimatter in line with the Standard Model , the opposite of what DZero ’s study found .
The CDF study is an update of a 2007 meson decay analysis that both CDF and DZero conducted where both found discrepancies in the preference for decays to matter and antimatter .
The recent CDF update of this analysis , which is being submitted to the scientific journal Physical Review Letters , found a smaller discrepancy than in 2007 .
DZero has plans to conduct its own update .
However , comparing the updated CDF study and the current DZero asymmetry result is like comparing apples and oranges .
True , both studies look at CP violation in meson decays , which can be used to search for “ new physics ” beyond the Standard Model .
However , while the studies look at the same underlying physics , they use vastly different approaches and analysis methods that renders it impossible to draw a conclusion from the CDF study that would deny or confirm the DZero asysmmetry result , according to CDF leaders .
Also , the uncertainties of both measurements more than “ cover ” the disagreement -- so neither rules the other one out .
What the CDF study does do is highlight the need for CDF to conduct an apple - to - apple type study of the current DZero result that would have the potential to validate or invalidate it .
This brings up the second rumor : Can CDF cross check the DZero result ?
Yes
While there was some initial discussion , even among CDF collaborators , about whether CDF could perform the same search because the magnet construction in its detector differs from DZero's , CDF collaborators believe they can reach the same level of sensitivity as DZero to the decays .
CDF conducted a similar apple - to - apple type study several years ago , but with a much smaller dataset , not enough to make a judgment either way , according to collaboration leaders .
The DZero result is based on more than 6 inverse femtobarns in total integrated luminosity , corresponding to hundreds of trillions of collisions between protons and antiprotons in the Tevatron collider .
However , the success of CDF ’s past study , leads CDF collaborators to believe they can conduct a larger , comparable analysis , although in a slightly different fashion , than the past CDF study and the current DZero study .
The CDF collaboration announced at the Fermilab Users ' Meeting in early June that it will perform this analysis with its full data set .
The duration of the study will depend on the amount of preliminary work conducted , but collaborators estimate a result in time for a presentation at the winter 2011 physics conferences if the CDF search turns out to be as competitive as DZero's .
June 18 , 2010 : Zipping through space at nearly a million miles per day , NASA 's New Horizons probe is halfway to Pluto and just woke up for the first time in months to look around .
An artist 's concept of New Horizons .
" Our spacecraft is way out in exotic territory , in the middle of nowhere , " says Hal Weaver , New Horizons project scientist at Johns Hopkins University .
" And we have a lot to do . "
It 's the perfect opportunity to test New Horizon 's instruments before the probe reaches Pluto in 2015 .
" We do n't want to miss a single breathtaking moment during the Pluto encounter , " he says .
" So we 're checking everything out now to make sure we 're ship - shape and ready to go . "
The 9 weeks of testing commenced on May 25th .
Mission controllers plan a thorough checkout and recalibration of all seven science instruments onboard .
First up is LORRI , the Long - Range Reconnaissance Imager , one of the largest interplanetary telescopes ever flown .
" On July 14 , 2015 , the date of closest approach , we 'll be able to distinguish objects on Pluto as small as a football field , " says Weaver .
" That 's about 300 times better resolution than anything we have now . "
LORRI will be working together with " Ralph , " a spectrometer designed to probe the surface of Pluto at visible and infrared wavelengths .
Ralph will reveal Pluto 's temperature , color , and chemical composition .
" During the current tests , we 'll point both LORRI and Ralph at something in the sky to make sure they can be operated together with full sensitivity .
Since New Horizons is far from any large bodies right now , we 'll aim the cameras at a star field to test them . "
Space artist Ron Miller 's concept of hypothetical geysers and sundogs on Pluto .
Just after New Horizons passes Pluto in 2015 , Pluto will appear as a waning crescent to the spacecraft looking back at it .
Weaver speculates that during this phase LORRI might be able to spot hazes high in Pluto 's atmosphere or perhaps evidence for cryo-volcanism ( i.e. , volcanoes that spew icy cold material rather than hot magma ) on Pluto 's surface .
" During a flyby of Neptune in 1989 , Voyager 2 spotted dark streaks on Neptune 's moon Triton that appear to have been produced by geysers spewing dirty , frozen nitrogen particles .
We could see something similar on Pluto . "
Click here for information about New Horizon 's seven main science instruments .
As New Horizons passes into Pluto 's shadow in 2015 , a UV imaging spectrometer named " Alice " will look back toward the sun through Pluto 's atmosphere .
This should reveal how molecules in Pluto 's atmosphere absorb sunlight , and thus what the atmosphere is made of .
" We know the sun 's extreme brightness can make these activities difficult for our instruments .
So we 'll set up the same angles during the current testing to determine what we 'll really be able to see and what kinds of information can be pulled out . "
Cameras and spectrometers wo n't be the only busy instruments .
REX , New Horizon 's Radio Science EXperiment , will detect and observe radio signals coming all the way from NASA 's Deep Space Network on Earth .
" The way those signals bend as they pass through Pluto 's atmosphere will tell us a lot about the atmosphere 's pressure and thickness . "
The team is counting on test results to be " all systems go . "
If everything checks out , there 's a lot to look forward to .
" We have high hopes for this mission , " concludes Weaver .
" Pluto awaits .
The most exciting thing is that we do n't know what we 're going to see when we get there . "
Stay tuned for 2015 .

The Supreme Court ruled Monday that human rights advocates led by a USC professor could be prosecuted if they offered advice to a foreign terrorist group , even if the advice was to settle disputes peacefully .
The 6 - 3 decision upholds the 1996 law that makes it a crime for Americans to provide “ material support ” to a designated foreign terrorist group , including by offering them expert advice or training .
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said the need to combat terrorism trumped the concern over restricting freedom of speech .
The court , he said , agreed with Congress and the president that “ providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization — even seemingly benign support — bolsters the terrorist activities of that organization . ”
Monday ’s ruling sends a warning to international aid groups and charities that even good - will measures could ensnare them in a criminal prosecution .
Until now , the government has used the law mostly to prosecute those who sent money to a terrorist group or who traveled abroad to undergo training at an Al Qaeda camp .
“ All this ruling does is it continues to marginalize Americans .
It does n’t marginalize terrorist groups , ” said Amjad Atallah , co-director of the Middle East task force at the liberal New America Foundation in Washington .
“ It tells Americans you ca n’t be engaged in conflict resolution in these areas . ”
The suit challenging the law was filed 12 years ago by USC professor Ralph Fertig , a founder of the Humanitarian Law Project in Los Angeles .
Fertig , who says he opposes violence , said he wanted to advocate for the Kurdish people before a United Nations tribunal , but he feared that in the process he might make contact with members of the Kurdistan Workers Party , known as the PKK , which has been designated as a terrorist group by the State Department .
He argued that the words “ advice ” and “ training ” should not be read broadly to cover those who advised others to steer away from violence and terrorism .
Fertig won before federal judges in California , who said parts of the anti-terrorism law were vague and conflicted with the 1st Amendment .
U.S. Solicitor General Elena Kagan , now a Supreme Court nominee , appealed on behalf of the Obama administration and won a reversal Monday in Holder vs. Humanitarian Law Project .
Joining Roberts in the ruling for the government were Justices John Paul Stevens , Antonin Scalia , Anthony M. Kennedy , Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr .
In his opinion , Roberts emphasized that Fertig and others were free to speak out on their own on behalf of the Kurds .
They violate the law only when they work with members of the PKK , he said .
The group , which seeks an independent state for the Kurds , has waged a “ violent insurgency ” against Turkey , he said .
In dissent , Justice Stephen G. Breyer said the 1st Amendment should protect the “ pure speech ” of these human rights advocates from prosecution , except when it could be shown that they knew they were aiding “ unlawful terrorist actions . ”
Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor joined his dissent .
“ This is a very dark day … but we will not let this inhibit our commitment to the Kurdish people , ” Fertig said .
“ We will continue to advocate for the rights of the Kurds who are being oppressed .
We do so with great fear that some of the people we are working with might be members of the PKK . ”
Some legal experts said they were surprised the court upheld a criminal law that targets speech and advocacy .
In January , the court struck down on free - speech grounds a 63 - year - old law that forbade corporations and unions from spending money on an election campaign .
In April , the justices cited free speech in voiding a law that made it a crime to sell videos of animals being tortured .
In Monday ’s opinion , Roberts said national security raised a higher concern .
The Constitution empowered the government “ to provide for the common defense , ” he said , and the 1st Amendment does not stand in the way of a law that forbids any aid to foreign terrorists .
Among those applauding the ruling was the Anti-Defamation League .
“ One can not provide ‘ humanitarian ’ support in the form of training , expert advice or assistance … to a terrorist organization without helping their bottom line and facilitating violence , destruction and murder , ” said Chairman Robert G. Sugarman and Director Abraham H. Foxman in a statement .
Georgetown law professor David Cole , who represented Fertig on behalf of the Center for Constitutional Rights , said he was “ deeply disappointed ” with the ruling .
“ In the name of fighting terrorism , the court said that the 1st Amendment permits Congress to make it a crime to work for peace and human rights .
That is wrong .
There is no evidence that teaching human rights would further terrorism . ”

Rep. Betsy Markey sponsored the resolution to support ' the goals and ideals of American Craft Beer Week . ' | Photo by AP Photo Close
While most of Washington was focused on Tuesday 's election results , the House was busy doing something else : Passing a resolution about beer .
House Resolution 1297 , sponsored by Rep. Betsy Markey , supports " the goals and ideals of American Craft Beer Week . "
" We 've got quite a number of microbreweries and entrepreneurs that are creating jobs , and we wanted to celebrate that this is a craft , " Markey told POLITICO .
" I think beer has been a tradition since this country was founded , " said Markey .
" We wanted to celebrate entrepreneurship — and good beer ! "
Markey is obviously partial to brews from her home state of Colorado , but she wo n't claim a favorite .
" You ca n't just have one , " said Markey .
" It really depends on what mood you 're in .
Sometimes , I like a light beer — I might want a Skinny Dip — or otherwise prefer a heavier brew . "
The real question is :
Why would anyone vote against this ?
" It does seem like a no brainer , " said Markey .

We have an more in depth spec comparison here , but basically : HTC EVO uses Qik and can chat to computers or phones , while Apple uses its own FaceTime tech , which is currently iPhone 4 to iPhone 4 only ( with a supposedly open standard set to alleviate that limitation over time ) .
Still , in practice FaceTime seems to be higher quality and easier to deal with .
It 's really the same old story : you 'll have more flexibility on Android out of the gate , more polish from Apple .
Service
AT&T / Sprint
Costs
AT&T you can get as low at $ 55 with 200 MB of data , 450 minutes of talk , and no messaging .
If you want unlimited voice and messaging , along with 2GB of data ( the most AT&T will pre-sell you , it 's $ 10 per GB after that ) , you 'll be forking over $ 115 a month .
Sprint requires you to go for a minimum $ 80 plan ( that includes the required premium data plan add - on for the EVO ) , which includes unlimited data , unlimited messaging , and 450 minutes of talk .
To bump up to unlimited everything ( and that $ 10 premium data charge insures a true unlimited data ) you 'll be spending $ 110 a month .
Wrap-up
This is going to be a big one for a lot of people .
In our experience , the EVO can easily get through a day of light use when used on 3G , and is n't that much worse on 4G .
Meanwhile , the iPhone has an improved battery over the already strong 3GS , and can fairly handily beat the EVO on both standby and active use time .
Then again , the EVO has a user - replaceable battery if you want to pack a spare .
We 're confident that most people can survive with the EVO , but if you want battery " comfort , " the iPhone is the best bet .
We 've never really liked the way Android segments storage between device and microSD card , and the EVO does n't help its case by requiring you to remove the battery to get at the included 8 GB card .
Meanwhile Apple offers the iPhone in 16GB and 32 GB flavors , all nicely synced and managed with iTunes .
There 's nothing stopping you from putting all the apps and music you want on the EVO , and with microSD you have theoretically unlimited storage , but it 's nowhere near as pretty a process as Apple makes it .
Software is much more a " shades of grey " area than hardware , so we 're going to have to let a bit more opinion seep in here .
Please forgive us .
You could spend a lifetime detailing the differences and similarities of these two advanced , complicated smartphone OSes ( or at least , like , a day ) , but we 'll try to hit the high points :
We 're going to call this for Android right away .
Google 's notification tray is just so much more pleasant , useful , and unobtrusive than Apple 's pop-overs -- we just wonder how long it'll take Apple to figure this out HTC is n't helping itself out here by shipping duplicate SMS and email clients to get in the way of Google 's own .
Apple 's also playing catch - up with iOS 4 , bringing a unified inbox and threaded messaging to the iPhone .
Basically , it comes down to Gmail : if you use it and love it , Android will always be your best experience of it , but for any other service , the iPhone serves just fine .
It also makes SMS a prettier experience , though no more usable than its Android counterpart .
Something that 's relevant for a minority , but very relevant for that minority , is Google Voice .
There 's a decent web app that makes it almost usable on the iPhone , but it 's a powerful , extremely useful thing as a deeply integrated app on Android , and now that everybody in the US can get in , it 's only going to grow in relevance .
These are both touchscreen - only phones , which might be a bit of a change if you 're coming from a physical keyboard - equipped device , but rest assured that many humans throughout the ages have managed to become quite proficient on touchscreen keyboards , and Apple and HTC's are pretty much the best in the business .
The EVO benefits from its extra real estate -- the keyboard is almost too large in portrait -- and we like some of the ways HTC handles prediction , like offering multiple word alternatives as you type , but the iPhone still offers the best touchscreen keyboard we 've ever used in actual practice , and the addition of spellcheck in iOS 4 only helps cement that .
Android : yes .
iPhone : no .
Apple is finally entering the multitasking arena with iOS 4 , but it 's certainly doing things its own way .
In truth , Apple still does n't allow any sort of " true " multitasking on its phone , just background services , task completion , and fast app switching .
Android blows this away by allowing full apps to run simultaneously .
Still , for all of Apple 's overwrought babying of the user , it does have a bit of a point : if you do n't kill your tasks vigilantly on Android , your phone will run hot ( we 're speaking from experience with the EVO ) , slow down , and devour battery life .
If you 're smart and proactive , Android 's multitasking can make you more productive and also more attractive to the opposite sex .
For everybody else , the iPhone is the cleaner solution , and in the multitasking - enabled apps we 've been using so far , we 'd say the iOS approach is usually sufficient -- though it 's really reliant on the app developers to get it right .
This is certainly a matter of taste , but here 's a gross simplification : iPhone is for aesthetes , Android is for nerds .
HTC's
Sense spitshine adds a bit to Android , but it also increases the quantity of divergent , inconsistent UI .
Apple 's managed to not only present a unified front in its own apps , but also pass on a strong design language to much of its developer community -- something Google is far from doing .
Meanwhile , there 's something very homespun and fun about diving into Android 's technical , geektastic menus and widgets .
Extra nerd points included for those brave enough to put stock Android on the thing .
You can't argue against the fact that the iPhone has more applications , way more games , and a generally higher level of app quality thanks to a more mature SDK and increased competition .
Still , when it comes to doing stuff that 's not gaming , Android Market does alright for itself .
It 's really down to a per user thing : can you live without app X ?
Is there an adequate replacement for app Y ?
Do you hate having fun ?
Both devices have approval processes to get onto the branded store , but Android 's is a bit more lax ( emulators , for instance ) , and you can also grab unsigned apps directly .
You have to jailbreak the iPhone for that kind of freedom .
Some notable first and third party applications :
This one 's pretty simple : if you live in a WiMAX area with good coverage , you could see higher data speeds on Sprint than AT&T .
The trick is , you probably do n't live in a WiMAX area with good coverage -- they 're few and far between .
Luckily , Sprint 's 3G network is actually pretty great ( outside of some notable rough patches in certain areas ) , and we 've had a wonderful experience using it on the EVO so far , surpassing even some other Sprint handsets we 've used .
As we get further into the launch we 're starting to see some hints that the EVO is straining Sprint 's network somewhat -- middling performance where it used to be excellent -- but that 's at least not a widespread , iPhone - scale problem at this point .
Meanwhile , AT&T is AT&T : great speeds and network if it 's not over capacity in your area .
The company has made some strong strides at fighting dropped calls in major metropolitan areas like NY and SF , and that new external antenna design on the iPhone 4 helps out as well -- as long as you do n't hold it wrong .
On a more minor note , the new iPhone also has slightly improved upload speeds .
The HTC EVO 4G is $ 199 after a $ 100 mail - in rebate with Sprint , but you can get it elsewhere ( like Radio Shack and Best Buy ) for $ 199 straight up .
The iPhone 4 is $ 199 ( if you can find one ) .
Service plans get much more complicated , but basically :

Ca n't do that ?
How about sending people an email with a short commercial that shows exactly why we need to end our dependence on foreign oil ?
Joel Benenson , a pollster for the Democratic National Committee has shown that fighting big oil is a political winner in a presentation he made to Congressional Democrats .
This is how we can win the framing game according to Joel Benenson .
Most of his polling in the report is over 60 % for those who favor change .
We need to channel this energy , and here are the tools , here is the opportunity , do something with the message , do it now .
As you know , the message matters .
And I want a better and stronger climate bill to pass , not something that 's been watered down , I want more than a big bill to subsidize more coal , nuclear and gas and put more money in sustainable and renewable energy that we can create and build HERE .
What else did the polling show ?
Voters want Candidates to stop doing " Big Oil 's bidding " .
Voters want action , not delays on the bill , voting to delay the bill is even worse than voting against the bill .
Voters do n't view this spill in isolation , but rather view it as a consequence of decades of inaction .
And even with concerns about the Economy , voters still want to pass real reform on energy and carbon pollution .
People get it , we need to spread the message far and wide and we need to talk to them , now .
And we need to tell them how they can push their Senators , their Congressperson to pass real reform and if they do n't how they can pass them out the door by voting in someone else .
Here is a commercial from VoteVets that 's based on this polling , just compare the wording and the message , I was watching Rachel Maddow when it aired and put the two together .
If you want to see the ad yourself , donate to keep it on the air .
More people need to see it .
So , here are some things you can do to talk about oil dependence and how we need to pass real reform , not just more of the same .
American Presidents have been talking about getting of our dependence on foreign for decades and we 've not gotten any further , how about we talk about it in our homes to our friends , to our families and to anyone who will listen ?
Joh Stewart pointed out the history of a lot of Presidential talk on the whole dependence issue , lets turn talk into action .
And no , I can never figure out how to embed clips here , I get all the damn errors code crap .
Dammit Jim , I 'm a blogger not a programmer .

Call it the 5 o’clock whistle .
The 5 o’clock send off .
The weekend blastoff .
The weekend work whistle .
The Friday work whistle .
Whatever .
The point is , hardly anybody does this anymore , and it ’s a shame .
Below are the ONLY specimens I can find that are n’t some lame DJ blowing a referee ’s whistle … but REAL Friday work whistles .
Enjoy !

“ Europe is completely squeezed out now , ” a senior Western oil and gas executive said .
“ The price they [ the Central Asians ] are getting from China is significantly higher than what the Russians are preparing to pay , so they can play those two off against each other .
They do n’t need the Europeans to play that game . ”

The economy added 290,000 jobs in April , the biggest monthly net gain in four years .
The chart above shows job changes in this recession compared with recent ones , with the blue line representing the current downturn .
The line has ticked upward , but still has a long way to go before the job market fully recovers to its pre-recession level .
Since the downturn began in December 2007 , the economy has shed , on net , about 5.6 percent of its nonfarm payroll jobs .
The unemployment rate ( measured by a different government survey , and based on how many people are without jobs but are looking for work ) rose slightly to 9.9 percent in April .
The divergence between the payroll growth and the rising unemployment rate is partly because more people are joining ( or rejoining ) the labor force and looking for jobs .
Newt Gingrich has made headlines recently by writing in his new book , To Save America , that the Obama administration ’s “ secular socialist machine ” represents “ as great a threat to America as Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union . ”
Even Fox News hosts have questioned whether Newt went a bit too far with the comparison .
Last night , Fox host Greta Van Susteren wondered as well :
VAN SUSTEREN : All right , Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union .
Go a little far on that one ?
GINGRICH : No .
Because I ’m not talking about moral equivalence of the people , I ’m talking about the end result .
If the Nazis had defeated us , then America as we know it would have disappeared .
If the Soviet Union had defeated us , the America as we know it would have disappeared .
I argue in this book — and I think it ’s a pretty reasoned and compelling argument — that the fact is , the values of a secular socialist movement are antithetical — and you hear from President Obama all the time . …
The secular socialist left does n’t want God anywhere in public life and does n’t want to acknowledge God anywhere in public life .
Of course , Gingrich never provides any actual evidence of this alleged “ threat . ”
And it ’s unclear exactly what Gingrich is hearing from the President “ all the time , ” but it certainly is n’t anything about taking God out of public life or turning America into a socialist state .
In fact , Obama ( and the Vice President , the House Speaker and the Senate Majority Leader ) regularly refers to God in public statements and speeches .
The Obama administration is even appealing a court decision that found the National Day of Prayer unconstitutional .
An editor from the National Review noted to the former Speaker that swaths of Christian and religious leaders actually supported the President ’s health care reform plan — what Gingrich has linked to socialism — but he brushed this fact aside , claiming they were just a bunch of socialists .
Other conservatives do n’t think Gingrich ’s argument is all that “ reasoned and compelling ” either , but rather “ sick , ” “ shameful , ” “ crazy ” and “ outrageous . ”

SOMETHING is rotten in the state of Venezuela : over 2,300 container - loads ( and counting ) of decomposing food , imported by the government last year and never distributed .
The scandal is particularly embarrassing for President Hugo Chávez , since it comes amid growing shortages of basic foodstuffs in state - run grocery chains .
But rather than rethink his statist food and agriculture policy , the president has declared “ economic war ” on the private sector .
The cargoes came to light last month when state intelligence agents were investigating the theft of powdered milk .
The government admits that 30,000 tonnes of food are rotting in the port of Puerto Cabello alone .
Opposition media put the total so far at over 75,000 tonnes , or around a fifth of what PDVAL , the state company responsible , imported in 2009 .
The company 's former president , Luis Pulido , has been arrested for corruption and up to 20 other officials may suffer the same fate .
PDVAL is a subsidiary of Petróleos de Venezuela , the state oil giant .
It was created in 2008 , in an oblique recognition that another state - run food chain , Mercal , was failing to do its job .
PDVAL 's grandiose objective is to achieve “ full food sovereignty ” and to stamp out what Mr Chávez claims is “ hoarding and smuggling ” by the private sector .
Since 2003 , the government has imposed price controls on many foodstuffs .
In that year the government defeated a business - led strike which came close to paralysing the economy .
The private sector has since faced mounting harassment .
The results have been persistent shortages and soaring inflation : the price of food and drink rose by 21 % in the first five months of 2010 , according to the Central Bank .
Elías Jaua , the vice - president , this week blamed inflation on “ speculators [ linked to ] political interests seeking destabilisation as part of a campaign strategy ” , before a legislative election in September .
Basic goods are scarcer in Mercal and PDVAL shops than in private supermarkets , according to a survey by Datanálisis , a polling company .
But the government is stepping up expropriations of farms , food manufacturers and distributors , in a bid to achieve what it calls state “ hegemony ” over the food supply .
On June 7th it announced the takeover of 18 more food companies accused of violating regulations .
All eyes are now on Empresas Polar , a family - owned giant that is Venezuela 's biggest private food - and - drink company .
Polar , which claims to generate almost 3 % of the country 's non-oil GDP and has 19,000 employees , complains of harassment .
It says its plants and offices were visited 220 times by government inspectors in the first five months of this year .
In late May , the government confiscated 114 tonnes of food from a Polar warehouse , alleging hoarding ( which the company denies ) .
Mr Chávez has often threatened Lorenzo Mendoza , Polar 's billionaire chairman , with expropriation .
But as the rotting food shows , his government is better at destroying the existing order than at creating a viable alternative .
Some 70 % of Venezuela 's food is now imported , which generates ample opportunities for graft .
Most of the farms and food companies the president has expropriated suffer from inflated payrolls , declining productivity and rampant inefficiency .
His threats against Polar are rejected by a well - paid and loyal workforce .
The company is one of the biggest remaining obstacles to the installation of Cuban - style communism in Venezuela .
But to seize it now might well lose Mr Chávez the legislative election .
As Venezuelans say “ love , with hunger , does n't last . ”
California welfare recipients using state - issued debit cards withdrew more than $ 1.8 million in taxpayer cash on casino floors between October 2009 and last month , state officials said Thursday .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger issued an executive order requiring welfare recipients to promise they will use cash benefits only to “ meet the basic subsistence needs ” of their families .
The order also gave the state Department of Social Services seven days to produce a plan to reduce other types of “ waste , fraud and abuse ” in the welfare program .
The moves came after The Times reported Wednesday that officials at the department failed to notice for years that welfare recipients could use the state - issued cards to withdraw taxpayer cash at more than half of the tribal casinos and state - licensed poker rooms in California .
The state initiated the debit card program in 2002 .
Casino withdrawals , which represented far less than 1 % of total welfare spending during the eight months for which the department released data , averaged just over $ 227,392 a month .
Schwarzenegger has already ordered the vendor that runs the state welfare system ’s ATM network to prohibit the cards from working at casino machines .
Republican lawmakers are now calling on the administration to track down the people who withdrew cash at gaming centers and recover the money .
“ I ’d say that $ 227,000 per month is an astounding waste of taxpayer dollars , ” said Seth Unger , spokesman for Assembly Republican Leader Martin Garrick of Solana Beach .
“ To me it is absolutely clear that the department failed in its duty to provide oversight .
We should explore all options to get the money back . ”
The electronic benefit transfer cards allow welfare recipients to access two accounts : cash offered through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and an electronic version of food stamps , which comes with strict rules governing how the money can be spent .
The cash benefits , however , can be withdrawn and spent just about anywhere .
A Times review of state records found that the cards work at ATMs in 32 of 58 tribal casinos and 47 of 90 state - licensed poker rooms .
Most of the ATMs impose a withdrawal limit of about $ 300 a day .
The monthly cash grant for a family of three ranges up to $ 694 , while families with more than 10 people can get as much as $ 1,469 , documents from the Social Services Department show .
Some Assembly Republicans called Thursday for assurances that welfare recipients can’t access ATMs at other “ seedy ” businesses .
“ If they ’re going to shut down … the casinos , why not also shut down the ATMs at liquor stores and bars ? ”
Unger asked .
Schwarzenegger spokesman Aaron McLear said the point of the executive order was to force the department to examine the program for all manner of abuse , but did not specify any other kinds of businesses that might be weeded out of the network .
“ We ’re going to eliminate any waste , fraud and abuse that makes sense to eliminate , ” he said .
Democrats , who have been fighting to preserve the state ’s fraying social safety net in the face of a $ 19 - billion budget gap , angrily rejected a Schwarzenegger proposal last month to eliminate the cash portion of welfare .
That was before anyone in Sacramento realized the money could be withdrawn by someone strolling from a poker game to a blackjack table .
Democratic leaders steered away from specifics while discussing calls for reform .
“ We will conduct timely legislative oversight , ” said Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg ( D - Sacramento ) .
“ We want to make sure all families are spending the money on the children it ’s intended to serve . ”

Patrick Gaspard served as the political director for the Service Employees International Union local 1199 .
W.H. aide failed to disclose payout
President Barack Obama ’s political director failed to disclose that he was slated to receive a nearly $ 40,000 payout from a large labor union while he was working in the White House .
Patrick Gaspard , who served as the political director for the Service Employees International Union local 1199 , received $ 37,071.46 in “ carried over leave and vacation ” from the union in 2009 , but he did not disclose the agreement to receive the payment on his financial disclosure forms filed with the White House .

In a section on his financial disclosure where agreements or arrangements for payment by a former employer must be disclosed , Gaspard checked a box indicating that he had nothing to report .
Bill Burton , a White House spokesman , told POLITICO Monday that Gaspard was in the process of correcting his disclosure form to reflect that he did in fact have an agreement for severance .
“ We have made the small administrative change to this year 's and last year 's forms to indicate that part of the final payment to Patrick reflected their typical severance of one week of pay for each of his nine years of service at Local 1199 of SEIU , ” Burton wrote POLITICO in an e-mailed statement .
Such financial disclosures are governed by federal law , but Stan Brand , a former House general counsel and ethics expert , said the Justice Department is unlikely to pursue an investigation unless they suspected a “ knowing or willful ” intent to deceive .
Gaspard ’s omission is a potentially embarrassing episode for the Obama administration , which has made a high priority of ethics .
“ They ’ve made ethics a fetish and they have all kinds of people over there with experience , so I do n’t know how they missed this one , ” Brand said .
Gaspard spent nine years at 1199 SEIU , a major labor union in New York .
Gaspard also worked for Obama ’s campaign , and later worked for the transition team , where he earned $ 11,500 , according to the financial disclosure form he filed this year .
He was pulling a salary from SEIU until Jan. 16 , 2009 , shortly before Obama was inaugurated .
Gaspard , who made $ 172,200 in 2009 , has from $ 35,000 to $ 80,000 in credit card debt and student loans , according to his financial disclosures .
This SEIU payout was first raised in early June by Rep. Darrell Issa ( R - Calif . ) , the top GOP lawmaker on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .
He sent a letter to the White House asking for information about the payment .
They have yet to respond .
The latest false scandal in climate science hit the blogosphere over the weekend .
National Post columnist Lawrence Solomon [ not to be confused with atmospheric chemist and IPCC WG1 chair Susan Solomon ] wrote a column with the outlandish claim :
The UN ’s IPCC misled the press and public into believing that thousands of scientists backed its claims on manmade global warming , according to Mike Hulme , a prominent climate scientist and IPCC insider .
Charges of a “ phony UN IPCC consensus ” are already reverberating on contrarian blogs around the world , thanks to the quick efforts of climate science disinformation specialist Marc Morano .
But now Mike Hulme , a professor of climate change at the University of East Anglia , has set the record straight .
His “ correcting and clarifying ” statement is unambiguous in its disavowal of Solomon ’s and Morano ’s misinterpretation :
I did not say the ‘ IPCC misleads ’ anyone – it is claims that are made by other commentators , such as the caricatured claim I offer in the paper , that have the potential to mislead .
Solomon , who is also Executive Director of of the right - wing , anti-science group Energy Probe , posted the following piece on the National Post website early last Sunday .
The IPCC consensus on climate change was phoney , says IPCC insider Lawrence Solomon – June 13 , 2010 – 8:50 am The UN ’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change misled the press and public into believing that thousands of scientists backed its claims on manmade global warming , according to Mike Hulme , a prominent climate scientist and IPCC insider .
The actual number of scientists who backed that claim was “ only a few dozen experts , ” he states in a paper for Progress in Physical Geography , co-authored with student Martin Mahony .
“ Claims such as ‘ 2,500 of the world ’s leading scientists have reached a consensus that human activities are having a significant influence on the climate ’ are disingenuous , ” the paper states unambiguously , adding that they rendered “ the IPCC vulnerable to outside criticism . ” …
Hulme ’s depiction of IPCC ’s exaggeration of the number of scientists who backed its claim about man-made climate change can be found on pages 10 and 11 of his paper , found here .
Never mind waiting until the ink dries .
Marc Morano swung into action within hours , while readers of the National Post print edition have yet to benefit from Solomon ’s latest wisdom .
Climate Depot breathlessly announced :
Will Media Now Apologize for being complicit in the ‘ Consensus Con ’ ?
UN IPCC ‘ consensus ’ on climate was phony , says IPCC Lead Author Mike Hulme !
The results were depressingly predictable .
The piece has already been reproduced or excerpted hundreds of times , including at Nigel Lawson ’s Global Warming Policy Foundation website and PrisonPlanet .
Now it turns out that Solomon ’s post was based on selective quotation and gross misinterpretation of an article by Hulme and his student , Martin Mahony , in press at Progress in Physical Geography .
But do n’t just take my word for it .
This morning , Mike Hulme prominently posted a statement “ correcting misleading newspaper and internet blog reports of the Hulme and Mahony paper on the IPCC ” .
Here is the key passage ( see below for the entire text ) :
First , I did not say the ‘ IPCC misleads ’ anyone – it is claims that are made by other commentators , such as the caricatured claim I offer in the paper , that have the potential to mislead .
Second , they have a potential to mislead if they give the impression that every statement in IPCC reports is ‘ signed off ’ by every IPCC author and reviewer .
Patently they are not , and cannot .
Third , it is the chapter lead authors – say 10 to 20 experts – on detection and attribution who craft the sentence about detection and attribution , which is then scrutinised and vetted by reviewers and government officials .
Similarly , statements about what may happen to the meridional overturning circulation ( MOC ) of the ocean are crafted by those expert in ocean science , statements about future sea - level rise by sea - level experts , and so on .
The piece concludes thus :
Giving the impression that the IPCC consensus means everyone agrees with everyone else – as I think some well - meaning but uninformed commentaries do ( or have a tendency to do ) – is unhelpful ; it does n’t reflect the uncertain , exploratory and sometimes contested nature of scientific knowledge .
So clearly , Hulme is not criticizing the IPCC itself or touting “ IPCC exaggeration ” , but rather “ well - meaning but uninformed commentaries ” from groups such as Greenpeace that do refer to a “ consensus ” of 2500 scientists in support of specific IPCC statements , for example on attribution of climate change .
Even more important , though , is Hulme ’s recognition that the IPCC ’s “ consensus ” approach can lead to findings that are perceived as overly conservative by many experts in a given field .
As the Progress in Physical Geography paper states :
But consensus - making can also lead to criticism for being too conservative , as Hansen ( 2007 ) has most visibly argued .
Was the IPCC AR4 too conservative in reaching its consensus about future sea - level rise ?
Many glaciologists and oceanographers think they were ( Kerr , 2007 ; Rahmstorf , 2010 ) , leading to what Hansen attacks as ‘ scientific reticence ’ .
Solomon et al. ( 2008 ) offer a robust defence , stating that far from reaching a premature consensus , the AR4 report stated that in fact no consensus could be reached on the magnitude of the possible fast ice - sheet melt processes that some fear could lead to 1 or 2 metres of sea - level rise this century .
Hence these processes were not included in the quantitative estimates .
That tendency to conservative caution is an inconvenient aspect of IPCC “ consensus - making ” that Solomon somehow forgot to mention .
Now that it is clear the only thing phony about the whole affair is Solomon ’s story itself , the most important remaining question is whether the National Post and Energy Probe will issue much - needed corrections .
Based on past form , I would n’t hold my breath .

Correcting and Clarifying Hulme and Mahony on the IPCC Consensus
Various newspaper and internet blogs are reporting me as saying that the IPCC has ‘ misled the press and public into believing that thousands of scientists backed its claims on manmade global warming ’ whereas in fact only ‘ a few dozen experts ’ did so .
This story emanates from an article , in press with Progress in Physical Geography and posted on my website http://mikehulme.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Hulme-Mahony-PiPG.pdf, which reviews 20 years of published literature on the nature of the IPCC and its functions and governance .
The relevant section from this paper is the following , which is part of a longer discussion about the nature of uncertainty and consensus in the IPCC assessments …
“ Without a careful explanation about what [ consensus ] means , this drive for consensus can leave the IPCC vulnerable to outside criticism .
Claims such as ‘ 2,500 of the world ’s leading scientists have reached a consensus that human activities are having a significant influence on the climate ’ are disingenuous .
That particular consensus judgement , as are many others in the IPCC reports , is reached by only a few dozen experts in the specific field of detection and attribution studies ; other IPCC authors are experts in other fields .
But consensus - making can also lead to criticism for being too conservative , as Hansen ( 2007 ) has most visibly argued . ”
Three things should be clear from this .
First , I did not say the ‘ IPCC misleads ’ anyone – it is claims that are made by other commentators , such as the caricatured claim I offer in the paper , that have the potential to mislead .
Second , they have a potential to mislead if they give the impression that every statement in IPCC reports is ‘ signed off ’ by every IPCC author and reviewer .
Patently they are not , and cannot .
Third , it is the chapter lead authors – say 10 to 20 experts – on detection and attribution who craft the sentence about detection and attribution , which is then scrutinised and vetted by reviewers and government officials .
Similarly , statements about what may happen to the meridional overturning circulation ( MOC ) of the ocean are crafted by those expert in ocean science , statements about future sea - level rise by sea - level experts , and so on .
The point of this bit of our article was to draw attention to the need for a more nuanced understanding of what an IPCC ‘ consensus ’ is – as I say : “ Without a careful explanation about what it means , this drive for consensus can leave the IPCC vulnerable to outside criticism . ”
The IPCC consensus does not mean – clearly cannot possibly mean – that every scientist involved in the IPCC process agrees with every single statement in the IPCC !
Some scientists involved in the IPCC did not agree with the IPCC ’s projections of future sea-level .
Giving the impression that the IPCC consensus means everyone agrees with everyone else – as I think some well - meaning but uninformed commentaries do ( or have a tendency to do ) – is unhelpful ; it does n’t reflect the uncertain , exploratory and sometimes contested nature of scientific knowledge .

During primary season , Sarah Palin 's endorsement was seen as a gift from the heavens in Republican circles -- the seal of good housekeeping for " tea party " activists .
Candidates who received the former Alaska governor 's blessing soon soared in the polls , as money and volunteers poured in .
Ditto the spotlight of national attention .
Now , it 's easy to wonder if Palin 's political Midas touch has turned to rust .
In Kentucky , the self - professed oracle for tea party anger has gotten himself in trouble with his mouth .
First Rand Paul questioned the 1964 Civil Rights
Act for forcing private businesses to integrate public spaces .
Then he defended BP , the petroleum company that has been leaking thousands of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico for more than a month .
As the White House escalated the rhetoric against BP for failing to cap the spill , Paul said criticizing business is " un-American . "
Finally , as the Ticket noted Wednesday morning , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell -- who , you may recall , backed Paul 's opponent in the race -- virtually ordered Paul to cancel all national TV interviews , including one scheduled for Sunday on NBC's " Meet the Press . "
In Idaho on Tuesday , tea party congressional candidate Vaughn Ward lost the Republican primary .
This despite Palin 's endorsement but after disclosures , as Ticket reported Tuesday , that Ward plagiarized not only position papers but Barack Obama 's famous address to the 2004 Democratic National Convention , the one that launched the president 's national career .
In South Carolina , gubernatorial candidate Nikki Haley -- Palin's pick in a crowded field of Republican contenders -- is battling allegations from a former consultant that Haley , a married woman with two children , had engaged in an inappropriate sexual relationship with him .
Palin says she warned her of smears to come .
The tea party activists have undoubtedly brought passion to politics , as has Palin .
But national Republicans are starting to worry that a too - conservative message could cost them elections .
So it 's not uncommon these days to see Palin and the Republican Party on different sides in primary fights .
In the state of Washington , for instance , Palin is backing Clint Didier , a former Washington Redskins player .
On her Twitter account she called him a " patriot running for U.S. Senate to serve his state & our country for all the right reasons ! "
Like Paul , he veers toward libertarianism , arguing that " we need to stop trying to police the world and telling other nations how to manage their affairs .
It is depleting our wealth and draining our national spirit .
America is a republic ; therefore let ’s stop trying to spread ' democracy . ' "
Meanwhile , establishment Republicans want Dino Rossi , a two - time candidate for governor who they think can actually beat Sen. Patty Murray in November .
Maybe this is why Democrats are starting to think that 2010 may not be the blowout against them that was widely predicted .
In Pennsylvania , in a special election to fill the seat long held by Democrat Jack Murtha , Mark Critz managed to defeat tea party favorite Tim Burns .
Afterward , Rep. Chris Van Hollen , who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , said , " The hype ... hit the brick wall of reality . "

At least 19 people have been killed by flash floods in south - eastern France , officials say .
Several others have been reported missing after torrential rain hit the mountains above the Cote D'Azur region on Tuesday .
A number of towns in the department of Var were affected , with hundreds of homes flooded .
Meteo France , the national weather service , said up to 40 cm ( 15.7 in ) of rain had fallen since Tuesday .
Meterologists say the floods are the worst in the region since 1827 .
About 2,000 rescue workers have been drafted into affected regions around Draguignan - the worst - hit area - near the Mediterranean coast to help those trapped in their vehicles or houses .
' Devastated '
Water levels were said to be falling slightly in Draguignan on Wednesday , though the rain was continuing in nearby Roquebrune and Frejus .
Meteo France has warned of further storms on Wednesday night .
" We have never seen so much rain in the month of June , " Patrick Galois of Meteo France told the AFP news agency .
At least 1,000 people had to leave their homes and spend the night in schools or other temporary shelters , and some 175,000 houses were estimated to have been left without electricity .
Some reportedly sought shelter on the roofs of their homes , while helicopters were brought in to rescue people .
Rescue teams had to moved 436 inmates from a prison in Draguignan after two floors flooded .
The force of the water swept empty cars and other vehicles down streets in Draguignan .
" This morning , we woke up to find a town centre that was devastated , extremely battered with overturned cars floating in the streets , collapsed roads and gutted houses , " said Corinne Orzechowski , the official leading the emergency operation .
Condolences

The floods are believed to be the worst since 1827
The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says that many of those who died were caught in their cars .
Rail and air services in the region were interrupted , and about 300 passengers travelling on a high - speed train between Nice and Lille had been trapped by the flood waters , the AFP news agency reported .
The railway line between Toulon and Frejus will be closed until Thursday morning .
President Nicolas Sarkozy offered condolences to the families of the victims , and pledged his support to rescue workers " mobilising non-stop to provide aid and find those still missing " .
He plans to visit the area early next week .
Google I/O Google is " very confident " that the newly open - sourced VP8 video codec will stand up to the sort of patent attack Steve Jobs warned of when he defended Apple 's decision to shun VP8's predecessor , the open - source Ogg Theora .
On Wednesday , at its annual developer conference in San Francisco , California , Google told the world it had open sourced VP8 under a royalty - free license , and it 's already using the codec to encode large videos on YouTube .
VP8 will be combined with the Ogg Vorbis audio codec and a subset of the Matroska container format to create a new media standard dubbed WebM .
Google acquired VP8 this spring when it purchased video compression outfit On2 Technologies in a deal valued at $ 124.6 m dollars , and it was widely expected that the company would open source the codec as a way of countering the patented H.264 .
Currently , Firefox and Opera use the open source Ogg Theora for HTML5 video .
Google uses both Ogg and H.264 , saying Ogg does n't provide the performance needed on a site like YouTube .
The two other big - name browser makers , Apple and Microsoft , have shunned Ogg entirely in favor of the H.264 .
Apple has said that the prefers H.264 due to Ogg 's " uncertain patent landscape " and its lack of hardware support , and Microsoft has made similar noises , saying that the intellectual property rights of Ogg and other codecs are " less clear " .
In a private email , Apple chief executive Steve Jobs even went so far as to say that unnamed forces were putting together a patent pool to " go after " Ogg Theora .
Today , when The Reg asked if VP8 was vulnerable to patent attack , Google product manager Mike Jazayeri indicated this is n't a big concern for the company .
" We have done a pretty through analysis of VP8 and On2 Technologies prior to the acquisition and since then , and we are very confident with the technology and that 's why we 're open sourcing , " he said .
But some have asked for more than generalities .
" Google says it holds certain patents on the VP8 video codec that is part of WebM but there 's no assurance that Google 's patents are the only patents required , " noted open source advocate Florian Muller tells The Reg .
" What about patents that third parties could assert ?
While it appears to be a nice gesture if a major player releases software on open source terms , it 's imperative to perform a well - documented patent clearance .
" Developers should be provided with detailed explanations why Google believes that no one adopting WebM will have to fear allegations of patent infringement . "
Google has open sourced the VP8 codec under a new license .
Essentially , it 's the BSD with a few modifications .
" There is additional language around the patent provision , " Jazayeri said .
" Basically , it helps ensure that the community that adopts this can't claim patent infringement . "
In legalese , the license says : " If You or your agent or exclusive licensee institute or order or agree to the institution of patent litigation against any entity ( including a cross- claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit ) alleging that this implementation of VP8 or any code incorporated within this implementation of VP8 constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement , or inducement of patent infringement , then any rights granted to You under this License for this implementation of VP8 shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed . "
Google has not received approval for the license from the Open Source Initiative ( OSI ) .
And it has not yet approached the OSI .
" We will certainly follow the best practices , " Jazayeri said .
Asked if Google had approached Apple and Microsoft about VP8 , Jazayeri said the company had " reached out to everyone " - meaning all major browser makers .
But that 's all he would say .
Following Google 's announcement , Microsoft 's Internet Explorer general manager Dean Hachamovitch tossed up a blog post that reiterated Microsoft 's commitment to H.264 - this will be used in the upcoming IE9 for HTML5 video - but he said Microsoft would allow VP8 playback as long as users installed the codec themselves .
" We are strongly committed to making sure that in IE9 you can safely view all types of content in all widely used formats .
When it comes to video and HTML5 , we ’re all in .
In its HTML5 support , IE9 will support playback of H.264 video as well as VP8 video when the user has installed a VP8 codec on Windows , " he wrote .
No word from Jobs .
Somebody please send him an email ( sjobs@apple.com ) .
He does n't like us .
Mozilla and Opera are already offering VP8 in developer previews of their browsers , and both were on hand today to lend their support to Google 's announcement .
Mozilla vp of engineering Mike Shaver told The Reg that according to the organization 's preliminary tests , VP8's performance per bitrate matches that of H.264 , and he said it exhibits similar CPU utilization .
It significantly outperforms Ogg Theora .
Hardware vendors such as AMD and Nvidia have also backed VP8 , and Shaver believes that as more and more organizations get behind the technology and its performance continues to improve , Apple and Microsoft can be brought on board as well .
He said it would " be a problem " if the two do n't join the crowd , as this will force web developers to deal with two separate video formats .
Starting today , Google is using WebM to encode all YouTube videos larger than 720p .
But of course , it 's still encoding them in Flash as well .
Asked if it had plans to remove Flash from YouTube , Google tossed us some boilerplate about how Flash is still a relevant and useful technology .
Adobe was also on hand to announce that it will use VP8 in Flash - at some point .
Speaking with The Reg , Opera CTO Hakon Wium Lie praised Adobe 's move , saying that at the very least this will allow web developers to encode video for both Flash and HTML5 on Chrome , Firefox and Opera . ®

With Communism ’s demise , and the return of Warsaw Pact countries to the capitalist fold , the world was promised a new age of peace and prosperity .
The shadow of war would lift .
Military expenditures would be cut back , and troops would be brought home from Cold War postings .
There would be more money for new wars — on poverty and homelessness , this time .
And capitalism , the single sustainable model of success ( it had , after all , emerged triumphant in a decades - long battle with Communism ) would deliver the poor from poverty , and bless the world with a bonanza of consumer goods .
Talk about failed predictions .
In place of peace , we got the lone remaining superpower waging war to sweep up the few remaining stragglers that continued to resist integration into the US dominated global economy .
Iraq was conquered , at the expense of countless dead , homeless , mangled and ruined ; campaigns of intrigue and bombing in the former Yugoslavia pushed the region into the US orbit ; and a war on Afghanistan continues to blast away thousands of peasants but cements a US military presence in a Central Asia pregnant with the promise of oil and gas wealth .
Wars on Iran and north Korea are real possibilities .
Today , the United States is asserting its military might over the face of the globe more audaciously than ever .
There are 368,000 US troops deployed in nearly 130 countries around the world .
( 1 ) US citizens think their military protects their interests abroad and defends host countries from threats .
They rarely pause to wonder whether what ’s called “ their ” interests are really their own personal interests or those of people who live in bigger houses and get bigger tax breaks and have sizeable investment portfolios .
Nor do they make a habit of wondering how it is that with the US exercising a virtual military monopoly over the world , host countries could be under a threat so imminent they would require a US force presence .
Exactly which of the tiny collection of countries not hosting US troops are threatening the remaining 130 ?
Could it be that US troops gird the globe to enforce the access of US firms and investors to the land , labor , markets and resources of others ?
Do “ our ” interests equate to Iraq ’s oil , Indochina ’s tin , Central Asia ’s natural gas , Kosovo ’s mines , the Balkan ’s pipeline routes , Africa ’s treasure trove of minerals and oil , and Indonesia ’s sweatshops ?
“ A lot of people forget , ” remarked Alexander Haig , former Supreme Commander of NATO and Secretary of State in the Reagan administration , that the presence of US troops in Europe is “ the bona fide of our economic success … it keeps European markets open to us .
If those troops were n’t there , those markets would probably be more difficult to access . ” ( 2 ) A lot of people forget , because they were told something quite different :
That US troops were stationed in Europe to deter a Soviet invasion , not to put a gun to the head of Europeans to keep their markets invitingly open to US firms and investors .
The obvious question , With the threat of a Soviet invasion long passed , why are US troops still there ? , is rarely asked .
So it does n’t really matter that we ’ve forgotten .
The most blatant of Washington ’s latest exercises in imperialism run amok has a similar character .
It was said that the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein was hiding banned weapons .
None were found .
But US forces stay in Iraq anyway , to ensure the conquered country remains the refashioned paragon of free markets and free trade Washington ’s policy makers have turned it into .
Which is to say , the emergence of US capitalism triumphant has n’t given us peace , as promised ; it has given us a bold US military prepared to wage war .
And it seems to be waging war to facilitate US capital settling everywhere , nestling everywhere and establishing connections everywhere , to paraphrase a shockingly topical passage from the Communist Manifesto of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels , a document whose irrelevance was said to have been established beyond a shadow of a doubt when the Berlin Wall was razed to the ground .
Yet , today , it seems to be more relevant than ever ; certainly more relevant than when a competing ideology forced the stewards of capitalism to tidy up the image of their vaunted system lest the rabble get it into their heads that they could do better .
It ’s said in newspapers and on TV that Washington ’s wars have to do with fighting terrorism , but the documents which define the US national security strategy are long on paeans to free markets and free trade and capitalism and short on concrete measures to protect the lives of US citizens from attacks by radicalized West Asians bearing legitimate grievances against the United states .
On the contrary , the strategy is a recipe for provoking terrorist attacks .
Bourgeois society , ” to use Marx ’s and Engels ’ phrase , has n’t given us prosperity either , unless by “ us , ” you mean the people who own and control the economy .
For the bulk of humanity things are a lot worst materially than they were when communists , socialists , and nationalists kept upsetting the capitalist apple cart by bringing vast tracks of national economies under public control , and putting the public welfare ahead of the profit interests of bondholders and investors .
According to the United Nations , 54 countries are poorer today than they were in 1990 , about the time Communism was declared failed , and capitalism lionized as the single sustainable model of success .
More children under the age of five are dying in 14 countries , and enrollment in primary schools is down in 12 .
Extreme poverty remains the fate of over one billion people .
And in former Soviet republics — cradle to what has been dismissed as a failed system — poverty had tripled one decade into their liberation from Communism .
Seventeen countries in Eastern Europe and the countries that made up the former Soviet Union have hardly become dynamos of prosperity , which should leave anyone with an ounce of gray matter wondering by what standard success is measured ; surely not by the majority ’s well - being . ( 3 )
After having been demonized for decades by a capitalist establishment bent on making Communism radioactive ( along with anyone so cavalier about their standing in polite society to utter a kind word about it ) it ’s sometimes forgotten , if ever apprehended in the first place , how impressive Communism ’s economic achievements were … and still are , considering the barren and poisoned ground in which the lone holdouts have been forced to eke out precarious existences .
Let ’s start with the most reviled of the hold - outs : north Korea .
The idea that north Korea is a threat to the United States is about as believable as the idea that a colony of ants is a threat to the elephant whose foot hovers three inches over its hill .
North Korea has n’t a single solider stationed outside its borders .
Washington , on the other hand , has 37,000 troops deployed , on , or near , the north Korean border , 65,000 troops stationed in nearby Japan , the Seventh Fleet lurking in nearby waters , and bombers within striking distance .
It has dismissed Pyongyang ’s pleas to sign a nonaggression treaty , declaring bizarrely that it will not succumb to blackmail .
And what has north Korea done to threaten the United States ( or to blackmail the country ) ?
It has fired up a mothballed nuclear reactor capable of producing weapons grade material , and withdrawn from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty , but only after Washington reneged on an agreement to build light water reactors and provide fuel oil shipments .
And only after Washington issued a virtual declaration of war , designating north Korea part of “ an axis of evil . ”
Could a north Korea with one or two crude nuclear bombs pose much of a threat to the United States poised to strike with overwhelming force ?
Quite the other way around .
Indeed , north Korea ’s pursuit of nuclear weapons can be said to be a rational response to an overwhelming US threat .
And there have been plenty of signs the threat is real .
“ This is just the beginning , ” a Bush administration official told the New York Times , after US and British troops marched on Baghdad .
“ I would not rule out the same sequence of events for Iran and north Korea as for Iraq . ” ( 4 ) The Pak Tribune cited CIA sources that revealed a “ list of countries where replacement of government has been declared essential . ”
( 5 ) The list included north Korea .
US undersecretary of state for arms control and international security , John Bolton , warned Pyongyang to “ draw the appropriate lesson from Iraq . ” ( 6 ) It has .
“ The DPRK ( north Korea ) would have already met the same miserable fate as Iraq ’s had it compromised its revolutionary principle and accepted the demand raised by the imperialists and its followers for ‘ nuclear inspection ’ and disarmament , ” declared the official daily of the ruling Korean Workers Party , Rodong Sinmun . ( 7 ) Later , the government issued this statement : “ The Iraqi war teaches a lesson that in order to prevent a war and defend the security of a country and the sovereignty of a nation it is necessary to have a powerful physical deterrent . ” ( 8 )
Washington ultra-hawk , Paul Wolfowitz , anticipating similar words US Secretary of state Hilary Clinton would utter seven years later , warned , “ north Korea is headed down a blind alley .
Its pursuit of nuclear weapons will not protect it from the real threat to its security , which is the ( internal ) implosion brought about by the total failure of its system .
Indeed the diversion of scarce resources to nuclear weapons and other military programs can only exacerbate the weakness of the ( government ) . ” ( 9 ) So what ’s the choice ?
Head down a blind alley , or turn over the country to Washington , and the multinational corporations it represents ?
Who ’s the blackmailer ?
History has not been kind to the tiny country .
The mountainous north was once the center of the peninsula ’s heavy industry , the south its breadbasket .
The Korean War , which saw US bombers destroy every building in the north over one story , changed that .
The north was reduced to rubble .
But it rebuilt , and until the 1980s , outpaced the south economically .
By 1961 , it was self - sufficient in agriculture .
North Korean children were better vaccinated than their counterparts in the United States , according to the World Health Organization and United Nations , who commended the country for its delivery of health care .
And life expectancy was higher than in the capitalist south . ( 10 )
Then disaster struck .
The socialist trading bloc collapsed , depriving Pyongyang of its major trading partners .
Oil subsidies from Russia ended .
And if that were n’t enough , floods and droughts ravaged crops .
Famine followed .
But , for a time , the country had enjoyed impressive material gains , an affirmation of what can be achieved outside the capitalist system , even where resources are diverted to defense against an unrelenting foe than remains poised on your borders to strike .
Imagine what the country could have achieved without the United States breathing fire down its neck .
Cuba , in many respects , fits the same mold : Astonishing social and economic gains under a communist government , the implacable and unrelenting hostility of the United States , and some backsliding after the collapse of its major trading partners .
( The United States has maintained an economic blockade for half a century . )
Still , despite these challenges , Cuba is a much kinder and egalitarian place today than it was before the revolution , under the rule of the US - backed Batista regime , when the country ’s economy was an appendage of that of the United States .
The United States fears Cuba , journalist Seamus Milne observes , not because it is a threat to the safety of US citizens , but because it ’s an example of what can be accomplished outside the US dominated capitalist model .
( 11 )
In 1953 , the illiteracy rate in Cuba exceeded 22 percent .
Today it is under one percent .
Three percent of those over the age of 10 had a secondary school education .
Today , almost 60 percent do .
Back then , at the height of the sugar harvest , when unemployment was lowest , eight percent were jobless .
Today , the unemployment rate is three percent , making Cuba one of the few countries in the world to boast full employment .
Well over 80 percent own their own homes , and pay no taxes .
The remainder pays a nominal rent .
No other country has as many teachers per capita .
Education is free through university .
The country also provides free university educations to 1,000 Third World students every year .
And classroom sizes put those of Western industrialized countries to shame .
Health care is free .
And while the United States has deployed over 300,000 troops in almost 130 countries to keep markets open to US investment , Cuba has sent 50,000 doctors to work for free in 93 Third World countries to heal the sick . ( 12 )
Infant mortality is lower than in any other Third World country and even some Western capitalist countries ( it ’s higher in Washington , DC . )
Life expectancy is 76 years , and is expected to rise .
( 13 ) By comparison , the return of capitalism has pushed life expectancy down in former communist countries .
These gains , seldom mentioned in the United States , place the country head and shoulders above other Latin American countries firmly ensconced in the US orbit , for which Washington ’s single sustainable model of success continues to deliver grinding poverty , misery , and gross inequality , but the profits necessary to keep the capitalist system afloat and the capitalist class awash in mansions , retinues of servants , stables of luxury cars , exclusive schools and private clubs .
There are elections , and , contrary to Washington ’s anti-Cuba propaganda , Cubans do vote .
But they do n’t choose among two largely identical parties , as in the United States , where the parties , and their candidates , are almost invariably in thrall to , or are representatives of , the capitalist class .
As for human rights , Cuba stands as a model of what can be achieved by way of economic and social rights , the basic rights to food , housing , clothing , health care , education and jobs , enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , but not recognized as human rights in the United States .
( 14 ) Washington , on the other hand , has made a fetish of civil and political liberties , which , in the case of its relations with Cuba , has everything to do with giving its agents in the country , mistakenly called “ independent ” journalists and “ independent ” librarians ( they ’re not independent of Washington , which bankrolls their activities ) , room to maneuver to organize destabilization , with the object of overthrowing the revolution and banishing economic and social rights in favor of investors ’ rights .
That Cuba , a poor country , has been able to guarantee the right to food , clothing , shelter , health care , education and jobs , despite trying economic circumstances and US hostility , can be seen as extraordinary , or simply what can be readily accomplished outside the strictures of capitalism .
If a poor Third World country , harassed by a powerful neighbor , can deliver high quality health care and education for free , why ca n’t the world ’s richest country do the same ?
The answer : Capitalism drives towards better profits , not better lives .
Ever since the US - dominated global economy has , with the collapse of Eastern Bloc Communism over 10 years ago , more boldly sought purchase everywhere , US military imperialism has run amok , wars of aggression have been started , and poor , and formerly communist , countries have become poorer .
The leaders of the Western world declare capitalism to be the single sustainable model of success , but countries that rejected capitalism , and committed to egalitarianism , have done better in terms of guaranteeing economic and social rights than comparison countries , despite difficult circumstances .
Meanwhile , those that have rejected egalitarianism in favor of a return to capitalism have regressed .
The promises of peace and prosperity that attended Communism ’s collapse were a fraud based in the self - interest of a narrow band of wealthy people in the world ’s richest countries .
That it is a fraud is richly evident in the failed promises and dismal record of the post - communist era .

It 's no secret that Sprint has had the San Francisco Bay Area on its 4G release roadmap for a while , with a planned release time frame of sometime this year .
It 's always been mind - boggling to me that the heart of the Silicon Valley , where Google itself lives , along with thousands of other tech companies , was not priority # 1 for Sprint .
Is it all about to change ?
I was getting off Caltrain at Mountain View this morning , playing with the EVO , as usual , when I suddenly noticed the 4G widget somehow switched itself on .
I knew we had no 4G around the Bay Area , so I never kept it on .
However , there it was .
This fact by itself would n't have been that exciting had I also not observed the 4G symbol which replaced the 3G one in the notification bar .
Holy crap ... can it be ?..
I quickly fired up the http://speedtest.net site in Dolphin HD , which supports Flash Light , and ran a quick test .
2.66 Mbps down ...
" The site did load unusually fast , " I thought .
4G is here ?
4G is here !
At that point , the icon disappeared and switched back to 3G .
Then it re-appeared again and kept jumping in and out every couple of minutes .
Something was still unstable , or my signal was weak at that location but the fact remained - 4G was floating in the air .
By the time I arrived at the Mountain View office , the only thing left was 3G .
However , about 8 hours later , on my way back to San Francisco , I saw the 4G symbol again .
It was n't just a brief test .
Not as far as I could tell .
I found a single tweet on Twitter supporting my findings , and not much else .
I guess nobody is really checking for 4G without an official announcement :
Now I need your help in testing this theory out .
If you are in the Bay Area , turn your 4G on and report back .
Alternatively , if you know anything more official , definitely drop us a line or leave a comment .
Who is excited !?
MÅ KUTTE : Hellas er et av flere land som har måttet redusere sine budsjetter grunnet finanskrisen .

Dramatiske kutt i velferdsordninger vil koste liv
Drastiske kutt i sosiale velferdsordninger , slik flere europeiske land nå gjennomfører , vil resultere i tap av menneskeliv , advarer britiske forskere .
Oppdatert 25 . juni 2010
Artikkelen er over ti år gammel
Forskere under ledelse av David Stuckler ved Oxford - universitetet i England har analysert sosialbudsjettet gjennom 25 år i 15 europeiske land , for å fastslå hvilke følger budsjettkutt kan få for folkehelse .

Finanskrisen har tvunget mange europeiske land til å gjennomføre drastiske budsjettkutt det siste året , noe som vil få klare følger , advarer de britiske forskerne .
Nær sammenheng
Det er nær sammenheng mellom hvor mye penger et land bruker på helsevesenet , støtteordninger til arbeidsledige , funksjonshemmede , småbarnsfamilier og bostøtte , og hvor stor risikoen er for at innbyggerne skal lide en for tidlig død , konkluderer forskerne i siste utgave av British Medical Journal .
For hver 80 euro ( 640 kroner ) myndighetene i et land kutter i sosiale velferdsordninger per person , øker risikoen for å dø av alkoholrelaterte sykdommer med 2,8 prosent og av hjertelidelser med 1,2 prosent , har de regnet ut .
Folk flest må betale
Mange europeiske land gjennomfører i disse dager store kutt i budsjettene , men det kan fort bli et tveegget sverd , advarer forskerne .
- Denne rapporten avdekker at det til syvende og sist er vanlige folk som må betale den høyeste prisen for budsjettkuttene , som i verste fall kan koste dem livet , sier Stuckler .

I Storbritannia har politikerne av frykt for å miste oppslutning slått ring rundt helsebudsjettet , men de overser samtidig hvilke helsemessige følger kutt i andre sosiale støtteordninger kan få , mener forskerne .
Sunn oppvekst
Folkehelsen avgjøres ikke bare av hvor mye som brukes på helsevesenet , slår Stuckler fast .
- Barn som får bedre utdanning , som har tryggere lekeområder og som lever i boliger av god kvalitet , har mye større sjanse for å få en sunn oppvekst enn de som ikke får slike tilbud , heter det i forskernes rapport .
- Voksne med trygge arbeidsplasser , som mottar mer i lønn enn akkurat det som trengs for å overleve , og som lever mindre farlig fordi de i mindre grad røyker , drikker og spiser usunt , kan også forvente å leve lengre , slår de britiske forskerne fast .

Australian doctors are considering introducing a controversial form of genital mutilation carried out on baby girls .
The Royal Australian New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists ( RANZCOG ) says the practice of " ritual nicks " could meet the cultural needs of some women and potentially save some people from drastic surgery .
Although illegal in Australia , female genital mutilation is common among some African , Asian and Middle Eastern communities but has been known to leave some young girls scarred for life when not carried out in proper clinical facilities .
RANZCOG secretary Gino Pecoraro told News Ltd , " We will need to start to think about [ its introduction ] but we would have to speak to community leaders from Australia . "
" But we need to make sure we do not legitimise the ritualistic maiming of children . "

RANZCOG said the issue would be discussed at a women 's health meeting in June .

HARGEISA ( Somalilandpress ) —
Three men from Somaliland who , ever since they were young dreamed of building a helicopter have designed and built their own helicopter in their own backyard using scrap metals and an old engine from a van .
The trio , Mohamed Abdi Barkadle , Saed Abdi Jide and Abdi Farah Lidan said the purpose of their helicopter was to be used to fight fire in the city and surrounding area .
They receive no major sponsors , financial nor material support from any one including the government , it is a three men vision and ingenuity .
This is the first ever helicopter built in any Somali speaking state .
The fact that the trio could do so much with so little will inspire a lot of Somalilanders .
To many Somalilanders , this is historical moment for Somaliland and it is possible very soon others will start manufacturing their own electronics and devices .
This is the time to support these promising Somalilanders ! , all stakeholders and regulatory agencies should rally round and assist these men to achieve their goal .
We wish them all the best from here Somalilandpress , we are certainly with you and we hope all the Somalilanders , friends and others who might be inspired by them get involved .
This gift is so completely wonderful .
I knew when I woke up this morning that it was out for delivery and I did n't get the package until I walked in the door from work at 9:45 tonight , and it deserved every bit of the excitement I had built up for it all day .
Alexgus said that he 's bad at planning gifts , and that he was going to pick some neat things that he hoped would make me happy , so he sent a neat periodical called yeti with a CD in the back that I 'm really excited about .
The book includes a story about a city in Tennessee called Oak Ridge that used to be a weapons enclave that I 'm especially excited to read - it 'll be a good way to brush up on the history of the state I transplanted myself to .
Second was a CD called Dear Companion by two gentleman named Ben Sollee - whom dear alexgus went to school with - and Daniel Martin Moore who is from my slightly - more - home - city of Cincinnati .
Third was BBQ sauce from a place called Mark 's that he wanted me to compare to famous Memphis BBQ .
Unfortunately , I have n't actually had real Memphis BBQ in the entire 11 1/2 months I 've lived here .
It smells amazing ( I have n't tasted it yet ) , lots of spice and a surprising amount of garlic .
I can see why it 's his favorite .
Last but absolutely not even a little bit least was an even more delicious smelling bag of coffee from a place called Heine Brothers in Mr. Alex 's hometown that he basically called his home away from home .
It 's Fair Trade and Certified Organic and I can't wait to take it by my amazing local coffee shop that I could n't do without so that I can have them grind it for me .
Thanks again alexgus .
This gift is about 1000X better than I expected it to me .
Menstruating : a sin ?

As we all know , when Onan spilled his seed God was displeased and slew him
When a woman menstruates she spills her eggs , does that mean she is committing a sin as bad as Onan 's during that time of the month ?
Of course the Lord has given us an easy , acceptable and failsafe way to prevent this period of uncleanliness : pregnancy : married women will never have to deal with the problem .
However , one of my daughters is now 11 years old and I fear she may soon start menstruating and she is not married yet
Should I find a good Christian husband for my daughter before she repeats Onan 's sin or does God allow unmarried girls to have this filthy period every month ?

When UC Berkeley officials came up with the idea of asking all new students to volunteer a DNA swab as part of an unusual fall orientation program , they expected to stimulate discussion .
They were n’t quite prepared for how much .
The plan drew quick criticism from privacy watchdogs and ethicists , who said the DNA project , linked to seminars about personalized medicine , would be an unprecedented and troubling use of genetics testing by an American university .
Several urged the campus to cancel or modify the project .
The university still plans to send the swabs this summer to 5,500 incoming freshmen and transfer students , asking them to return them with cells from inside their mouths .
Campus officials estimated that about 1,000 students would participate and said no one would be penalized for refusing .
The samples will be analyzed for gene variations that affect people ’s reactions to three dietary substances : lactose , folic acid and alcohol .
Only the participants will be able to learn about their own results , the project promises .
Then the samples will be destroyed .
Dubbed “ Bring Your Genes to Cal , ” the program is part of UC Berkeley ’s annual “ On the Same Page ” program , in which incoming students , like those at many colleges , typically are asked to read the same book over the summer and discuss them in fall seminars .
This year ’s program is more ambitious , seeking to engage students in a new way on a cutting - edge topic , said Alix Schwartz , who coordinates the orientation program for UC Berkeley ’s College of Letters and Science .
“ We needed something that will grab their attention , ” she said .
“ We felt if you get a swab in the mail , you will at least think about it . ”
When students arrive on campus , faculty members will lecture about what the DNA results could mean — facial flushing after drinking alcohol or the need to eat more green leafy vegetables , for example — and will be available for counseling , if students request it .
Those possible reactions to the three substances are not life - threatening , and finding out about them should not be traumatic , the professors heading the project said .
“ Our view was to select genes in which a student could either ignore what they learned , and be no worse off than they were before , or could use the information constructively if they choose , such as to tune their intake of dairy products , ” UC Berkeley genetics professor Jasper Rine , who will deliver the main orientation lecture , said in an e-mail .
But critics said that despite the disclaimers , incoming students would feel pressure to join in , perhaps out of concern they might alienate future professors .
“ That to me is anything but voluntary , ” said Jeremy Gruber , president of the Council for Responsible Genetics , based in Cambridge , Mass .
Gruber ’s organization , along with the Berkeley - based Center for Genetics and Society , is among those urging the campus to drop the project .
Such groups are increasingly concerned about privacy and the risk of discrimination in job hiring and medical insurance as the technology of DNA testing advances without broad agreement on its many uses .
Critics have also noted that the Food and Drug Administration has recently challenged the sale of over - the - counter genetics tests while it investigates medical claims associated with them .
At least one large drugstore chain has postponed plans to carry one such test .
The UC Berkeley orientation program ’s very name is coercive because students who do n’t agree to the test wo n’t feel “ on the same page ” with everyone else , said UC Berkeley and NYU sociology professor Troy Duster , who served on an advisory council to the National Center for Human Genome Research .
Duster and other critics say they also have concerns that the DNA samples could be used to explore other , more worrisome genetic traits and that there is no way to ensure that the material would remain private .
Mark Schlissel , UC Berkeley ’s dean of biological sciences , said that sufficient privacy protections are in place .
He also emphasized that the project was approved by the campus review board for all human - involved experiments .
Schlissel said he regretted that the initial information sent to faculty did not fully explain the project and that some critics reacted without knowing all the safeguards .
“ A lot of folks imagined the worst , and organizations that care a lot about these issues are using this as a way to get public attention , ” he said .
At the same time , he and Rine said they expected the debate over the plan to enliven the September seminars by scientists , sociologists , ethicists and lawyers .
“ We all have a stake in making sure that we maximize the benefits and minimize the risks of these new technologies , ” Rine said .
Arthur L. Caplan , director of the University of Pennsylvania ’s Center for Bioethics , said he supports the testing project , but recommends that students are told their results during one - on - one counseling sessions , rather than from a website , as is now planned .
“ I think the idea was clever and innovative , ” he said .
“ I think they came up with a very interesting idea in demonstrating personalized medicine and genetic testing . ”
One aspect of the project has been modified in response to concerns .
The university had planned to offer several more detailed DNA analyses from a commercial company as prizes in an essay and art contest about personalized medicine .
But the awards will now be cash ; the university said it did not want to appear to be endorsing any product or taking a position on the controversial issue of direct - to - consumer testing .
Administrators said the total cost of the testing is estimated to be about $ 50,000 , which will be funded by a College of Letters and Science donation pool , not state funds .
UC Berkeley ’s student newspaper , the Daily Californian , was the first to report on the DNA plan and comments on the paper ’s website in recent days have reflected some opposition : “ Big Brother at Its Most Insidious , ” one wrote .
“ Creepy , ” another said .
But Jeremy Hardin , a UC Berkeley - bound senior at Wilson High School in Long Beach , was among a number of students interviewed who voiced support for the project .
Hardin said he will be happy to send in his DNA samples and trusts the university to safeguard participants ’ privacy .
“ I ’m totally for it .
No one is forcing me to do it , and there ’s no real downside I can see , ” said the 17 - year - old , who expects to major in philosophy and take pre-med courses .
In addition , he said , “ you can actually learn something about yourself and about the group . ”

Perhaps because I am often viewed as a " doom - and - gloomer " blogger , I am acutely aware of the limits of doom - and - gloom thinking .
" Doom - and - gloom " in the service of truth and dismantling catastrophically false hopes is positive , but a doom - and - gloom perspective without limits is not .
Indulge me for a moment of meandering .
Some readers prefer the charts - and - data entries here on oftwominds.com , while others move on as soon as they discern a chart .
Why do I publish both types of analyses ?
Each serves a critical role but is insufficient in itself to offer an integrated understanding of our plight and possible solutions .
Without any charts - and - data analyses , then coverage of housing , global finance , China , etc. soon deteriorates into a fact - free repetitive rant .
But charts - and - data analyses alone are intrinsically inadequate to the task of probing the politics of experience which illuminates the cultural and social trends which drive the data .
Data , after all , can and is routinely massaged or manipulated to support whatever thesis is being presented -- usually a defense of the status quo ( a.k.a. " extend and pretend . " )
Another interesting aspect of this site is that many readers who write me say they like the site because it is humanistic and positive in tone .
This is of course a matter of perception ; one person 's positive tone ( downsizing expectations and energy - consumption , for instance ) is another person 's " trying to go back to the 19th century " ( i.e. downsizing is a negative dismissal of technology 's promise ) .
As the writer / proprietor , I can only report that the overwhelming majority of you perceive the site as positive despite the ' doom and gloom " often presented here .
I do not consider an exploration of reality and a dismantling of P.R. , manipulated data , self - serving " extend and pretend " misinformation and all the other full - court defenses of the status quo to be negative .
What is terribly negative is to misrepresent our situation in order to benefit those feeding at the trough of the status quo .
It is a terribly negative disservice to tell potential homebuyers , for instance , that the housing bust is over , and housing has resumed its " natural " upward rise in value .
Who makes such a claim ?
Those who stand to benefit from the facsimile of " growth " ( all the result of government stimulus and the outright socialization of the U.S. mortgage market ) being taken as if it were private , " organic " growth .
This kind of deception is viewed as " positive " in the Mainstream Media , even though the peddling of illusions and false hopes are immensely destructive to those who fall for the con/P.R./ propaganda .
Thus British Petroleum fed a lapdog Mainstream Media the " facts " that the oil well was leaking aa mere 1,000 barrels a day at the start of the disaster , when their own internal estimates suggested the outflow was dozens of times larger .
Was pumping out misinformation and glossing over the hard realities really providing a " positive " service to the public ?
Obviously not ; lies , misrepresentations , distortions and other manipulation is necessarily destructive of trust .
Now the public has lost whatever little faith they might have had in BP , the Mainstream Media and the agencies of the Federal government tasked with safeguarding the nation 's waters and providing oversight to the oil industry .
There is little more destructive and negative than misleading " positive spin . "
Thus I consider it my sacred duty to present the facts as they can discerned or gathered , and to provide a context free of spin , hype , marketing , and other defenses of the Elites who profit from the status quo never being challenged .
For example : if my friends had listened to any one of my dozens of warnings posted here about the housing bubble in 2005 , 2006 and 2007 , they would not now be debt - serfs , toiling endlessly just to pay their mortgages and property taxes .
The hype that " housing never goes down , " etc. has destroyed untold millions of households ' wealth .
Meanwhile the " doom and gloom " served up here and elsewhere would have saved these households from a needless financial disaster that will be unfolding for decades .
On the other hand , readers also report that they are deeply depressed by the constant negativity of our " news " and overall situation .
Absorbing hour after hour of negative " news " and analysis is spiritually and psychologically wearing .
What is the " payoff " for absorbing all this negativity ?
If it does n't help us avoid a needless disaster in our own lives , then perhaps it does n't serve a positive purpose .
Human nature has been selected to respond to threats in a limited number of ways : fight or flight , collaboration , experimentation , rituals , voting with our feet , etc .
If we feel we have no control over the situation , then the stress becomes corrosive .
This has been studied in the workplace , and it was found that those jobs in which the worker had little to no control caused the sort of destructive stress that leads to physical and mental health breakdowns .
Those jobs in which workers had a large amount of control over their work and work environment may have the same level of stress , but the workers did not experience the same negative consequences .
Stress / problems need not be negative ; they can be spurs to learning , experimentation and innovation .
We can see the " no control " negativity in the " news " with which we are hammered constantly .
Sudan is a wretched mess , replete with death , rape , hunger and every evil known to humanity .
So is The Congo , and a hundred other places beyond our control .
Where the U.S. has conquered / occupied territory ( Iraq and Afghanistan ) , there is still only 6 hours of electricity a day in Basra , and car bombs are killing dozens in Baghdad .
Both Iraq and Afghanistan are riddled with a systemic corruption which mocks the lofty goals set by a naive ( or was that hubris and naivete just P.R. for our consumption ? )
American occupation and adminstration .
Even when it is our own nation which is nominally " in charge " ( be it Iraq , Afghanistan or the oil - fouled waters of the Gulf ) , we as citizens have little to no control .
Our " control " is limited to rejecting the current slate of Elites defending the status quo ( Republicrat or Demopublican , take your pick ) at the ballot box or " taking to the streets " in peaceful demonstrations of our displeasure .
Since the status quo has essentially no need for our approval of anything -- 98 % of all incumbents handily win re-election , and their replacements are soon strapped into the grid of special interests , party " discipline " and bureaucracies which constitute the interlocking status quo-- then demonstrations are safely ignored , discounted or demonized .
There is another uglier side to a fascination with doom - and - gloom reports .
Whether we confess to it or not , there is an addictive aspect to doom and gloom which goes hand in hand with the distractive , addictive qualities of the TV and Web .
Nicolas Carr has made a bit of a splash recently with his book The Shallows : What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains .
Carr fi rst launched his critique in a 2008 article for The Atlantic titled " Is Google Making Us Stupid ? "
I think I beat Mr. Carr to the subject by three years , as I wrote Flattening the Knowledge Curve : The " Googling " Effect in May 2005 .
My point was that information is not the same as knowledge .
( As reader Walt Howard kindly posted years ago on another blog about oftwominds.com : " This guy is THE leading visionary on reality .
He routinely discusses things which no one else has talked about , yet , turn out to be quite relevant months later . "
( This ends our shameless plug . )
Carr summarized his views in this article :
As technology advances , deep reading suffers :
Reading from a screen is very different from reading from a book .
A book provides a shield against distraction , allowing us to focus our entire attention on an author 's narrative or argument .
When text is put onto a screen , it enters what the science fiction writer Cory Doctorow terms an " ecosystem of interruption technologies . "
The words have to compete for our attention with links , e-mails , texts , tweets , Facebook updates , videos , ads and all the other visual stimuli that pour through our computers .
Media profits from our addiction to misery and distraction .
So naturally , they provide us with gripping images of misery ( full - color doom and gloom , baby ) and multiple distractions ( 200 channels of marketing , linkfests , etc . )
What exactly will I gain from watching a brief bit of video on the miseries suffered by people in Sudan ?
Is n't this the acme of " eye- catching news " over which I have no control ?
Is n't this a blatant exploitation of the human " survival technique " to focus on threats , injury , trauma , lest it somehow overtake us ?
Why does the freeway slow down to a crawl at an accident ?
Not because the damaged vehicles are blocking the roadway - - it 's " looky - lou 's " craning their necks to see if there 's any blood , or to ogle the twisted steel and torn plastic .
We can't help ourselves , and so the media plays relentlessly to this instinct .
Breathless " news " : if it bleeds , it leads .
What did I learn in a three - minute video segment on the multiple , overlapping miseries of Sudan ?
Did I actually acquire any real knowledge , or did all I really " consume " was a shallow , superficial , very possibly distorted or sensationalized visual depiction of an extended " car crash " on the other side of the world ?
Cui bono -- to whose benefit ?
Am I a " better citizen " as a result of absorbing this emotionally disturbing and traumatizing " news " about a situation over which I have no control ?
I do n't think so .
There is another disturbing element to the entire " doom and gloom " culture which my friend G.F.B. observed has some characteristics in common with the joys of horror movies : the more ghastly and awful the " news , " the more we revel in it , and the more we enjoy the vicarious thrills of spiraling disaster , mayhem and fear .
Is it any wonder that so many people concerned about the future have horror - film - like images playing in their brains about roving mobs of heavily armed , hunger - crazed bad guys who must be mowed down , Rambo - style , and of a dystopian future that plays up the very worst instincts of humanity and deletes any of the good ones ?
Little wonder there ; positive instincts detract from the drama and the fear .
The vast , pervasive ignorance of the American public about history plays perfectly into a TV - movie - based " reality " that is utterly divorced from real life .
As I note here repeatedly , when disaster has struck major cities filled with armed citizens ( for example , the city of San Francisco burning down in 1906 ) , virtually none of the horror - movie visions of deranged violence played out .
A few dozen suspected looters did get shot by authorities , but the other 350,000 displaced residents rather boringly got on with their lives .
When readers write me about being dispirited and depressed by our many predicaments and problems , I always recommend turning off the TV and the Internet .
Why burden ourselves with a deranging mishmash of superficial , sensationalized , distorted - for - dramtic purposes visuals and horror - film accounts or " analyses " which thrill and captivate us with their " but wait , it gets worse -- much worse ! " narrative .
We always have some level of control in our lives , and it is a positive , enriching practice to focus on that .
Our control begins with limiting the flow of sewage that flows into our brains from the Web and the media .
That which we cannot control in any realistic fashion and which has essentially no impact on our lived experience should be minimized , and viewed with vigilant skepticism : is this actually knowledge , or it is merely superficial " information " designed to ensnare our wandering , context - deprived , manic attention ?
We also control what we opt into and opt out of every day , with every dollar we spend and with every minute we invest in tasks , interests , reading and projects .
I am aware of the puzzling deaths of many bee hives in the past years ; I noticed the absence of honey bees and bumblebees in our own garden .
My " action " and " solution " : to keep some flowering plants growing year - round , so any wandering bee or other pollinator ( moth , etc. ) would have something to eat and / or something to benefit their " household . "
Yes , yes , oh yes , it is small , but is n't it meaningful to the insects which feed on my garden year - round ?
Is n't the pleasure I extract from watching the insects flit from one poppy blossom to the next of some value ?
I do not need an " expert " or media / Web article to confirm this is so ; I experience it myself .
My experience does not need to be mediated by the marketing / media complex .
If I pay off my credit card and never run a balance , is n't that striking a small but eventually mortal blow to the system of debt servitude which we proudly proclaim as the " wonder of consumer credit " ?
How about if I pay off my mortgage and remove it from the pool of debt which Wall Street can slice and dice into debt - backed securities ?
Absolutely , that is individual control with a cumulatively massive impact .
If I vote against the compromised , Elite - captured incumbent , regardless of party affiliation , wo n't this endless rejection of the status quo eventually inspire a non-capturable person to seek public office ?
If 4 % of us pay off all our credit cards and mortgages , then the Pareto principle suggests this will exert a profoundly outsized influence on 64 % of the somnambulant , media - ensnared debt serfs that share our land .
And should the number of people who actively vote out incumbents and reduce their debt - serfdom to zero rises to 20 % , then they will exert outsized influence on fully 80 % of the populace .
No , we are not powerless and without control .
Yes , we are powerless to stop the oil leak , and most of us are not able by reason of locale or other duties to volunteer to sop up oil on beaches .
But we can " stop the madness " and limit our complicity by using as little oil as possible .
There are other power sources at hand ; Spain and Germany get about 1/3 of their electricity from wind , solar , etc. , compared to 4 % in the U.S. , because they have made energy which they control a national priority via subsidies , policies , etc .
Meanwhile , we subsidize offshore drilling to the tune of billions of dollars and mock " alt energy " as " uneconomical . "
Cui bono , indeed .
Doom and gloom is only valuable if it works in a positive fashion to dispel and dismantle destructive half - truths , frauds , embezzlements , propaganda and misinformation designed to serve and protect the fiefdoms of the status quo .
It is easy to confuse this sort of clarity - producing skepticism with a dystopian , media - induced solipsism in which there is no control and no positive instincts ; in that deranged state , there is only fear and the emotionally corrosive thrill of " But wait !
It gets worse ! "
The subtext of this site is always : we do have control , even if it the apparent absence of action : that is , not buying a house can be a very positive action .
If we tend even a single plant , the pyschic rewards of that infintesimal ( on the planetary stage ) nurturing pays far more dividends to the individual than hours of media consumption and distraction .
If we do indeed want to learn actual knowledge , then here 's a rule of thumb : read at least 250 pages of a book devoted to the subject by an author whose bias or point of departure you can assess .
Better yet , read 500 pages from several sources .
After 500 pages from books , then you will have the foundations of a context to organize future information on the subject .
That 's why I strictly limit my time online and devote a certain amount of time every day to reading non-superficial periodicals and books .
Reading deeply is another way of gaining control , for with knowledge we loose the bounds of derangement , distraction and manipulation which the marketing / media complex thrives on .
Let them peddle it all they want ; it 's within our control whether to " consume " it or not .
The same can be said of all the manufactured / processed foods which are relentlessly marketed ; we have control .
We do n't have to buy it or eat it .
The easiest control , and perhaps the greatest power we each possess , is simple : turn it off , limit our exposure and build redoubts of knowledge against the inch - deep flood of superficiality , distraction , hafl - truths and context - free " facts " which pass for " news " and " information . "
Steve Stockman , among the best of Washington ’s freshmen Congressmen , holds a daily prayer session that staff members attend voluntarily .
Last year , nobody could have stopped it .
But thanks to the “ Contract With America , ” Congress now has to comply with the 1964 Civil Rights Act .
The ACLU says Stockman may be discriminating on the basis of religion .
Now it ’s up to the executive branch ’s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to decide .
Like the rest of the country , Stockman ’s office will probably choose the path of least resistance : comply with the planners ’ wishes .
The Left wins another one .
The incident points to the shortsightedness of forcing such laws on Congress .
Bad law should be repealed , not extended , especially not to the only branch of government the people can directly influence .
The executive branch can now effectively control the internal life of every Congressional office , just as it controls the internal life of most every business , bank , and educational institution .
Already , the law is being used selectively against trouble making Congressmen .
Sure , Stockman and staff can invoke First Amendment protections of religious freedom .
And the Fourth Amendment was supposed to protect privacy rights in homes , schools , and businesses .
The Constitution has never stood in the way of civil rights enforcement .
In the name of stamping out illegal discrimination , fundamental rights like freedom of association are denied daily .
The ethical gloss of civil rights has long since vanished , leaving only the brute power of statism to enforce an egalitarian agenda .
White males , for example , are no longer fooled by the euphemisms .
Whether its “ set asides , ” “ affirmative action , ” or “ timetables , ” they know it means denying economic opportunity to them in order to benefit others .
Politicians are promising to do something about it , but they have missed the larger point .
Our troubles do n’t stem from “ quotas , ” “ set asides , ” and the like ; they stem from the presumption that government should be monitoring “ discrimination ” in the first place .
Pass all the anti-quota laws you want .
Until anti-discrimination law is repealed , nothing can block the march of big government .
Think about the term “ discrimination . ”
It means choosing among several options .
Our every thought , word , and deed are choices among options .
We stop discriminating only when we become slaves or when we die .
When the government got into the business of regulating our choices through anti-discrimination law , it was attempting to regulate our thoughts .
It first forbid certain kinds of choices when made “ on grounds of ” race , sex , religion , and national origin .
That was expanded to disability , which includes “ mental ” disability .
Nowadays , our whole society and economy are burden by the anti-discrimination police .
This was the inevitable result of a 30 - year old legal trick .
The Civil Rights
Act of 1964 did n’t forbid any particular racial or sexual configuration in school or the workplace .
An employer or admissions officer is free to choose , so long as he does n’t choose for the wrong reason .
Single - race or single - sex workplaces  freedom of association ’s acid test  were still allowed .
But , according to law , they could not be consciously created .
You can hire only white males , but you cannot intend to hire only white males .
How can we prove intent ?
This is where the trouble begins .
Every decision is made from a mixture of motivations .
Not even the actor himself can fully know what went into a decision .
Certainly the government cannot .
But by forbidding certain kinds of discrimination , the government gives itself power to define what constitutes evidence for malintent .
Courts , it ’s hardly surprising , took the easiest path .
To prove discrimination , look for circumstantial evidence .
They discover “ disproportionate effects ” and “ disparate impact . ”
This translates to : you ’re guilty because you have not hired enough women and minorities .
To avoid that fate , you must adopt affirmative action , quotas , goals , timetables , and set asides : the spoils system now poisoning American life .
Let ’s say Congress wanted to stop shotgun weddings .
So it passed a law saying : “ Marriages entered into by parties at or under the age of 25 must be based on love , not convenience ; Neither should this law discourage early married as such . ”
This is enforced with $ 100,000 fines .
After an explosion of litigation and government investigations , who’d be surprised when couples would wait until age 26 to get married ?
So it is with the civil rights movement .
Its members may protest that they did n’t intend quotas and the like .
In fact , the civil rights movement gave us exactly what it was supposed to give us : legal preferences for its constituents and institutionalized disadvantages for everyone else .
Here ’s a recent application .
When the merchants of Union Point , Georgia , drew up a list of known shoplifters , the Justice Department intervened to stop them .
Everyone on the list was black .
In order to comply with the Civil Rights Act , some on the list would have to be white .
If there are no white shoplifters  and black police chief said there were none  there can be no list and thus no property rights enforcement .
Union Point is a microcosm of America under civil rights .
In the case of religious discrimination , you ’re guilty by choosing religion over secularism .
By holding a prayer session in his office , is Representative Stockman culpable under the Act ?
Well , he ’s holding a prayer session , not a Black Mass .
This might discourage Devil worshipers from applying for a job , a situation which the Civil Rights
Act is supposed to prevent .
The hysteria about same - race adoptions is another case in point .
Most adoption agencies allow couples to choose the race of their child .
It ’s hardly surprising that when adopting a child , the vast majority of people choose their own race .
The National Association of Black Social Workers , for example , encourages blacks to adopt blacks .
But the Institute for Justice in D.C. and the Wall Street Journal are pushing a federal law to forbid discrimination in adoption .
As with businessmen in hiring , colleges in admissions , and hotels with customers , adoption agencies would not be allowed to take race into consideration when placing children .
That is , a black family could not request to adopt a black child .
An Asian couple with special affection for Vietnamese orphans can forget it .
A white family could not request a white baby .
It ’s a fair assumption that no one wants to gamble when it comes to intimate matters like the race of your children .
That ’s why , if passed , this law would destroy the market for adoption rearing rights as we know it .
It would be just another of the thousands of enterprises destroyed by Washington ’s egalitarian planners .
It ’s conservatives , not liberals , who are naive about the real meaning of anti-discrimination law .
They say they love the Civil Rights Act , “ Dr. ” King , and the “ ideal ” of the color - blind society .
They want to protect “ individuals ” from discrimination , but not “ groups . ”
They like “ equality of opportunity ” but do n’t like “ equality of result . ”
Shelby Steele , an author whose status as a black man allows him to pronounce against quotas , says he would gladly get rid of affirmative action .
But in that case , he writes , there would have to be “ criminal penalties , ” not just civil ones , for discriminating against blacks .
William Kristol , the Republican leadership ’s excuse for an intellectual , agrees .
This is foolish and dangerous .
You cannot abolish affirmative action and quotas and still enforce the Civil Rights Act.
Racial preferences are bound up with anti-discrimination law  logically , politically , historically , and jurisprudentially .
The Steele - Kristol proposal would actually be totalitarian .
It would criminalize thoughts and intents that are already forbidden under civil law .
If people feel pressure to conform to egalitarian dictates now , imagine how much worse it would be if jail were a possibility ?
Neither is the California Civil Rights initiative much of a solution .
This referendum says that neither discrimination nor preferences will be allowed in the conduct of state business .
But such a law invites more questions than it answers .
Depending on how it ’s enforced , it may not be an improvement .
Its authors hope to dethrone race and sex as criteria for state contracts and college admissions , and enshrine “ merit ” as its replacement .
But “ merit ” is a subjective and nebulous concept .
Isolating the abstraction of “ merit ” from race and sex will be difficult or impossible ; the attempt will invite even more litigation .
What if not discriminating ( as interpreted by courts ) requires giving preferences ( as interpreted by courts ) ?
What if not giving preferences appears to be discrimination ?
What if the word “ preference ” is interpreted ( by courts ) not as quota but as a * de facto* lack of minority representation ?
As in : you have too many white males on the payroll ; you must be giving special preference to them .
There ’s no way to win this game , because , even with this referendum , the government still holds all the cards .
Quotas and racial preferences are already banned under the 1964 and 1991 Civil Rights Acts .
These preferences persist because the only foundation they need is anti-discrimination itself .
What good will banning quotas do so long as government has the ability to veto the results of private decision making ?
It was n’t quotas that led to the class - action looting of Denny ’s , which ended in owners giving away 47 restaurants to the officially privileged .
End every set aside , and you still have whole housing complexes harassed for keeping out criminals .
Abolish all affirmative action , and colleges will still have to recruit the intellectually challenged in order to avoid the appearance of discrimination .
The only way to end the terror of quotas , and to establish a free market in talent , is to repeal the 1964 Civil Rights Act .
The government needs to be stripped of its power to determine if anyone is discriminating or giving preferences ( or even determining on what constitutes either ) .
The government of a free society cannot have the power to declare holding subjective intentions , whether good or bad , to be illegal .
If a college or university wants a racial quota , fine .
Another can have an exclusivist admission policy .
The same goes for business : the government should never again tell anyone they have too many or not enough of this or that group .
We also need to give up the notion of a “ color - blind society ”  a goal as absurdly utopian as socialism itself  and settle for real fairness : a neutral legal environment of contract enforcement .
Imagine a world without anti-discrimination law .
Every employee would be planned and wanted .
Business would be free to advertise for job openings without fearing lawsuits .
There would be no more quota loans from banks .
The credit rating would mean something again .
The university could get back to being a place of learning instead of a victimological remediation center .
Do n’t count on Washington to end affirmative action any time soon .
Neither party intends the overhaul of civil rights .
The quota culture is so huge  in academia , business , and in the official philosophy governing public policy in this country  that it requires political root canal .

Greece is likely to need far more financial aid than seems to be on offer
IN FEBRUARY European Union leaders vowed to take “ determined and co-ordinated action ” to protect Greece against a sovereign - debt default and to stop its troubles infecting the rest of the euro area .
Weeks later the same politicians are still discussing how precisely to meet that pledge ( see article ) .
The need for clarity is now more urgent .
Greece has to refinance some € 20 billion ( $ 27 billion ) of debts that mature in April and May .
The yields on ten - year Greek government bonds rose to 6.3 % this week , a spread of some three percentage points over German Bunds .
The euro fell to its lowest level against the dollar for ten months after Portugal , another troubled euro - zone country , suffered a downgrade .
A standby fund for Greece of € 25 billion is rumoured , and euro - zone ministers now seem less frosty at the thought of help from the IMF .
That may be enough to calm markets and enable Greece to roll over its debts .
But it will be only a temporary fix .
It will take years to repair Greece 's public finances , which means a much larger rescue fund will be needed if it is to avoid default .
The Greek government has somehow to keep its economy on an even keel while pushing through a huge fiscal tightening .
Countries that seek IMF help generally have to endure brutal cuts in public spending , which deepen recessions .
To counter that effect , the IMF typically counsels a weaker currency .
Sadly , this is not an option for Greece .
Stuck in the euro , its exchange rate with its main trading partners is fixed .
Greece cannot devalue , so it needs more time to adjust than the three years it has agreed with its EU partners — and a bigger safety net while it does .
Just how big ?
Analysis by The Economist suggests a figure of € 75 billion rather than € 25 billion .
Greece is likely to need five years to get its deficit down below 3 % of GDP ( see table ) .
On our projections interest payments will rise from 5 % of GDP to 8.4 % in that time , to reflect the higher cost of issuing new debts and of refinancing old ones .
Other budgetary cuts will be needed to offset this .
By our reckoning the Greek government will have to increase the “ primary ” budget balance ( ie , excluding interest payments ) by 13.5 percentage points of GDP to cap its debt burden .
That is bound to have an effect on growth .
Our projections assume that nominal GDP will be 5 % lower by 2014 .
This is necessarily a stylised analysis , which requires some brave assumptions ( some of which may even be too kind ) .
The estimate of how big a bail - out Greece may need hinges on a particularly heroic one : that private investors have had their fill of Greek bonds but would still roll over existing debts if a bail - out fund covered the country 's new borrowing .
Our projections imply that Greece will run-up an extra € 75 billion of debt by 2014 , by which time its debt will stabilise at 153 % of GDP .
This figure is a rough guide to how much financial aid Greece may require .
That may be too much even for the newly flush IMF .
For its share of Latvia 's rescue , says Laurence Boone of Barclays Capital , the fund stretched to 12 times the country 's “ quota ” , the amount a member country contributes to the fund 's coffers .
A €75 billion package would require the IMF to provide around 40 times Greece 's quota if the costs were split with the EU .
Optimists say that demand for Greek bonds will revive as its budget deficit falls and confidence returns .
There is no theory that says investors will tolerate debts of 113 % of GDP ( Greece 's ratio in 2009 ) but balk at anything higher .
Japan 's gross public debt is almost 200 % of its GDP with as yet few signs of revulsion .
But Japan is the only sovereign issuer of yen bonds , while Greece is the least creditworthy of the many countries offering euro bonds .
Japan is a creditor nation that can rely on domestic savers .
Greece is a deficit country that depends on “ footloose ” investors , says Thomas Mayer of Deutsche Bank .
Greek bonds are attractive because of their generous yields .
If the interest - rate spread stays close to 3 % , a buyer of a ten - year German bond who holds it until it matures would make only three - quarters of the return he could make on a similar Greek bond .
For bold investors , such a gap is ample insurance against the risk that Greece may not able to pay back all it has promised .
Others think the reward may not be worth the gamble .
A debt restructuring , where bondholders are forced to swallow losses , is a “ substantial risk ” if recession in Greece drags on , says Marco Annunziata of UniCredit .
Its would - be rescuers may conclude that throwing money at a weak , if profligate , country is still the cheapest way to stop trouble spreading .
But the likely bill for Greece 's bail - out looks larger than many are assuming .

BALTIMORE — “ Criminal negligence .
The verdict is guilty ! ”
That was the message proclaimed by pickets walking near a local BP gas station here June 12 as British Petroleum ’s gusher continued to spew 80,000 barrels of crude oil daily into the Gulf of Mexico .
There is no end in sight of this nightmare .
Passing motorists honked and waved and one rolled down his window and shouted , “ It ’s a good thing you ’re doing . ”
It was one of hundreds of picket lines , rallies and candlelight vigils across the nation against BP in recent days for unleashing the worst “ man-made ” environmental catastrophe in U.S. history , a preventable disaster that could destroy the habitat of the Gulf for decades , perhaps even a century .
MoveOn.org organized more than 150 candlelight vigils last week including about a dozen along the Louisiana , Alabama , and Florida Gulf Coasts as well as Florida ’s Atlantic coast .
Phil Levitt , a MoveOn organizer in West Palm Beach , Fla. , told the vigil that Congress must lift the $ 75 million cap on Big Oil ’s liability for environmental disasters .
“ We do n’t want compromise , ” he said .
“ We want the highest liability limit possible … People are losing their jobs . ”
He warned that the oil plume may be caught up in the Gulf Stream and foul the Atlantic Ocean , beaches and wetlands up the coast as far as the Carolinas .
Dave Schott , a veteran peace and justice activist in Baltimore was holding a placard , “ Boycott BP and the Big Six . ”
He told the World , “ It ’s outrageous .
BP is wrecking the environment and destroying jobs too .
The oil is killing the wildlife , killing the fish and the shrimp .
Families who have been shrimp fishermen in the Gulf for generations are losing their jobs and their way of life . ”
Maria Allwine , a leader of the Green Party of Maryland held a sign “ Spill , Baby , Spill . ”
She took note that former Alaska Governor , Sarah Palin , and her tea party supporters no longer chant “ Drill , Baby , Drill ” adding , “ She left the people of Alaska in the lurch .
She has nothing to offer the people . ”
June 12 was set aside as an “ International Day of Action against BP ” with local protests across the nation and around the world , she said .
The Communist Party of Maryland and the Young Communist League , one of the initiating organizations of the picketline here distributed a statement pointing out that 11 workers died in the April 20 — Earth Day — explosion of BP ’s Deepwater Horizon rig .
Two weeks earlier , April 5 , 29 coal miners died in the explosion of Massey Energy ’s Upper Big Branch mine in West Virginia and on April 2 , six workers died in an explosion at Tesoro ’s refinery in Anacortes , Washington .
“ Those responsible for these preventable disasters should be indicted on charges of criminal negligence , manslaughter , ” the statement said .
The 46 workers who died are victims of “ profit greed ” as oil and coal companies flout health and safety laws , engage in speed - up and corner cutting , “ evil fruit of 30 years of Reagan - Bush deregulation . ”
The statement points out that then - VP Dick Cheney , former CEO of Halliburton , rejected acoustical shutoff valves for ocean - bottom oil wells on grounds they “ cost too much ” even though they are standard on North Sea oil wells .
“ We should not allow … Cheney to slink away to his ‘ undisclosed location , ” the statement said .
“ Put the criminals on trial . ”
The statement also called on Congress to stop stalling and enact a “ green energy ” program to convert to wind , solar , and other renewable energy , and hire millions of jobless workers insulating homes , schools and office buildings .
“ Nationalize BP , Exxon - Mobil , Massey Energy .
Operate them in the public interest , ” the statement concluded .

Hello everyone !
So , today I wanted to tell you a little bit about this month ’s featured comic .
Punch an ’
Pie is just great , to say the least , but I want to be upfront with you : it ’s a lesbian webcomic .
Now , now , all you young boys and girls , slow down .
This comic is totally SFW .
Those searching for hot steamy scenes with little clothing and / or ample nudity will not be pleased with this selection .
If you are looking for some hot naughty bits , however , I recommend heading over to Moon Over June if you have n’t heard of it already .
Boobies await you , friends .
So. Punch an’ Pie . Wow .
Ok .
I ’m gonna try and hold back a little bit , but no promises .
First things first , Punch an ’ Pie has two authors : Aeire , the writer , and Chris Daily , the artist .
Right of the bat you can tell that Chris is absolutely gifted with facial expressions .
He captures the main characters so perfectly , especially in the eyes .
I love the emotions .
While the art style could be classified as simple ( compared to other comics such as Yu+ Me ) , I think it would be a shame to say such things .
The characters are so well developed you ’d swear they were your friends .
Aeire is a wonderful writer .
Lesbian antics aside , I ca n’t express how much I relate to Angela .
Her jealousy , her quirks , her love of her mediocre job … * sigh . * Gotta love it .
So , if you like cute lesbian stories that revolve around everyday people with no magical powers but still deal with common shit , you ’ll love Punch an’ Pie.
( AKA , if you like QC , you ’ll like this . )
Tata for now !

The Food and Drug Administration is seriously considering whether to approve the first genetically engineered animal that people would eat  salmon that can grow at twice the normal rate .
The developer of the salmon has been trying to get approval for a decade .
But the company now seems to have submitted most or all of the data the F.D.A. needs to analyze whether the salmon are safe to eat , nutritionally equivalent to other salmon and safe for the environment , according to government and biotechnology industry officials .
A public meeting to discuss the salmon may be held as early as this fall .
Some consumer and environmental groups are likely to raise objections to approval .
Even within the F.D.A. , there has been a debate about whether the salmon should be labeled as genetically engineered ( genetically engineered crops are not labeled ) .
The salmon ’s approval would help open a path for companies and academic scientists developing other genetically engineered animals , like cattle resistant to mad cow disease or pigs that could supply healthier bacon .
Next in line behind the salmon for possible approval would probably be the “ enviropig , ” developed at a Canadian university , which has less phosphorus pollution in its manure .
from Jim Stanford
One of the most controversial topics that will be addressed at this month ’s G - 20 meetings in Toronto , Canada will be the proposal for new taxes on banks and other financial institutions .
Unfortunately , the host to the summit , Canada ’s strongly neoliberal Conservative government , has already expressed strident opposition to any new tax on banks – whether a Robin Hood - style tax as proposed by Oxfam and other progressive groups , or the milder measures being studied by the IMF .
While the host government certainly does not have any veto power at these summits , Canada ’s vocal opposition to any new taxes ( or restrictions of any kind ) on private banks certainly throws up another roadblock to get something done .
Indeed , with President Obama adopting ( for the time being , anyway ) a more populist , finance - bashing tone ( symbolized by the lawsuit against Goldman Sachs ) , Canada ’s government – led by Finance Minister Jim Flaherty – has become the leading international voice against new bank taxes .
Before a supportive hometown crowd on Toronto ’s Bay Street ( Canada ’s version of Wall Street ) , he recently denounced the idea of “ excessive , arbitrary , punitive ” taxes on Canada ’s banks , which weathered the global financial storm with flying colours .
Our banks did n’t make bad , risky decisions .
Our banks did n’t join the excesses that brought down American and European institutions .
Our banks behaved prudently and rationally .
Our banks did n’t need a bail - out .
“ We ’re not going to punish our banks for the fact that they have acted responsibly , ” he righteously thundered .
The market worked well in Canada , he argues , so we ’re not going to mess with it – and neither should other countries .
This pompously self - congratulatory tone is not remotely justified by the economic facts .
The reality is that Canada ’s uber - profitable private banks are supported by a tight web of government protections and subsidies .
Their consistent profits and relative stability reflect much less the market - driven rationality of their executives , than the virtue of public regulation and protection .
Despite this protected situation , however , the banks did indeed receive unprecedented government support at the time of the crisis ( through a range of measures that provided upwards of $ 200 billion Cdn. in liquidity support when the banks needed it the most ) .
Finally , and most painfully , far from increasing taxes on the banks ( as so many are now proposing ) , Flaherty ’s government is actually cutting them .
Here are the facts about Canada ’s banking system , the support it receives from government , and the direction of bank taxes in Canada :
Canada ’s banking system is dominated by 5 big banks which control some 90 percent of total banking assets in the country .
They have earned steady , above - normal profits every year for almost two decades .
Even in fiscal 2009 , with the global system melting down around them , they earned a combined after - tax profit for the year of $ 13.5 billion ( for those 5 banks alone ) .
This comfortable and lucrative oligopoly is reinforced by government prohibition against any of the major banks being merged or taken over by a controlling interest , and a complementary requirement that all of the banks must be majority Canadian owned .
This protected the large banks against take - over threats from U.S. and other foreign banks , which were flush with cash while the bubble was expanding .
When manufacturing workers ask for defence against competing imports , they are denounced as “ protectionist . ”
But Canada ’s banks get this kind of assistance every day of the year .
The financial sector ( which employs just 6 percent of Canadian workers ) has been sucking up over one - quarter of all business profits in Canada .
Incredibly , amidst a wicked recession that was centred in finance , that share actually rose last year .
Canada has a strong public system of deposit insurance , unconditionally guaranteeing cash and term deposits up to $ 60,000 per person per account .
Depositors can access the guarantee several times over , by opening multiple accounts with multiple institutions .
Public deposit insurance mostly defuses the risk of any panic attacks on the banks from the public in times of stress .
More importantly in the recent crisis , Canada has a strong public institution which guarantees almost all residential mortgages , the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation ( CMHC ) .
So long as a mortgage meets basic CMHC requirements ( which were relaxed in recent years , as CMHC followed the industry ’s lead in allowing increasingly lax down - payment and other terms ) , the mortgage is guaranteed by CMHC ( a government - owned agency ) .
This meant that Canadian banks never faced the risk of widespread mortgage defaults that helped bring down their U.S. counterparts .
The government faced that risk .
Also , the CMHC guarantee facilitated a more reliable and convenient process of mortgage securitization for Canada ’s banks ( most Canadian mortgages are still securitized ) .
Because they were government - guaranteed , mortgage - based bonds and related assets never lost their value as they did in the U.S. ( with consequently destructive knock - on effects on balance sheets , bank capital , and so on ) .
Despite all this regular support , when the financial crisis hit Canada ’s government stepped in with additional , extraordinary measures to support the private banks .
Finance Minister Flaherty implemented an Extraordinary Financing Framework ( EFF ) that provided a potential total of $ 200 billion in liquidity assistance for the private banks , delivered via a number of forms .
These measures included an innovative process of “ swapping ” cash for CMHC - guaranteed mortgages ( so that the government temporarily took ownership of the mortgages ) , emergency ultra -low - interest loans , and other forms of capital injection .
The banks tapped into these measures energetically as the crisis worsened .
The funds have since been repaid ( easily , as the banks retained healthy profitability right through the credit ) – but that does n’t negate the fact that this bail - out was essential to preserving their stability .
The relative “ success ” and stability of Canada ’s banking system has much less to do with the rationality of private decision - taking , and much more to do with the wisdom and effectiveness of public regulation , public insurance , and outright public ownership .
We Canadians are glad that our banks are stable .
We would n’t even necessarily begrudge the above - normal profits that are generated in this protected , supported oligopoly , so long as the banks do their job at supplying stable credit to the real economy – and so long as they pay their damn taxes .
However , Flaherty ’s government is relaxing even that last , modest bit of social accountability over private banks .
Indeed , the Finance Minister ’s tough talk against the Robin Hood tax seems designed to provide useful cover for the fact that his government is actually cutting bank taxes – not increasing them .
On January 1 corporate taxes fell by a full percentage point , and under Mr. Flaherty ’s fiscal plan they will fall three more points by 2012 .
That will save Canada ’s financial sector around $ 2 billion per year .
Incredibly , these tax cuts are being implemented even as Flaherty ’s government grapples with a $ 40 billion + deficit , and warns Canadians that they must tighten their belts in coming years to balance the books .
Let ’s start the balancing process with the banks , which continue to generate unusual profits despite the global financial crisis which they were very much a part of causing .
Cancelling the latest corporate tax cuts would recoup $ 2 billion per year from the financial sector alone .
Better yet , restoring tax rates for the financial sector to where they were when the Conservatives took power ( 21 percent , plus a 1.12 percent surtax ) would boost the take to $ 4 billion per year .
So before Ottawa cuts a single person off unemployment benefits , lays off a single civil servant , or sells a single public asset in the name of deficit reduction , it had better tap the banks for their full contribution to running the government that saved their own bacon .
That ’s not excessive or punitive .
It ’s simply called paying your fair share .
And do n’t believe Mr. Flaherty or Prime Minister Stephen Harper when they lecture the world in Toronto about the supposed virtues of Canada ’s more “ rational ” banks .
They did n’t behave as aggressively as those in other countries – mostly because they did n’t feel any compulsion to .
They were comfortable making swads of profits being less “ innovative , ” in the context of a regulated , oligopolistic , government - guaranteed industry .
Moreover , when the bubble burst , the nanny state was still on hand for Canada ’s banks , with massive additional support .
We could have a discussion about the extent to which the Robin Hood tax or other taxes would actually change bank behaviour ( I tend to think that stronger , more direct regulations and controls are necessary , not just fiscal disincentives , to really put a dent in the destructive processes of leveraged speculation ) .
But there ’s no debate at all that banks should make a decent contribution , through their taxes , to the social costs of the crisis they caused .
And Canada ’s protected , profitable banks would be a great place to start .
New Zealand are the rank outsiders for this tournament – or 32nd favourites , if you like – available at up to 2000 / 1 .
They would see a single point as an achievement in South Africa , and their saving grace is that they are in a relatively weak group , alongside three fairly defensive sides .
What strengths can they draw upon ?
Well , they are not entirely lacking in top - level experience .
Ryan Nelsen captains a top - half Premiership side , his defensive partner Ivan Vicelic spent seven years in the Dutch Eredivise , and others have had spells at the likes of Celtic , Fulham and West Brom , with varying levels of success .
The World Cup will still be a huge step up , but New Zealand are not as unaccustomed to superior footballers as the last side to be embarrassed at the World Cup – Saudi Arabia in 2002 , where all of their players were playing in the Saudi national league .
Another positive is the fact that they appear to have a solid , settled first team .
They maintain a fairly standard 3 - 4 - 3 system , and the XI that started last week ’s friendly against Australia was the same XI that started the playoff games against Bahrain last year .
Furthermore , there should be a good understanding within the side because of club connections .
Five of the first XI play together at Wellington Phoenix , where they are managed by Ricki Herbert – who doubles up as the national team manager .
Their starting line - up appeared entirely predictable until this week ’s shock 1 - 0 win over World Cup dark horses Serbia , where Herbert was notably keen to praise the performances of some fringe players .
“ It ’s always been about performance for us , but a win like this over a top - class nation like Serbia is a great bonus , ” he said .
” We made four changes and I thought Tommy Smith and Winston Reid , who only have three caps between them , did extremely well at the back alongside Ryan Nelsen . ”
“ Jeremy Christie came into midfield and did well and Chris Wood in his first start against a big team was outstanding . ”
Certainly , the win with these players raises questions about how Herbert will start the first game against Slovakia , but the smart money will be on him reverting to his usual side – so whilst the win against Serbia was more impressive , the recent last - minute defeat to Australia is the more salient game when considering their formation .
The basic shape
Here is the basic shape of their side – a simple 3 - 4 - 3 .
The three centre - backs are marked in red , and generally stay central at all times – Vicelich , the left - sided centre - back , is the only one who occasionally looks to bring the ball forward – the other two look to play the ball to the wing - backs , who are marked in yellow .
They play wide , between the lines of defenders and central midfielders ( marked in pink ) .
The left - wing - back , Tony Lochhead is nominally a left - back , whereas the right - wing - back , Leo Bertos is a winger , so Bertos naturally gets forward slightly more .
The three forwards ( marked in green ) play quite close to each other , with Rory Fallon the central of the three .
They like to play diagonal balls across the pitch – the left - centre - back to the right - wing - back , and then the right - wing - back to the left - sided striker .
And vice - versa .
Meanwhile , Fallon plays a traditional target man role , and one of the outside strikers make sure they are in close attendance .
Split roles for the central midfielders
Although the central midfielders play alongside each other when defending and when the ball is dead , the two have very different jobs when in possession .
Simon Elliott ( in pink ) plays what is effectively a holding role in front of the three centre - backs , looking to receive short passes and dictate play from deep in the midfield …
… whereas Tim Brown ( in pink ) is a much more attacking player , looking to make late forward runs in a Tim Cahill - esque way , and joining up with the three strikers .
Three central strikers
Playing three strikers all over 6 ′ has obvious advantages when it comes to chucking the ball into the box at head height , but New Zealand ’s strikers do little defensively .
One expects the outside forwards in a three - man defence to drop wide and occupy the full - backs when out of possession , but they remain fairly central and leave the wing - backs to man the flanks on their own .
This leaves the opposition full - backs with acres of space ( see the Australia left - back at the bottom of the above picture ) which could cost New Zealand dear against sides possessing attacking full - backs , or against a Paraguay side who could play both wingers and wing - backs .
Chris Killen sometimes drifts back towards his own goal , but this appears to be in order to create a different attacking option rather than to help defend .
Conclusion
New Zealand ’s technical deficiencies are obvious considering the relative weakness of their players , but their formation probably wo n’t help them either .
Although it appears well - structured and all the players understand their jobs fully , keeping three strikers high up the pitch creates problems further back ( see Milan ’s 4 - 0 thrashing at Old Trafford ) , especially considering the Kiwis are likely to spend large parts of the game without the ball .
The midfield will have to get through an awful lot of running .
That said , a goal is not an unrealistic prospect – the strikers are good in the air and the late runs of Brown provide a further goal threat .
Fitness levels will be key , something hard to judge from low - tempo friendlies .
If New Zealand are able to perform for 90 minutes they could provide more problems than opponents expect .
If the midfield tires late on , then they could find themselves on the end of thrashings that the balance of play does n’t completely merit .
But in their first World Cup since 1982 and with no expectations – they may as well go for it , attack in numbers and hope to go out in style .

The G20 is coming !
It ’s easy to catch Summit Fever this June , what with every major news outlet in the country covering what might just be the biggest event of the summer ( if , you know , you do n’t like soccer ) .
Much has been made of the intended discussions , the possible agreements , and the powers of diplomacy .
Much , too , has been made of the security , the financial costs , and the interruptions to daily life in Toronto .
But what about you ?
What does the G20 Summit , coming to the Metro Toronto Convention Centre this June 26 and 27 , mean for you ?
( Other than a lot of time spent reading Torontoist , of course : we ’ll be providing regular G20 coverage leading up to the summit , and live coverage on the weekend of . )
Whether you live in Toronto , work here , walk or drive or cycle or use transit through here , attend school here , are just visiting here , or are just hoping to get out of here , this is Torontoist ’s comprehensive guide for everyone in the city who ’ll be affected by the G20 .
Residents
There ’s no way around it : living downtown on Summit Weekend wo n’t be any fun at all — unless you like limited access to your home , your friends , your family , and all the other amenities of modern living you ’re likely accustomed to in a non-police state .
If you live within the “ Security Perimeter ” ( in black on our map ) , the Integrated Security Unit has probably given you accreditation , much like members of the media might get for an event like this .
That ostensibly makes it easier for you to get through the fence and cops and protesters and the media .
Because pass cards have that power .
Otherwise , Toronto Police and summit organizers insist that residents of the city can go about their daily life .
The Star reported on a June 10 meeting , organized by Councillor Adam Vaughan , at which police suggested that leaving extra time to get places and carrying photo ID will be necessary for those living downtown during the summit .
And if any emergencies should arise for residents , Toronto is apparently ready for the challenge .
“ All plans are in place for extraordinary circumstances , ” Kim McKinnon of Toronto EMS tells Torontoist , indicating that , along with Toronto Fire and Toronto Police , service wo n’t be interrupted for residents , although she would n’t go further into the details of how that ’s possible .
“ Toronto EMS is well known for its ability to manage large events and to do it successfully , ” she added , citing Caribana and the 2002 papal visit as examples .
Non-emergencies , though , are a different story .
The University Health Network ’s website states that treatments will continue throughout the G20 , but some doctor ’s appointments will have to be rescheduled .
The site also helpfully points out that “ it is impossible to predict the impact that the G20 Summit will have on the downtown core . ”
That is : it ’s impossible to predict the impact that the G20 Summit will have on you and your regularly scheduled life .
Some Torontonians are planning to leave town G20 weekend .
That ’s not a bad idea , especially because vacationing can actually be a profitable venture .
For those who live downtown , why not list your home on Craigslist ?
Lots of people are — because if the government ’s gonna spend a billion dollars of your money to pay for this thing , you might as well get a kickback .
Businesses and Employees
If you ’re putting off a casual visit downtown during Summit Week , be thankful you have a choice : people who work downtown do n’t — although many businesses have simply thrown up their hands and decided to close up shop on June 25 , 26 , and 27 .
Even the Art Gallery of Ontario has announced it will lock its doors at 4 p.m. on Friday .
For theatregoers , it ’s even worse : Mirvish Productions is suspending its two King Street West productions during the entire week leading up to the Summit .
And then there ’s the TIFF Cinematheque , which is cancelling or re-scheduling several screenings .
The Blue Jays are also flying the coop for the duration .
All of that and more will have “ a domino effect ” on other businesses in the area , according to Janice Solomon , president of the Entertainment District Business Improvement Area .
While not all businesses downtown will close their doors , Solomon says that smaller retailers — like restaurants — that rely on pre- and post - show or game customers will take a financial hit .
Things are expected to be so chaotic around the secured zones that many corporations are asking their employees to either work from home or take a few vacation days for the duration .
Those who do make the journey downtown to work , be warned : leave an hour earlier than you normally would , and bring lots of photo ID .
You ’ll need it to get through the checkpoints .
And then there are those businesses that have already closed temporarily because of the Summit — involuntarily .
As of June 10 , the City began shooing hot dog vendors in the so - called red zone away from their designated spots .
They ’re not allowed to set up shop elsewhere , which means they ’re essentially on an unpaid vacation for the next two weeks .
“ What can you do ? ” one exasperated vendor told us at John and Front during his last few hours on the job Thursday .
“ You ca n’t beat the city . ”
But while some establishments may feel the pinch , it ’s business as usual ( or better ) for others .
Take Porter Airlines , for instance .
Although airspace around the downtown core is restricted for unscheduled traffic during the Summit , Porter says its flight schedule will not be affected .
Of course , getting off the ground is one thing : getting to and from Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport is another .
Porter ’s decided to suspend its passenger shuttle bus service for Summit Week , because no one knows if , or for how long , ground traffic will be delayed during that week .
There also appears to be a budding entrepreneur class developing .
As delegates and journalists flood into the city , hotel rooms are filling up and accommodation is at a premium .
That ’s tempted some people to rent out their downtown apartments and condos often at remarkably inflated prices .
Speaking of hotel rooms , Tourism Toronto has high hopes for the Summit ’s effect on the city ’s economy .
In a recent release , Tourism Toronto estimated that “ delegates , media and security staff will consume approximately 114,000 total hotel room nights in dozens of hotels across Toronto… .
The summits are expected to generate $ 53 million in direct spending by delegates ( hotels , food and entertainment ) .
That does not include the convention centres , audio / visual companies , transportation companies and all the other businesses that will benefit . ”
As for revenue lost by businesses that close , or face a customer drought , there are no estimates yet available , the organization says .
There ’s also the potential for violence between protesters and police , an eventuality that ’s got business owners even more antsy .
The federal government is refusing to compensate them for damage caused during the Summit .
But Councillor Adam Vaughan — as councillor for Ward 20 , Trinity - Spadina , part of his ward is within the security zones — says the fight is far from over .
The leading mayoral candidates have all pledged to keep pressing Ottawa to pony up some money for shopkeepers , should it be necessary , and Vaughan himself has launched a letter - writing campaign .
Protesters
From the individual with a sandwich board and an axe to grind , to members of well - known , well - organized environmental and social justice groups , thousands of protesters from all over the world will be descending on the city over the next couple of weeks .
If you ’re one of them , here are some tips about what to beware of , how to find a particular demonstration , where to stay , and what to do in case you find yourself on the wrong side of the barricades .
First , let ’s assume you ’re from out of town .
Whether you need a ride to Toronto , a place to stay while you ’re here , or help deciding which demonstrations you ’d like to participate in , the catch - all organization that ’s overseeing the various interest groups and their actions is the Toronto Community Mobilization Network .
The group ’s website lists scores of events in a handy calendar format , from community meetings to full - blown marches , that are taking place across the city .
If you want to start your own demonstration , they can also help you get organized .
So let ’s assume now that you ’ve made it to Toronto , you ’re settled in a billet , and you ’ve decided what event you ’d like to participate in .
Now , you ’ve got to get there .
The designated protest site is Queen ’s Park , the park immediately to the north of the provincial legislature .
It ’s just south of the intersection of Bloor Street and Avenue Road , which makes it easy to get to by public transit , bike , or on foot .
Before you head over , though , the federal government would like to have a word with you .
The Integrated Security Unit is overseen by the RCMP , but it ’s staffed by everyone from local police officers to Canadian Forces soldiers .
Here , you ’ll find some advice the ISU has for protesters .
Now that you ’ve arrived , armed with the rules and regulations set out by the authorities , you ’ll almost certainly be taking part in a peaceful protest .
But there are no guarantees .
Almost no one believes that demonstrators will stick strictly to Queen ’s Park North , and even if they do , clashes between protesters and police are not unheard of , at any demonstration .
At most of the major protests here , though , demonstrators will have a special ally : an organization called the Movement Defence Committee .
It ’s made up of about eighty lawyers who ’ve volunteered to help protesters free of charge .
They ’ll also be acting as observers at many of the major demonstrations .
The lawyers have expertise in immigration law ( to help people who may have trouble getting into Canada ) and criminal law ( for those who find themselves under arrest ) .
The Committee ’s recommending that demonstrators write their “ Arrest Line ” number — 416-273-6761 — somewhere on their bodies .
If trouble does break out during a demo that you ’re participating in , you may be faced with a relatively new weapon in the police arsenal .
Officially , it ’s known as Long Range Acoustic Device .
Unofficially , it ’s called a sound cannon .
It emits a high - pitched soul - piercing burst that ’s supposed to convince you to do what the police are telling you to do ( assuming you were n’t in the first place ) .
Here , too , demonstrators will have an ally on hand : the Council of Canadians will be handing out free earplugs to protesters .
Pedestrians
Walking is likely the best way to get around during G20 weekend , so long as you do n’t walk anywhere near the secured or protest zones .
It ’s probably best not to be anywhere from King to Lake Shore and Spadina to Yonge unless you absolutely have to : that ’s the “ Traffic Zone , ” where even pedestrians will be subject to police checkpoints .
And if you do get past , do n’t even think about getting over that ten - foot fence that ’s protecting the “ Security Zone . ”
While the thousands of delegates , journalists , and visiting police officers might clog the sidewalks on their way towards the action , you should be able to walk free and easy through the streets of the city .
Above ground , anyway .
According to the Integrated Security Unit , the PATH system will be closed from Friday , June 25 to Sunday , June 27 , so you ’ll have to get your fill of fast food and Grand and Toy outlets in the open air that weekend , preferably far outside the downtown core .
Also gone anywhere near the secured zones for the Summit : trash bins and newspaper boxes .
And someone will probably be watching you : OpenFile has a map of new CCTV cameras installed especially for the Summit .
In theory , anything outside the security zone is fair game for pedestrians .
But , like everything G20 , even walking is subject to change .
Cops might ask you to alter your route so as to avoid landing helicopters ( yeah , it happens ) or you might get stuck behind a marching protest .
So even if you ’re just walking your dog , the same advice applies all weekend : leave lots of time , plan your routes carefully , and ask yourself if where you ’re going is absolutely necessary .
Transit Riders
If you absolutely have to make it to an appointment downtown during Summit Week , there are no sure things , but the TTC may well be the Better - than - nothing Way .
TTC Director of Communications Brad Ross says almost all routes will be running as scheduled ; the only exceptions are 6 Bay , 72A Pape , and 320 Yonge buses .
But that does n’t mean it ’ll be all smooth sailing for riders .
For one thing , if you use Union Station , keep in mind that the Front Street doors will be locked ( all other entrances will be open ) .
The real transit problems , though , will happen as a result of roads downtown that have been closed spontaneously — either by police or protesters .
“ There will be some diversions right downtown , ” Ross warns .
“ The real issue is we do anticipate demonstrations and protests , so some of our routes could be delayed … we ’ll be monitoring that situation closely , and communicating with our customers through PA announcements , or e-alerts and through the media .
The general advice is : give yourself extra time , but we really ca n’t say where or when there ’ll be delays . ”
To keep up with those route changes — whether they ’re planned or impromptu—check the TTC ’s website , sign up for e-alerts , or follow @TTCNotices or the crowd - sourced @TTCupdates on Twitter .
Likewise , GO Transit is also planning on running a regular schedule throughout .
And like the TTC , they ’re also warning riders to expect the unexpected .
“ What we ’ve been advising customers is to expect delays because of things we have no control over , such as road closures due to demonstrations , ” says spokesperson Vanessa Thomas .
Cyclists
Starting today , getting from point A to point B in the downtown core may seem a bit like travelling the maze in a kid ’s colouring book — particularly for cyclists .
Your first obstacle will be the “ Traffic Zone . ”
Only some streets will be open , and to get into the zone you ’ll be expected to show photo ID — Constable Hugh Smith of Traffic Services suggests you carry at least two pieces with you — and then …wait .
There will be line - ups as police check pedestrians ’
ID and search some cars before allowing them into the zone .
Once inside , you ’ll find that some streets will be open as usual , some will be closed completely , and others may only be open to sidewalk traffic , so be prepared to walk your bike .
If your trip through the core normally takes an hour , allow for two during the two weeks leading up to the summit , police suggest .
Which streets will and wo n’t be open is still up in the air , but expect to face a convoluted route to your destination , and do n’t be surprised if you find yourself seriously off - course at best , and lost at worst .
In that case , Toronto Bike Messenger Association spokesperson Marli Epp points out there ’s nothing wrong with asking that courier who ’s stopped at a light beside you for help .
“ That ’s a good idea , definitely , ” says Epp : they know their way around the city better than most , and although some folks find them somewhat intimidating , “ there ’s a camaraderie between messengers and average cyclists because of what we all go through on the roads . ”
When you ’ve arrived at your destination , there may be other surprises waiting , according to Councillor Adrian Heaps ( Ward 35 , Scarborough Southwest ) , who chairs the city ’s cycling committee .
If you ’re used to using one of the city ’s bike lockers — at Metro Hall , for instance — you may be out of luck .
The City is still undecided , but the transportation committee is pushing to have them removed for the duration .
One bright spot : cyclists who ’re members of the Union Station bike storage station will not be affected , as those lockers will remain in use .
But getting to them could be a bit of a hassle , since the Front Street entrances to Union will all be closed .
( Cyclists will only have access through south entrances to Union . )
But suppose you do n’t use lockers to park your bike .
Heaps says there ’s been talk of removing about one thousand of the post - and - ring street bike stands — some have already been taken out near the inner security perimeter — although he ’s opposing the idea .
How could a simple bike stand be considered a security threat ?
“ I think it ’s a concern about what could be locked to it , ” says Heaps .
Getting inside the inner “ Security Perimeter ” will be even tougher for cyclists .
Yvonne Bambrick , head of the Toronto Cyclists Union , is warning that you ’ll need a special security pass .
The Bike Messengers Association ’s Epp points out that messengers can get a security pass from Toronto Police Service headquarters on College east of Bay , or you can contact the BMA for more information .
Motorists
If , for whatever reason , you insist on living your life as normal over G20 weekend — and living your life as normal includes driving — just leave a bit ( read : a lot ) more time than usual .
The much - hyped three - metre fence lining the “ Security Perimeter ” around the Toronto Convention Centre wo n’t be passable , especially by car , so if your business takes you there , you ’re out of luck .
Similarly , the so - called “ Traffic Zone ” just outside the Perimeter ( see our handy map ) will involve police checkpoints and , we can only imagine , not a whole lot of movement .
The Integrated Security Unit is vague on specific details , except the following : you wo n’t be able to exit the Gardiner going eastbound at York Street , Bay Street , or Yonge Street on Friday and Saturday , and you wo n’t be able to get on the York Street ramp going westbound on Sunday .
But you probably do n’t want to be on the Gardiner or the 427 anyway .
While it wo n’t be closed outright , the ISU is promising “ intermittent restrictions ” — for Obama ’s motorcade and the like — which will result in “ significant traffic disruption . ”
If you do make it downtown , just hope you wo n’t have to park .
Street parking in the immediate vicinity of the convention centre — between Spadina and Yonge , Lake Shore and Queen — wo n’t be available , and “ heightened enforcement ” will be in effect .
It is the end of the month , after all .
Other than that , you should be okay .
All 400 - series highways ( 427 occasionally excepted ) are open .
Aside from other traffic stoppage due to protests and civil unrest — remember , the official protest zone is Queen ’s Park , assuming no protesting happens anywhere else — the city streets are running as usual .
Just keep in mind this is all subject to change .
So the bottom line ?
The roads will be working best if they ’re leading out of town .
Students
School ’s out for summer…or for the G20 weekend if you go to U of T .
The university is shutting down for the weekend , prohibiting staff and students from its St. George campus from 6 p.m. Wednesday , June 23 to Sunday night , June 27 .
The closure comes in anticipation of protests occurring at Queen ’s Park .
That means no more teachers , no more books — and , oh yeah , no more residence rooms for students living in Innis , New , University , and Woodsworth colleges , who will be temporarily relocated elsewhere .
In fact , U of T is urging all faculty ( and , we assume , all students ) to “ consider these days of closure as if we were experiencing a long winter storm ! ”
Well , it ’ll definitely be a storm of some kind , but winter ’s not the word we ’d use .
Recently re-named OCAD University is following suit and locking down from Thursday to Sunday , presumably because it ’s close to the security zones and because art students are prone to political protest .
Bucking the trend is Ryerson , which will remain completely open and operational during the summit .
George Brown , along with most other colleges in the GTA , will also remain open .
There will , however , be some changes to small things like graduation plans , so make sure you keep checking your email and any school websites important to you .
But if you ’re lucky enough to be out of school , do n’t waste your free time trying to communicate your unformed , liberal - arts - educated ideals through carefully organized protest .
Waste it by throwing a big G20 inspired house party .
We suggest dressing up as your favourite world leader and playing G20 drinking games ( a Pittsburgh radio show came up with one that could be adaptable ) .
With almost ten thousand uniformed police officers surrounding the Convention Centre and secured zones , we doubt there will be any left over to deal with your neighbour ’s noise complaints .
So go ahead .
Have fun .
Just remember : only the real Berlusconi can get away with sexist gaffes and grabby hands .
Those Leaving Town
Travel information is a moot point if you ca n’t even get into or out of the city .
Toronto ’s not totally locked - down , but transportation to and from Toronto certainly wo n’t be business as usual .
Let ’s start with airplanes .
Both Pearson International and Billy Bishop Toronto City airports will be operational , but delays can be expected in both cases .
Porter Airlines , which flies off the island just a short ferry ride away from the hubbub downtown , issued a press release stating its intentions to run a full flight schedule that weekend .
Porter ’s complimentary shuttle bus will not run from Monday , June 21 through Sunday , June 27 due to downtown road closures and traffic delays .
If you get to the Island airport yourself , though , flights are scheduled to depart and arrive as usual .
Except they ca n’t say that for sure : “ Everyone recognizes this is an extraordinary event and new information may cause some plans to be adjusted , ” Porter CEO Robert Deluce said in the statement .
So again , we ’ll just have to wait and see .
Pearson is farther removed from the action , but no less affected .
While travellers can still expect regularly scheduled activity , they can also expect “ an increased police and military presence ” at the airport , according to the Greater Toronto Airport Authority .
As for ground routes in and out of the city , VIA Rail announced it will keep its train schedule — just not from Union Station .
From June 24 to 27 VIA will load and unload Toronto passengers from its suburban stations and breeze through the city without so much as pausing for air .
Passengers will then have to take shuttle buses into the city from Oakville , Oshawa , Brampton , and North Toronto .
And for those travelling to northern Ontario , Ontario Northland train service announced it will be running coach buses to North Bay from June 24 to June 28 instead .
They ’ll leave from the coach terminal at Bay and Dundas , which will be much more accessible than Union Station .
If you ’re planning to drive out of town yourself , our guide ’s section for motorists can steer you in the right direction — far , far away from Toronto .
The Homeless
While residents living inside the “ Security Perimeter ” will be given accreditation to come and go as they need , the same does not hold true for homeless people living in those boundaries : the homeless community will not be allowed within the Perimeter at all during G20 weekend .
The CBC reported that some homeless people have been told they ’ll have to vacate the area as early as June 21 .
Failure to leave voluntarily could mean being removed by police and , possibly , arrested .
With no fixed address , many homeless people will have trouble producing proper identification to police officers .
That means , unlike people who live and work in downtown skyscrapers , they may not be able to reenter the secured zones ( including the “ Traffic Zone ” ) at all during G20 week — not even for access to shelters and other important services .
While the Streets to Homes program is working in overdrive to help members of the homeless community in the area relocate , lots of people are bound to slip through the cracks due to the sheer size of the restricted zones , and the lack of easy communication to the community .
The Integrated Security Unit for the G20 insists these measures are for the good of the community and come as a means of protecting the “ safety and security of our most vulnerable communities , ” perhaps from protesters and riot cops .
OpenFile also reports , in their piece about how the homeless will be affected by the G20 , that the Gateway Shelter will be open extended hours — from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. — to help with the increased demand .
It ’s just one organization trying to accommodate the move , but only time will tell whether this message spreads early and far enough through the downtown community .
Tourists
Stephen Harper insists that the G20 is an opportunity to showcase Toronto to the world , which is why the city is rolling out the Welcome Wagon —er , the Salutation Sound Cannon .
If you ’ve already booked your trip to Toronto and do n’t belong to a governmental delegation or protest group , you might be wondering what to do this weekend .
The answer ?
Go to Montréal .
Several key tourist attractions are closed G20 weekend .
The CN Tower , which bills itself as “ Canada ’s most recognizable and celebrated icon , ” will be closed from June 25 to the 27 due to its proximity to the Convention Centre .
It will reopen on the Monday .
The Art Gallery of Ontario will also be closed , as will the Mirvish productions Mamma Mia and Rock of Ages , both at theatres on King Street Street .
The Globe and Mail reported that the theatres will be dark the entire week of June 21 to June 27 due to security concerns , as well as concerns about ticket holders not being able to get through traffic jams and police blockages to get to the venues .
Even tours will be hard to come by .
Toronto Hippo
Tours is moving its operations from Front Street to the Delta Chelsea Hotel in the weeks leading up to the G20 weekend , but it expects some route alterations in the days immediately before the summit .
“ We ’ll be closing for the actual weekend of the summit , ” said PR Manager Anne Greenwood .
“ There ’s not much we can do . ”
Unpredictable traffic schedules and an inability to navigate such large portions of the downtown core have forced other tour operators to close as well .
Toronto
Tours wo n’t be operating its City or Harbour tours , and a Gray Line operator said the company hopes to be running , but ca n’t speculate yet on details or even whether it ’s possible .
All of that , of course , is contingent on tourists being here that weekend at all .
Sarkozy probably wo n’t be taking in the Textile Museum , but delegates from all over the world are taking up hotel rooms .
The Globe thoroughly canvassed area hotels , none of which have available rooms and only a few of which have non-summit guests .
If you ’re one of the lucky few to have a room , there ’s another unknown variable to throw into the mix : the potential hotel workers strike .
It ’ll likely affect the French delegation at the Novotel most , but the threat of full - scale tourism shutdown looms large .
Of course , it ’s not all bad news .
Andrew Weir , vice president of communications of Tourism Toronto , is enthusiastic about the summit .
“ It ’s a unique opportunity to see a global summit .
It ’ll be a tremendous spectacle , ” he says .
“ We do n’t have a global summit of thirty thousand people every day .
It ’s not lost on us that there will be logistical issues .
But that ’s what comes with hosting a major world event . ”
So , tourists , go out and ogle the protestors and see if you ca n’t catch a glimpse of Obama !
If the summit ’s not your thing , Weir reminds us that Toronto really does have a lot to offer beyond the CN Tower .
“ People will discover new things about Toronto that weekend , especially the scope and breadth of the city , ” he says .
“ With the World Cup , every neighbourhood in the city will be alive and electric and completely remarkable .
People can move about the city and , while some downtown attractions are closing , others , like the ROM with Terracotta Warriors [ opening June 26 ] , are opening massive global exhibitions that weekend . ”
He also said some entertainment district restaurants are planning on extending their hours to accommodate visiting media and delegates .
That means you can talk soccer and listen to jazz ( the festival ’s still on ! ) with the rest of the world well into the night .

Volvo has announced that it is working with Göteborg Energi on electric vehicle development and related recharging infrastructure with Volvo delivering 10 100 % electric C30s by autumn 2010 .
The initial model will be a test bed for future Volvo electric cars and will feature a lithium ion battery system capable of powering the C30 for 150 kms on a single charge with a top speed of 130 kmph .
Volvo states that the recharge time for a fully depleted battery will be ~8 hours and that the 150 km range will be more than enough for 90 % of Europeans daily commute .
The C30 looks a little like the new Honda CR - Z Hybrid and depending on the price point of the eventual electric Volvo they could find themselves competing directly against each other .
The CR - Z will get a leg up on any potential competition though as when it is released in the US this Autumn it ’ll be the only sports car hybrid on the market , all indications are at this stage that it ’ll do very well indeed , especially if we see oil prices continue to climb .
That said , the lure of a 100 % electric car like the eC30 is a very strong draw card for many people , one need only look at the staggering pre-orders for the Nissan Leaf to see that most automotive manufacturers have seriously underestimated the market for pure electric cars .

SYNOPSIS : First of 30 electric cars to begin deliver Fall 2010 .
-
Volvo Cars and energy company Göteborg Energi yesterday signed a letter of intent regarding cooperation in the area of electrical vehicles and recharge infrastructure .
Within the terms of the agreement Volvo provides ten Volvo C30 Electric cars with delivery start during the autumn .
-
“ This is a landmark first step , ” says Lennart Stegland , director of the Volvo Car Corporation ’s Special Vehicles division .
The Volvo C30 Electric project has attracted immense international attention .
Volvo Cars has received visits from many potential overseas customers , but the first confirmed user is Swedish .
-
“ Ten cars will be delivered starting this autumn .
The Volvo C30 Electric is a natural part of our focus on DRIVe products , with the aim of promoting a sustainable society .
We are happy with the cooperation with Göteborg Energi .
What is more , it ’s happening in Volvo ’s home town of Göteborg , ” says Lennart Stegland .
-
The cars in the demo fleet are equipped with advanced measuring instruments .
It is important for Volvo Cars to build up additional know - how about how parameters such as driving habits and charging patterns affect the battery and its lifetime in the electric car .
The Volvo C30 Electric has the same safety , comfort and interior space as the standard Volvo C30 .
The difference is that the C30 Electric is powered solely by electricity – so it has absolutely no exhaust emissions on the road .
-
If the car is recharged using electricity from renewable sources , travel is virtually free from carbon dioxide emissions .
The range is up to 150 km on a single battery charge .
-
“ That ’s way further than 90 percent of commuters in Europe cover on a daily basis .
The car could be used for the average family ’s everyday commuting needs , ” says Lennart Stegland .
-
The Volvo C30 Electric is powered by a lithium - ion battery that is charged from a regular mains power socket .
A completely depleted battery takes about eight hours to recharge .
-
The car has a top speed of about 130 kilometres per hour and accelerates from zero to one hundred in 10.5 seconds .
Volvo Cars ’ electric car project currently encompasses about 250 vehicles .
-
“ However , with more customers we would of course be able to expand our production series , ” says Lennart Stegland .
Electric cars are the future
-
He is convinced that electric cars will gain a major foothold in the market .
“ By 2020 about 5 - 10 percent of cars in Sweden are expected to be electric .
By 2020 - 2025 we believe that electric cars will account for 3 - 10 percent of the market share in the EU countries .
Different markets have different preconditions , ” adds Lennart Stegland .
Göteborg Energi comments the letter of intent signing and the cooperation with Volvo Cars to build its first ten electric cars as follows :
-
“ We believe in the future of the electric car and are extremely proud that we will be the first recipients of electric vehicles from Volvo Cars .
We work to promote a sustainable society in Göteborg so to participate in the development of new infrastructure for safe electric cars and cooperate with Volvo Cars at such an early stage feels absolutely right , ” explains Anders Hedenstedt , President of Göteborg Energi .

This looks like a pretty nice way to start the day …

Several weeks ago , I noticed that one of my friends on Facebook was a “ fan ” of Proposition 16 – PG&E ’s Monopoly Protection
Act that is easily the worst measure on the June ballot .
After I chewed him out for it , he expressed shock to even be on that page .
Apparently , PG&E had added him on as a supporter without his consent .
Today , just as the Prop 16 campaign boasted that it now has 50,000 “ fans ” on Facebook , I received a press release from the Sunrise Center in Marin County – who complained that some of their own staffers ( who are working hard to defeat Prop 16 ) have also been added as “ fans . ”
Besides exposing a serious loophole in Facebook ’s privacy features , it also proves that PG&E’s $ 40 million campaign to pass Prop 16 includes committing identity theft .
Christy Michaels , the Corte Madera - based Sunrise Center office manager , said she was surprised to hear from a friend that an ad showed up on her friend ’s Facebook page claiming , “ Christy Michaels likes Prop 16 . ”
When Christy went online she found she was named as a supporter of PG&E - funded Prop 16 on the Sunrise Center Facebook page and her personal page .
Women ’s Energy Matters ( WEM ) is reporting these incidents to the Secretary of State , Attorney General , California Public Utilities Commission and State Senator Mark Leno , asking for immediate investigations and injunctions against PG&E and Facebook .
WEM , Christy , and Kiki are advocates for Marin Clean Energy , the community - run alternative to PG&E that launched May 7th and provides local residents and businesses twice the renewable energy as PG&E at the same cost .
If Prop 16 passes , local communities would require a two - thirds vote to create a similar “ public option ” to PG&E – which scares the giant utility company because they would have to face competition .
Barbara George , Executive Director of WEM commented , “ The whole point of Facebook is to be in touch with people you know and trust , so for PG&E ’s campaign to misappropriate Facebook identities and friends lists in order to falsely claim that people ‘ like ’ Prop 16 is an intolerable invasion of privacy and subversion of democracy .
The June 8 election on this measure has been tainted by massive false advertising and dirty tricks , and Facebook identity theft is a new low .
PG&E is already spending $ 46 million on TV and print ads promoting Proposition 16 which , if it passes , would make it virtually impossible for communities to follow Marin ’s lead to provide cleaner cheaper power for their residents and businesses . ”
Attorney General Jerry Brown should consider pressing criminal charges against PG&E , who appears to have committed identity theft .
Ironically , Facebook ’s former Chief Privacy Officer — Chris Kelly — is running to replace Brown in next week ’s election .

President Obama will hold a White House gay pride reception on June 22 .
Invitations for the event were mailed last week .
They say : “ The President requests the pleasure of your company at a reception in celebration of LGBT Pride Month to be held at The White House . ”
The reception begins at 5 PM .
Among those invited is openly gay Detroit City Council President Charles Pugh .
“ Who gets an invitation to the White House , ” Pugh said in a video posted Tuesday on Facebook .
“ I 'm just saying , that 's pretty good . ”
“ It 's an honor , really , to represent the people of the City of Detroit who were not bigots , who accepted my candidacy for the qualifications I brought to the table and did not in any way judge or reject me because of who I am , ” he added .
Earlier Obama declared June gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender pride month .
The president used the opportunity to cheer on lawmakers as they considered repeal of “ Do n't Ask , Don't Tell , ” the 1993 law that forbids gay troops from serving openly , and highlight some of the gay rights initiatives advanced by his administration .
Saying that “ our Nation draws its strength from our diversity , ” Obama called upon Americans to “ observe this month by fighting prejudice and discrimination in their own lives and everywhere it exits . ”

* INTRODUCTION
The closing decades of the twentieth century saw the rise of a new kind of " sport " in North America : the " canned hunt . "
Although canned hunts advertise under a variety of names -- most frequently " hunting preserves , " " game ranches , " or " shooting preserves " -- they can be identified by the two traits they all have in common : they charge their clients a fee to kill an animal ; and they violate the generally accepted standards of the hunting community , which are based on the concept of " fair chase .

In some cases animals may be shot in cages or within fenced enclosures ; in others they may be shot over feeding stations ; some of the animals are tame and have little fear of humans , while others may be tied to a stake or drugged before they are shot .
But whatever method is used , the defining characteristic of a canned hunt is that the odds have been artificially manipulated against the animal so heavily that the notion of fair chase is subverted .
Canned hunts are commercial hunts that take place on private land under circumstances that virtually assure the hunter of success .
As the establishment of canned hunts increases , they are attracting more public concern about their ethical , ecological , and biological implications .
After extensive research , The Fund for Animals has concluded that these concerns are well founded , and we have created this report as a reference tool for use by members of the public , nonprofit organizations , legislatures , and government agencies in addressing the grave public policy issues raised by canned hunts .
Section I provides an introduction and overview ; explores the ethical objections to canned hunts based on standards generally accepted by the sport hunting community ; raises questions about the appropriate legal analogy that should be applied to canned hunts ; and discusses the serious animal health and public health issues raised by canned hunts .
Section II catalogs the relevant statutes and regulations of each state with an example of a model ordinance relating to the regulation of canned hunts .
( Note :
This report covers canned hunts for both native and exotic mammals ; canned hunts for birds will be covered in a separate report to be released at a later date . )
Description : The Thrill of the Kill ?
A sweltering summer day forces a large lion under the shade of a drooping tree amidst a bucolic landscape .
She pants from the heat unconcerned at the sight of an approaching man wearing a pristine white shirt and clean , khaki pants .
He stops about 100 feet from the tree and animal .
As the feline lies in the relaxing shade , the man raises a rifle pointed toward the drowsy animal .
An unseen voice directs the lone gunman .
He shoots once and the lion , wounded and disoriented , races from the shade of the tree .
Only her cries of pain can be heard and her flailing limbs seen over the grass .
The voice again directs the man to shoot again after seconds have elapsed as the creature struggles for life .
The second shot finishes the job .
The man nervously approaches the feline and butts her with his gun .
He then gives thumbs - up to the camera , bends down and feels her coat ....
The camera pans out to show a tall , chain - link fence .

Although canned hunts are advertised as rugged , outdoor adventures , in reality they are conducted in an atmosphere of comfort and convenience .
You can fly into a hunting preserve here in the United States , and after a gourmet dinner , you can spend the night in a luxurious hunting lodge .
The next day , you 'll be given a high - powered rifle with a brief orientation to its use and driven to the " shooting area . "
The area is usually a fenced enclosure from which there is no escape , ranging from a few square yards to several hundred acres , depending on how strenuous you want your hunt to be .
The outcome is never really in doubt .
In many cases , the hunting preserve will give a guarantee : " No kill , no pay . "
Whether the area is large or small , the animals are either fenced in -- so that they cannot escape and have no hiding place that is secret from the guide -- or they have been habituated to eating at a feeding station at the same time every day for food .
At many ranches , the same truck that brings dinner to the feeding stations also brings the hunters .
Exotic animals bought from breeders are often accustomed to people feeding them and cleaning their cages , so they have no fear of humans .
They are often surplus zoo animals or retired circus performers who are too habituated to humans or too old and arthritic to run away .
The essentials are always the same regardless of the cost of the trip : an animal who is either fenced in , lured to feeding stations , or habituated to humans , and odds so heavily in the hunter 's favor that there is little risk of leaving without a trophy .
Most canned hunts have taxidermists on site or on call to mount your trophy , whose fate was sealed the moment you made your reservation .
Prohibiting these questionable hunting practices from being captured on tape is a standard practice of game ranches .
" Video cameras [ are ] permitted in lodge area only -- not on hunts , " according to Cumberland Mountain Hunting Lodge2 .
Ohio's Whitetail Trophy & Exotics , Inc. warns , " Unauthorized video is considered criminal .
You must have permission before using video equipment and must follow a strict set of guide lines . "

Obviously , they do n't want the public to get a true picture of canned hunts .
But , undercover footage occasionally leaks out and the images haunt the viewers :
The Corsican ram stopped cold in his tracks , raised his head to sniff the breeze , and tried to peer through the foliage .
The hunter , covered head to toe in camouflage , slowly raised to shoulder level a modern techno - marvel of levers , wheels , and pulleys and released his arrow .
At the twang of the string , the ram jerked his head around -- just as the razor - sharp broadhead sliced into his left flank .
Letting out a bellow of pain and terror , he lunged forward into the wire fence that held him captive .
The hunter , no more than twenty yards away , reloaded and shot .
Another strike in the flank and another bellow as once again the ram hurled himself against the fence .
A third arrow struck him in the side , a fourth high up on the back .
The hunter was deliberately aiming away from the head and shoulders to avoid any risk of spoiling his trophy .
" If you fall , " he yelled at the ram , " fall the right way .
I do n't want you bending my arrow . "
The slowly dying animal huddled against the bottom of the fence .
After six arrows , the guide put the doomed animal out of his agony with a bullet .

Game Ranching : A New Way to Separate City Slickers from Their Money
According to the Safari Club International , an organization dedicated to big game trophy hunting , the first game ranch in the United States was the Y.O. Ranch in Mountain Home , Texas , two hours southwest of San Antonio .
Founded in 1880 as a longhorn cattle ranch , the Y.O. introduced Indian blackbuck antelopes in 1953 .
When the blackbucks thrived , the Y.O. went into the business of exotic hunts , and ranch managers began adding other species of exotic deer including axis , sika , and fallow .
5 Today , the Y.O. advertises " North America 's largest collection of exotic wild animals -- zebras , giraffes , ostriches , sika , oryx , aoudad and eland -- over 50 different species .
The Y.O. is a hunting mecca for photographers , native game hunters and exotic game hunters from everywhere . "
6
By the 1960s , inspired by the success of the Y.O. Ranch , hunting preserves and game ranches had begun to appear first in the Texas hill country and then throughout the nation .
7
But their current burst of popularity dates only from the 1980s as they began filling a new market niche created by the paradox of fewer and fewer hunters spending more and more money on their sport .
From the 1950s through 1975 , the number of hunters in America had held steady at around 10 % of the population age twelve and above .
But starting in 1975 , a decline set in that continues to the present .
According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , in 1996 , the latest year for which statistics are available , only 7 % of Americans sixteen and older hunted .
8
Researchers for the hunting industry have identified several reasons for this decline , including the fact that a majority of Americans now oppose sport hunting .
9
But only two of these factors are important in understanding the growing popularity of canned hunts .
First , since World War II , America has become an urban and suburban nation .
More and more people live in cities and suburbs , while development pushes wildlife habitat farther and farther away from them .
Hunting has become more time consuming and less convenient than other forms of recreation like golf or tennis .
Second , with two - career families now the norm rather than the exception , and household and child - rearing responsibilities typically shared by two working parents , hunting forays have to be fitted into a high - pressure schedule of work , parenting , and household chores .
To further complicate things , in many states -- including some in which hunting has long been popular , such as Texas and Maine -- most land is privately owned and finding a place to hunt can be daunting due the decreased accessibility to land .
Hunting trips now have to be planned , scheduled , organized -- and paid for .
And the operators of game ranches and hunting preserves are well aware of this .
" If you do n't have the 10 days to 2 weeks normally needed to hunt for trophies with someone else , " say the operators of Cedar Ridge Elk Ranch in North Dakota , " and you want ACTION , and you want to ' bring it home , ' then Cedar Ridge Elk Ranch is the place for you .
" 10 The same people whose metropolitan lifestyle is incompatible with traditional hunting typically have significant disposable income to spend on recreation .
And so we see that while the number of hunters is declining , the amount of money they spend is going up -- dramatically .
In 1991 , hunters spent $ 14 billion on their sport , but by 1996 that figure had risen to $ 20.67 billion , an increase of 33 % while the number of hunters was dropping by 17%.11
The recipients of the $ 21 billion spent each year by hunters include the manufacturers , distributors , and retailers of hunting products ranging from firearms and ammunition to archery equipment to outdoor clothing , camping gear , and related accessories .
They also include hunting lodges , guides , game ranches and hunting preserves .
There are three types of game ranches or hunting preserves operating in the United States .
First , there are some that are simply large tracts of privately owned land , hundreds or even thousands of acres , which are not fenced and not stocked .
No feeding stations are maintained and no crops are planted in small patches -- known as " feeding plots " or " food plots " -- for the purpose of attracting game .
The only difference between these " ranches " and hunting on public land is that the hunter has to pay for the privilege .
They are not the subjects of this report .
Second , there are game ranches or hunting preserves that specialize in native species , usually white - tailed deer or elk .
These establishments " manage " the herd to produce a high - proportion of " trophy " animals by techniques adapted from the cattle industry , such as keeping the herd inside a game - proof fence to prevent dilution of the gene pool , providing high - protein food supplements , prohibiting the hunting of young bucks until their antlers reach trophy size , and culling " inferior " animals from the herd .
Some game ranches buy and import stock from breeders , live animal dealers , and other ranches .
For example , Forest of Antlers Outfitters in Minnesota promises " a unique hunting experience , specializing in trophy bucks . . ." 12 while the Triple Three Ranch in Wyoming advertises that they " control the harvest and manage the herd for large trophy heads .
" 13 In a letter to a Fund for Animals investigator posing as a prospective client , Triple Three owner Craig Smith wrote , " We have good trophies all through the season .
Our Mule deer have averaged 24 - inch spread 4x4 and five years old for the last six years .
I really do n't think you can do better as far as mule deer go . . .
Whitetail are increasing in numbers with an 18 - inch spread average .
" 14 Often , the game ranches that breed deer and elk are also raising them for their parts and for the sale of their meat .
Third , there are game ranches and hunting preserves that deal in exotic animals , ranging all the way from African lions to Indian axis deer .
Exotic species are either bred on - site or bought from breeders or dealers , and the hunting of exotics takes place in a fenced enclosure that may range from the size of a large pen to several hundred acres .
This traffic in exotic animals exists because large municipal zoos depend on baby animals to attract paying customers .
When these babies grow up , they must be disposed of to make room for the new crop of babies who will draw new crowds of customers .
Since the public would not tolerate the animals simply being killed by the zoo , they are sold to dealers , who in turn often sell them to research laboratories , roadside petting zoos , and canned hunts .
In this way , the zoos can claim to have no responsibility for their ultimate fate .15 ( Exotic animals bought as " pets " and later discarded also add to the supply for canned hunts . )
This pivotal role of municipal zoos in the inhumane commerce in wildlife , including wildlife destined to end up at canned hunts , has been extensively documented by investigative journalist Alan Green in his groundbreaking expose Animal Underworld .
Green notes that , " On a single day , " while he was doing his research , " AZA zoos were looking to rid themselves of six hundred mammals , nearly four hundred reptiles , thousands of fish , hundreds of birds , and a variety of invertebrates .
" 16 The AZA is the American Zoological Association , the trade association for the larger , more established zoos , including most municipal zoos .
Green characterizes the fate of the baby animals who outgrow their public appeal this way : . . . the expendable two - year olds -- along with the aged , out - of - vogue , and reproductively spent -- become sacrificial lambs that are cast off , resold , and laundered on paper until they become officially ' lost to follow - up . '
Animals that are supposedly part of grand conservation schemes are recast as just more fodder for the dealers , brokers , auction houses , and sanctuaries that exploit them for profit , subject them to abuse , relegate them to unsuitable environments , or even worse , use them to breed new generations of product for their mercenary commerce .
17 Green concludes by asking , " Are zoo animals nothing but crowd - luring props , to be blindly disposed of when they 're no longer useful .... Society castigates those who treat their mutts in such fashion . "
18
Many game ranches and hunting preserves offer both native and exotic species to their customers .
The following is a brief listing of species available at selected canned hunting facilities .
( Many establishments advertise : " Other animals upon request " or " African animals upon request " ) : Addax Antelope Aoudad Axis Barasingha Bison Black Bear Black Hawaiian Ram Blackbuck Antelope Blesbok Bobcat Bongo Antelope Buffalo Corsican Ram Cottontail Rabbit Coyote Eland Elk Fallow Deer Feral Hogs 4 Horn Ram Fox Gazelles Hog Deer Impala Javalina Kudu Moose Mouflon Ram Muntjac Musk Ox Opossum Oryx Pere David Raccoon Red Stag Sika Deer Spanish Goat Texas Dall Watusi White - tailed deer Wild Boar Wildebeest Yak Zebra * The Cost of the Kill
There are no statistics available on how much money hunters are spending on canned hunts .
But a look at some of their advertisements suggests that they account for a significant portion of the 33 % increase in hunters ' expenditures between 1991 and 1996 .
For example , The 777 Ranch near San Antonio bills itself as " Africa in Texas . "
The Jim Carrey movie " Ace Ventura -- When Nature Calls " was filmed at the 777 Ranch .
Prices range from $ 1,500 to kill a " trophy class " Indian blackbuck antelope to $ 12,500 for a " record class " markhor , a Middle Eastern member of the goat family .
19
This ranch 's prices are typical of what the market seems to bear .
Glen Savage Ranch in Pennsylvania charges $ 5,995 for a white - tailed deer rated between 140 and 154 on the scoring scale of the Boone and Crockett Club ( B&C ) -- an organization that maintains a kind of " Guiness Book of World Records " for big game -- and $ 9,995 for a buck rated between 170 and 184 .
For bucks with higher B&C scores , Glen Savage discreetly suggests that the prospective customer " call for pricing .
"
20
As with most ranches and preserves , prices include lodging , meals , and field dressing the trophy animal .
Hunters are willing to pay these prices for a populous native species because white - tailed deer are so heavily hunted that few outside of hunting preserves live long enough to grow trophy racks .
Except when they are " culling " the herd , the operators of canned hunts do not permit their clients to kill bucks until they have grown a trophy rack .
Concerned that the industry 's emphasis on the upscale market might prove intimidating to less affluent hunters , Broken Arrow Ranch in Texas invites prospective clients to " Come to where the ' WORKING MAN ' can afford to hunt ! "
Broken Arrow , which specializes in exotic deer , offers customers the chance to " kill a TROPHY deer ... and a Fallow doe , stay in our modest but comfortable bunk house , receive continental breakfast for the low price of $ 1350 . "
For the more moderate , they promise " other affordable hunting packages that will fit your needs .
" 21
Since game ranching is a new and very loosely regulated industry , there are no dependable statistics on how many game ranches and hunting preserves are now in operation .
In a telephone conversation , a staff member of the Exotic Wildlife Association , the principal trade group for game ranches and hunting preserves , told a Fund for Animals investigator that the association has between 800 and 1,000 active members , of which more than 500 are in Texas , while several hundred other game ranches " work with us " on a less formal basis .
He declined to speculate on the amount of money taken in annually by game ranches and hunting preserves .
22 There 's a Reason They Call Them " Ranches " To prospective clients , the operators of game ranches and hunting preserves claim that they are in the hunting business .
But when they talk to each other and to the government agencies that regulate hunting , they tell a different story .
Then they claim that their real business is ranching , and that they are simply adapting tried and true cattle raising techniques to an alternative form of livestock .
It is no coincidence that Texas , America 's premier cattle ranching state , was home to the first game ranch -- which was created on a cattle ranch -- and presently hosts more than 500 game ranches .
Canned hunt operators want to be ranchers when they 're raising animals , but hunters when they 're killing them .
Their point is that state game agencies should not be able to regulate game ranches and hunting preserves because their animals are domestic livestock , and state agriculture departments should not be able to regulate them because agriculture agencies have no authority to regulate hunting .
Forced to choose , however , most game ranchers and hunting preserve operators would rather be regulated by state agriculture departments , which are , on the whole , more sympathetic to canned hunts than state wildlife agencies .
This strategy was first brought to public attention by Alan Green , who reports that , " In one state after another , the game farmers have pressed legislators to reclassify a growing list of animals as agricultural products , much like apples , alfalfa , and other cash crops -- a change that allows them to raise , sell , and slaughter exotics without the hassle of fish - and - game department inspections or other government intrusions .
"
23
Many state wildlife agencies oppose canned hunts for three primary reasons .
First , since no hunting license is required to hunt exotic animals on private land , game ranches and hunting preserves -- or at least those that specialize in exotics -- potentially threaten a critical source of revenue for the agencies .
Secondly , and more importantly , most state wildlife agency personnel have been educated in and are personally committed to the philosophy of " fair chase hunting . "
Although dedicated supporters of sport hunting , they generally believe canned hunts are unethical and should not be allowed .
All too often , however , they are reluctant to voice their views publicly for fear that opposing any kind of " hunting " will be viewed as giving aid and support to the opponents of all hunting .
Third , the agencies are concerned about disease transmission ( as explained in " The Risk of Disease " section ) .
State agriculture departments , on the other hand , tend not to judge canned hunts in terms of a long tradition and an ethical code .
They often view game ranches and hunting preserves as a way to help farmers and ranchers increase the profitability of their businesses .
From their point of view , allowing the hunter to " only occasionally succeed , " while the animals " generally avoid being taken " would be an inefficient way to try to turn a profit .
After all , do the butchers in slaughterhouses " only occasionally succeed . "
In chicken processing plants , do broiler chickens " generally avoid being taken . "
Canned hunt operators and many state agriculture departments treat hunting as an alternative form of animal slaughter , and hunting enclosures as outdoor slaughterhouses .
But thus far , due to their newness and their pretense at being " hunts " rather than slaughter , game ranches and hunting preserves have generally avoided the kind of regulation to which traditional livestock producers and slaughterhouses -- at least in theory -- are subject , such as health inspections .
But most importantly , these outdoor slaughterhouses should be subject to the federal Humane Slaughter Act , which requires that an animal be rendered immediately unconscious and not allowed to suffer in the process of being slaughtered .
But hunting , even under the conditions of a canned hunt , inevitably entails a significant wounding rate in which the animal suffers for a period of minutes or hours before being found and -- in the euphemism of the hunting community -- " dispatched . "
In bow hunting -- which is popular on game ranches and hunting preserves because it heightens the illusion of an authentic hunt by a skilled outdoorsman -- the typical cause of death is exsanguination .
The animal almost never dies immediately , and up to 50 % of animals who are struck by an arrow in free - range hunting are wounded and never retrieved .
24 This is clearly inconsistent with the federal standards established in the Humane Slaughter Act , and with similar standards enacted by many states .
There is no way that slaughtering an animal under conditions that simulate hunting could comply with currently existing statutory requirements for the slaughter of livestock .
And livestock is precisely what these animals have been turned into .
Ethical Objections from Both Ends of the Spectrum : Unfair Chase
Hunting is a sport whose object is to kill sentient beings for pleasure , and that can never be ethical .
It is a sport in which only the aggressor participates willingly ; the victim has no choice in the matter .
And it is a sport in which the stakes are dreadfully uneven ; if the animal loses , he dies ; if the hunter loses , he goes home empty - handed and life goes on as before .
That being said , we all recognize that among ethically objectionable acts , some are more heinous than others .
Due to their egregious cruelty and blatant violation of the hunting community 's " fair chase " standard , canned hunts inspire a higher level of outrage than more traditional forms of hunting , even to the extent that many staunch defenders of sport hunting are vocal opponents of canned hunts .
Hunting advocates defend the ethics of their sport by invoking the concept of " fair chase . "
Even the pro-trophy hunting Safari Club International has a code of ethics in which the hunter pledges " to comply with all game laws in the spirit of fair chase , and to influence my companions accordingly .
"
25
" Fair chase " is left undefined .
In an affidavit for hunters who wish to have a trophy buck recorded in its record books , the Boone and Crockett Club defines fair chase as " the ethical , sportsmanlike , and lawful pursuit and taking of any free - ranging , wild , native North American big game animal in a manner that does not give the hunter an improper advantage over such game animals . "
26 This statement leaves several key terms , including " ethical , " " sportsmanlike , " and " improper advantage " undefined , although B&C does give examples of practices that violate fair chase , such as shooting an animal who is helpless when mired in deep snow or swimming in the water .
Jim Posewitz spent 32 years as a biologist with the Montana Department of Fish , Wildlife , and Parks .
As founder and president of Orion : The Hunter 's Institute , he is one of sport hunting 's most passionate defenders , much in demand as a speaker by hunting organizations and wildlife agencies across the country .
In his book , Beyond Fair Chase , which is widely viewed within the hunting community as the " bible " of hunting , Posewitz discusses fair chase in these terms : " Fundamental to ethical hunting is the idea of fair chase .
This concept addresses the balance between the hunter and the hunted .
It is a balance that allows hunters to occasionally succeed while animals generally avoid being taken .
" 27 One page later , he notes that , " The concept of fair chase is important to hunting .
The general public will not tolerate hunting under any other circumstances .
" 28 Posewitz 's organization , Orion , defines hunting as " the fair chase pursuit of free - roaming wildlife in a noncompetitive situation in which the animal is used for food .
"
29
Orion 's definition of ethical hunting includes four elements : 1 ) fair chase ; 2 ) free - roaming wildlife ; 3 ) non-competitive ; and 4 ) used for food .
The first two elements are shared with the definition used by B&C .
Since B&C exists to promote trophy hunting , their definition of fair chase does not include " a noncompetitive situation " or consuming the animal .
Fair chase is the fundamental standard put forward by defenders of hunting .
All other defenses of hunting for sport depend on and derive from the notion of fair chase .
But , hunting on game ranches and preserves is killing for fun and bragging rights under circumstances in which the traditional defenses of hunting become meaningless .
And as we have already seen , they make a mockery of the alleged ethical codes of the hunting community .
Therefore , is hunting on game ranches and hunting preserves really hunting at all , or is it something else entirely -- something quite different that is masquerading as hunting ?
Outdoor writer Ted Kerasote , whose popular book , Blood Ties : Nature , Culture and the Hunt , is an impassioned defense of hunting , including trophy hunting , has no doubt about the answer to this question : " Wildlife is not livestock .
The problem comes when people are supposedly hunting these animals .
That 's the problem right there . "
According to Kerasote , canned hunts are turning hunting " into this caged , paid affair and it bears no resemblance to what hunting is , was , and could be .
Like so many things in our world , people want to buy the product ( the trophy ) rather than experience the process ( meeting the animal on its own terrain ) .
"
30
Orion 's definition of " ethical " hunting and Kerasote 's comments provide an excellent standard for identifying canned hunts and making judgments about them by comparison to traditional hunting .
And these judgments will not be made according to the standards of the animal protection community , but according to the standards of the hunting community .
In fact , concluded from both Orion and B&C 's definitions , any managed situation which is manipulated to significantly reduce the animal 's chance to survive is a canned hunt which fails to meet the hunting community 's own standard for hunting .
No Kill , No Pay
A hunting preserve or game ranch at which the hunter occasionally succeeds while the animal usually escapes is at a strong competitive disadvantage in today 's market .
And the canned hunt operators are closely attuned to the economics of their business .
They also know that a busy professional or business person or first - time hunter who plunks down several thousand dollars for a day of hunting does not expect to go home empty - handed .
And their advertisements go out of their way to reassure prospective clients .
" We specialize in 100 % Success Rate on all Whitetail rifle hunts , " brags the Oak Creek Whitetail Ranch in Missouri .31
By Jim Posewitz 's standard , a rifle hunt at Whitetail does not even have a nodding acquaintance with fair chase , regardless of what other conditions it may be conducted under .
In one fashion or another the operators have manipulated the odds so that the hunter always succeeds and an animal always dies .
Pennsylvania 's Tioga Boar Hunting Preserve tells prospective customers that hunts never require " more than two days ; all hunts are guaranteed . "
Nor do hunters have to be accomplished shooters since " kills are usually made from 25 to 100 yards , " which is point blank range for a modern hunting rifle .
32
And in case the prospective client is " gun shy " of vaguely worded guarantees , the European Wild Boar Hunt , a hunting preserve in Idaho , spells it out : " You are guaranteed a pig , or your money will be refunded . "
33
Do n't Fence Me In
Most people assume that the animal 's physical inability to escape when approached by the hunter is what makes hunting inside a fenced enclosure incompatible with fair chase .
From this , they conclude that if the enclosure is large enough -- say several hundred acres -- the animals within it are , for all practical purposes , " free roaming , " and the fairness of the chase is preserved .
While it is true that shooting an animal within a corral or a fenced lot is a particularly heinous form of canned hunt , the animal 's physical inability to escape is only one aspect of the unfairness of hunting within a fenced enclosure .
A large fenced enclosure -- up to hundreds or even thousands of acres -- on a managed game ranch can tilt the advantage to the hunter so dramatically that the animals within cannot be considered free - roaming .
Every hunter knows that in most states most years , nearly half the deer killed during hunting season are killed on the first day .
Partly this is because there are more hunters out that day , but mostly it is because the deer are caught by surprise .
As soon as the sound of rifles begins to reverberate through the woods , the deer change their feeding , drinking , and sleeping habits .
If they are able , they leave the area where they are being hunted .
In more built up areas , they go onto private land , and -- when they realize there are no hunters -- stay there .
In wilderness areas , they go into deep woods and bed down under cover during the day , only coming out at night to eat .
The point is that on a fenced hunting preserve -- no matter how large the enclosure -- the animals are not able to change their behavior patterns in any way that will thwart the hunter .
Game ranches and hunting preserves employ " guides " whose full time jobs are : to be intimately familiar with the entire landscape of the preserves ; to know where the animals are on the preserves at all times ; to know where and when they like to eat , drink , and bed down ; and to know all their hiding places .
Unable to escape from the guide 's backyard , so to speak , the animals are as much " sitting ducks " in a 500 - acre enclosure as in a five - acre pasture .
A canned hunt will take a little more time and effort on 500 acres than a five - acre pasture , but the hunter 's chances of killing an animal are about the same either way .
All that the larger area accomplishes is to give hunters the illusion that they are actually hunting an animal when in reality they are simply slaughtering with a bow or a rifle .
If this were not so , hunting preserves would not be advertising " no kill , no pay . "
In their public statements , operators of game ranches and hunting preserves often claim that a facility is a canned hunt only if the animal is shot at point - blank range in a cage or fenced pasture .
In an interview which aired in March 2000 , for example , Ike Sugg , who was then - director of the Exotic Wildlife Association , told Dateline NBC that any enclosure of more than a few acres can provide a fair chase hunt if there is dense cover which makes the animal hard to find .
34
This may sound fair to people who are unfamiliar with hunting , but it ignores the role of the guide and the fact that once flushed a fenced animal has no escape route .
Kerasote , also a columnist for Sports Afield magazine , makes much the same point , although he expresses it a bit more obliquely , when he says , " I would say that for hunting to take place there has to be a simulacrum for some original condition .
Whether that 's 20 or 50 or 100 acres is irrelevant .
I think one can have a legitimate hunting experience on 20 unfenced acres in upstate New York as long as there is no enclosure or barrier to turn the animal back .
"
35
Canned hunt operators know that their clients understand that the fence and the guide are what ensure the kill while the size of the enclosure determines the realism of the illusion that actual hunting is taking place .
And so they advertise both the presence of the fence and the size of the enclosure .
Cedar 's Edge Game Ranch in Michigan offers " white tail and fallow deer , Russian boar , various types of sheep and upon request elk , buffalo and red deer " and has " 90 acres in our enclosure with plans to fence the remaining 320 acres .
" 36 Davenport Game Preserve in New York boasts " an intensely managed 250 - acre enclosure which harbors many record - class trophy Whitetail and Sika deer , " 37 while Michigan 's WilMar Ranch has " over 100 acres enclosed for your enjoyment .
"
38
" Game - proof " fencing of the type used by game ranches and hunting preserves can also have a serious detrimental impact on the entire ecosystem in which the fenced enclosure exists .
According to a draft report prepared by a working group of the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission , Specific problems caused by hunting within high - fence enclosures ... include : ( 1 ) substantial increase in risk of disease to native free - ranging wildlife [ See " The Risk of Disease " section ] ; ( 2 ) disruption and displacement of wildlife within their natural home range , animal densities that exceed natural biological carrying capacities , risk of escape by non-native wildlife resulting in undesirable wildlife populations established in the wild , hybridization and even threatened elimination of some native species ; complications that inhibit effective enforcement of statewide hunting egulations ... 39
Animals such as deer and bears who are displaced from portions of their native home range by fenced enclosures typically seek to replace the lost territory by extending their range or searching for a new home range altogether .
This can lead to unfenced lands being stressed beyond their carrying capacity and to an increase in human - animal interactions , as displaced deer , for example , wander into suburbs looking for browse .
The ultimate cause of most unwanted human - animal contact is residential development encroaching upon natural habitat .
Game - proof fencing constitutes a similar encroachment and can be expected to have a similar effect , with the sole difference that the unwanted contact will not occur where the encroachment exists , but in nearby residential areas and on nearby roads and highways .
The Primrose Path
There are other , more subtle ways than a fence to restrict the " free- roaming " nature of animals and thus remove the element of " fair chase " from the hunt , assuring the hunter of a kill .
One is the use of " funnels . "
A funnel is a narrow area bordered by natural or man-made barriers along which an animal must move to get to a destination , such as a food source .
A trail leading from deep woods to a cornfield with a steep embankment along one side and a creek on the other would be a natural funnel .
A creek on one side of the trail and a fence on the other would be a man -made funnel .
By setting up a tree stand overlooking the trail , a guide who knows the habits of the deer living on the preserve can give his client a guaranteed shot at close range .
To assure that potential customers have no fears of coming home empty - handed , deer hunts at Blackhawk Farms in Louisiana " are fully guided and tree stands , blinds , and rifle stands are the norm .
These stands are strategically located over funnel areas , food plots , and cut-overs and are chosen based upon deer movement patterns and wind conditions .
" 40 A cut - over is an area in which the mature trees have been cut down so that young saplings , whose leaves deer like to browse , grow up in their place .
By manipulating the environment , both natural and man-made , the hunt operators can then ensure a kill for their clients .
The Condemned Animal Ate a Hearty Meal
Often used in conjunction with funnels are food plots and feeding stations .
Food plots , as we noted above , are small patches of land planted in a crop , such as corn , that the targeted species enjoys .
Usually no bigger than a large garden , they are typically bordered by a grassy strip that leaves the animals exposed while they eat .
Surrounded by woods or scattered trees that give the hunter cover , food plots turn the animals they attract into standing targets at close range .
Most game ranches that use food plots plant several at a distance from one another so they can switch off randomly from one to another .
Animals would soon begin to avoid a food plot that was " overhunted . "
To further increase the deadliness of food plots , some operators erect permanent ground level blinds or elevated shooting stands overlooking them .
For example , RockBridge Lodge in Alabama assures clients that , " You may hunt over white oak acorns , green fields , persimmon trees , corn food plots on trails to and from bedding areas , and rest assured you will get the opportunity to launch an arrow ...
RockBridge deer are fed and managed year round .
Specialty crops are planted to attract and hold the game . " 41 Shot at close range by hunters hidden from view , the animals have no chance .
Essentially a refinement of food plots , feeding stations are troughs in which a guide places food at the same time every day for days or weeks before taking a client to hunt over it .
In this way the guide knows precisely when animals will appear at the station to eat , and the hunter does n't have to waste time waiting for a target to show up .
In a hi-tech variation , some feeding stations use automatic dispensers with electronic timers .
As with food plots , feeding stations are often used in conjunction with blinds or shooting stands .
Harry 's Lodge in Maine takes no chances on prospective clients worrying that they may not get a point blank shot since , " At Harry 's Lodge we run our bear hunts from tree stands over baits .
Because of an average of less than 20 yards from tree to bait , we are set - up especially well for all types of weapons , whether you use a gun , bow , or pistol . " 42 The significance of " free- roaming " for the standards of hunting is that the animal has a greater opportunity to elude the hunter and the hunter has a more difficult time in locating the animal and getting in range .
It is a critical factor in the " balance " that Jim Posewitz of Orion talked about .
Animals lured to food plots , feeding stations and bait piles are as hard to find and easy to shoot as animals in a pen .
Like everything else in canned hunts , the notion that an animal shot over a food plot , a feeding station , or a bait pile is free - roaming is an illusion .
The appearance is there , but the truth is just the opposite .
The Risk of Disease
It is well accepted that when animals become concentrated in numbers the likelihood of disease transmission increases .
Whether the concentration is caused by natural factors , influenced by artificial elements , or is the product of captivity , diseases and the intra- and inter-specific transmission of disease can flourish under such circumstances .
Animals , whether wild or captive , have different susceptibilities to disease .
The susceptibility of individual animals to one or more diseases is a function of , among other things , environment , stress , genetics , nutrition , and age .
If an animal 's immune system is compromised as a result of the stress of captivity , poor or inadequate nutrition , youthfulness or old age , the animal has a greater chance of being affected by disease .
Animals concentrated in a captive environment like a shooting preserve or game farm are more susceptible to a variety of diseases than are animals who live under more natural , wild conditions .
That is not to say that wild animals are disease - free as there are an abundance of diseases that afflict many wild and free - roaming species .
Furthermore , admittedly , animals in captivity who are , or can be , handled can be more easily treated for disease than animals in the wild .
It is doubtful , however , that those involved in the shooting preserve business provide any level of veterinary care to their captive targets .
Since the killing of these animals is guaranteed , spending money on veterinary care is not cost - effective and would adversely affect profits .
Since most of those who partake in canned hunts do so for a trophy to mount on a wall , as long as a disease does not affect the appearance of an animal , there would be no incentive to address the problem .
As canned hunts have proliferated in many states , concerns about disease have increased .
Diseases such as tuberculosis , brucellosis , and chronic wasting disease ( which is similar to bovine spongiform encephalopathy or " Mad Cow Disease " ) have been diagnosed in wild and captive wildlife .
43
While some are concerned about the health of individual animals held captive , more are concerned about the potential impact of disease on wild , free - roaming animals .
The reality is that despite legal standards requiring fencing of shooting preserves for big game and exotic wildlife , captive wildlife can escape ( as a result of human error ) and , if diseased , can become a vector for disease transmission to wild animals .
For example , Montana game ranches were faced with the occurrence of tuberculosis in 1991 when an elk on a game ranch tested positive for the disease ( 27other elk showed signs of exposure ) .
Wildlife officials worried the disease could infect the neighboring Yellowstone free - roaming herd of elk.44
In addition , the interstate transport of animals for breeding purposes adds to the increased possibility of spreading such diseases .
Michigan has been battling an outbreak of tuberculosis in deer for the past few years due to the preponderance of baiting statewide .
Scott Everett , legislative counsel of the Michigan Farm Bureau , claims " deer baiting and feeding promotes the congregation of animals in a small location .
That allows for the aerosol transmission of bovine TB ... TB is a disease created by certain conditions : stress , crowding and overpopulation .
Baiting and feeding create these conditions . "
45
As baiting and feeding are common practices on canned hunts , the possibility of the spread of disease such as tuberculosis increases .
Though disease is a natural element in nature and though some diseases may have more serious consequences than others , the introduction of a disease into a wild population as a result of the escape of an animal from a fenced shooting gallery poses an unacceptable risk to our free - roaming wildlife .
In some cases the disease introduced to a wild population from an escaped captive exotic animal may be an unknown organism for which our native wildlife have no natural immunity .
The consequences of such a disease outbreak could be substantial .
For example , V. Geist , speaking at the 54th North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference , stated that , " Asiatic sheep and goats on western ranches for ' trophy hunting ' is a time bomb that will destroy bighorn sheep .
" 46 Furthermore , the escape of captive wildlife -- exotic or native -- also poses a threat to the genetic health and purity of our wild , native populations .
CONCLUSION
In August 1995 , The Fund for Animals ' national director , Heidi Prescott , was invited to speak at the Fourth Annual Governor 's Symposium on North America 's Hunting Heritage in Green Bay , Wisconsin .
It may seem implausible to have an animal protection advocate speaking to a conference of the hunting community 's leaders ; Prescott 's speech , however , entitled " How Hunters Make My Job Easy , " challenged hunters to clean up their own ranks and speak out against egregious practices such as canned hunts .
She asked :
What do people who may not have strong feelings about hunting either way . . . think of outdoor ethics when a story runs in their local newspaper about someone paying thousands of dollars to kill a tame lion or sheep on a fenced - in ranch ? . . .
Do you think that the average person who looks at this practice thinks that hunting is a spiritual outdoor experience , and that hunters respect the wild and are the great wildlife managers and conservationists they claim to be ?
I can tell you what they think , because they call The Fund for Animals ' office to express their horror , their sorrow , and ask what they can do to help .
47
The Fund for Animals is committed to working with hunters and state wildlife agency officials -- people with whom we may never agree on many issues -- to find areas where we have common ground and common interests .
We believe that the issue of canned hunts is one of those areas .
To animal protection advocates , a canned hunt is the cruel and inhumane killing of an animal simply for a trophy .
To hunters , a canned hunt is a violation of fair chase and a blight on the image of their sport .
To biologists , a canned hunt is a " time bomb " of potential disease for native wildlife populations .
All in all , it would be difficult to find anyone who would be willing to defend canned hunts .
Except , perhaps , the operators who profit by breeding or trading in animals who are marked as guaranteed trophies , and the hunters who lack the skill or the inclination to hunt in the wild .

FIGHTING FRAUD : The BNZ 's Michael Turner who created the bank 's new LEN technology aimed at stopping the skimming of credit cards .
A ' flu jab ' for credit cards which protects them against skimming attacks has been patented world - wide by the Bank of New Zealand .
The bank announced today the results of a two - year trial of its world - first liquid encryption technology ( LEN ) which has reduced credit card fraud by 50 per cent for the bank ’s 450,000 credit card holders .
LEN works by re-setting the information held on the card ’s magnetic strip every time the card is used at a BNZ automatic teller machine ( ATM ) .
The technology has been in development at the bank since 2006 , with the first trial to about 2000 customers beginning in February 2008 .
Skimming is the process of accessing then cloning credit card information , most commonly through ATMs .
Often the information is held for six months to a year before it is used to access the card holder ’s funds , BNZ security and fraud national manager Owen Loeffellechner said .
" Because LEN changes the card ’s information each time it is used at an ATM it makes the skimmed information out of date and unable to be used to commit fraud . "
Loeffellechner said the technology was a game - changer in terms of combating fraud as it shifted the emphasis from detection to prevention , and allowed the customer to actively protect themselves from fraud .
BNZ chief information officer Peter Yarrington said the bank had been pleasantly surprised by the level of success of the system since it was expanded to cover all 450,000 credit and flexi - debit card holders .
New Zealand statistics for credit card fraud are not available due to variations in bank reporting processes , Yarrington said , but in Australia each year $ 200 million is stolen through " payments fraud " with credit card fraud accounting for 75 per cent of these transactions .
While New Zealand ’s credit card fraud rate is considered to be lower , adding another layer of protection will help to drive these sophisticated fraud rings offshore , Yarrington said .
The bank would not confirm its own credit card fraud rates , citing commercial sensitivity .
BNZ has patented the technology and other banks had expressed a “ level of interest ” in acquiring the technology .
The bank is also looking at applying the technology to EFTPOS systems , Yarrington said .

Animal experimenters in the US , beware : you may find yourselves facing criminal charges for simply doing your job .
That ’s what has happened to nine staff at the University of Wisconsin - Madison , who could go to jail or pay heavy fines for carrying out decompression experiments on sheep for the US navy .
Some sheep died in the experiments , which aimed to find new ways to save divers from decompression sickness , otherwise known as “ the bends ” .
Antivivisectionists at the Alliance for Animals in Madison and at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals discovered that Wisconsin has a law banning the killing of animals through decompression .
The AFA and PETA filed charges , and on 2 June circuit judge Amy Smith backed the animal - rights groups ’ claim .
She concluded that the researchers “ intentionally or negligently violated Wisconsin law ” , and so should face criminal charges .
Smith dismissed the university ’s defence that the research project was exempt from the law .
The case is the first in which animal researchers have faced criminal charges in the US since 1981 .
“ If animal rights groups continue to pursue the use of laws in ways they were not originally intended , I ’m concerned that universities may be forced to expend additional resources to counteract these unwarranted legal attacks , ” says Frankie Trull , president of the Foundation for Biomedical Research in Washington DC , which defends animal experiments .
“ I recommend institutions doing biomedical research educate their in - house counsels about these animal rights strategies and be prepared . ”
( Comments posted on the video page indicate that this procedure works for many of the Panasonic digital cameras–happy cleaning ! )
My Panasonic FX37 is a great camera .
Fast , wide - angle lens , ( f/2.8 , 25 mm equivalent ) in a compact package with all the modern features ( image stabilization , HD video , facial recognition , etc ) .
And it takes really nice photos .
However there is one downside : its sensor seems to attract dust , which is especially noticeable when zooming in on a bright object ( such as the sky ) .
I ’m not sure if this is a matter of the case being poorly sealed compared to other pocket cameras , but it is frustrating .
Thankfully , the remedy is fast and simple : by removing a few small screws , you are able to access the sensor inside the camera .
A few bursts of air and a quick reassembly is all it takes to be snapping photos like the camera is brand new .
I made a quick video tutorial of how to access and clean the sensor– the entire process takes less than 10 minutes .
Make things smoother on yourself by getting the tools together before starting the process .
You do n’t want to leave the case open any longer than necessary .
Here ’s what you ’ll need : Mini screwdrivers •
Blower or compressed air • Lint - free cloth • Receptacles for screws and parts • Clean workspace .
Be careful disassembling your camera .
This will almost surely void your warranty ( a warranty that probably can be used to have the company clean the sensor for you ) , so be certain that you are willing to risk breaking your camera forever .
I take no responsibility for any damage incurred following these instructions .
Now , go clean that sensor !

Amid reports that S -300 missiles were banned by the Security Council sanctions imposed on Teheran last week , Iranian national security official Esmail Kowsari said Saturday that Russia must " abide by agreements " and deliver the missiles .
On Friday , the Kremlin announced the latest round of sanctions prevented Moscow from delivering the powerful air - defense missile system to Iran - a deal which has been on hiatus for three years .
The Mehr news agency quoted Kowsari as saying that Russia was " bound by an agreement to provide Iran with the advanced defense system .
"
He reportedly warned that if Moscow failed to deliver , Teheran would be " well capable of producing missile defense systems that are very much similar to Russia 's S - 300 apparatus .
" Following the Kremlin 's announcement , White House spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters in Washington that the US appreciates " Russia 's restraint in the transfer of the S - 300 missile system .
" The UN resolution does not specifically prohibit Russia from supplying the S - 300 , Crowley said .
" However , for the first time , the resolution calls for states to exercise vigilance and restraint in the sale or transfer of all other arms and related material .
" On Sunday , Iran announced its parliament was working on a " top priority bill " which would limit the country 's ties with the IAEA .
According to IRNA , the move came as a response to the new sanctions imposed on the Islamic republic .
BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel roundly rebuffed U.S. President Barack Obama 's call for Germans to aid the global recovery by spending more and relying less on exports , even as she warned that Europe 's own financial crisis is far from over .

She called on the Group of 20 industrial and developing nations meeting ...
There is a poster that depicts a huge polar bear lying prone on a flue of ice .
The caption under it reads , " When I get the feeling to do something , I lie down until the feeling goes away " .
Such is the sigh of the resigned procrastinator : broken by frustration , unable to catch up , chained by depression and sustained by the simple apathetic response , " I do n't care anymore " .
Yet most people who procrastinate have not contentedly handed in their resignations .
In fact , we struggle incessantly to shake off procrastination .
We plan and schedule ; we write down and underscore ; we promise and make resolutions ; we organize and reorganize .
Generally , we accomplish a short lived refreshment from procrastination , and then crash soundly back into it .
The reason ?
The problem of procrastination is one that often goes beyond self - discipline and whipping oneself from stasis to stress .
It is usually the symptom of a multifaceted set of problems that defy a single solution .
Procrastination :
Why does it seem so strong ?
An ancient proverb states : " It is not the size of the tree but the depth of its roots that make it strong . "
Procrastination usually has very deep roots .
(1) Disorganization
Procrastination and disorganization are integrally linked .
Yet it is errant to assume that all disorganization is the same .
In fact , procrastination - oriented disorganization occurs in four primary areas .
( a) A poor distinction between urgency and priority .
In the beginning of the urgency - priority cycle , procrastinators tend to attend to " comfort " tasks which are most convenient , interesting , or within reach .
Priority is sacrificed for convenience .
As these tasks are being attend to , however , other tasks begin to pile up , and soon a backlog of tasks cry out for attention .
A jumble of new and old tasks become marked as urgent , and the procrastinator is forced to drop current tasks to attend to the urgent ones .
In a sense , what is urgent has become priority .
This confusion continues as tasks split into three categories which cry out for attention and which are increasingly difficult to distinguish , namely , priority / urgent ; priority / non - urgent ; non-priority / urgent .
Meanwhile , the attractiveness of the non-urgent , non-priority comfort tasks still lure the procrastinator to do them .
The result is that the procrastinator becomes subject to the tyranny of the urgent , is unable to establish proper priorities , and constantly seeks reprieve from these stresses by attending to tasks that are neither urgent nor priority !
( b) Distractibility .
Closely related to the tendency of procrastinators to attend to comfort tasks is the problem of distractibility .
It is not surprising to find procrastinators explaining that a task is left unattended to because " something else came up " .
Setting better emotional boundaries ( e.g. , saying " No " to yourself ) in order to stay on task usually helps to limit attention to the multitude of off - task behaviours ( distractions ) .
( c) Forgetfulness .
Unfortunately , no amount of prioritizing or boundary drawing can prevail over disorganized forgetfulness .
Typically , procrastinators assume they have an excellent memory and they often insist that they remember even though they appear to have forgotten ( " Of course , I remember .
I was just about to do it " ) .
Multiple slips of " reminder " paper adorn their pockets and purses , and they seem to use more than one appointment book or none at all ( both practices have the same effect ) .
A step in the right direction is to acknowledge a problem with forgetfulness , although it must never be used as an excuse for inaction .
d) Lumping .
Finally , a major part of procrastination - oriented disorganization comes in the form of " lumping " or " chunking " , that is , the errant perception that most tasks come as an inseparable whole ( a " lump " ) that cannot be subdivided and dealt with systematically .
The harried teenager who thinks of " cleaning my room " as a massive single - lump task would likely procrastinate over cleaning his room .
(2) Fear
Fear motivated procrastination usually expresses itself as avoidance and the intense desire to either delay performing a task or wait for its expiration so that it no longer has to be dealt with .
Often , one task is related to another , and the cluster of avoided tasks increases over time .
As outstanding tasks mount , the procrastinator becomes resigned , depressed and inactive .
The internal struggles of fear - motivated procrastination are usually of two types : the rational versus the irrational ( " I know that I should , so why can't I just do it " ) and discipline vs discomfort ( " I planned to do it , but when the time came , I just did n't feel like it . " ) .
Attempts at resolving these conflicts must start at the level of dealing with the fear rather than with logic or greater discipline .
(3) Perfectionism
Most procrastinators do not think of themselves as perfectionists .
" If I 'm a perfectionist , I would get things done , " they say .
Not necessarily .
In fact , perfectionism can lead to " starts and spurts " performance , meaning that an individual goes on a cleaning spree , or attacks a task with great energy and then slumps back in exhaustion after having exasperated , irritated , or alienated everyone around .
Perfectionism has also been found to be strongly related to depression and an extremely critical spirit ( either self or other critical ) .
What is perfectionism , then ?
Perfectionism is a form of rigidity or inflexibility that is marked by three major characteristics : ( 1 ) The intense desire to jump in and do things yourself because others just can't do it right ; ( 2 ) the insistent attitude that you would n't even start on something if you can't do it well ; and ( 3 ) the profound need for closure , indicated by agitation or discomfort should something be left " hanging " .
Each of these characteristics " drives " the perfectionist to procrastinate .
For perfectionistic procrastinators , the first step in dealing with procrastination is acknowledging and disliking these three basic tendencies .
Then practical solutions can be applied systematically .
(4) Procrastination As An Indicator
Procrastination may also be an indicator of a more serious physical or psychological problem that would respond positively to treatment .
Often , such procrastination is not observed by the one procrastinating , but by others close to that person .
Extreme anxiety , severe clinical depression , obsessive compulsive disorder , attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity , and illnesses that are related to memory loss are examples of such dysfunctions that may lead to procrastination .
Taking Charge of Procrastination
(1) What am I afraid of ?
In fear - motivated procrastination , it is necessary to identify the fear to begin with .
For example , a person trying to find a job over an extended period of time may have developed a fear of being rejected ... yet again .
A high school student drags her feet in completing her class project because of a fear of obtaining another failing grade .
The accounts analyst finds it a chore to complete even one assignment towards his CGA certification because of his fear of the material itself .
This last example may in fact have to do with his lack of aptitude in his chosen field !
In a nutshell , both the fear and the sources of that fear must be confronted before the behaviours expressed by procrastination can be addressed .
Often , a trained counsellor would be able to help in identifying the sources of fear and their effects on self - esteem , then provide some direction in dealing with these problems .
2 ) Get yourself an appointment book .
And please ... do n't go overboard with this idea .
Procrastinators often start ambitiously .
( Remember the problem of " lumping " ? )
They run out and buy the most expensive bells - and - whistles appointment book , invest in an elaborate electronic daytimer , or photocopy reams of get - your - life - together organizers readily available on the market .
You hear the reasoning , " Hey , if it 's gotta be done , it 's gotta be done right ! "
( Do you hear the perfectionist ? )
Eventually , the massive effort comes to an anticlimactic halt when they " run out of steam " , and discouragement sets them three steps back after having dashed two steps forward .
It is far wiser to purchase a simple appointment book , preferably one that is about the size of a small paperback that has a one week spread when the book is opened .
Appointment books help to address the problems of disorganization and even poor memory .
First , learn to use it every day .
Write down things you are going to do or that you have already done .
Look ahead into the next week , if you like , but do n't plan your life for the next year .
To help you use the book more , write in important telephone numbers and addresses as you acquire them .
Carry it around with you all day .
Make its presence with you a habit .
Second , learn how to plan ahead realistically .
Break down tasks into tangible stage goals , and provide these goals with appropriate deadlines .
Then write these deadlines into your appointment book .
Third , provide yourself with daily " to do " lists that you write into your book .
Even small , easy - to - do or habitual items could be added to the list .
Check the items off as you go along .
The point is to register accomplishment tangibly as you move through the day .
3 ) " Dechunking " .
Breaking a task down into manageable chunks ( " dechunking " ) usually removes the threat of having to do a large task all at once .
Sometimes , a task may be underestimated as costing very little energy and time when it really takes up a good chunk of your energies .
Learn to break tasks down to 15 minute chunks to begin with .
As you get more practised at it , increase the size of your chunks .
It would be very helpful to use your appointment book to plan your dechunking .
Breaking Free
Procrastination has a way of ruling our lives if we do not bring it under control .
Many resigned procrastinators simply confess , " I 'm just lazy " and hope that the explanation suffices .
Not by a long shot .
Laziness is procrastination out of control .
It takes a great deal of wisdom and effort to break the clutches of procrastination , but the results are often worth the while .
" Whatever you do , do your work heartily , as for the Lord rather than for men ; knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance .
It is the Lord Christ whom you serve . "

However , it can be hard to fully enjoy the experience if you do not understand the local language .
For example , ordering food from a menu you can not read can be an adventure .
Today we are introducing a new feature of Google Goggles that will prove useful to travelers and monoglots everywhere : Goggles translation .
Here ’s how it works :
Point your phone at a word or phrase .
Use the region of interest button to draw a box around specific words
Press the shutter button
If Goggles recognizes the text , it will give you the option to translate
Press the translate button to select the source and destination languages .
The first Goggles translation prototype was unveiled earlier this year at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and could only recognize German text .
Today Goggles can read English , French , Italian , German and Spanish and can translate to many more languages .
We are hard at work extending our recognition capabilities to other Latin - based languages .
Our goal is to eventually read non-Latin languages ( such as Chinese , Hindi and Arabic ) as well .
Every new release of Google Goggles contains at least one new feature and a large number of improvements to our existing functionality .
In addition to translation , Goggles v1.1 features improved barcode recognition , a larger corpus of artwork , recognition of many more products and logos , an improved user interface , and the ability to initiate visual searches using images in your phone ’s photo gallery .
Computer vision is a hard problem .
While we are excited about Goggles v1.1 , we know that there are many images that we can not yet recognize .
The Google Goggles team is working on solving the technical challenges required to make computers see .
We hope you are as excited as we are about the possibilities of visual search .
Google Goggles v1.1 is available on devices running Android 1.6 and higher .
To download , please scan the QR code below or go to the Android Market app on your phone and search for “ Google Goggles ” .

Anger towards Lebanon is brewing in Sudan and in Sudanese online forums .
According to reports in the Arab media , a fundraising party held by Sudanese immigrants and asylum seekers in Beirut in aid of a child with cancer , was raided by Lebanese security apparently on the hunt for illegal residents .
Eyewitnesses report that although most of those attending produced valid residency cards , this did not spare them from being handcuffed , beaten and racially abused .
According to Sudanese and Lebanese newspaper reports ( in Arabic ) , the detainees were referred to as animals who " learned how to wear nice clothes " and " black pieces of coal " , and lined up flat on their bellies .
Some members of the police , seemingly ignorant of the fact that there are any Arabic - speaking black Arabs , asked some of the Sudanese how they spoke Arabic so fluently .
The Sudanese responded that they were Arabs from Sudan .
In disbelief , the officers thought that they were being mocked , and another round of beating started .
The Lebanese authorities have launched an investigation , but deny that there was any racial motivation to the raid .
On the skin - colour and race spectrum , Sudan is possibly the most African of the Arab League nations .
Lebanon on the other hand , or at least the image the country portrays in the media , is fair and Occidental , both in culture and race ( Lebanese applicants at my university regularly ticked the " Caucasian " box on application forms ) .
This incident highlights the unspoken , unsettling chasm between the two nations in terms of popular perceptions of different races in the Arab world .
While mistreatment of migrant workers attracts coverage , the subtleties of intra-Arab discrimination rarely do .
Lebanon is no stranger to such controversy .
Following a plane crash in the country earlier this year , it was reported that " even though there were nine nationalities aboard the Boeing 737 jet , which burst into flames and crashed into the sea minutes after taking off in a violent thunderstorm on Monday morning , the Lebanese , naturally enough , only concerned themselves with one " .
The families of Ethiopian migrant workers were segregated into separate rooms and DNA testing and identification of dead bodies was prioritised for Lebanese citizens .
Unfortunately , this , in addition to the well - publicised plight of foreign maids in the Lebanon and such insensitivity as manifested in the " Nubian monkey " affair , makes it hard to dismiss this episode as a one - off incident .
Ironically , in an unusual and unique phenomenon of Arab migration to Africa , the Lebanese remain the biggest non-African migrant minority in west Africa .
This community goes back as far as the 19th century , spawning a racial sub-category of African - Lebanese mulattoes and amassing riches in Sierra Leone where it has dominated the diamond industry .
In a typically colonialist fashion , this embracing of Africans does not seem to apply back home .
However , there is a public pan-Arab narrative to which all states adhere .
Meetings of the Arab League are usually sessions praising and paying homage to the host country 's leader and each other .
The meme is that Arabs are all brothers in race , language , history , and anybody who dares suggests otherwise is a turncoat agitator in the pay of the west .
Hence , both the Sudanese and Lebanese governments are doing their best to downplay the affair .
The Lebanese ambassador in Khartoum even went so far as to praise being black by saying that " priests wear black as a sign of respect and that the Kaaba in Mecca is covered in black silk " .
As if the slurs were some sort of compliment .
The Sudanese ambassador in Lebanon condemned a call to boycott Lebanese products as " sabotage " .
This is not surprising as Sudan itself does not have a glowing record of treating its non-Arab citizens particularly well .
In addition , most Sudanese residents in Lebanon fled from such conditions in Sudan , which does not predispose the Sudanese diplomatic mission to a very sympathetic stance .
Sadly , it is a region where few are innocent .
Northern Sudan , which dominates the rest of the country politically and culturally , has since independence downplayed its African heritage and amplified its Arab and Muslim character , subscribing to the popular perception that Arabs are superior to Africans .
Needless to say , according to statements on behalf of the Lebanese and Sudanese governments , this incident " will not affect the fraternal relations between the two nations " .
Image caption Jon Venables was given a new identity on his release from prison
One of the two killers of Merseyside toddler James Bulger has been charged with possession and distribution of indecent images of children .
Jon Venables , who killed James in 1993 , was released from jail in 2001 and given a new identity and anonymity for life under a special court order .
But Venables , now 27 , was recalled to prison in February after allegedly breaching the terms of his licence .
He is charged with two offences under the 1978 Protection of Children Act .
Early stage
It is alleged that he downloaded 57 indecent images of children between February 2009 and February 2010 .
He is secondly accused of distributing seven images between 1 and 23 February this year by allowing files on his computer to be available through a peer - to - peer network .
Gavin Millar QC , for the Crown , told the judge that there was no evidence that anyone else had acquired the files through that route .
The case is at a very early stage and will return to court on 23 July .
That hearing will be the first opportunity for Venables to indicate whether he will be pleading guilty or not guilty to the alleged offences .
Were he to plead not guilty , he would appear before a jury under his new name .
If he pleads guilty , the case will move to sentencing before a judge .
Under the terms of Venables ' anonymity order , the media is not allowed to report anything about his new identity and a jury would never know who he really is
Mother 's concerns
In March , the then Justice Secretary Jack Straw announced that Venables had been returned to prison but said that it was not in the interests of a fair trial to publicise what had allegedly happened .
Denise Fergus , James 's mother , had called for the reason for the recall to be made public , saying as his mother she had " a right to know " .
In a statement , read by her spokesman on her behalf on Monday , she said : " It is right that the charges he faces should be made public .
" I have been kept informed to an extent about the legal proceedings in the case over the past few months through the Ministry of Justice , the Merseyside Probation Service and more recently by senior officers from Merseyside police . "
She said her solicitor had also been in contact with the ministry about concerns she had over the " way the case is going to be handled " .
" We are still awaiting a reply to that formal approach .
I am prepared to wait and see what happens .
I simply want to see justice done in this case and I do n't want to say anything that could affect the proceedings , " the statement said .
' Disaster '
Speaking outside court on Monday , Robin Makin , solicitor for James 's father Ralph , attacked the Ministry of Justice for the way it had handled the case ever since Venables ' recall .
" We consider that the way this has been handled since news of Jon Venables being recalled to custody has been a disaster , " he said .
" The public authorities ought to behave quite differently and in due course further details are likely to emerge of the mistakes that were made .
Ineptitude and incompetence spring to mind . "
Venables and his friend Robert Thompson were jailed for life when , as 10 - year - olds , they took two - year - old James from a shopping centre in Bootle .
The toddler 's body was found on a disused railway line more than two miles away from where he had been taken .
Venables and Thompson were given new identities on their release from prison in 2001 because of the risk that they would be victims of a vigilante attack .
Media law expert Mark Stephens insisted despite the publicity it was " almost certain " that Venables could get a fair trial .
He said : " The judge has gone to extraordinary lengths , as has the prosecution .
They have worked with the defence to make sure that a fair trial can happen and that justice will out at the end of the day . "
However , BBC legal affairs analyst Clive Coleman says if the case goes to trial , it will be a very difficult one for the authorities to manage .
Defence lawyers could argue there was an " abuse of process " because of the publicity surrounding the case .
They would tell the judge that a jury would be able to identify the defendant , and the notoriety of James '
Bulger 's murder would mean Venables would not be able to get a fair trial , he said .
( CNET ) -- Google has seen enough of Microsoft 's Windows operating system , suspending internal use of the OS amid security concerns related to the attack on its network late last year , according to a report .
Google CEO Eric Schmidt believes that Chrome OS is more secure than Windows , reportedly ordering employees to move away from Windows machines .
The Financial Times reported late Monday that Google has begun telling new employees that they are no longer able to request Windows PCs , giving them the choice of Mac or Linux systems .
Google has long offered its employees their choice of work operating system but will no longer do so , The Financial Times said , afteran attack on Windows and Internet Explorer 6 resulted in the theft of Google intellectual property , believed to be source code , late last year .
Rumors to this effect surfaced earlier in the year , but CNET was unable to confirm them at the time .
Microsoft has never been a friendly face inside the Googleplex , but Google 's engineering - driven culture and need to test its software on a variety of systems usually meant that at least some portion of its employees preferred the Windows environment .
Some Google employees will still be able to use Windows machines , but they will have to get special permission , according to the report .
Later this year Google will begin directing employees toward Chrome OS systems , Google CEO Eric Schmidt told CIOs attending a Google seminar on cloud computing in April .
Google believes the browser - based operating system will be " inherently more secure " than alternative operating systems , Schmidt said at that event .
Google declined to comment " on specific operational matters . "

Poll : BP Oil Spill Response Rated Worse than Katrina Most favor pursuit of criminal charges against BP and others involved in spill .
June 7 , 2010 --
By more than a 2 - to - 1 margin , Americans support the pursuit of criminal charges in the nation 's worst oil spill , with increasing numbers calling it a major environmental disaster .
Eight in 10 criticize the way BP 's handled it – and more people give the federal government 's response a negative rating than did the response to Hurricane Katrina .
A month and a half after the spill began , 69 percent in a new ABC News / Washington Post poll rate the federal response negatively .
That compares with a 62 negative rating for the response to Katrina two weeks after the August 2005 hurricane .
Click here for a PDF with full charts and questionnaire .
BP 's response to the spill draws even broader criticism – 81 percent rate it negatively .
And 64 percent say the government should pursue criminal charges against BP and other companies involved in the spill , which has poured oil into the Gulf from a well 5,000 feet beneath the surface since an explosion and fire destroyed the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig April 20 .
The poll was conducted Thursday through Sunday , mostly before BP announced Sunday that a containment cap on the well was capturing a substantial portion of the gushing oil .
Nonetheless , BP faces deep damage to its public image : Nearly three - quarters of Americans , 73 percent , see " unnecessary risks taken by BP and its drilling partners " as a significant factor in the spill .
And amid fouled beaches , oiled wildlife and closed fisheries , there 's growing public dismay over the damage .
Seventy - three percent now call the spill a major environmental disaster , up sharply from 55 percent in a Pew Research Center poll a month ago .
Support for pursuit of criminal charges against BP and its partners rises to 71 percent among people who call the spill a major disaster .
Similarly , 73 percent favor criminal charges among those who suspect that unnecessary risks were taken by BP and its partners .
There 's sharp negative intensity in views of BP .
Fifty - four percent give its response the lowest rating , " poor , " and 51 percent " strongly " favor examination of criminal charges against the company and its partners – both high levels of strong sentiment .
BP Oil Spill : Partisanship & Federal Government Response
Substantially fewer , by contrast , rate the federal government 's response as " poor , " 32 percent .
There 's partisanship in views of the federal response , with Democrats less critical of the Democratic - led government .
Nonetheless , even among Democrats , 56 percent rate the federal response negatively .
That rises to 74 percent of independents and 81 percent of Republicans .
Partisanship ran in precisely the opposite direction in views of the Katrina response under the Bush administration .
Just 41 percent of Republicans rated that response negatively , compared to 64 percent of independents and 79 percent of Democrats .
In addition to the 7 - point difference in negative ratings of the federal response to the oil spill vs. Katrina , there 's a 10 - point difference in positive ratings – 28 percent for the government 's oil spill response , vs. 38 percent for its response to Katrina .
That 's in part because 59 percent of Republicans rated the response to Katrina positively , while just 40 percent of Democrats say the same about the current oil spill response .
All the same , there 's far less partisan division in concern about the spill 's effects :
It 's seen as a major environmental disaster by seven in 10 Republicans and three - quarters of Democrats and independents alike .

" Whether anyone likes it or not , migration will be a key issue of the 21st century .
Pritchett 's book highlights the difficult political and ethical issues that the movement of people across national borders presents to the current system .
His discussion of ways to break the deadlock is a provocative contribution in an area where provocation is needed . "
— Mary Robinson , President , Ethical Globalization Initiative and former President of Ireland
" Lant Prichett gives us the most lucid and forward - looking account of the one aspect of 21st century globalization that politicians still refuse to recognize and manage properly : labor migration .
If you care about the state of the world in the future , you will find this book irresistible and useful reading . "
— Ernesto Zedillo , Director of the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization and former President of Mexico
In an increasingly liberalized and integrated global economy , with more open capital and goods and services markets , the highly restricted and heavily regulated markets for global labor are an oddity .
In this controversial book , CGD non-resident fellow Lant Pritchett examines the potentials and perils of greater cross - border mobility of unskilled labor — within poor world regions and between poor and rich countries .
Pritchett argues that irresistible demographic forces for greater international labor mobility are being checked by immovable anti-immigration ideas of rich - country citizens .
He highlights the difficult political and ethical issues that the movement of people across national borders presents to the current system and proposes breaking the gridlock through policies that support development while also being politically acceptable in rich countries .
These include greater use of temporary worker permits , permit rationing , reliance on bilateral rather than multilateral agreements , and protection of migrants ' fundamental human rights .
Pritchett 's discussion of ways to break the deadlock is a provocative contribution to the growing debate on one of the most important and difficult issues of the 21st century .
Art recovery experts marveled at the audacity of the Paris burglary and debated whether a criminal gang was trying to send a message to other organized crime groups with the theft of five paintings by Picasso , Matisse , Georges Braque , Fernand Léger and Amedeo Modigliani .
The burglary , they said , probably is part of a trend among criminals to steal paintings for use as underworld collateral in the face of bank crackdowns on money laundering .
“ It is very difficult now to move money through the banking system without being traceable by the police , ” said Julian Radcliffe , president of Art Loss Recovery , a private database of lost and stolen art based in London .
“ If you are a criminal and you want to move money from England to Switzerland or Paris to Italy , you have to have a way of moving value without being discovered .
You ca n’t use the banking system and you ca n’t use cash . ”
In cases that Art Loss has tracked , Mr. Radcliffe said that stolen paintings have been used , for example , as collateral by Colombian drug dealers and cigarette smugglers in the Balkans .
Typically , a painting is used as currency on the black market at 10 percent of its real value , according to Antonia Kimbell , recoveries manager for Art Loss Register , who said artworks are usually stolen and passed through a hierarchy of thieves — burglars outsourced from another country to elude investigators and brokers to move the paintings .
For those who do try to offer stolen art on the open market , the effort is fraught with risks .
Art Recovery worked on a case with the F.B.I. involving Robert Mardirosian , 74 , a one - time Massachusetts state prosecutor , whose conviction for possessing stolen property was upheld last month .
His story dates back to 1978 , when his client , David Colvin , was accused of stealing seven paintings , including a Cezanne , from a home in Stockbridge , Massachusetts .
In theory , gate agents with these devices can anticipate the need to rebook a flight after a missed connection , instead of waiting for passengers to ask .
In the future , new technology may allow airlines to know if travelers are stuck in traffic on their way to the airport , thanks to GPS - enabled smartphones , or offer an earlier flight if a traveler shows up with time to spare .

Passengers traveling this summer will see only a glimpse of the new technology , though it will be introduced at airports over the next year or two .
For now , the airlines remain dependent on computer systems first built a half century ago that have been layered with updates upon updates  “ a spaghetti of networks , ” as one analyst described it  that do not always communicate well with one another , or with passengers .
So some airport screens may say a flight is on time , while the gate information shows it has been moved to another terminal and the airline employees standing behind their monitors say the flight has , in fact , been delayed two hours .
And the experiences of passengers are more like Dr. Joan Bengtson’s .
Dr. Bengtson , a gynecologist who lives in Boston , said that she was once stranded because of a snowstorm , and it took two days for the airline to rebook her .
Meanwhile the phone number she was given remained busy for hours .

One of Russia 's top criminal judges has been murdered in the capital , Moscow .
Eduard Chuvashov had presided over several high - profile trials , including the sentencing of some of Russia 's most notorious neo -Nazis .
According to one of Russia 's main news agencies , a security camera recorded the moment the gunman entered the apartment building and opened fire .
The judge had just come out of his apartment .
Mr Chuvashov is reported to have died instantly after being hit in the head and chest .
The gunman , who managed to escape , is reported to have been in his 20s and of Slavic appearance .
Officials have been quoted as saying this was probably a contract killing connected to the judge 's work .
Local media said Mr Chuvashov was the judge who sentenced 12 ultra-nationalists from the Russian fascist group known as the " White Wolves " in February .
Mostly teenagers , the group were found guilty of a string of brutal murders against dark - skinned migrants from Central Asian countries , many of whom had been bludgeoned to death .

The @BPGlobalPR
Twitter profile vilifies the company further .
Some fan favorites from the Twitter page include :
Since then , we 've seen a ludicrous parade of headlines , toxic name - calling , contributions from Kevin Costner and numerous TV appearances by Bill Nye the Science Guy , the children 's show host who is apparently now an authority on the issue .
@BPGlobalPR 's fictional character , Terry , moves to stir up further controversy beyond the real - life disaster and so - far disastrous cleanup attempts that have sent BP 's stock sliding 17.5 points since the April 20 Deepwater Horizon spill .
The fake BP Twitter page was created a week ago and already has 42,000 followers -- dwarfing BP 's real account , @BP_America , which has 5,700 .
The person pulling the strings of @BPGlobalPR , who refused to reveal himself or even break character in an interview with The Times , spills barrels of dark humor onto the international calamity .
As if the all - too - real BP oil spill were n't enough of a circus , a satirical Twitter account called @BPGlobalPR adds some dark humor to a sludgy situation .
Catastrophe is a strong word , let 's all agree to call it a whoopsie daisy .
The good news : Mermaids are real .
The bad news :
They are now extinct .
# bpcares
We just saw a shark fight an octopus inside the geyser .
Almost made this whole thing worth it .
We tracked down the fictional Terry and had a chat via e-mail .
Throughout the exchange , he refused to break character ( or talk on the phone ) .
He did , however , note that the project has netted more than $ 3,000 for the nonprofit Gulf Restoration Network through the sale of $ 25 " BP cares " T - shirts ( in green and black , a nice mesh of the colors of money and oil ) .
" Companies screw up and then they hire folks like me to come in to make it look like they 're doing something while they figure out how to make money again , " the fake public relations representative wrote .
" BP is doing everything we can to save our reputation and hopefully salvage some oil out of all this .
We 're making a ton of shirts and commercials about how we care , and I cleaned an ugly bird yesterday . "
The page quickly caught the attention of numerous media outlets , which in turn flagged representatives of the oil giant -- the real one .
" It ’s a shame , but obviously people are entitled to their views , " one spokesman told the Wall Street Journal .
Spokesman Toby Odone told AdAge that he was n't aware of any attempts by the company to have the feed taken down .
He added that the satirical account had changed its logo from the signature green BP image to a black one ( with some dark substance spilling off of it ) .
The bogus BP spokesman took a characteristically opposing stance .
" I 've heard rumors of fake BP PR accounts , and I assure you if we find out who is in charge of them , we will annihilate them , " he wrote .

Occasionally we see robots that are so awesome that we wonder why they have n’t conquered the world yet .
So it is with the newest unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAV ) from UPenn ’s GRASP Lab , which autonomously performs “ precise agressive maneuvers ” in a great video ( see below ) .
‘ Agressive ’ is the key word here as the quadrotor drone sounds like a swarm of angry hornets as it bursts through a series of windows at different angles and orientations .
It also performs flips , weaves through other UAVs , and perches on walls with Velcro .
This thing is amazing !
Quadrotors provide a good deal of stability and maneuverability and make ideal spy drones .
MIT is developing an iPhone control system for quadrotors for military use and Parrot released a retail version ( also controllable via iPhone ) with augmented reality applications .
GRASP ’s version of the device , however , can go where no drone has gone before – ducking through openings at high speeds with just three inches of clearance .
That ’s an incredible degree of autonomous maneuvering and it shows how well these UAVs may be able to adapt to urban environments and unconventional terrain .
The UPenn quadrotor is the work of grad student Daniel Mellinger , his advisor Vijay Kumar , and research scientist Nathan Michael .
They used 20 vicon cameras to digitally map the quadrotor in its space .
You can clearly see the white sphere markers on the UAV and the ‘ windows ’ in the video .
Combined with data from the quadrotor ’s IMU , the visual tracking allowed the UAV to perform its precise and aggressive maneuvers .
While that tracking system provided amazing results , it ’s obviously not something you want to have to set up in the field .
It will take considerably more research to allow the UAV to perform the same maneuvers with its own instrumentation in a non-mapped space .
In other words , as aggressive as the GRASP quadrotor may be , you do n’t have to worry about it flying through your window anytime soon .
That ’s definitely a load off my mind .
Now if I could only find a way to avoid an unstoppable robot dog …

The United States embassy has demanded an investigation into how an American citizen lost her eye last week at the Qalandiyah checkpoint after being struck by a tear gas grenade .

Emily Henochowicz , 21 , an art student in New York , came to Israel six weeks ago as an exchange student at Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem .
She has participated in a number of protests in the West Bank .
Last Monday , after the takeover of the Mavi Marmara , Henochowicz took part in a demonstration at the Qalandiyah checkpoint together with a few dozen protesters .
Border Policemen fired tear gas grenades to disperse the protest , one of which struck Henochowicz in the face .
She was taken to Hadassah University Hospital , Ein Karem , where she underwent surgery .
In addition to losing her left eye , Henochowicz is suffering from fractures to her face .
She returned to the United States on Saturday night for continued treatment .
Henochowicz 's father , a doctor , is originally from Israel and she also has Israeli citizenship .
The U.S. embassy has been in continuous touch with the family .
Haaretz has learned that the embassy conveyed a demand that Israel investigate the incident .
A Swedish activist , Soren Johanssen who was reportedly standing near Henochowicz , was quoted as saying : " They fired many canisters at us in rapid succession .
One landed on either side of Emily , then the third one hit her in the face . "
Another protester , Jonathan Pollak , was quoted as saying that Border Policemen had intentionally aimed at the demonstrators .
However , an internal probe by the Border Police indicates that the tear gas projectile hit a wall and subsequently flew at Henochowicz .
A statement from the Border Police spokesperson said : " The investigation carried out by the IDF showed that the forces operated at the site impeccably and utilized means according to procedure .
There was no directly - aimed fire in the incident . "
A statement from the Foreign Ministry said : " The incident is known .
We have not received an official request from the Americans on this matter .
We are in a very open and effective dialogue with them about the incident . "
Henochowicz 's attorney , Michael Sfard , yesterday demanded that the Samaria and Judea District police ( which investigates suspected criminal use of weapons by Border Policemen in the West Bank ) launch an investigation .
" According to testimony I have begun to receive , the firing was at close range and was directly aimed , and if this is correct , it is clearly a criminal act for which those involved must answer .
My client and her family have authorized me to say that they demand that her unnecessary injury be fully investigated , and that we spare no effort to ensure that law enforcement authorities carry out their duty in this matter , " Sfard wrote in his demand .
Money Is Not Real
So , the world 's elites have decided to focus all their efforts on generating another Great Depression .
Their cunning plan is to destroy their countries in order to save them :
As Europe ’s major economies focus on belt - tightening , they are following the path of Ireland .
But the once thriving nation is struggling , with no sign of a rapid turnaround in sight .
Nearly two years ago , an economic collapse forced Ireland to cut public spending and raise taxes , the type of austerity measures that financial markets are now pressing on most advanced industrial nations ...
Rather than being rewarded for its actions , though , Ireland is being penalized .
Its downturn has certainly been sharper than if the government had spent more to keep people working .
Lacking stimulus money , the Irish economy shrank 7.1 percent last year and remains in recession ...
[ David Stronge ] moved to reinvent himself , returning to school with thousands of other Irish , in hopes that a higher degree would lead to better prospects .
Mr. Stronge plans to seek alternative energy jobs in Britain once he gets his master ’s degree in August .
" Ireland is n’t going to spend on infrastructure probably for another 10 to 15 years , " he said .
" So you have to go to where the opportunities are . "
At the D Café , a sandwich shop facing a stretch of empty buildings in Dublin ’s Docklands enclave , even that dream seems impossible .
“ If you ’re self - employed and lose your job , you ’re entitled to nothing , not even the dole , ” said Debbie , the owner , who would only give her first name .
She transformed her convenience store into a deli when Liam Carroll , a property baron , threw up the nearby developments .
But the tenants never came , and her business evaporated .
" It ’s so destroying , " she said , gazing out the window .
" We all live day by day , and we do n’t know when it will ever pick up . "
Of course , much of the world 's elite understand exactly what they 're doing : i.e. , use the economic catastrophe they themselves created as a pretext to kill the welfare state they 've despised for 65 years .
Nonetheless , a significant chunk of them actually believe they 're doing the right thing for everyone .
How is this possible ?
The best explanation I 've seen appears in a 1994 book by John Ralston Saul called The Doubter 's Companion .
It 's a kind of dictionary — the whole book is just him defining and discussing a bunch of words .
And one thing he defines is " debt , unsustainable levels of . "
Everything you need to understand about our current attempt to obliterate ourselves can be found within it .
His most important point is that money is not real .
Yet somehow we 've decided it 's a great idea to stop feeding real food to real people and cease educating real children in order to demonstrate fealty to an abstract concept .
My favorite parts are these , but you should go below the fold and read the whole thing :
A nation cannot make debts sustainable by cutting costs .
Cuts may produce marginal savings , but savings are not cash flow .
This is another example of the alchemist ’s temptation ...
Civilizations which become obsessed by sustaining unsustainable debt - loads have forgotten the basic nature of money .
Money is not real .
It is a conscious agreement on measuring abstract value .
Unhealthy societies often become mesmerized by money and treat it as if it were something concrete .
The effect is to destroy the currency ’s practical value .

DEBT , UNSUSTAINABLE LEVELS OF
National debts are treated today as if they were unforgiving gods with the power to control , alter and if necessary destroy a country .
This financial trap is usually presented as if it were peculiar to our time , as well as being a profound comment on the profligate habits of the population .
The reality may be less disturbing .
1 . The building up of unsustainable debt loads is a commonplace in history .
There are several standard means of resolving the problem : execute the lenders , exile them , default outright or simply renegotiate to achieve partial default and low interest rates .
2 . There is no example of a nation become rich by paying its debts .
3 . There are dozens of examples of nations becoming rich by defaulting or renegotiating .
This begins formally in the sixth century BC with Solon taking power in debt - crippled Athens .
His organization of general default – “ the shaking off of the burdens ” – set the city - state on its road to democracy and prosperity .
The Athens which is still remembered as the central inspiration of WESTERN CIVILIZATION was the direct product of a national default .
One way or another most Western countries , including the United States , have done the same thing at some point .
Most national defaults lead to sustained periods of prosperity .
4 . The non-payment of debts carried no moral weight .
The only moral standards recognized in Western society as being relevant to lending are those which identify profit made from loans as a sin .
Loans themselves are mere contracts and therefore cannot carry moral value .
5 . As all businessmen know , contracts are to be respected whenever possible .
When not possible , regulations exist to aid default or renegotiation .
Businessmen regularly do both and happily walk away .
The collapse of the Reichmann financial empire – larger than most countries – is a recent example .
The family was able to turn around , walk away and almost immediately begin a new life , promoting the biggest property development in the history of Mexico .
6 . There are no general regulations dealing with the financial problems of nations simply because they are themselves the regulatory authority .
There is however well - established historical precedent .
Mexico effectively defaulted in 1982 - 83 , thus regenerating its economy .
The reaction of Western lenders has been to treat these crises as special cases .
The sort of thing that only happens to Third World countries .
That ’s nonsense .
7 . The one major difference between private and public debt is that the public sore cannot be based upon real collateral .
This makes default a more natural solution to unviable situations .
The question of national collateral was fully addressed in the eighteenth century when it became clear that an indebted people could not owe their national rights ( their land and property ) to a lender .
The citizen ’s natural and concrete rights took precedence over the lender ’s abstract rights .
One of the most peculiar and insidious aspects of twentieth - century CORPORATISM has been an attempt to reverse this precedence .
The managerial imperative suggests that national debts can be indirectly collateralized in several ways .
Governments can be forced to sell national property to pay debts ( PRIVATIZATION ) .
They can also be pressed to transfer ownership of national property to lenders , as has been done in the Third World .
There is also the threat that defaulting nations will be treated as international pariahs .
This is a strange argument since it does n’t apply in the private sector ( see 5 ) .
It is also an idle threat , as Mexico has demonstrated ( see 6 ) .
8. Debts – both public and private – become unsustainable when the borrower ’s cash flow no longer handily carries the interest payments .
Once a national economy has lost that rate of cash flow , it is unlikely to get it back .
The weight of the debt on the economy makes it impossible .
9 . A nation cannot make debts sustainable by cutting costs .
Cuts may produce marginal savings , but savings are not cash flow .
This is another example of the alchemist ’s temptation .
Mrs. Thatcher spent a decade trying to slash the British national debt .
She had the advantage of being able to use North Sea oil income for this purpose .
The result was a damaged industrial sector , economic stagnation and endemic unemployment .
The payment of debts is a negative process which can only be a drain on investment and growth .
The more successful major repayment programs are , the more the economy will be damaged .
10 .
Strong nations weaken their own economies by forcing weaker ones to maintain unsustainable debt - levels .
For example , in spite of enormous efforts on all sides , the Third World debt has continued to grow .
In 1993 it was $ 1.6 trillion .
This costs them far more in interest payments sent to the West than the West sends in aid .
The practical effect is to make economic growth impossible .
The Third World thus constitutes a dead weight in our ongoing DEPRESSION ; a barrier to renewed cash flow
11 . Civilizations which become obsessed by sustaining unsustainable debt - loads have forgotten the basic nature of money .
Money is not real .
It is a conscious agreement on measuring abstract value .
Unhealthy societies often become mesmerized by money and treat it as if it were something concrete .
The effect is to destroy the currency ’s practical value .
12 . An obsession with such false realities and with debt repayment indicates a liner , narrow managerial approach to economics .
The management of an economy is the profession of finance - department technocrats , economists and bankers .
Their approach is quite naturally one of continuity .
This is a means of denying failure .
To treat money or debt as a contractual matter – therefore open to non-payment or to renegotiation – would mean treating the managerial profession as of secondary importance and unrelated to fundamental truths .
What sensible people might see as originality or practicality , fiancnial expers see as a threat to their professional self - pride .
13 . Does all of this mean that governments should default on their national debt ?
Not exactly .
What it does mean is that we are imprisoned in a linear and managerial approach which denies reality , to say nothing of experience .
Money is first a matter of imagination and second of fixed agreements on the willing suspension of disbelief .
In other words , it is possible to approach the debt problem in quite different ways .
14 .
There have been changes which limit our actions in comparison to those of Solon or Henry IV , who negotiated his way out of an impossible debt situation in the early seventeenth century and re-established prosperity .
First we have to recognize and protect the investment made by citizens directly ( government bonds ) and indirectly ( bank deposits ) in the financing of national debts .
Second , there is the new and unregulated complexity of the international MONEY MARKETS , which now constitutes an important corporatist element .
15 . Our central problem is one of approach .
For two decades governments have been instructing economists and finance officials to come up with ways in which the debt can be paid down and interest payments maintained .
No one has instructed them to propose methods for not paying the debt and not maintaining interest payments .
No one has asked them to use their creativity in place of a priori logic .
16 . Were the members of the Group of Seven ( G7 ) each to pool their economists and give them a month to come up with modern versions of default , we might be surprised by the ease with which practical proposals would appear .
17 .
There are two simple guiding points :
A . The appearance of continuity is easily achieved in default scenarios through paper mechanisms which can be categorized as “ debt retirement . ”
B . What is difficult for a single country in contemporary circumstances is easy for a group , particularly if that group speak for the developed world .

クラミジアの薬の種 類
クラミジアはクラミジア・トラコマチスと呼ばれる細菌が原因となって起きる病気です。
そのため、この病気を治療するときには抗生物質や合成抗菌剤など、病原微生物を殺菌する成分が含まれている薬を使用します。
クラミジアの薬として主なものは、マクロライド系やテトラサイクリン系・ニューキノロン系の抗生物質があります。
このうち、比較的よく使用されるのがマクロライド系の抗生物質です。
マクロライド系の治療薬には、アジスロマイシンやクラリスロマイシンなどがあります。
アジスロマイシンはとくに効果が高く、通常は1回使用するだけで完全にこの病気を治すことができます。
そのため性感染症ガイドラインの推奨グレードではAの「強く推奨する」となっています。
アジスロマイシンの作用機序としては、有効成分が細菌のタンパク質合成を阻害することによって殺菌効果を示します。
この系統の薬は副作用も少なく、妊婦や子供でも使用することができるのが特徴となっています。
アジスロマイシンを使用した場合、感染しているクラミジアのほとんどを除菌することができます。
そのためクラミジアを治療する際の第一選択薬となっています。
クラリスロマイシンも効果が高いですが、アジスロマイシンとは違って7日間の服用が必要になります。
性感染症ガイドラインの推奨グレードでは、妊婦のみ推奨グレードBの「一般的な推奨」で、そのほかの場合には推奨グレードAとなっています。
次に使用されることが多いのが、テトラサイクリン系の抗生物質です。
テトラサイクリン系の製品には、ドキシサイクリンやミノサイクリンなどがあります。
これらの薬は、マクロライド系が使用できない場合や、効果が出なかった場合などに使われます。
ドキシサイクリンやミノサイクリンも、病原菌のタンパク質合成を阻害することで抗菌作用を示します。
テトラサイクリン系の抗生物質では、ドキシサイクリンが処方される割合が高くなっています。
これらの治療薬を使った場合、若干副作用が見られることもあります。
最後にニューキノロン系の抗生物質には、レボフロキサシンやトスフロキサシン・シタフロキサシンなどがあります。
これらの製品は病原菌のDNA合成を阻害することで抗菌効果を発揮します。
ニューキノロン系は、過去にはクラミジアを治療する場合一般的に使用されていましたが、現在では耐性菌が増えてきているため、この病気の治療に使われることは少なくなってきています。
それでは、クラミジアの症状としてはどんなものがあるのかを見ていくことにしましょう。
AMERICA : Washington may challenge Arizona ’s new immigration law on grounds it pre-empts the federal government ’s right to determine immigration policy , writes LARA MARLOWE
THE MEXICAN - AMERICANS sit on folding chairs , around picnic tables laden with coolers , in the shade outside the state capitol building in Phoenix .
It is the 60th day of their vigil against law SB1070 .
There are no posters or political slogans , only the US flag and the emblems of the army , navy , air force and marine corps , to remind the white people that they , too , served this country .
A plaster Madonna draped in rosary beads , a framed image of Christ and burning candles form a makeshift chapel beneath another tree .
At first , they are wary .
“ People come out of the building to talk to us .
Then they go back inside and they distort what we say , ” a teenage boy says .
“ We ’re not an organisation , just Hispanic people , trying to be together , a community , ” says Carolina Caudillo ( 20 ) , a student of journalism at Phoenix College .
With her long gold - brown hair and pale green eyes , Caudillo seems to have stepped out of a Gabriel Garcia Marquez novel .
She speaks of fear , of people leaving the country .
Sometimes her face breaks into a sad , beautiful smile .
“ My friend Valerie went to high school with me , ” Caudillo continues .
“ She spent most of her life here .
This was her home .
She went back to Mexico .
She said she does n’t have a future here .
“ Another friend left because they deported her father .
Her mother and siblings followed right away .
She stayed on alone for a while .
Families are being split up . ”
Although her English is flawless , Caudillo searches for words to explain the hatred that has engulfed Arizona .
“ It ’s been going on for a long time , growing , ” she says .
“ I do n’t know who to blame .
We do n’t know how to solve it , but it needs to be solved . ”
I leave the little encampment and head past the rose bushes and replica of the Liberty Bell for my appointment with state senator Russell Pearce , the author of SB1070 .
Pearce ( 62 ) is a vituperative former policeman whose conversation is punctuated with the words “ illegal ” , “ criminal ” and “ enough is enough ” .
He makes up extravagant figures – up to 10,000 illegals crossing the border daily – and is furious when I use the word “ Mexican ” .
“ Why would you assume that this is about Mexicans ? ” Pearce says .
“ The media does that and it ’s a fabrication and a myth . . .
It has nothing to do with anything but the law .
It offends me to the core when people assume this is about race . ”
In 1977 , Pearce was shot in the chest by a Mexican youth .
He was out on patrol , and stopped when he saw three teenagers drinking .
One of them grabbed his weapon .
“ If I had a heart I ’d be dead , ” he jokes in an oft - repeated witticism about how belonging to the Republican Party saved him .
In 2004 , Pearce ’s son Sean , also a policeman , was shot in the stomach when he went to arrest a Mexican charged with homicide and drug - dealing .
These days , Pearce has found a home further to the right , with the Tea Party movement .
Since 2004 , he has written three laws targeting illegal immigrants .
He says many states ( the first time he mentions it it ’s 18 ; the second time 34 ) have contacted him for help in modelling their own laws after SB1070 .
The Obama administration may challenge SB1070 on the grounds that it pre-empts the federal government ’s right to determine immigration policy .
“ I fully expect to be sued by the left - wing , open - border anarchist crowd that support law - breakers over law - keepers , ” Pearce says .
His latest law will not take effect until July 29th , but Pearce is already working on his next project .
The 14th amendment of the US constitution is “ unconstitutional ” , he says .
“ It was passed in 1868 for the sole purpose of righting the wrong done to former slaves . ”
Juris solis was never meant to apply to the children of illegal aliens .
It ’s an aberration , Pearce says , for “ anchor babies ” or “ jackpot babies ” born in Arizona to enjoy citizenship .
It costs taxpayers “ hundreds of millions of dollars ” because “ in this welfare state we have created in the US , and we are a socialist country ... everybody thinks they have the right to other people ’s stuff ” .
As Pearce tell it , whites are the victims .
“ Ranchers near the border have their fences torn down .
Their water lines are destroyed .
Their dogs are killed and their cattle are slaughtered .
They board up their houses .
If they hear noise at night , they do n’t come out because they are fearful .
They pray for daylight . ”
Two Mexicans shot dead on the border in the past two weeks “ were trying to kill our border patrol agents ” , Pearce says .
“ Home invaders , car - jackers , drug smugglers , child molesters .
That ’s what ’s coming across that border every day . ”
This invasion “ is threatening American culture ” , Pearce says .
On May 11th , governor Jan Brewer signed a Bill that will end ethnic studies programmes in Arizona schools .
Pearce cites a passage in a schoolbook , the title of which he can’t remember , that says , according to him : “ The white people are dying .
We need to run them out .
If they wo n’t leave , we will kill the gringos . ”
He adds : “ They ’re teaching these children they ’re being oppressed , that they need to take back America , that this is their land , that they ’re being abused , that white people are the enemy .
This is nothing less than sedition . ”
Does it really hurt anyone if Spanish language classes are taught in Arizona schools ?
“ Yes it does , ” Pearce says .
“ They can speak it in their own homes .
I ’m not gonna pay for it .
We ’re a nation that speaks English . ”
Leonardo DiCaprio , Ellen Page , and Cilian Murphy star in Christopher Nolan ’s very cool looking new film , ‘ Inception ’ .

For those of you who follow me regularly–yes , I got an A on that paper .
For those of you who do n’t read me regularly , just be comforted in the fact that you ’re reading a blog by a good student .
Anyway , back on track .
You ever see a pair of kids pajamas that says “ Inflammable ? ”
Well–if you knew the real meaning of inflammable , you would be greatly concerned .
Keep reading to find out why !
Wait …THAT’S what inflammable means ?!
So back in “ ye olden days , ” inflammable actually meant something that was highly explosive or could catch fire very easily .
Think about it –that ’s why we still have words like “ inflamed , ” because the root word was inflammable .
However , over time there was concern that there could be confusion over the prefix in - , which normally negates things , and that people would think items that were likely to catch fire WEREN ’T likely to catch fire .
Because of this , rumor has it that the National Fire Protection Association began using flammable as a replacement for inflammable to eliminate confusion .
However , there ’s a new problem introduced by doing that –they both mean the same thing !
So now what do I do ?
Although flammable means the same thing as inflammable technically , most people have assumed that inflammable means flame - resistant .
As such , for general usage you may want to use the words in that way–but for academic writing you might want to think about using the traditional usage of inflammable .
Good luck !

The crew want to book their place in the history of space exploration
There was all the pageantry of a real space launch .
The six " astronauts " wearing bright blue jump - suits and even surgical masks , were paraded before banks of television cameras and hordes of journalists at a news conference before entering their mock spaceship .
Amongst the long rows of VIPs at the news conference were senior officials from the United States , China and the European Union .
If , as some experts believe , the main aim of the Mars 500 experiment is to publicise the concept of human flight to the red planet , then it has surely succeeded beyond all expectations .
" I am very happy to be part of this project , " said Diego Urbina , the Colombian - Italian and most extrovert member of the crew .
" It will raise awareness of space flight so hopefully a few years from now there will be a real flight to Mars . "
He confessed that Elton John had been his inspiration .
" I do n't know if you know that song Rocket Man , " he asked .
" I want a future like that … where people will be going frequently into space and will be working there and it will be very usual . "
Image caption
The facility contains living quarters , a gym and sauna
In front of the world 's media , all the team spoke confidently about the chances of the experiment being successful - in other words that noone would crack under the stress of such lengthy confinement in such claustrophobic and bizarre conditions and demand to be let out .
" The target is for all six of us to be here for 520 days , " said the French crew - member Romain Charles who took a guitar with him into the cluster of brown and silver - coloured metal tubes which will be home until November 2011 .
After the news conference , the six crew disappeared , re-emerging an hour later by the entrance hatch to the mock spaceship , where they put on another high - spirited performance for the media .
Finally , blowing kisses and waving to wives , girlfriends and relatives , they walked up the steps and through the entrance hatch .
A solemn - faced official slowly closed and sealed it behind them .
So now reality bites for the six - member volunteer crew .
What will they be thinking as they sit inside their tin cans in north - west Moscow where outside the warm sun shines and the flowers blossom ?
There is no thrill of a blast - off and flight through space .
There are no windows from which to watch the Earth gradually shrink away .
And no anticipation of reaching a new world more than fifty million kilometres away .
Instead , silent inertia , stale air and tinned food .
And everywhere cameras watching their every move , looking out for signs of mental collapse .
They have just one thing to cling on to , that they are playing their part in the history of space exploration .
That their success in this experiment will mean a human flight to Mars is a step closer .
And space experts already believe the first flight could be just 25 years away or even less if there is the political and economic will from countries with advanced space programmes .

New Canadian research into 500 million - year - old carnivore fossils has revealed an early ancestor of modern - day squids and octopuses , solving the mystery surrounding a previously unclassifiable creature .
" This is significant because it means that primitive cephalopods were around much earlier than we thought , and offers a reinterpretation of the long - held origins of this important group of marine animals , " Martin Smith , University of Toronto and Royal Ontario Museum paleontology PhD student , said in a release .
Quirks & Quarks Listen to Bob McDonald 's interview with study co-author Martin Smith from the University of Toronto , from the May 29th edition of Quirks & Quarks .
Smith and University of Toronto and Royal Ontario Museum paleontologist Jean- Bernard Caron published their findings in Wednesday 's peer - reviewed journal Nature .
Up until the mid 1970s , paleontologists only had one fossilized Nectocaris pteryx to work with , but it was not a good enough specimen to classify the animal as being a precursor to a specific sea creature .
Over the course of the past three decades , scientists have discovered 91 new Nectocaris pteryx fossils at the Burgess Shale Formation in the Canadian Rockies , one of the world 's most famous fossil sites .
A joint study of these two - to five - centimeter - long fossils by university and museum researchers shows that Nectocaris was kite - shaped and flattened from top to bottom .
It had large , stalked eyes and a long pair of grasping tentacles , which the researchers believe helped it capture prey .
" Fossils like Nectocaris help us to map out how the groups alive today might be related , and how they evolved , " said Smith .
" This tells us something about how biodiversity originated in the past , and helps us to understand the rich tapestry of life today . "
Yesterday , a coalition of House Dem women , led by Nancy Pelosi , tried to get the Senate to do the right thing .
They failed yesterday , but they are n't done .
In an interview with HuffPo's Arthur Delaney , Pelosi said the task remains urgent .
But her suggestion that the Congress consider doing it with offsets might not go over well in the Senate .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) told HuffPost on Friday that reauthorizing the benefits remains an urgent task , raising the possibility that Democrats might agree to offset the cost of the spending .
" It really has to happen , " said Pelosi of reauthorizing extended benefits .
" One of the debates that goes on now -- which I completely resist , but it 's one of the debates going on -- is at the end of the day , these people have to have their benefits , and should we begin paying for unemployment benefits ? "
..... While Republicans and conservative Democrats like Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - Neb. ) have insisted that the entire bill be offset , Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) have refused to cave so far .
Historically , extended unemployment benefits in times of high unemployment are always classified as " emergency " spending , so it 's not offset .
" It 's a completely bad idea because the stimulative effect that you get from putting money down is all set on either reducing something else or raising taxes , " said Pelosi .
" So the double purpose of it , which is to reduce the needs of the unemployed and the stimulative effect , are canceled out . "
Jobless benefits have been treated by every Congress and every administration since the program began as emergency spending , and as Debbie Stabenow said in a conference call with reporters today , " If 15 million people out of work is n't an emergency , I do n't know what is . "
The offsets Republicans have been pushing for the hardest are the most potentially damaging to any hope of further economic growth .
They want to raid what 's left of the already - appropriated stimulus funds to pay jobless benefits , a suggestion at cross- purposes , since the stimulus money is supposed to be creating the jobs to get these folks working again .
Not that lapses in logic have ever bothered Republicans .
This year , the Supreme Court will decide if California 's law banning the sale of violent games to kids is constitutional .
Too bad for us that retired justice Sandra Day O'Connor is n't still on the bench .
In an interview on Good Morning America Wednesday , O'Connor extolled the virtues of videogames as a teaching tool for young kids .
" They 're fabulous , " she told news anchor George Stephanopoulos .
" We 've had tests done .
And the students go up 20 percent in their knowledge by playing those games .
It 's just incredible . "
O'Connor spoke Wednesday at the Games for Change festival in New York .
On Good Morning America , the retired justice bemoaned the decline in civics and history teaching in public schools because of the No Child Left Behind Program and applauded games like Do I Have A Right ?
that aimed to teach students about government in a fun , accessible way .
" We know also from the Annenberg polls that youngsters in middle school level – sixth , seventh , eighth grade – spend , on the average , 40 hours a week in front of a screen , " she said .
" If we can capture just part of that time , a little bit of it , to get 'em in front of a computer screen to play these games , they 're going to learn . "
Sandra Day O'Connor was the first female member of the U.S. Supreme Court .

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Responsible people are fearful .
Those who save for the future increasingly understand that they are the targets of the predatory class .
They see the United States and most other governments running record deficits , and most implicitly understand that this will not come to a good end .
Greece and California are already serving as the canaries in the coal mine .
The Federal Reserve is holding short - term interest rates below the rate of inflation , so those who have interest - bearing savings accounts or certificates of deposit are seeing their savings erode , while at the same time , the Obama administration and Congress are increasing tax rates on interest , dividends and capital gains .
Governments are expropriating ( stealing ) people ’s savings .
The U.S. and most other governments of the world are issuing debt at such a rapid rate and at such high levels , with no real plans to reverse such behavior , that it is almost a certainty they will not pay back what they owe .
How will they avoid paying back the money ?
Well , there is always the old , tried - and - true way of inflation , whereby the central bank ( the Federal Reserve in the United States ) prints so much money as to erode the value of the money - so the government ends up paying ( in real value ) only cents on each dollar it borrowed .
( I actually own a bank note for “ one hundred trillion dollars ” issued by the central bank of Zimbabwe in 2008 .
The note is next to worthless except as a collector ’s item .
The issuance of so much currency is how the government of Zimbabwe managed to expropriate all of the savings of its citizens . )
Politicians in developed countries have found that their citizens often get upset when inflation reaches high levels and then tend to vote out the culprits .
You may recall that the less - than - astute Jimmy Carter lost his re-election campaign , in part , because inflation at one point reached 14 percent and the prime interest rate hit 21 percent .
An insightful European banker suggested to me over breakfast a couple of weeks ago that the European political class would use selective expropriation , rather than inflation , to avoid paying back all of the debt .
The way this would be done would be that the political leaders would announce they would only pay back those bonds with full interest that were held by labor unions and other “ politically correct ” interest groups but not the bonds held by “ greedy bankers ” and rich people .
Maturities would be extended and promised interest rates lowered - effectively reducing the value of the bonds .
My initial reaction was that , yes , such a selective expropriation might work in Europe , but not in the United States .
As I thought more about it , however , looked at what was happening and heard President Obama ’s rhetoric attacking “ greedy ” bankers and insurance companies , I began to think that not only was my European friend right about Europe , but his scenario was equally valid here .
Look at the evidence .
Savings by individuals and businesses and their productive investment ( what economists call capital formation ) are necessary for an economy to grow because that is where the money comes from to build new factories , buy equipment , engage in research and development , and fund new jobs .
Rapidly growing economies require high levels of investment .
Stagnant and declining economies do not .
When governments run high deficits , they take away the capital that could be used to create economic growth and new jobs .
In the United States , government has not taken more than 15 percent of gross savings in any of the recessions in the past 30 years - up to this one ( and actually has contributed to gross savings in some years when the surpluses of state and local governments are included ) .
However , now the government is taking almost 40 percent of the gross savings ( see chart ) , and at the same time , the personal savings rate has been falling again for the past year .
The Obama administration ’s budget ( as re-estimated by the Congressional Budget Office ) shows budget deficits in the trillion - dollar range for each of the next 10 years , meaning that the government debt as a share of gross domestic product will continue to rise , leaving less saving for the productive private economy and job creation .
The savings rate is likely to continue to fall because :
c The maximum federal tax on interest , annuities , royalties , etc. is slated to rise a whopping 24 percent .
c The maximum federal tax rate on dividends is slated to rise an obscene 189 percent ( from 15 percent to 43.4 percent ) .
c The maximum tax rate on capital gains will rise by a destructive 59 percent .
( These coming tax increases already are in law , courtesy of the just - passed health care bill , and the expiration of the George W. Bush tax - rate cuts at the end of this year ) .
These tax - rate increases understate the real tax increase under way because many state governments also are increasing tax rates on interest , dividends and capital gains .
In addition , as inflation rises , the real tax on capital , and particularly capital gains , rises very rapidly because the Internal Revenue Service unconstitutionally taxes people on imaginary income ( that is , inflation ) in addition to real gains - causing an effective real tax rate , which often can exceed 100 percent .
Most of the people targeted to pay these increased tax rates are not only upper income , but also astute .
Common sense and the empirical and theoretical evidence show that people will not pay such tax rates .
They can avoid the tax by consuming , rather than saving , by buying nonproductive assets - e.g. gold , rare automobiles , etc. , or by moving to more tax - friendly environments .
The political class , particularly in Washington and Europe , is engaged in the most massive act of wealth destruction since World War II .
As in World War II , there will be hundreds of millions of innocent victims who will suffer real misery .
After the collapse , will there be an international tribunal to try those who destroyed the jobs , savings and hopes of millions of their fellow citizens ?
We can only hope .

A picture of the Abell Cluster taken using the Hubble Space Telescope shows the diversity in galaxy types , including a giant elliptical galaxy at the center of the cluster , a beautiful spiral in the bottom right - hand corner and many smaller systems displaying a wide range of shapes , sizes and colors .
A computer algorithm modeled after the human brain haslearned how to recognize different galaxy types ranging from spiral toelliptical , and can now help flesh - and - blood stargazers with the daunting taskof classifying billions of galaxies .
The machine - learning codes have proven reliable enough toagree with human classifications of galaxies90 percent of the time , according to scientists at University College Londonand the University of Cambridge in the UK .
That should help astronomers keep up with a deluge of galaxyimagery from observational projects such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Galaxy Zoo .
The billions of galaxies in the knownuniverse include a widerange of shapes such as spiral , elliptical , barred and irregular .
" Next generation telescopes now under construction willimage hundreds of millions and even billions of galaxies over the comingdecade , " said Manda Banerji , an astronomer at the University of Cambridge .
"
The numbers are overwhelming and every image cannot viably be studied bythe human eye . "
Classifying the types of galaxies represents the first steptoward understanding the origin and evolution of galaxies .
More than 250,000 people have helped astronomers classify 60 million galaxies in the online Galaxy Zoo project .
Astronomers then used the Galaxy Zoo classifications to train their computer algorithm , known as anartificial neural network , as part of the process for learning to recognizegalaxy types .
The artificial neural network can analyze the complexrelationships between different variables such as shape , size and color ofastrophysical objects , and then come up with the appropriate galaxy type .
Thatprocess mimics the biological neural network found in living creatures .
Astronomers first trained the computer algorithm on 75,000 astrophysical objects from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey included in the GalaxyZoo project , before testing its abilities in classifying 1 million objects .
They also fiddled with the weighted parameters that the algorithm used so thatthey could finally achieve the 90 percent success rate .
Some limitations exist .
For instance , the algorithm had aproblem with misclassifying red spirals and blue ellipticals , because too fewexamples of those objects exist for the algorithm to get a good read .
The study , published in the journal Monthly Notices ofthe Royal Astronomical Society , also did not include intermediary objectssuch as galaxymergers that defy easy classification .
Still , even a limited auto - classification method shouldprove useful for astronomers drowning in galaxy imagery and data .
One recentcelestial census even found that astronomers had been undercounting the numberof distant galaxies by about 90 percent .
" While human eyes are very efficient in recognizingpatterns , clever computational techniques that can reproduce this behavior areessential as we begin to push the boundaries of our observable Universe anddetect more distant galaxies , " said Ofer Lahav , an astrophysicist at the University College London .
" This study is an important step in thatdirection . "
President Obama ’s reluctance to comment in any but the most vague terms of the massacre of 19 aid workers by Israeli commandos late Sunday night has left many wondering exactly where the US government will fall on an issue which has been blanketly condemned by virtually every government in the civilized world and virtually every government outside the civilized world .
But the lack of White House comment has opened the door for Congressmen to stake out public positions on the matter and , perhaps predictably , those that have commented have universally praised the killings .
Rep. Gary Ackerman , the House Foreign Affairs chair , praised the raid , saying he supported Israel ’s decision to attack the ship and the decision of the commandos to use deadly force against the aid workers , who he said were “ brutally attacking ” them .
He added that the whole matter was secretly Hamas ’ fault .
Several of the Congressmen singled out the United Nations for condemnation , claiming that criticizing the massacre was a “ double standard ” and demanding that President Obama use veto power to prevent any action being taken against Israel for it .
President Obama has called for an Israeli-led “ investigation ” into the lead up to the massacre , but has stopped short of criticizing the killings in any specific way .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton advised people to be “ careful ” in their responses .

For the last two years , unlimited data plans have given app - hungry smartphone users an all - you - can - eat buffet .
But will customers react to AT&T ’s new , limited menu by simply eating less ?
Some software developers fear they will , and if that happens , the caps on data use that AT&T has imposed could also make consumers lose their appetite for the latest innovations .
Some developers worry that customers will be reluctant to download and use the most bandwidth - intensive apps and that developers will cut back on innovative new features that would push customers over the new limits .
“ What created this lively app world we are in was the iPhone on one hand , and unlimited data plans on the other , ” said Noam Bardin , chief executive of Waze , which offers turn - by - turn driving directions .
“ If people start thinking about how big a file is , or how fast an application is refreshing , that will be a huge inhibitor . ”
New features on phones encourage more data use and vice versa .
The next version of the iPhone , set to debut on Monday at Apple ’s Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco , will include a second , front - facing video camera , according to leaked reports .
That could conceivably allow developers like Skype to offer face - to - face video calls from phones  a service that is much more data - intensive .

I ’ve been thinking a lot about my health lately .
It ’s been nearly five months since my second son was born , and I ’m still carrying around a few of those extra baby pounds .
The added responsibilities of another child have also given me something of an excuse to exercise less .
To get myself back into top form ( if I was ever in top form … ) , I know I need to choose healthier foods , exercise more , and set goals .
This got me thinking about our writing health .
What steps must we take to keep our writing healthy and fit ?
There are 5 things I believe writers should strive to do daily .
Think of them as writers ’ vitamins : you wo n’t die if you do n’t get them , but over time , the right dose will help improve your overall writing ability and efficiency .
1. Write
It may sound obvious , but the best way to improve your writing is to practice as much as possible .
The thing that ’s made the most difference to the quality of my writing is committing to a regular schedule .
You need n’t work on the same piece of writing every day .
Try alternating between a novel , short - story , non-fiction article , blog post or poetry .
If you like to take a day off each week ( for me it ’s Sunday ) , you can use that day to reflect on the rest of your week , and perhaps record your thoughts in a journal .
2. Read
Whether it ’s a book , magazine , writing manual or blog , take some time out of each day to read .
Not only is it relaxing , but you ’ll learn something new about the craft of writing every time you do it .
I like to associate a certain time of day with reading so it becomes a habit .
For me , that ’s just before I go to sleep at night .
I also like to sign out several books from the library at once so that when I do n’t feel like reading one , I have several back - ups to choose from .
3. Analyze
I originally subtitled this section “ Watch , ” but I felt that did n’t do it justice .
When we writers watch television , we are n’t just watching : we ’re analyzing .
We use it as an opportunity for inspiration , critical thinking , and story deconstruction .
But this is one vitamin on which you do n’t want to overdose .
Be selective with what you watch ( i.e. choose series from which you can learn something ) , keep your brain switched on , and use the experience to your own benefit .
Check out Larry Brooks ’ story deconstruction series on the film Shutter Island for a great example of how to improve your writing by watching movies .
4. Plan
As with anything , planning ahead is a good way to keep yourself motivated and on track .
Before you go to bed each night , jot down your game plan for the following day .
What are your goals for the next twenty - four hours ?
How will you achieve them ?
You can also take time each day to mentally plan what you ’ll write at your next session –for example , the next scene in your novel or the next article for your blog .
You ’re more likely to be successful if you know where you ’re going , as opposed to simply writing whatever , whenever you feel like it .
5. Review
I recommend reviewing your performance at the end of every day , so you can see whether or not you ’re achieving your short - term goals .
It ’s all too easy to let things slide for a day , maybe two .
Soon a week has passed , and your productivity level has taken a nosedive .
Reviewing your performance can help you identify what ’s keeping you from progressing , so you can overcome those obstacles before things get away from you .
On the other hand , if you ’re always achieving your daily goals without fail , maybe you ’re setting your level too low .
In that case .
challenge yourself to an added goal each day .
Your Writing Health
Are you getting enough of your daily writing vitamins ?
The more consistently you write , read , analyze , plan and review , the healthier your writing becomes .
Of course , everyone needs a day off , so do n’t feel guilty about taking time to recharge your batteries .
What things do you think writers should aim for every day ?
Now that my writing ’s well - being looks a little brighter , must be getting back to those extra pounds …

GIVING aboriginal people the right to own property on reserves could help cure the abject poverty that plagues First Nations , a top Tory thinker and a former chief said Tuesday .
Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs Grand Chief Ron Evans said he 's open to the idea , if Ottawa makes good on long - standing treaty obligations to share resource revenue with First Nations .
Tom Flanagan , a University of Calgary politics professor and Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's former chief of staff , said lack of property rights is one root of the poverty that grips remote reserves with little economic development , poor housing and few jobs .
Bands do n't even have legal title to their reserves .
Those lands are held in trust by the Crown , so any project on a reserve such as a casino or a golf course needs the approval of the Indian Affairs minister , a slow and painful bureaucratic process that deters investors .
It takes four to six times longer to develop a business project on a reserve and costs four to six times more , according to Flanagan 's research team .
Reserve residents do n't own the land or the homes in which they live .
Instead , they have temporary certificates of possession or leaseholds that often restrict who a holder can transfer to .
First Nations can't do what non-aboriginal people do every day -- buy a home , build up equity , sell it for a profit or hand it down to children .
That essentially kills the resale market and the will of private developers to build homes , meaning band members must always rely on Ottawa for housing funding .
" We have to imagine a world where we do n't have to ask the minister to build a home for us , " said Manny Jules , a former chief from Kamloops , B.C. , and a longtime advocate of property reform .
The idea floated Tuesday at a luncheon put on by the right - leaning Frontier Centre for Public Policy is one that interests AMC Grand Chief Ron Evans .
" We want to arrive at that place as well , but we have an obligation to those who did their best to ensure we do n't lose our rights , our livelihoods , " he said .
That means agreements with government to share resources -- everything from oil to water to timber -- on traditional First Nations land .
Those agreements would let bands move more quickly toward self - government , with private property rights as part of that equation .
Jules said he will spend the rest of the year consulting with bands across Canada and hopes to begin drafting a legislative proposal to government by this time next year .
He said any bill would be voluntary -- bands could opt in and would retain rights and funding under the Indian Act .

Bundesversammlung Wulff wird im dritten Wahlgang Präsident
Schwarz - Gelb ist knapp an der Katastrophe vorbeigeschrammt :
Im dritten Wahlgang wurde Christian Wulff zum neuen Bundespräsidenten gewählt , sogar mit absoluter Mehrheit .
Doch an dem Wahlkrimi wird die Koalition noch lange zu leiden haben - es könnte der Anfang vom Ende für Merkels Regierung sein .
For those of you counting down to the robot uprising , you may be interested in the latest news from engineers at the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich .
They 've created autonomous robots that randomly dock with each other on the ground and then rise into the air– no human intervention required .
The little hexagonal modules that make up the flying drone are completely self - sufficient .
In the context of a robot army , that means the airborne robot could be indestructible .
Because the magnetically connected ' bots easily break away from each other , they could blow apart under attack , and then reassemble themselves on the ground , good as new .
For now , Raymond Oung , one of the lead researchers , envisions the self - controlled ' bots more as a teaching tool for describing control systems than a tool of war .
Once the modules meet up on the ground , the way they propel themselves into the air and stay there is is a dynamic demonstration of how a servo system works .
Communicating via infrared sensors - like the kind in your TV remote - the ' bots quickly adapt to the changing conditions of flight .
Each module has its own attitude sensor , and broadcasts its location to others in the collective .
That way , if the aircraft starts tilting towards the right , the modules on the right side generate more thrust to compensate .
Add a dash of autonomous walking robots to these shape - shifting flyers , and you 've almost got an airborne T - 1000 .
Okay , okay , they 're not quite there yet .
So far , the Swiss robotics team has only flown four of the self - assembling ' bots as one .
But Raymond Oung , one of the lead researchers , says there 's virtually " no upper limit on the number of modules " you could fly .
By the end of the summer , they hope to demonstrate a swarm of twelve .
After that , who knows .
It 's only a matter of time ...

AURORA , Colo .
— An Aurora coffee shop whose bikini - clad baristas prompted a boycott has closed its doors .
Perky Cups was evicted for failing to pay rent and violating terms of the lease , including operating outside the shop ’s premises .
Owner Jason Bernal sent women wearing bikinis onto city streets to advertise the shop .
That prompted Aurora City Councilwoman Molly Markert and at least 30 other people to sign a petition calling for a boycott of the shop and other businesses in the same shopping center .
Bernal said he ’s relieved the shop has closed because of problems he ’s had with the landlord .
He plans to open a new location in the coming weeks .
Landlord Greg Coleman could n’t say how much money Bernal owed because their dispute is now in court .

Article by Yahya Snow refuting the Skeptics Annotated Quran team ( Skeptics Annotated Bible )
So the SkepticsAnnotatedBible group have produced a piece on the Quran ( SkepticsAnnotatedQuran ) .
They put forward 45 scientific / historical issues they have with the Quran .
They are very brief so this article will answer their issues as briefly as possible .
Generally much of their material is repetitive and the themes of their material are ignorance and ridicule .
These answers show the sceptics were being unreasonable and even ignorant in bringing these forty five points up .
1. And He taught Adam all the names . ”
Allah taught Adam all the names of the plants and animals , which must have taken a while since there are 1.7 million species that are known today , with probably another 10 million or so that are yet to be discovered .
And this only includes those that are alive today .
If extinct species are included ( ~99 % ) , then Allah must have taught Adam a billion or so names .
2:31
The sceptics are being flippant and using manipulative exaggeration .
They say it must have taken a long time ; not so , if they read Tafsir Al - Jalalayn they would note that the belief is that Allah taught Adam the names by “ placing knowledge of them into his heart ” .
So if the sceptics thought a little laterally ( or just read the Tafsir ) they would not have made the claim of taking a lot of time .
2. Humans created from a single man .
4 : 1
Well , if this sceptical team had read the verse in full they will note the Quran elaborates on this point in the same verse .
It teaches that Adam was created first and from him Eve was created and then the rest of humanity come through the procreation of Adam and Eve .
Thus it is reasonable to say that humans were created from a single man as Adam was the first and then Eve was created from Adam and then through procreation the rest of humanity came .
So Adam was a starting point and the Quran is completely correct .
If they had read the verse in its entirety they would have understood the point about the “ single person ” .
Sure , the sceptics may not agree with creationism but this does not make it incorrect .
The question is why did they not bother to read the whole verse for a fuller explanation ?
3 . The Quran repeats the silly story about Cain and Abel ( though they are unnamed in the Quran ) .
5:27-31
The sceptics attack the story via ridicule but they do not even attempt to disprove it .
I ’m not sure why they included this reference in their list as they do n’t even try to disprove it .
As for story of the first murder ; of course during the history of humanization there will be a human who was the first to commit the crime of murder and you would not be surprised if God told people through His Book about this story .
If you read the passage all the way to verse 32 you realise that the story is told and man is taught that murder is a huge crime .
The sceptics show their anti-religion bigotry here .
They ridicule this story as “ silly ” yet they cannot disprove it .
The only reason they ridicule it is because they are naturalists .
Naturalists are people who do not believe in the supernatural .
Again , despite their ridicule , they cannot disprove this story .
For clarification and thoroughness their reference to the story being repeated is due to the fact it is also in the Bible .
It is still wise to point out the childish nature in which they dismiss a story they cannot disprove .
4. Homosexual acts are condemned as unnatural .
( Will ye commit abomination such as no creature ever did before you ? )
But , in fact , such acts are common in many other species .
7:80 - 81
The sceptics clearly misrepresent the verses .
The verses dos not teach homosexuality to be “ unnatural ” .
Please go back and read the verses again rather than misrepresenting them .
From these verses we learn that the people of Lot are the first ones from humanity to commit such deeds , we learn it is seen as a sin .
This is confirmed by the Quranic experts as “ the commentators say that first they started this evil act ” [ 1 ]
The sceptics should be a little more scholarly rather than jumping in and making incorrect attributions to the Quran .
In any case , even if a book did claim homosexuality to be unnatural , there is no firm proof to disprove this “ unnatural ” claim ; if the sceptics were intellectually honest they would have noted this .
However , it is wise to reiterate the fact that these Quranic verses ( 7:80 - 81 ) do not claim homosexuality to be unnatural but do we do learn from these verses that it is a sin .
The Quran is completely correct , it is the sceptics who are mistaken .

5. Crucifixion is a Roman punishment , unknown in Egypt at the time this story supposedly occurred .
7:124
Crucifixion was a simple method and hardly required rocket science for a society to come up with crucifixion .
Have the sceptics got any evidence to show that it was impossible for Egyptians to crucify individuals ?
No , of course they have not .
They simply made this claim up with no supporting evidence .
Hardly scholarly !
To correct the sceptics ; crucifixion is thought to have originated from Persia and it was also used in Egyptian , Carthaginian , Seleucid , Assyrian and other civilisations .
Smith ’s Bible Dictionary confirms that the Egyptians did use crucifixion [ 1 ] .
Thus the Quran is completely correct but the sceptics clearly did not research the history of crucifixion , they simply made a caim up without any supporting knowledge .
See :
[ 1 ]
http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Quran/Contrad/External/crucify.html
6 . When Allah revealed himself to Moses , the mountain ( Mt. Sinai ? ) came crashing down .
7:143
Actually the sceptics lack comprehension skills here , Allah revealed Him to a mountain which Moses was looking upon , this mountain collapsed to dust .
There is no information given concerning the name of the mountain .
I ’m not too sure why they included this point in their list , it certainly does not disprove anything concerning the Quran .
Perhaps they included it because it seems implausible to the sceptics due to the fact that they disbelieve in supernatural occurrences .
Again , why include this in your list when you do not even attempt to disprove it ?
Is it because you want your list to look lengthy ?
7. Humans created from a single man .
7:189
Previously discussed in point 2 concerning 4:1 . ( Please view )
8 . “ They fold up their breasts that they may hide ( their thoughts ) from Him . ”
Allah thinks ( in his heart ) that humans have their brains in their breasts .
11:5
It is obviously a figure of speech which we still use today .
Have you not heard somebody ask “ tell me what is in your heart ” .
It is not taken literally , it simply represents the innermost feelings / thoughts / secrets .
The commentary on this verse also shows the reference to “ the breasts ” is concerning the “ innermost secrets ” .
The Quran is not saying people have brains in their hearts .
The sceptics must take us for fools if they think people cannot see it is a figure of speech .
The Quran is not in error but the sceptics are being unreasonable .
9 . Joseph saw in a dream eleven planets .
Does this mean that according to the Quran there are eleven planets in our solar system ?
12:4
No , seeing eleven planets in a dream does not mean there are eleven planets in our solar system .
If an individual sees five suns in his dream does this mean he is claiming there to be five suns in our solar system ?
Of course not .
The sceptics lose all sense of logic here .
The Quran simply relays Joseph telling his father about his dream .
The Quran is not making a claim of eleven planets in our solar system .
The sceptics seem to have lost there ability to reason .
It is also worth noting that the word used represents stars ( it is translated as stars rather than planets in the Hilali / Khan translation ) .
Either way ; the Quran is not claiming there are eleven planets or stars in our solar system .
It simply tells you of what Joseph told his father .
Nobody , intellectually honest , would believe the sceptics once they read the verse for themselves .
To be fair to the sceptics , they too do not claim this , they just ask the question .
Well they got the answer here , the answer is no .
Now they can remove this point from their list too .
10 . “ The sun … runneth unto an appointed term .
” The sun ( according to the Quran ) orbits the earth .
13:2
The Quran does not claim the sun orbits the earth .
This has already been discussed in detail for point 23 ( please view )
It simply tells us that the sun and the moon run courses ( i.e. have orbits ) BUT the Quranic verse does not say what the sun orbits .
The sceptics add this bit in their when they claim “ it orbits the earth ” .
This is a lie on their part .
Read the verse for yourselves and see their deception .
Nowhere does it say the sun runs its course around the earth .
The sceptics dishonestly made this up !
Now the question is does the sun run a course ( i.e. does it have an orbit ) ?
Yes the sun has an orbit .
It orbits around the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy .
So the Quran is correct in teaching us that the sun runs a course ( i.e. has an orbit ) .
This is scientifically accurate . [ 1 ]
The problem is ; the sceptics added their own bit into the verse by claiming it orbits around the earth .
They should be more factual and honest in the future .
Did they think we would not even bother to read the verse ?

11 . “ He … spread out the earth .
” Sounds like a flat earth to me .
13:3
Again , the earth ( ground ) being spread over the lava so we can travel over it without being harmed shows that this Quranic verse is true .
It does not mean it is flat .
It is also correct to say Allah spread out the earthen the sense of vastnesses .
Again spreading out does not mean flat .
Even the Encyclopaedia at FreeDictionary uses the term “ spread over ” concerning the lava covering a wide distance [ 1 ] .
Thus we realise it is a term that refers to vastness and not a term which refers to flatness .
Would the sceptics claim that the Encyclopaedia people were claiming a flat earth ?
Of course not , therefore it would be equally unfair to claim that the Quran is teaching a flat earth !
The sceptics lose their sense of comprehension when they speak about the Quran , if they were reasonable they would realise they are twisting things in order to support their anti-religion agenda .
This is not honest on their part !
It does not refer to a flat earth as the early expert in the Quran ( Ibn Tamymiyah ) did not believe in a flat earth , in fact he believed in a spherical earth , thus he confirms NO Quranic verse teaches us the earth is flat .

12 “ And the earth have We spread out . ”
The earth is flat according to the Quran .
15:19
Again , the earth ( ground ) being spread out over the lava so we can travel over it without being harmed shows that this Quranic verse is true .
It does not mean it is flat .
It is also correct to say Allah spread out the earth in the sense of vastnesses .
Again spreading out does not mean flat .
Even the Encyclopaedia at FreeDictionary uses the term “ spread over ” concerning the lava covering a wide distance [ 1 ] .
Thus we realise it is a term that refers to vastness and not a term which refers to flatness .
Would the sceptics claim that the Encyclopaedia people were claiming a flat earth ?

13 And thy Lord inspired the bee , saying … eat of all fruits .
” Allah told bees to eat from all fruits , but decided to eat nectar and pollen instead .
16:68-68
The sceptics must take us for fools if they want us to believe Arabs at the time of the Prophet ( and even after ) thought bees ate all fruit such as apples , bananas , oranges etc .
Regarding the “ eat of all fruits ” , Zawadi says “ The better translation is “ eat from the fruits ” and not “ eat of all the fruits ” .
Surprisingly , only Palmer and Khalifa ( the deviant ) got it correct .
In Arabic the word min means from ” [ 1 ] .
Thus we realise if the Quran is translated this way ( two translated did translate it this way ) it makes more sense to the English speaking audience .
The sceptics did not view all the translations they ran with what suited their agenda .
However , even if we use the sceptic ’s translation it still does not disprove the Quran :
It must be said that we humans even use figures of speech such as the one used in this verse ( eat of all fruit ) .
If I tell a child to “ eat from everything in this restaurant ” and place him in a restaurant he will eat from the variety of food at his disposal , he will not eat the furniture , people or decorations ( i.e. he will only eat from what is edible by human beings and will decide what to eat for him / herself ) .
Likewise the bee will only choose from what is edible for a bee from “ all fruit ” ( i.e. it will only eat from fruit / produce which contains nectar and / or pollen .
It is also useful to note that the Arabic word used ( thamarat ) does not refer to fruits such as apples , pears bananas etc .
This type of fruit has a separate word ( fakiha ) .
The context also confirms this .
The sceptics did not realise this .
Thus in this context the word ( thamarat ) refers to the fruit / produce from flowers rather than regular fruit ( fakiha ) that humans eat .
Most flowers have nectar ( grasses do not ) .
So through the context we realise that “ eat of all fruits ” refers to eat from all plants containing nectar and / or pollen ( i.e. any plant that contains bee food the bee can eat from it ) .
Nectar and pollen are “ fruits ” / produces from flowers / plants , thus the Quran is 100 % accurate and the sceptics are being unreasonable again .
The verse ( 16:69 ) is not ordering the bees to eat all fruit , the understanding gained from the verse is quite simple ;
God simply inspires the bees to eat from a variety of flowers which contain fruit ( nectar ) which the bee can derive nutrition from ( eat of all fruits , thamarat ) .
This is actually scientifically accurate because bees do travel to a variety of flowers for food , in doing so the bees partake in cross pollination .
Through this cross pollination , by the bees , we get crops , nuts , fruit and vegetables which are for human consumption .
Therefore due to God inspiring bees to eat from a variety of flowers / plants we ( humans ) get a benefit .
Perhaps , before God ’s inspiration , bees only ate from one or two plants and now due to the inspiration from God humans are benefiting .
This is a sign for those who think deeply .

14 The sun rises and sets at particular places on a flat earth .
At the westernmost point on earth , the sun sets in a muddy spring .
18:86 , 90
No , the Quran does not claim the sun sets in a muddy spring .
The sceptics clearly have not read the verse in question .
To a man mentioned in the Quran ( Dhul - Qarneyn ) the sun appears to be setting in a pool of water as “ he found it set in a spring of murky water ” .
Even the early commentator , Ibn Kathir , confirms this .
Thus the early Arabs did not even think this meant the sun enters a pool of water .
If the sceptics had read the verse they would have noticed “ he found ” it , thus this is a clear reference to whether was seeing and when you are looking into a pool of water it appears as though the sun is setting in the water .
Ibn Kathir confirms this too .
The Quran is not wrong but the sceptics are wrong for misreading the verse .
15 Most scholars consider Dhu’l - Qarneyn ( “ The Two - Horned Lord ” ) to be Alexander the Great , who is here presented as a devout Muslim .
18:83-98
“ Most scholars ” , which scholars ?
The first person ( to my knowledge ) to suggest Dhul - Qarneyn was Alexander the Great was Abdullah Yusuf Ali .
This was his opinion .
In fact there is a stronger opinion that Dhul - Qarneyn is Cyrus the Great .
Sceptics should note the opinion of a translator is hardly an accurate representation of the Quran .
The Quran does not even state the identity of Dhul Qarnayn .
So how can the Quran be wrong here ?
It can ’t !
If Yusuf Ali thinks it is Alexander the Great it does not mean the Quran is saying this .
DhulQarnayn simply means “ one with two horns ” ;
The Quran does not confirm who this man is .
The sceptics lost their sense of logic once again .
16 he Pharaoh threatens to crucify Hebrews on palm tress .
( But crucifixion was a Roman form of punishment that was unknown at the time . )
20:71
Again , this is a fanciful claim by the sceptics backed with no proof whatsoever ( it has already been discussed in point 5 ) .
We already know that crucifixion did occur in Egypt .
Somebody needs to tell the sceptics ; they are looking even sillier now .
17 he sun “ floats ” in an orbit around the earth .
21:33
No , the Quran does not claim the sun orbits the earth .
This has already been discussed in detail for point 23 ( please view )
Nowhere does it say the sun runs its course around the earth .
The sceptics dishonestly made this up !
It simply tells us that the sun and the moon run courses ( i.e. have orbits ) BUT the Quranic verse does not say what the sun orbits .
The sceptics add this bit in there when they claim it orbits “ around the earth ” .
This is a lie on their part .
Read the verse for yourselves and see their deception
The verse simply tells us that the sun and moon have an orbit .
It does not say it orbits the earth .
Read the verse !
We know the moon has an orbit but the question is does the sun have an orbit ?
Yes the sun has an orbit .
It orbits around the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy .
So the Quran is correct in teaching us that the sun runs a course ( i.e. has an orbit ) .
This is scientifically accurate [ 1 ] .
The problem is ; the sceptics added their own bit into the verse by claiming it orbits around the earth .
They should be more factual and honest in the future .
Did they think we would not even bother to read the verse ?
[ 1 ]
http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question18.html
18 The heavens and the earth were of one piece , then We parted them . ”
The sun , stars , and earth were joined together until Allah separated them ( about six thousand years ago ) .
21:30
The sceptics add their own addition here , the Quran does not teach this to have occurred 6000 years ago .
The sceptics are confusing the Quran for the Bible .
The Bible teaches the 6000 year claim whilst the Quran does not mention any time period .
I would ask the sceptics to be more scholarly and accurate here .
As for the heavens and the earth being one piece , yes , the Quran is correct on this .
It agrees with the Big Bang theory where the cosmos began from a single point , thus the earth and the heavens must have been a mono - block ( joined together as taught in the Quran ) during the early stage of the big bang .
Thus the Quran is in agreement with science , in fact this appears to be a scientific miracle in the Quran !
I also ask the sceptics to brush up on their science as well , it would save us all some time !
Also , it is interesting to note that they do not mention the rest of the verse because the rest of the verse contains another scientific accuracy ( miracle ) because Allah teaches that all living things were made from water and we know all living things are comprised of water !
19 Allah created all animals .
Some with no legs , some with two , and some with four .
( Most animals have six legs .
Did Allah forget about the insects ? )
24:45
Again , the sceptics must be taking us for fools if they expect us to believe that the early Arabs did not know how many legs insects had .
The sceptics are being condescending here .
In any case let us look at their claim .
The Quran ( 24:45 ) is simply telling us that Allah “ created every moving creature from water ” and “ of them there are some that creep on their bellies , and some that walk on two legs and some that walk on four ” .
[ Hilali / khan ]
Note the Quran does not put a limit on this , it uses the word “ some ” .
It simply tells you some animals have no legs , whilst some have two or four .
It does not claim that all living beings fit into these three categories ( no legs , two or four ) , the word “ some ” is used , thus it does not close the door on beings with six legs or any different number of legs .
The Quran is not denying insects or any creatures with a different number of legs , only the most unreasonable individual would make the claim of the sceptics based on that verse ( 24:45 )
An analogy ; if I say “ some people in London are from France , whilst some are from England and some are from America ” , does this mean I am claiming that there are no Chinese , Polish etc in London ?
Of course not , I simply mentioned three different nationalities living in London , I did not close the lid on other nationalities .
The same logic applies to the Quran , the sceptics should be more logical even when dealing with a thing which they hate ( religion ) .
The sceptic ’s lack of insight or bias is also highlighted by them skipping over the amazingly accurate scientific point in the same verse !
The verse teaches us that Allah created every moving creature from water .
This is absolutely correct , why did the sceptics fail to bring this to our attention ?
20 “ He sendeth down from the heaven mountains wherein is hail . ”
Hail comes from mountains .
24:43
The sceptics have got it wrong again !
The Quran is not claiming hail comes from mountains .
Once again the sceptics are taking us for fools if they believe people in 7th century Arabia thought hail came from mountains , surely Arabians who did not live next to mountains could tell this by simple observation .
Well , according to the sceptics , they could not .
The sceptics are being foolish and amateur .
Actually the verse confirms that hail comes from the sky as it states “ He sends down FROM THE SKY hail ” [ Hilali / Kahn ] .
This scuppers and disproves the sceptics claim .
Were they unable to comprehend a simple English translation of the Quran .
As for the “ mountains ” reference , it is explained through the commentary that this refers to the initial clouds holding the hail .
Hail is a result of suspended ice in the air and hail forms in cumulonimbus clouds ( which are like mountains ) .
So the Quran is super accurate and seems to bring forward something people could view as a scientific miracle !
21 The earth is fixed and does not move .
27:61
The sceptics misrepresent the verse .
The verse does not teach us that the Earth is fixed on a whole , in fact the verse mentions “ fixed abode ” , this is referring to the Earth being a fixed place to live in .
Some planets are gaseous so they are not fixed ( or firm ) abodes to live in , whilst the Earth is not gaseous ( the Earth is solid and firm ) , therefore is a fixed / firm abode to live in .
Remember the key word here is “ abode ” , the sceptics missed this .
The Hilali / Kahn translation clearly mentions this word .
It is also worth noting that the word for “ fixed ” represents “ firm ” too .
Is the Earth firm ?
Yes because it is solid not gaseous .
If they read various translations of the Quran they would have realised that the Quran is not talking about the Earth ’s rotation .
Yusuf Ali ’s translation reads “ made the Earth firm ” .
Therefore it is clear that this is not referring to the rotation of the Earth but the Earth geographically .
Is the Earth firm and a fixed abode ?
Yes !
It is not gaseous ( like some other planets ) therefore is firm .
Thus the Quran is correct and the sceptics were wrong again .
Shakir ’s translation reads “ made the Earth a resting place ” , yes the Earth is a resting place for humans and other creatures .
The reason why I bring this translation up is to further show that the verse is not denying the rotation of the Earth ; it is clearly not even referring to the rotation of the Earth , thus the sceptics are wrong again .
22 “ He hath subdued the sun and moon to service .
Each runneth unto an appointed term . ”
The sun orbits the earth .
35:13
No , the Quran does not claim the sun orbits the earth .
This has already been discussed in detail for point 23 ( please view )
It simply tells us that the sun and the moon “ each runs its course for a term appointed ” ( i.e. both have an orbit )
It simply tells us that the sun and the moon run courses ( i.e. have orbits ) BUT the Quranic verse does not say what the sun orbits .
The sceptics add this bit in their when they claim “ it orbits the earth ” .
This is a lie on their part .
Read the verse for yourselves and see their deception
We know the moon has an orbit but the question is does the sun run a course ( i.e. does it have an orbit ) ?
Yes the sun has an orbit .
It orbits around the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy .
So the Quran is correct in teaching us that the sun runs a course ( i.e. has an orbit ) .
This is scientifically accurate [ 1 ] .
How did the Author of the Quran know this ?
The problem is ; the sceptics added their own bit into the verse by claiming it orbits around the earth .
They should be more factual and honest in the future .
Did they think we would not even bother to read the verse ?
[ 1 ]
http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question18.html
23 “ The sun runneth on unto a resting - place for him . ” 36:38
Actually the Hilali / Khan translation states “ And the sun runs on its fixed course for a term ( appointed ) ” .
This translation does not mention a “ resting place ”
So the sun has a fixed course ?
Yes it does , it has an orbit ; it orbits around the centre of the Galaxy .
So we realise that the sun moves and is on a fixed course .
How did the Author of the Quran know this ?
As for “ for a term ( appointed ) ” well , we all believe that the sun will die one day .
Even the sceptics believe this , so this is the appointed term .
In simple words , Allah allows the sun to move on its course for a term ( a set time period ) and Allah will make it end one day .
I ’m not sure why the sceptics brought this up , did they not know that the sun does move on a course [ 1 ] ?
[ 1 ]
http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question18.html
24 It is not for the sun to overtake the moon , nor doth the night outstrip the day .
They float each in an orbit . ”
The sun and the moon orbit the earth .
( Well at least Allah and Mo are half right here ! ) 36:40
No , the Quran is not claiming the Sun and moon orbit the Earth .
The sceptics make this claim .
Did they read the verse ?
The verse does not claim anything such .
This has been discussed many times now and the sceptics are looking more and more embarrassed each time .
Nowhere does it say the sun and moon orbit the Earth .
It does state “ … They all float in an orbit ” ( “ they ” refers both the moon and the sun ) .
the sceptics are adding their own bits to the translation , how dishonest !
So you can see that the Quran does not claim the sun and the moon are orbiting the Earth .
The sceptics wrongly added this in there !
However one may ask , do the moon and sun float in an orbit ?
Yes they do .
They both have orbits .
We all know that the moon orbits around the Earth but many people do not know that the sun has an orbit too .
The sun orbits around the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy [ 1 ] .
So the Quran is correct in mentioning the fact that they both have an orbit .
The question is ; how did the Author of the Quran know that the sun had an orbit ?
[ 1 ]
http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question18.html
25 Jonah was swallowed by a fish .
37:142
The “ fish ” refers to the whale .
A whale is certainly big enough and able to swallow a human .
It is a story which is also mentioned in the Bible .
Again , we are not sure why the sceptics include this in their list .
26 “ We decked the nether heaven with lamps . ”
Allah put “ lamps ” in the lower heaven to serve as lights .
These are the stars that we see in the sky at night .
41:12
I ’m not sure what the problem is here .
The sceptics are being myopic .
Stars emit their own light so describing them as “ lamps ” is fair as lamps emit their own light too .
The Quran is perfectly accurate again .
How did the Author of the Quran know that stars emit their own light ?
27 “ And the earth have We spread out .
” The earth is flat according to the Quran .
50:7
Again , the earth ( ground ) being spread over the lava so we can travel over it without being harmed shows that this Quranic verse is true .
It does not mean it is flat .
It is also correct to say Allah spread out the earth in the sense of vastnesses .
Again spreading out does not mean flat .
Even the Encyclopaedia at FreeDictionary uses the term “ spread over ” concerning the lava covering a wide distance [ 1 ] .
Thus we realise it is a term that refers to vastness and not a term which refers to flatness .
Would the sceptics claim that the Encyclopaedia people were claiming a flat earth ?
Of course not , therefore it would be equally unfair to claim that the Quran is teaching a flat earth !
The sceptics lose their sense of comprehension when they speak about the Quran , if they were reasonable they would realise they are twisting things in order to support their anti-religion agenda .
This is not honest on their part !
It does not refer to a flat earth as the early expert in the Quran ( Ibn Tamymiyah ) did not believe in a flat earth , in fact he believed in a spherical earth , thus he confirms NO Quranic verse teaches us the earth is flat .

28 “ And the earth have We laid out , how gracious is the Spreader ( thereof ) ! ”
The earth is flat according to the Quran .
51:48
The earth ( ground ) being spread / laid out over the lava so we can travel over it without being harmed shows that this Quranic verse is true .
It does not mean it is flat .
It is also correct to say Allah spread out the earth in the sense of vastnesses .
Again spreading out does not mean flat .
Even the Encyclopaedia at FreeDictionary uses the term “ spread over ” concerning the lava covering a wide distance [ 1 ] .

29 All things
We have created by pairs . ”
This is not true .
Many bacteria , protists , fungi , and plants reproduce asexually .
51:49
Actually this verse is completely correct if you studied science and the verse you would not make the same mistake as the sceptics .
The verse mentions “ of everything ” so it is not simply referring to living beings therefore the verse is not concerning male - female pairs as “ everything ” includes stone , oxygen , water , metal etc. , obviously the aforementioned ( oxygen , water etc ) do not come in male - female pairs .
Thus the Quran is not speaking of biological pairs ( male - female ) .
So the question is asked , does everything created ( i.e. all matter ) come in pairs ?
Yes it does , matter and anti-matter .
So the Quran is completely correct to state this .
The sceptics need to be more careful when reading verses as they completely misunderstood the verse , hence their mistake

30 “ The moon was rent in twain . ”
Muhammad split the moon into two pieces .
Beat that one , Jesus !
54:1-2
Yes the Quran confirms this .
In fact ahadith sources do state Muhammed ( pbuh ) split the moon into two and this event was witnessed by a number of people [ 1 ] .
Ridiculing it is easy , proving it wrong is another thing , which the sceptics cannot do .
The ahadith sources saying this are strong and reliable and eye witnesses saw this event occur !
[ 1 ] Sahih al Bukhari 6/4867
31 “ Allah it is who hath created seven heavens , and of the earth the like thereof . ”
The “ seven heavens ” refer to the sun , moon , and five planets that were known at the time of Muhammad ( Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter , and Saturn ) .
The earth was flat and the “ seven “ heavens ” revolved around it .
65:12
This is utter speculation from the sceptics .
They have no proof for this claim whatsoever .
If you consult the Arabic , the word for heavens is the plural for skies / heavens ( samawat ) , it is not a word used for planets , stars or moons .
This word for heavens points to something above like the sky / atmosphere not planets or moons .
So the sceptics claim is scuppered by the Arabic .
The Arabic shows their claim to be false , it is not referring to planets , moons or suns but is referring to seven heavens .
That is all .
In fact if the sceptics had bothered to cross reference this with another verse in the Quran ( 71:15 - 16 ) which elaborates on the seven heavens they would not be looking so silly .
This verse tells us that the seven heavens are in layers “ one above another ” , so clearly the seven heavens do not refer to planets etc .
Thus the sceptics are completely wrong .
32 “ Who hath created seven heavens … Canst thou see any rifts ? ”
Allah asks Muhammed to examine the sky to see if it has any cracks .
67:3
This is pure ridicule on the part of the sceptics .
It is superficial nonsense from the sceptics .
Allah is putting forward a verse which people of deep thought ( not of ridicule ) can contemplate upon .
Nobody is expecting to find any rifts when they look into the heavens but when they do look up they realise the beauty and precision of what Allah created , the one who thinks deeper will ponder upon how beautiful the Creator of such splendour and beauty must be .
33 Allah made the stars as missiles to throw at devils .
67:5
Again , can the sceptics disprove this ?
No they cannot , they have not even Shayateen ( devils ) so how can they claim stars are not used to drive away devils ?
Scientifically this actually makes sense as stars do MOVE and some even move as fast as 500 kilometres per second [ 1 ] .
Now that is certainly quick enough to drive away devils .
The sceptics need to think deeper and brush up on their science , stars are not fixed structures , they do actually move and they move very rapidly therefore they can function as objects / missiles to drive away devils to protect God ’s creatures !

34 At the end of the world the earth with the mountains will be lifted up and crushed with one crash .
69:14
I ’m not sure why the sceptics include this verse either .
It seems like they have a desire to make fun and ridicule without thinking things through rationally .
Even according to science our earth will have an end , thus the mountains and the earth will be destroyed one day .
So how can a sceptic disagree with the Quran ?
Can the sceptics disprove the verse ?
No , of course not , the sceptic simply wants to make fun because he / she does not believe in religion and is anti-religion .
This position of theirs takes them to the path of the unreasonable .
Whilst the Quran remains completely accurate .
35 “ And hath made the moon a light ” This verse implies that the moon produces its own light , rather than reflecting light from the sun .
71:16
The sceptics are wrong again , spectacularly wrong !
Actually , the Arabic word used does show that the moon has reflected light rather than its own source of light .
The sceptics expose their ignorance here , the Quran is completely correct and the question must be asked ; how did the Author of the Quran know that the moon was reflected light ?
This is confirmed by Dr Zakir Naik here :
http://www.answering-christianity.com/ahmed_eldin/light_of_moon.htm
36 “ Have We not made the earth an expanse , And the high hills bulwarks ? ”
The earth is flat according to the Quran .
78:6-7
No , the Quran is not claiming the Earth to be flat .
“ An expanse ” does not mean flat .
Do the sceptics not know this ?
Expanse means “ A wide and open extent , as of surface , land , or sky . ”
The Earth is wide and open .
Even fields or open land masses are described as expanses ,
Thus it is reasonable to describe the earth as an expanse and it does not mean flat !
The sceptics need to brush up on their English .
However , Hilali / Khan translate the Arabic word ( mihada ) as “ a bed ” .
This further shows the Arabic word used does not mean flat , therefore we can safely say Allah was not claiming the earth to be flat .
Note : the word used does not represent a conventional bed which we sleep on today , that is a different word ( sareer ) .
So do not think Allah is describing the Earth to be similar to what you sleep on in your bedrooms .
It is a reference to the ground in all likelihood and the comfort of the earth .
To summarize , the Arabic word used does not mean flat .
“ Expanse ” does not mean flat either .
It is obvious that it does not refer to a flat earth .
The Arabic word for flat was not used , so why did the sceptics even make such a claim ?

37 “ He spread the earth .
” The earth is flat according to the Quran .
79:30
Again spreading out does not mean flat .
Even the Encyclopaedia at FreeDictionary uses the term “ spread over ” concerning the lava covering a wide distance [ 2 ] .
Thus we realise it is a term that refers to vastness and not a term which refers to flatness .
Would the sceptics claim that the Encyclopaedia people were claiming a flat earth ?
Of course not , therefore it would be equally unfair to claim that the Quran is teaching a flat earth !
In fact , the early scholar ( Ibn Taymiyah ) believed the earth to be spherical and not flat thus confirming this expert in the Quran never believed the Quran claimed a flat earth in ANY verse .
Ibn Taymiyah ’s authority and knowledge concerning the Quran is sufficient to show the sceptics to be incorrect .
The Quran ( 55:17 ) seems to indicate the earth is round by referring to two easts and two wests .
The critics fail to mention this , I guess the truth and scholarly etiquette is of little concern [ 1 ]

38 Someday the stars will fall .
81:2
The sceptics seem to be scientifically illiterate here ; astro-physics teaches us that ALL stars “ die ” eventually .
None live for ever .
In any case , the Quran in this passage is talking about the Day of Judgement .
Creation will be destroyed prior to this Day , so stars will also be affected ; this is according to the Muslim and Christian belief .
The sceptics disagree because they are against supernatural occurrences , my question to them is do you think all this ( the Earth , the Solar System etc ) will last forever ?
There was a point when it did not exist , what has a beginning must have an end … think about it .
39 “ He is created from a gushing fluid that issued from between the loins and ribs .
” Semen , according to the Quran , is formed not in the testicles , but somewhere “ between the loins and ribs . ”
86:5-7
Between the loins and ribs roughly includes the testes too .
So the sceptics are wrong from the word go .
However , the male ejaculate does not gush forth from the testes , in fact the testes only produces sperm , the rest of the ejaculate is semen which is produced via the seminal vesicles ( amongst other organs ) , the sperm is carried to the seminal vesicles and it is ejaculated from this point in the body .
This point fits between the loins and the ribs .
So the Quran is correct again whilst the sceptics are shown to be ignorant of human biology .
A more detailed article is here :
https://yahyasnow.wordpress.com/2009/08/23/quran-got-it-right-about-semen-production/
40 “ He is created from a gushing fluid . ”
Humans are not created from semen , but from fertilized eggs .
86:6
This is a flippant point which is reckless in nature .
The sceptics seem to have lost all comprehension of science here .
“ Fertilized eggs ” , what does the egg require for it to get to a fertilized stage .
Yes , you guessed it semen ( sperm to be more precise ) .
This semen is a gushing fluid and is required for the creation of a new baby , thus we realise the Quran is correct … humans are created from a gushing fluid ( male ejaculate ) .
This gushing fluid is one of the components required for procreation – the Quran is correct
41 “ And the earth , how it is spread ? ”
The earth is flat according to the Quran .
88:20
The earth ( ground ) being outspread over the lava so we can travel over it without being harmed shows that this Quranic verse is true .
It does not mean it is flat .
It is also correct to say Allah spread out the earth in the sense of vastnesses .
Again spreading out does not mean flat .
Even the Encyclopaedia at FreeDictionary uses the term “ spread over ” concerning the lava covering a wide distance [ 1 ] .
Thus we realise it is a term that refers to vastness and not a term which refers to flatness .
Would the sceptics claim that the Encyclopaedia people were claiming a flat earth ?
Of course not , therefore it would be equally unfair to claim that the Quran is teaching a flat earth !
The sceptics lose their sense of comprehension when they speak about the Quran , if they were reasonable they would realise they are twisting things in order to support their anti-religion agenda .
This is not honest on their part !
It does not refer to a flat earth as the early expert in the Quran ( Ibn Tamymiyah ) did not believe in a flat earth , in fact he believed in a spherical earth , thus he confirms NO Quranic verse teaches us the earth is flat .

42 The sun … and the moon when she followeth him . ”
The moon orbits the earth ; it does n’t “ follow the sun . ” 91:1-2
The sceptics are being absolutely ridiculous here .
This is a clear reference to day and night .
The moon does follow the sun !
During the day the sun is out and when the day passes the night follows , what comes out at night ?
Yes , the moon .
So the moon does follow the sun !
It is so obvious that it refers to day and night .
Even the NEXT two verses continue the theme on day / night !
Thus proving it is referring to day and night !
43 “ The earth and Him Who spread it . ”
The earth is flat according to the Quran .
91:6
The earth ( ground ) being spread over the lava so we can travel over it without being harmed shows that this Quranic verse is true .
It does not mean it is flat .
It is also correct to say Allah spread out the earth in the sense of vastnesses .
Again spreading out does not mean flat .
Even the Encyclopaedia at FreeDictionary uses the term “ spread over ” concerning the lava covering a wide distance [ 1 ] .
Thus we realise it is a term that refers to vastness and not a term which refers to flatness .
Would the sceptics claim that the Encyclopaedia people were claiming a flat earth ?

44 Thy Lord … createth man from a clot . ”
Humans were created from a clot ?
96:1-2
Yes humans are created from a leach like clot ( alaq ) .
This leach like clot ( alaq ) is an early stage of the embryo .
What does the embryo turn into eventually ?
Yes a human .
Therefore it is accurate to say that humans were once an alaq ( leach like clot ) so the Quran is correct in teaching humans were created from an alaq ( leach like clot ) .
This is all confirmed in detail by Dr. Sharif Kaf Al - Ghazal .
It looks like the skeptics need to brush up on embryology before they start making claims against the Quran of this nature !

45 Allah dealt with the owners of the elephant by sending swarms of “ flying creatures ” .
105:1-3
The flying creatures are small birds .
It is clear from the Arabic .
Again , they cannot disprove this event ; the only reason why they disagree with it so vehemently is because it is against their naturalistic beliefs .
It is not a historic or a scientific error yet the sceptics include it in their list , I ’d imagine it is included for ridicule purposes .
Overall , the sceptics seem to rely on ridicule rather than logic and fair reasoning .
As you can see the sceptics brought no substance to the table , if they are intellectually honest they will remove their list from circulation .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
As much as 1 million times the normal level of methane gas has been found in some regions near the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , enough to potentially deplete oxygen and create a dead zone , U.S. scientists said on Tuesday .
Texas A&M University oceanography professor John Kessler , just back from a 10 - day research expedition near the BP Plc oil spill in the gulf , says methane gas levels in some areas are “ astonishingly high . ”
Kessler ’s crew took measurements of both surface and deep water within a 5 - mile ( 8 kilometer ) radius of BP ’s broken wellhead .
“ There is an incredible amount of methane in there , ” Kessler told reporters in a telephone briefing .
In some areas , the crew of 12 scientists found concentrations that were 100,000 times higher than normal .
“ We saw them approach a million times above background concentrations ” in some areas , Kessler said .
The scientists were looking for signs that the methane gas had depleted levels of oxygen dissolved in the water needed to sustain marine life .
“ At some locations , we saw depletions of up to 30 percent of oxygen based on its natural concentration in the waters .
At other places , we saw no depletion of oxygen in the waters .
We need to determine why that is , ” he told the briefing .
Methane occurs naturally in sea water , but high concentrations can encourage the growth of microbes that gobble up oxygen needed by marine life .
Kessler said oxygen depletions have not reached a critical level yet , but the oil is still spilling into the Gulf , now at a rate of as much as 60,000 barrels a day , according to U.S. government estimates .
“ What is it going to look like two months down the road , six months down the road , two years down the road ? ” he asked .
Methane , a natural gas , dissolves in seawater and some scientists think measuring methane could give a more accurate picture of the extent of the oil spill .
Kessler said his team has taken those measurements , and is hoping to have an estimate soon .
“ Give us about a week and we should have some preliminary numbers on that , ” he said .
Nevada Democrats have seized on the widely debunked conspiracy theory that President Obama was not born in the U.S. to attack Tea Party darling Sharron Angle , the Republican running against Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
The Nevada Democratic Party , seeking to brand Angle 's views as too extreme , points to her campaign website touting the endorsement of the Declaration Alliance , a group that believes Obama was n't born in the U.S. and therefore is constitutionally ineligible to serve as president despite confirmation from the Hawaiian government that he was born there .
On its website , Declaration Alliance declares that it supports Angle and expresses " reasonable doubt " to the " constitutional eligibility " of Obama to be president .
A spokesman for Angle has said she 's not a so - called " birther , " but that has n't stopped Democrats from pressing the issue .
They note that Angle 's campaign has scrubbed its website of her many controversial issues except the group 's endorsement .
" It 's not enough for a spokesperson to say ' she's not a birther ' and leave it at that , " Phoebe Sweet , a spokeswoman for the Nevada State Democratic Party said in a written statement .
" Given so many other things that have come out of her mouth , stating her belief that the president is legally qualified to serve our country would be the least controversial . "
Angle stunned the Republican establishment this month with a come - from - behind primary victory that has emboldened supporters of the vulnerable Reid , a four - term senator .
They believe her conservative views will doom her candidacy .
So far , Angle has stumbled out of the gates as she has retreated in the face of attacks on her positions , including support for phasing out Social Security over time .
She has proposed privatizing the entitlement program – an initiative that former President George W. Bush failed to achieve .
She has said on her website that Social Security and Medicare are " broken and bankrupt . "
National Republicans have said Angle needs to reintroduce herself to the public for the November election .
But Democrats are determined to define her first .
" It 's no surprise that Sharron Angle holds some extreme and dangerous ideas – we already know she wants to kill Social Security and Medicare , thinks families with two working parents are wrong and wants to make Nevada the nation 's nuclear waste dump , " Sweet said in the statement .
" But to tout the endorsement of a group that – despite incontrovertible evidence to disprove their crackpot conspiracy theory – questions the citizenship of the president of the United States is both embarrassing and deeply troubling .
Sharron
Angle must come out of the bunker and clarify her true belief . "
Angle 's campaign did not respond to a request for comment .
Her website now prominently features the results of a Rasmussen poll that show her leading Reid 50 to 39 percent .
" Harry Reid is scared and has begun running negative attack ads against Sharron , " her site reads .
" We need your donation to fight back . "

Rencontres gay : le site secret
Gaymec :
Deux mecs musclés tombent amoureux
Ils pouvaient bien sûr se vanter de leurs corps , tous deux étaient des garçons au physique spectaculaire et bien musclés .
Ils n’avaient jamais baisé ensemble avant , mais après s’être rencontrés et être sortis ensemble , ils ont décidé que cela devait être enregistré , heureusement pour nous .
Après avoir parlé un peu de leur rencontre grâce au site Gaymec et montré superficiellement leurs plaquettes de chocolat , ils ont commencé à s’embrasser et à se déshabiller , maintenant ils se baisaient vraiment .
Puis l’un d’eux s’est penché et a commencé à sucer la bite de l’autre , ça les a trop excités tous les deux .
C’est alors que l’un d’eux a mis sa jambe sur le lit en montrant son petit cul et l’autre l’a pénétré .
Mais il n’était pas le seul à avoir la bite en feu , puis ils ont changé et l’autre gars l’a baisé aussi .
Bien sûr , ils n’ont pas arrêté jusqu’à ce qu’ils arrivent tous les deux , avec des corps comme ça , il faut en profiter jusqu ’au bout et le plus longtemps possible .
Bien sûr qu’ils l’ont fait .
Gaymec :
Un père et son fils
Un père inscrit sur Gaymec est là pour tout ce dont son fils a besoin , et cette fois il a eu besoin d’un coup de main pour changer la roue de son vélo .
Son père n’y a pas pensé et est allé l’aider , après tout , c’est pour ça qu’il était là .
Mais ce que le garçon ne savait pas à l’époque , c’est qu’il avait l’intention de lui enseigner plus que cela .
Peu après avoir commencé , il s’est mis derrière lui dans un style « fantôme » et a commencé à jouer à toucher le garçon .
Celui - ci était tellement excité qu’il s’est levé et a sorti sa bite , alors son père l’a sucée sur place sans que sa mère le sache .
Elle ne voulait pas aller dans le garage , donc ils pouvaient faire ce qu’ils voulaient .
Ils se sont mis nus et ont commencé à embrasser leur corps pour en profiter jusqu’à ce que finalement le père mûr pénètre le cul du garçon .
Gaymec :
Il le fait avec des blacks
Ça s’est bien mieux passé que prévu .
Il ne l’avait jamais fait avec un homme noir auparavant , alors en rencontrer trois à la fois était un rêve pour le garçon .
Au début , ils ont commencé à se déshabiller jusqu’à ce qu’ils sortent leurs grosses bites noires et commencent à les sucer .
Ils ne sont pas restés immobiles non plus et ont sucé la queue du blanc et lui ont aussi léché l’anus .
Ils le préparaient à ce qui allait suivre et n’ont pas attendu .
L’un a pénétré dans son trou de cul et l’autre a baisé sa bouche , c’était un grand début pour cette baise .
Mais le meilleur était encore à venir , et c’est alors que le garçon s’est mis entre ces deux hommes black et qu’ils ont simultanément pénétré dans son cul .
Vous pouvez imaginer qu’avec ces bites et trois à la fois , il serait totalement détruit , et vous n’avez pas tort .
Cependant , c’est le regard que vous avez quand deux queues comme la sienne entrent dans votre cul en même temps .
Il remercia Gaymec de lui avoir trouvé ces beaux blacks à baiser .
Gaymec : Histoire de famille
Son fils se promenait nu dans la maison , vivait seul et ne se souciait pas que son père le voie .
Mais ce jour - là , alors qu’il se reposait sur le canapé , l’adulte inscrit sur le site Gaymec est venu se pencher pour bien le regarder .
Il avait une bonne bite , et le garçon a vu son intérêt et a commencé à se branler devant lui .
C’est alors que l’homme mûr ne s’est pas du tout coupé et c’est lui qui a tenu sa queue pour le branler .
Peu de temps après , son père lui a aussi sorti sa bite et le garçon s’est branlé cette fois - ci sur lui .
Ce n’était plus si normal , et bien que le nudisme ait été considéré comme une bonne chose par les deux , l ’inceste n’était qu’une chose excitante dans laquelle ils étaient sur le point de tomber .
L’homme n’y a même pas pensé , il s’est assis à côté de lui et a commencé à sucer la bite du jeune homme .
Cette pipe l’a bien sûr rendu trop excité pour dire non .
Profitant du fait que le garçon était nu , il n’avait qu’à l’asseoir sur le canapé et , tout en tenant ses jambes , le pénétrer .
Juste là sur le canapé et pendant qu’ils se filmaient avec une caméra faite maison , c’était comme si et où ça se passait , ils baisaient jusqu’à ce que la mature arrive .
Une fois qu’il a éjaculé , ils se sont levés du canapé et ont continué à faire leurs affaires comme si de rien n’était .
Gaymec :
Black en rute
Les deux hommes s’étaient rencontrer sur Gaymec .
Bien sûr , cet homme noir était physiquement doué , à la fois pour son corps musclé et pour sa grosse bite noire .
Comparé à lui , un blanc mince , le contraste était brutal .
Pourtant , ils étaient tous deux attirés l’un par l’autre et se sont vite retrouvés nus .
La première chose qu’il a faite a été de sucer sa bite noire , qu’il a mise dans sa bouche pendant un long moment .
Non seulement il l ’a sucée , mais il a aussi baisé sa bouche pendant longtemps comme si c’était son petit cul .
Mais dès qu’il eut fini avec l’oral , il le prépara pour le pénétrer , et l’enfonça littéralement .
Quand vous sentez un homme comme ce grand Black en vous , votre visage est un de bonheur maximum , c’est pourquoi il ne pouvait pas s’arrêter de sourire .
Le noir a continué à baiser son cul étroit et mince jusqu’à ce que finalement , bien sûr , il jouisse .
Il connaissait parfaitement l’homme qu’il avait dans la maison et il n’avait pas l’intention de le laisser partir .
Gaymec :
Le youtubeur qui avait envie de baiser
La vie de jeune homme était un vrai gâchis , le garçon typique qui a du succès et fou tout en l’air , même son hygiène personnelle .
Il a gagné sa vie comme un youtuber relativement célèbre , étant même parfois interviewé .
Mais en réalité , il disait souvent qu’il était un putain de clochard et qu’il allait s’inscrire sur Gaymec .
Voyant comment il s’habillait et qu’il avait tout foiré , son manager est allé l’engueuler alors qu’il était dans la cuisine en train de boire dans une bouteille du réfrigérateur .
Il l ’a jeté sur son T - shirt sale et déchiré , ce qui a été la goutte d’eau qui a fait déborder le vase .
Il a attrapé ce vêtement et l ’a littéralement déchiré , laissant le garçon surpris par cette réaction violente , il ne savait pas ce qu’il faisait .
Il lui dit de se mettre par terre et de ramasser tout ce qu’il avait jeté , mais la vérité est que tout cela les avait rendues toutes les deux chauds , d’autant plus qu’il était torse nu .
Il se leva légèrement et vit que son manager avait sorti sa bite ce qui l ’a excité au plus haut point .
Après cela , ils sont tous les deux allés sur le canapé où ils se sont mis complètement nus et juste comme ça le manager a commencé à pénétrer dans son trou de cul en le baisant mille fois mieux que sa mère .
Après leur arrivée , ils ont tous les deux fini nus pendant qu’il serrait le cou du jeune homme avec sa ceinture .
C’est ainsi que la journaliste les a découverts après avoir légèrement ouvert la porte de sa maison , elle ne pouvait pas croire ce qu’elle venait de voir .

Être un mec gay
Les gays et les lesbiennes n’ont pas à passer par une phase de déni de leur sexualité .
S’ils l’avaient fait , ils seraient passés depuis longtemps par une phase de déni , mais si ce n’est pas le cas , que se passe - t - il alors ?
Les hommes homosexuels sont - ils vraiment homosexuels et les femmes lesbiennes sont - elles vraiment lesbiennes ?
Ou est - il possible que les hommes gays aient un problème plus important que les femmes gays et les lesbiennes ?
Vous serez peut - être surpris d’apprendre que les gays et les lesbiennes peuvent avoir un contrôle total sur la façon dont ils se définissent .
Les hommes peuvent ne pas croire qu’être gay signifie être gay .
Certains pourraient dire que cela signifie qu’il est gay et que ce n’est qu’une phase et qu’être gay est la même chose qu’être hétérosexuel .
Cela peut paraître idiot à un homme , car il est difficile de contester le fait qu’être « gaymec » n’a rien à voir avec l’orientation sexuelle d’une personne , mais c’est une très grande différence .
Peu importe que le type soit un homosexuel ou un garçon homosexuel si cela ne correspond pas à son idée de la masculinité .
Certains hommes seront à l’aise et fiers d’être gays et accepteront qu’il le soit .
Mais certains hommes gays sont plus préoccupés par d’autres choses et traversent donc une phase où ils ont honte d’être gays .
Les hommes agissent ainsi pour de nombreuses raisons , certains ont peur de ce qu’ils feront lorsqu’ils deviendront gays , d’autres ont peur que les femmes les rejettent et d’autres encore ont peur d’être jugés par la société et les autres hommes .
Certains d’entre eux ne veulent même pas admettre qu’ils vont sur des sites comme Gaymec .
Ce n’est que l’une des phases par lesquelles passe tout homme gay .
Certains gays peuvent être hétéros , mais ils choisissent quand même d’être gays .
Cela ne les dérange pas d’être gays parce qu’ils aiment leurs petits amis ou leurs femmes hétéros et qu’ils pensent qu’ils auront plus de problèmes s’ils ne sont pas hétéros .
Et bien sûr , certains hommes sont tout simplement hétéros et sont attirés par d’autres hommes .
Il y a des gays qui sont gays et lesbiennes parce qu’ils ne veulent pas sortir du placard et le dire à qui que ce soit .
Beaucoup d’hommes gays et de femmes lesbiennes sont enfermés dans un placard , et ne peuvent donc pas être gays ou lesbiennes s’ils ne le disent pas aux autres .
Mais il leur est parfois très difficile de parler de leurs préférences sexuelles , par exemple de la façon de s’habiller , des endroits où ils peuvent rencontrer des gens , etc .
Les gens ont des besoins et des désirs différents , ils peuvent penser qu’ils doivent se changer de temps en temps pour s’adapter au monde .
Mais s’ils décident de se changer , c’est totalement à eux de le faire et personne d’autre ne doit les y obliger .
Certaines personnes trouvent les rencontres homosexuelles trop difficiles ou embarrassantes à gérer .
Certains gays choisissent de ne sortir qu’avec d’autres gays parce qu’ils se sentent moins gênés par eux - mêmes et qu’ils peuvent s’ouvrir à eux au sujet de leurs fantasmes sexuels , fétiches ou autres .
Il existe de nombreuses façons de sortir avec d’autres homosexuels comme aller sur le site Gaymec et cela n’implique pas d’essayer de convertir qui que ce soit en homosexuel .
Beaucoup d’homosexuels essaient de cacher leur sexualité et leur orientation à leur partenaire parce qu’ils savent qu’ils sont des « gaymecs ».
S’ils parlent de leur orientation sexuelle à leur partenaire , ils risquent de le blesser .
Dans certains cas , ils risquent même de se faire virer de la maison si la personne avec qui ils sortent découvre qu’ils sont gays .
C’est pourquoi de nombreux gay mecs choisissent de ne pas parler à leurs partenaires de leurs préférences sexuelles .
Ils choisissent également de garder leur relation secrète à l’égard de leur famille .
Certaines familles interdisent même aux homosexuels de venir dans leur entourage parce qu’elles ont peur que s’ils viennent , ils puissent être homosexuels .
Beaucoup de gens pensent qu’ils doivent se taire sur leur orientation sexuelle , ce qui est injuste pour les homosexuels .
Pour certaines personnes , il est plus facile de cacher qui vous êtes , mais pour d’autres , il est plus pratique d’être avec des gays .
Certains gaymecs sont également gênés d’aller dans des bars et des clubs et d’être en présence de personnes gays .
Beaucoup d’hommes ont peur d’aller dans des clubs gays parce qu’ils ont peur d’être jetés dehors .

What dirty little deed are you up to ? “
… 8 translations later , Bing and Yandex gives us :
Men walkin’ ‘ long the railroad tracks
Goin ’ someplace there ’s no goin ’ back
Highway patrol choppers comin ’ up over the ridge
Hot soup on a campfire under the bridge .
I live and work in what is called Metro Detroit ’s most thriving suburb , Royal Oak .
Art galleries , coffee houses , high - rise condos , hipster culture galore .
It ’s a great place to be , but the surface glimmer of sheen is hiding a much subdued luster .
Homeless folks push shopping carts in search of the elusive 10 - cent deposit .
Under the railroad track embankments , in the public library and city parks , wandering nomads search for some sort of identity in America the beautiful .
Shelter line stretchin’ round the corner
Welcome to the new world order
Families sleepin ’ in their cars in the southwest
No home no job no peace no rest .
Letter carriers like me see it all .
Foreclosures , bankruptcy notices , evictions , bounced check statements , delinquent utility bills , all on the rise in this economy .
And we hear it all , too .
Today , a young couple with two kids told me a sad story .
They are giving their house , a house they had built just eight years ago , back to the bank .
They are going to rent now and hope that their luck will change .
Dad is a proud American , flies his flag every day .
“ Support our troops , ” “ George W. for President ” – the lawn signs now crinkled in a corner of his former garage .
The highway is alive tonight
But nobody ’s kiddin ’ nobody about where it goes
I ’m sittin ’ down here in the campfire light
Searchin ’ for the ghost of Tom Joad .
Heard a statistic on the radio today .
Americans are paying the lowest income taxes in 60 years , around 9 percent .
The average for the last 60 years is about 12 percent of income .
The richest corporations pay no income tax .
The CEOs of these corporations make 458 times the wage of the average worker .
The top 1 percent own 40 percent of the wealth in this country .
I wear a hat of red and black in search of the American dream .
He pulls prayer book out of his sleeping bag
Preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag
Waitin ’ for when the last shall be first and the first shall be last
In a cardboard box ‘ neath the underpass .
The Postmaster General says five - day delivery is the only way to save the Postal Service .
Oops , he never mentions the loss of 40,000 union jobs or service to the American public .
In a Washington Times interview , he even lets it slip that Tuesday as well as Saturday delivery may have to go .
He ’s going to push for four - day delivery .
And he probably wo n’t stop there .
The privateers are wringing their hands in wishful anticipation .
Wonder how much he gets paid ?
Public servant or CEO ?
Wonder who ’s whispering in his ear ?
Got a one - way ticket to the promised land
You got a hole in your belly and gun in your hand
Sleeping on a pillow of solid rock
Bathin ’ in the city aqueduct .
Tom Joad is the protagonist in “ The Grapes of Wrath . ”
This is John Steinbeck ’s fictional portrayal of a family caught up by the ravages of the Great Depression .
As I sit in my garage , pen in hand , I am looking for the ghost of Tom Joad .
And if the spectral fates will be so kind , let the ghost of Joe Hill sit by my side as well .
I wear a hat of red and black lost in the American dream .
The highway is alive tonight
But where it ’s headed everybody knows
I ’m sittin ’ down here in the campfire light
Waitin ’ on the ghost of Tom Joad .
Joe Hill , the troubadour of discontent ; the most famous “ Wobbly ” of all time .
The Industrial Workers of the World – IWW – were the bedrock of the modern labor movement .
Hill ’s songs and acts of rebellion led to him being framed on a murder charge and executed in Utah in 1915 .
His last words were , “ Do n’t waste any time mourning ; organize ! ”
He then yelled the command to “ fire ” to his executioners .
I dreamed I saw Joe Hill last night .
Now Tom said “ Mom , wherever there ’s a cop beatin ’ a guy
Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries
Where there ’s a fight ‘ gainst the blood and hatred in the air
Look for me Mom I ’ll be there .
The IWW believed in song as a means to rally .
Joe
Hill wrote many of the songs in the famous “ Little Red Song Book , ” including “ Casey Jones – a Union Scab . ”
At rallies , management would send in the Salvation Army band to cover up the Wobbly speakers .
Joe
Hill wrote parodies of Christian hymns so that the union members could sing along with the band , but for their own purposes .
The best known IWW song is “ Solidarity Forever , ” sung to the “ Battle Hymn of the Republic . ”
Now , more than ever , we need songs to fan the flames of discontent .
And more black and red hats .
Wherever there ’s somebody fightin’ for a place to stand
Or decent job or a helpin ’ hand
Wherever somebody ’s strugglin ’ to be free
Look in their eyes Mom you ’ll see me .
The Letter Carriers had a great food drive on May 8 .
My mom helps me pick up food from my giving customers .
It ’s amazing to me that every year the least able to give , the underemployed and out of work , are the most generous .
I know this one feller has n’t worked in over a year and he put out two full bags of food .
The working class understands the fear of hunger and losing a job .
Twenty - three tons of food collected in Royal Oak in one day .
Incredible .
My mom has told me since I was a kid to quit trying to save the world .
Sorry , Ma , I got a head with wings … under my black and red hat .
The highway is alive tonight
But nobody ’s kiddin ’ nobody about where it goes
I ’m sittin ’ down here in the campfire light
With the ghost of old Tom Joad .
Thank you Bruce Springsteen , John Steinbeck , Joe Hill , Woody Guthrie and Mom .

James Kemp in Belfast is trying his best to get back to Leeds .
All flights at Belfast International Airport have been cancelled due to the volcanic ash .
Thousands of air passengers were caught up in massive travel chaos today after an ash cloud from a volcanic eruption in Iceland grounded flights right across the UK and Ireland .
In an unprecedented situation , Belfast International , Belfast City , City of Derry and Dublin airports were among those closed to incoming and outgoing flights as the huge cloud drifted into UK airspace .
The National Air Traffic Services ( NATS ) said all non-emergency flights in UK airspace would be grounded from noon today until 6 pm at the earliest .
But it is feared that passengers will face further disruption after Ryanair warned cancellations and delays were likely to continue into Friday .
And bmi said flights from Dublin to London Heathrow have been cancelled “ until further notice ” .
A Belfast International Airport spokesperson said : " National Air Traffic Services has extended the prohibition on all flights within UK airspace ( bar in an emergency ) until 7 am on Friday 16th .
As such all flights in and out of Belfast International Airport have been cancelled for the remainder of the day .
" Passengers due to travel later today are strongly urged not to make their way to the airport before contacting their relevant airline for advice and assistance .
The airport ’s homepage – www.belfastairport.com - has a list of relevant contact details to help passengers get the information they need as quickly as possible .
" Belfast International Airport remains operational and flights will resume as soon as it is deemed safe to do so by the authorities .
Further updates will be provided in due course . ”
A NATS spokesman said : “ From midday today until at least 6 pm , there will be no flights permitted in UK controlled airspace other than emergency situations .
“ We continue to monitor the situation with the Met Office and work closely with airline customers and adjoining countries . ”
Aviation chiefs were forced to take the extraordinary decision amid warnings from experts that the tiny particles of rock , glass and sand contained in the ash cloud would be sufficient to jam aircraft engines .
The huge cloud was released into the atmosphere following a volcanic eruption under a glacier in the Eyjafjallajoekull area of Iceland .
Weather forecasters warned it could take days for the cloud to disperse .
Travel organisation Abta said it was working closely with the relevant authorities and airlines to ensure its members were kept informed of the most up - to - date information .
An Abta spokeswoman said : “ Some airlines and tour operators have posted statements on their websites and this information will be updated on a regular basis until the situation returns to normal .
At this stage no timescales have been indicated . ”
All early flights were halted at Belfast City and City of Derry airports while only a small number of European flights made it out of Belfast International before the noon ban came into force .
All London airports were closed while Aberdeen , Edinburgh and Glasgow airports were also shut early this morning .
Passengers arriving at airports across the UK were greeted with information boards telling them services had been cancelled indefinitely .
Belfast City spokesman Mark Beattie said there was “ a high likelihood ” the cancellations would be extended into the afternoon .
SDLP MLA Conal McDevitt was caught up in the chaos with fellow members of the Stormont Health Committee .
“ We had arrived at around 6 am for a 7 am flight to Leeds Bradford , ” he said .
“ But the staff were very clear and concise in their message that there would be no flights .
“ Of course it is inconvenient but I would rather be on the ground and safe .
It is an unpredictable situation . ”
Passengers arriving at City of Derry airport for an 8.10 am
Aer Arann flight to Dublin were told it has been cancelled .
Ann Daly , from Londonderry , was one of the passengers taken to Dublin by taxi instead .
“ I am going down to Dublin for work and I was supposed to be there at 10 am but I am not going to get there now until this afternoon , ” she said .
“ I am just glad I am going to Dublin and not going further afield .
It does n’t bother me that much but I feel sorry for anyone going on holidays . ”
The European air safety body , Eurocontrol , said the cloud of ash had reached 55,000ft and was expected to move through Northern Ireland and Scotland by 1 pm .
It is not expected to be visible at ground level .
Brian Flynn from Eurocontrol : “ As it moves toward the Netherlands and Belgium it will dissipate and lose intensity , like any weather phenomenon .
But we do n't know what the extent of it will be . ”
Matt Dobson , a forecaster for MeteoGroup , said : “ The concern is that as well as the eruption , the jet stream passing through Iceland is passing in a south easterly direction , which will bring ash to the north of Scotland and Denmark and Norway .
But it is impossible to say how much ash will come down . ”
Airport operator BAA said : “ Following advice from the Met Office , the National Air Traffic Service has introduced restrictions to UK airspace this morning as a result of volcanic ash drifting across the United Kingdom from Iceland .
“ Passengers intending to fly today are asked to contact their airline for further information and should expect disruption in the coming hours . ”
Passengers can also keep up to date with cancellations at Belfast City and Belfast International via their websites .

U.S. researchers used many generations of data to see if college student today have more or less empathy ( compassion , understanding ) to others than students of the past .
Find out what they found out and what some of their comments are based on their study of empathy and college students -- today and in the past .
The article highlighting this study is entitled ' Changes in Dispositional Empathy Over Time in American College Students .' It was presented on Friday , May 28 , 2010 , at the 22nd annual convention of the Association for Psychological Science ( APS ) , which was held May 27 - 30 , 2010 , in Boston , Massachusetts , U.S.A .
The three researchers involved in the study and the paper are Edward H. O'Brien , Courtney Hsing , and Sara Konrath , all from the University of Michigan .
The three U.S. researchers based their study on 72 previous studies that involved about 14,000 U.S. college students .
The previous studies were conducted between the years of 1984 and 2009 .
They suggested that , today , college students have less empathy for others then did college students of twenty or thirty years ago .
In fact , they found that students today scored about 40 % lower on a measure of empathy than students of the past .
They used the Davis Interpersonal Reactivity Index The Index is a measure of dispositional empathy that takes as its starting point the contention that empathy consists of a set of separate but related constructs .
Page two continues .
The Davis Interpersonal Reactivity Index uses statements such as ' I sometimes try to understand my friends better by imagining how things look from their perspective " and " I often have tender , concerned feelings for people less fortunate than me " when measuring empathy in these college students .
The researchers concluded , ' We find that Empathic Concern , Perspective Taking , and Fantasy ( marginal ) are declining over time , with Personal Distress remaining stable .'
[ APS ]
Thus , the researchers found that students today do not share feelings and / or emotions with their peers as much as students of the past did .
In addition , students today were discovered to less likely to show gratitude than students of the past .
The researchers contend the today 's young are more interested in taking care of themselves then helping others .
Dr. Konrath , a researcher the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan , stated , " We found the biggest drop in empathy after the year 2000 . '
[ MSNBC : ' Today 's college kids lack empathy '  ]
Page three concludes .
Dr. Konrath , who is also with the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Rochester , added , " Many people see the current group of college students ' ” sometimes called ' Generation Me ' ' ” as one of the most self - centered , narcissistic , competitive , confident and individualistic in recent history .'
[ MSNBC ]
She added reasons for this less empathic attitude with college students today .
Dr. Konrath commented , ' Compared to 30 years ago , the average American now is exposed to three times as much nonwork - related information .'
[ MSNBC ]
'In terms of media content , this generation of college students grew up with video games , and a growing body of research , including work done by my colleagues at Michigan , is establishing that exposure to violent media numbs people to the pain of others . "
[ MSNBC ]
And , " The ease of having ' friends ' online might make people more likely to just tune out when they do n't feel like responding to others ' problems , a behavior that could carry over offline .' [ MSNBC ]
Forty - year - old record presses , installed by EMI in the 70s vinyl heyday , grind noisily away , oozing hydraulic oil on to the floor .
Long pipes run the length of the factory floor , carrying steam to power the presses .
It 's as if the digital age has never occurred .
Hi -tech this is not , but über - cool niche it certainly is .
I 'm on an industrial estate in Hayes , Middlesex .
This was once the EMI vinyl manufacturing plant , until the record label sold it off in 2001 , and it became the Vinyl Factory .
In the 70s this plant pressed 1 m records a week .
It 's now the last major vinyl plant in the UK and presses around 25,000 records a week .
General manager Roy Mathews began work here straight after school as an apprentice .
That was 50 - odd years ago .
In those days the Beatles and Pink Floyd used to trail through the factory , keen to see their records ( Sergeant Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band and The Dark Side of the Moon no less ) being pressed .
Mathews met them all , but no such thing happens today .
The stars do n't do factory visits any more ; it 's a reality too far .
But while CDs and downloads have taken over the market , vinyl itself has never lost its credibility .
Devotees cite its superior sound quality and the personal , tactile relationship one develops with the big black disc and accompanying artwork .
The Vinyl Factory 's mission statement is : " Music is a physical experience . "
What 's more , vinyl is experiencing a resurgence .
Massive Attack , Grace Jones , The Pet Shop Boys and Mumford & Sons have all pressed limited runs here .
Mathews pulls out a black LP called the " lacquer " .
This is the master cut that the Vinyl Factory receives from Abbey Road Studios .
It 's an aluminium disc coated in acetate lacquer into which an analogue signal has been cut using a heated diamond stylus .
At this point , the disc is a soft facsimile of the final record .
We move to the hub of the factory floor , where an assistant cleans the surface of the lacquer using distilled water and then softly brushes it using soap solution to remove any grease before placing it in the silver plating tank , where mechanical jets shower the disc with a thin layer of silver to make it electrically conductive .
Before our eyes the disc gathers a beautiful silver sheen .
It is then placed in an electroplating bath where , over three hours , individual nickel molecules attach themselves to the silver .
The resulting " master " is washed and separated from the original lacquer .
As this master is now a negative imprint , another positive nickel copy is made , called the " mother " .
The mother copy is played and checked for faults .
All being well , negative nickel " stampers " are then produced from the mother .
These are cleaned and used to press the final run of records .
Mother , master , stamper , positive , negative : I am initially bemused by Mathew 's flood of terminology .
To him it 's clearly second nature ; after half a century , vinyl manufacturing is stamped on his brain indelibly .
A pile of paper record labels are placed in a record press .
The vinyl arrives in the form of black PVC pellets contained in a large vat with spidery tubes running out of it and into several large presses .
The pellets are sucked up the tubes and into the sealed press and melted at high temperature .
A sausage of black vinyl is squirted out , into a circular block , which is sandwiched between two record labels before being flattened between the A and B side stampers .
The excess PVC that seeps out of the sides is trimmed off and dumped in a bin .
It is fearsomely hot to touch .
The press then produces a perfectly round , covetable finished disc that it slots into a sleeve before depositing it in an adjacent box .
Once a run is complete , the used stamper is removed and the next one is cleaned with pressurised air to get rid of any grit , slotted into place and screwed in , ready for the next run .
Warm , noisy and greasy , these old machines keep on keeping on .
The pristine records they produce belie the frankly rather clapped - out looking machines that continue to manufacture them .
Old school engineering triumphs here .
Nothing has changed .
But why tinker with perfection ?
Microsoft on Monday introduced a slimmer version of the Xbox 360 console amid demonstrations of its controller - free gaming device Kinect .
The new Xbox 360 costs the same as its predecessor ( $ 300 ) and will begin shipping to retailers today , according to Microsoft .
Other features include a removable 250 - GB hard drive ( up from 120 GB ) , 802.11N
Wi-Fi connectivity , five USB slots , touch - sensitive power buttons and backward compatibility with all games ( but not your existing hard drives or Memory Unit memory cards ) .
Microsoft also claims the new Xbox runs quieter than previous versions , as the console now has one large fan as opposed to two small fans .
The console also sports a " Kinect - Ready " port that hooks up directly to Kinect .
( It 's unclear how to connect to Kinect with the older Xbox .
We 've put in a query with Microsoft . )
The announcement concluded Microsoft 's press conference at the E3 gaming convention .
Earlier in the conference , Microsoft showcased its upcoming Xbox 360 accessory Kinect , which uses multiple cameras to track a player 's body movements and translate them into game controls .
Several major gaming companies , including Konami and Activision , showed off new titles utilizing the device .
Due for release later this year , the Kinect device puts Microsoft 's Xbox in closer competition with Nintendo 's Wii , whose Wiimote features a combination of motion and optical sensors enabling players to manipulate objects on the screen with hand gestures .
Updated 1:30 p.m. PT with additional details on the new Xbox 360 .

If you ’re over 60 years old and reading this post , it ’s probably too late .
Good for you if you ’re under 30 .
You ’ve got a better chance if you ’re younger .
Age discrimination ?
No .
The end of retirement as we know it — an emerging unpleasant reality that will ( re ) shape the quality of life and standard of living for billions .
Start dealing with it .
Now .
If you are a knowledge worker , cognitive capitalist , or a Reichian symbolic analyst , you will not be retiring at 65 .
Period .
Even if you are in a protected public union with cosseted pension funds , you are at extraordinary risk .
Just ask the Greeks , the Californians , or the Japanese .
This is a global phenomenon .
Demographics and structural deficits do n’t lie .
Unless the global economy comes roaring back in ways that stimulate sustainable growth in OECD countries , even the most talented professionals had better expect to work for at least another five years .
Of course , with stimulating careers , good health , and longer life spans , this is n’t necessarily a bad thing .
But it is surely not what most mid-career executives and professionals have planned .
( Indeed , there ’s no shortage of optimists who still expect to enjoy the fruits of early retirement . )
Forget the “ saving for retirement ” shibboleths .
Strategically addressing those 60 + months after age 65 may be the most significant long - range planning investment in your human capital portfolio .
Charles Handy ’s “ portfolio careers ” and “ How Starbucks Saved My Life ” scenarios notwithstanding , the simple reality is that retirement planning as we know it is obsolete .
Everyone reading this should take 15 hard minutes to ruthlessly reassess the reality of the “ new ” final years of their future career .
The finish line has become elusive ; the goal posts have been pushed back .
Based on your current skill set and competences , what do you think your workday will look like when you ’re 70 ?
Are you comfortable with the probability that you will be managing employees younger than your grandchildren ?
Temperamentally , do you think you ’ll add more value as a mentor , a partner , or part - timer ?
More important , what will your ( much ) younger boss think ?
Do you honestly believe that , when you have to work five more years than anticipated , you can get away with not being more facile , adept , and productive with emerging technologies ?
The inevitable aging of the ( for now ) wealthier Western economies guarantees a surge of innovative device interfaces more compatible with slower fingers and tired eyes .
You will , of course , be taking web - enabled professional / technical development courses at 58 or 62 or you will be fired for cause .
Whatever your 70 - year - old workday scenarios may be , what new or novel skills or experiences do they demand ?
Do they demand more travel or less ?
More time immersed in digital environments or less ?
More interactions with people within a decade of your age or fewer ?
Are there personal or professional development initiatives you should be undertaking now precisely because those five years present opportunities that the earlier deadlines do n’t ?
The most important slice of those 15 - minutes - for - five - more - years should focus on role models .
Who are the 70 + year olds whose presence , energy , and effectiveness might profitably serve as the benchmarks for your own ?
Who are the two 75 - year - olds who you would professionally emulate ?
Write them down .
I know my two and why I picked them .
But why have you chosen yours ?
What do your choices say about the kind of person you want to be at the end of your professional life ?
To be sure , there ’s no shortage of 70 + and even 80 + seniors — Warren Buffett , Sumner Redstone , Pablo Casals , Louise Nevelson , Agnes de Mille , Lee Kuan Yew — for whom advancing age has not been an obstacle to productivity and professionalism .
But the braver and bolder way to interpret this challenge is the recognition that , just as you ca n’t run or swim as fast as your 25 - year - old self , your 70 - year - old self will have to manage and add professional value differently than you did at 40 or 50 .
You do n’t have to know — you ca n’t possibly know — the answer to that right now .
But it ’s not too early to ask those questions and select those role models .
( You ’ll be fascinated to see how those selections evolve as you age ) .
The future of “ five more ” does n’t quite make a mockery of the clichéd “ Have you saved enough for retirement ? ” and “ What will you do in retirement ? ” questions dominating most end - of - career discussions .
Make no mistake : Calculating the value of career - enhancing investments at 53 when expecting to retire at 65 requires different NPV or DCF computations and professional assessment than when making such a bet knowing you will not be retiring before 70 .
That ’s a greater than 40 % gap ; it ca n’t be ignored or finessed .
The changing structural economics of retirement almost completely overturn conventional cost / benefit calibrations for human capital investment .
Are those extra five years being tacked onto an appreciating or depreciating asset ?
Even adjusting for age discrimination lawsuits and legislation , how will organizations accommodate a psychographic , demographic , and economic shift every bit as profound as the rise of women in the workplace ?
The fact remains that older professionals and managers tend to be the most expensive items on the payroll .
You know this .
What on earth justifies the value of keeping them — or you — for five more years ?
Or , alternately , are those additional years spent in the murky realms of partial , part - time , or contingent employ with nervous 60 - year - olds working almost as hard and creatively for two - thirds or three - quarters of their previous compensation ?
How about half ?
The pace of change in the most vibrant post - industrial sectors is such that the technical expertise of one ’s 40s has decayed into anachronistic obsolescence by one ’s 50s .
Knowledge may be power but it is also perishable .
Yesterday ’s hot mark - up language is tomorrow ’s Sanskrit ; last decade ’s breakthrough medical procedure is next year ’s malpractice .
The cliché about the distinction between “ five year ’s experience ” and a “ year ’s worth of experience five times ” has seldom been more apt or more bitter .
Then again , cultivating and harvesting one ’s socio- professional network for five more years can also yield disproportionate value .
Perhaps , as some Kauffman Foundation fans have suggested , we ’ll see an explosion of “ silver entrepreneurship ” or Tom Malone ’s “ e- lancing ” as an industry ’s most experienced practitioners launch start - ups or consulting shops to manage their transitions .
Enterprise dynamics of internal competition , promotion , and mentoring will be revolutionized if the median age skews up and 60 - year old executives who had planned to vanish into the Bermuda triangle of retirement in five years now push hard to stay for 10 .
If market forces and healthier lifestyles make 65 the new 50 , then everyone now working in their 40s or 50s better revisit their most fundamental assumptions about what investing in their career should mean .
When you know that being on the job 60 more months is inevitable , you have to have the courage and character to ask :
How can I make them the most pleasantly and professionally productive of my life ?

Happening NOW : Top White
House officials privately making nice with labor
In a private meeting currently under way with labor leaders , top White House officials are working hard to smooth over tensions in the wake of an anonymous administration official 's claim that unions had flushed $ 10 million down the toilet in Arkansas , and are stressing that they respect labor 's decision , sources say .
The private make - up session is directly at odds with the tough tone the White House official struck in the wake of the primary , and is also at odds with Robert Gibbs ' subsequent quasi-endorsement of the sentiment .
In the meeting , a White House official asked labor to put the anonymous comment behind them , a source at the meeting says .
Representing the White House at the meeting , which is currently underway at AFL - CIO headquarters in Washington , are top advisers Patrick Gaspard and Jen O'Malley .
On the labor side are AFL - CIO 's political directors .
Michael Lebowitz was interviewed by Srećko Horvat during the Subversive Film Festival and conference on socialism , held from May 1 to May 25 , 2010 , in Zagreb , Croatia .

Srećko Horvat :
In May , as a participant of the big international conference on Socialism , you are coming to a country which had an experience with the the Yugoslavian version of socialism in the last century .
Could you explain why socialism in the 21st century ?
Michael Lebowitz : Basically , I think there is no alternative .
Capitalism has always been a system that treats human beings and nature simply as a means for the purpose of making profits .
The logic of capital is the growth of capital and , as Marx pointed out , its tendency is to destroy both those original sources of wealth -- human beings and nature .
But how long can that go on ?
Production under capitalist relations is so unfulfilling that it produces people who can only get satisfaction by purchasing and possessing things .
At the same time , we know that in order to be able to sell the commodities produced , capital must constantly generate new needs .
It is a lethal combination – consumerism is not an accident in capitalism .
But can everyone in the world consume , consume ?
We can already see the result of growing demands upon natural resources , the competition between old capitalist countries and new emerging ones , the drive to emulate the consumption standards of the global North .
After all , why should people in some parts of the world be privileged by the accident of their birthplace ?
How long can this continue ?
How long before there is a growing struggle over the limited resources – a struggle between those who currently control those resources and those who feel entitled to an equal share ?
I think barbarism is the direction that capitalism is going .
And that our choice is between socialism and barbarism .
Of course , nobody sensible is looking for reproduction of socialism as it was attempted in the 20th century .
As the President of Venezuela , Hugo Chávez , said in 2005 , " We have to reinvent socialism . "
And , he noted that it can't be the kind of socialism that existed in the Soviet Union .
" It must be a new type of socialism , a humanist one , which puts humans and not machines or the state ahead of everything . "
I think that is precisely the socialism we have to invent .
Socialism for the 21st century has as its core a focus on human development – the full development of human potential .
That is a return to the central theme of 19th century socialists like Karl Marx .
It is the understanding that our goal must be a society in which everyone has the opportunity to develop all their capacities and potential .
Marx summed it up in The Communist Manifesto by saying that the goal is " an association , in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all " .
In large part , that vision was missing in much of the 20th century attempts to build socialism .
Instead , emphasis upon the quantitative growth of productive forces displaced that vision .
One of your most famous books is certainly Beyond Capital : Marx 's Political Economy of the Working Class .
For those who have n't read it yet , could you explain what is left out of Capital .
Is there any relationship between what was missing in the 20th century and missing parts of Marxist theory ?
Well , there 's a lot missing in Marx 's Capital .
That book had an essential purpose but it was limited .
The point was to explain the nature of capital and its tendencies .
Marx 's goal there was to explain to workers what this beast is -- how what we see around us is not accidental , how it can't be changed simply through reforms , that you need to end the rule of capital .
There is an enormous mystification of capital , and we need to go beneath the surface to understand capital .
Marx did that brilliantly .
However , Capital was not an attempt to describe the whole of capitalism .
Remember that Marx intended initially to write six books about capitalism , and he only finished the first of these – the book on capital ( and , of course , he only finished the first volume of that book himself ) .
We ourselves have to go beyond Capital .
I think the short answer as to what is missing in Marx 's Capital is the human being as a being of praxis .
We do n't see human beings with their own goals , struggling to achieve those goals and transforming themselves in the process .
We can see that in Marx 's other writings but not as a theme of Capital .
Marx necessarily would have had to deal with this if he ever had proceeded to the volume on wage labour .
So that 's what I was trying to do in my book : explore implications of Marx not writing the book he planned on wage labour .
I think that once you begin to look at the side of the worker , you are led inevitably to stress the human being as a subject and you see the importance of the " key link " of human development and practice .
But if workers do n't appear in Capital as subjects for themselves , then we do n't focus upon capital 's constant need to divide and separate workers in order to weaken them .
Two - sided class struggle goes into the background , and all capital has to do is increase productivity in order to produce these objects ( workers ) more cheaply .
What you end up with is technological determinism because what capital must do to capture the fruits of productivity gain is not explored .
So , we do n't even get a full picture of the side of capital without introducing the worker as a subject .
The relation of all this to the question of socialism for the 21st century is that it is essential to recognise that Marx wrote Capital from the perspective of a society in which people are subjects who are able to develop their full potential – where they are able to become , in his words , " rich human beings " .
His premise was a society based not on the growth of capital but what he referred to in Capital as " the inverse situation in which objective wealth is there to satisfy the worker 's own need for development " .
Look at how many times
Marx talks there about capitalism as an " inversion " .
Well , an inversion of what ?
The answer is the inversion of a different , more human society – socialism .
A society which does not destroy human beings in the process of production , a society which introduces new productive forces that do not cripple human beings but which allows them to grow , a society which treats nature as something to be respected and sustained .
Yes , I definitely do think there is a link between what was missing in Marx 's Capital and what was missing in 20th century attempts to build socialism .
In my new book , The Socialist Alternative : Real Human Development , I have tried to develop the logic of a socialist alternative based upon the concept of human development .
A central theme of that book and your recent work is the concept of the " elementary triangle of socialism " .
Could you explain it ?
If you do n't know where you want to go , no road will take you there .
For some time , I have been stressing the absolute necessity to have a clear idea of where we want to go , a vision of socialism .
That 's especially important after the experiences of the 20th century .
The socialist alternative ( which is not only an alternative to capitalism ) must put human development at its core .
So , I explore in the book the conditions for this , drawing upon Marx but also upon what we need to learn from the 20th century experience .
I try to look at socialism as an organic system , a system of production , distribution and consumption in which the elements all coexist and support each other .
I consider here these elements as ( A ) social ownership of the means of production , ( B ) social production organised by workers for ( C ) social needs and purposes .
Social ownership is essential because it is the only way to ensure that our communal , social productivity is directed to the free development of all rather than used to satisfy the private goals of capitalists , groups of individuals , or state bureaucrats .
Social production organised by workers because it's only the way to end what Marx called the crippling of body and mind that comes from the separation of head and hand .
As long as workers are prevented from developing their capacities by combining thinking and doing in the workplace , they remain alienated , fragmented human beings whose enjoyment consists in possessing and consuming things .
And if workers do n't make decisions in the workplace and develop their capacities , we can be certain that someone else will .
Finally , satisfaction of communal needs and purposes focuses upon the importance of going beyond self - interest .
It means we look upon others as members of a community , as members of a human family .
The essential starting point here is the concept of a community , a concept of solidarity – something we can never build by focusing on selfishness and self - interest .
These three sides of this combination ( which Chávez has called the elementary triangle of socialism ) clearly reinforce each other .
And , if any of these are missing , it poisons the other sides of the triangle – this is an important lesson from the 20th century .
You have written on the Yugoslavian system of " self - management " , and in one of your older works you state that " worker management is the only real ultimate alternative to capitalism " .
Why did this experiment fail ?
I ’m sure that people in Croatia can answer this much better than I can .
My own impression is that your self - management experiment ( to which I was very much attracted at the time ) had many problems but that we can learn from these in order to build an alternative which does n't make the same mistakes .
Underlying much , I think , was the absence of the third side of the triangle – the attempt to create a society consciously based upon a concept of community and solidarity .
Instead of recognising the way in which people develop by meeting each others ' needs , the focus was upon self - interest ; the logic was that by , stressing material self - interest , the development of productive forces would lead somehow to a new society oriented toward human development .
Ultimately , that did n't differ much from the perspective of Soviet Marxism .
Of course , there was the recognition here that state ownership is not social ownership and that workers ' management is a necessary condition for social ownership .
That certainly was missing in the Soviet model .
However , the focus upon self - interest infected the other sides of the triangle .
Enterprises competed against each other and acted against each other 's interests in order to maximise their income .
There were great disparities in income levels based on differential access to and possession of particular means of production ; and unemployed workers had no access to the means of production at all and ended up leaving to become guest workers outside the country .
This was n't social ownership – it was group ownership of specific means of production .
Further , workers did not rule within the workplace ; they tended to accept the recommendations of the managers and the experts .
The assumption was that everyone in the enterprise had the same interest – maximising income .
So , why not accept what the managers proposed ?
Thus the division between thinking and doing continued , and the result was that workers did not develop their capacities .
If they were able to get rid of bad managers , it was n’t in order to self - govern in the workplace .
Rather , it was like an electorate voting out one government and electing a new one to rule over it .
Why did n’t the workers rule ?
An important reason was that they did not feel qualified to make technical decisions .
However , rather than transforming the workday so that part of it would be set aside for education in self - management , the focus was on immediate material interest and not upon an investment in human capacities .
The absence of a conscious attempt to build solidarity , to build a solidarian society , infected both social property and worker management .
In this respect , we need to think seriously about the observations of Che Guevara who worried specifically about the lack of a socialist spirit here when workers compete against each other and , in general , warned that reliance upon material self - interest leads to a dead end .
When I visited here in the 1970s and 1980s , I was struck by the lack of solidarity in the society .
It was quite a contrast to Cuba , with which I was familiar .
As you know , the socialist experiment in Yugoslavia had also some bad sites ( concentration camps such as Goli Otok and prisons for political disidents such as Lepoglava , a new class associated with the [ Communist ] Party , and so on ) .
How would you explain the socialist alternative to those who went through bad experiences during the time of " real - existing socialism " ?
Well , I have to confess that I did not know about these things and did not question them .
When I looked at Yugoslavia , I was looking at it as an economist and as a test of the experiment of workers ' management .
So I was not exploring other elements of the society .
Certainly , too , Yugoslavia seemed to be so advanced as a society relative to the countries following the Soviet model .
As to how I would explain the socialist alternative to those who went through those experiences ?
The same way I explain it now to people living in countries that are trying to build socialism at this time .
In Vietnam , Cuba and Venezuela – all countries that I have been in recently , I stress the necessity to build all three sides of a socialist triangle .
To build social ownership of the means of production , workers ' management in workplaces and communities and a solidarian society – one based upon the conscious recognition of each others ’ needs .
And , I stress that if you do n't do that , the failures will be predictable .
The point , as Che stressed , is to simultaneously build productive forces and new socialist human beings .
In Croatia , some say – if you can ban Nazi symbols , you could also ban the communist symbols as the red star ( both are symbols of totalitarian regimes ) .
How would you answer to such claims ?
I do n't look upon those as symbols of states but rather as symbols of movements .
And I reject entirely the idea that you can equate a symbol associated with people who used human skin to make lamp shades and executed people in the gas chambers , on the one hand , with the symbol under which many people have struggled for freedom , against capitalism and imperialism ( and I think of the Vietnamese people who defeated US imperialism in particular ) .
People who equate those two symbols are foolish or inhuman .
Having said that , however , I do n't agree that a state should ban the Nazi symbol .
Rather , I think that people should themselves struggle politically against that symbol and consciously educate themselves and others to struggle against such inhumanity .
You knew some of the former members of the Praxis group ( Gajo Petrovic , Predrag Vranicki , etc. ) .
How do you , from a temporal but also spatial distance , look upon their work ?
I have n't thought about them for a while .
When I referred earlier to the concept of human beings as beings of praxis , though , it reflected their central themes .
I was very much influenced by the work of Gajo Petrovic and Vranicki and tried to see them when I visited Zagreb in the past .
The idea of making human development the centre of a concept of socialism and stressing that this development occurs only through practice is , in fact , a return to the critical insights of Marx of which they were so aware .
I think that the humanistic Marxism that they stressed is what socialism for the 21st century is all about ; hopefully , the more we work at building that , the more their insights and those of the Praxis group will be acknowledged .
Where in the world do you see those new possibilities , new hopes for better societies based on the concept of solidarity ?
There are new possibilities , and we see them especially in Latin America right now because the strong rejection of the effects of neoliberalism there has opened the door to think of an alternative – not a third way , a barbarism with a human face , but a socialist alternative .
I have been working in Venezuela for several years along with my wife Marta Harnecker , and I think there are many very important developments there .
In particular , there is a vision of a socialist alternative in Venezuela .
You can see that represented in parts of Venezuela 's Bolivarian Constitution introduced under Chavez .
In its explicit recognition ( in Article 299 ) that the goal of a human society must be that of " ensuring overall human development " , in the declaration of Article 20 that " everyone has the right to the free development of his or her own personality " and the focus of Article 102 upon " developing the creative potential of every human being and the full exercise of his or her personality in a democratic society " – the theme of human development pervades the Bolivarian Constitution .
That constitution also focuses upon the question of how people develop their capacities and capabilities – that is , how overall human development occurs .
Article 62 of the constitution declares that participation by people in " forming , carrying out and controlling the management of public affairs is the necessary way of achieving the involvement to ensure their complete development , both individual and collective " .
The same emphasis upon a democratic , participatory and protagonistic society is also present in the economic sphere , which is why Article 70 stresses " self - management , co-management , cooperatives in all forms " and why Article 102 ’s goal of " developing the creative potential of every human being " emphasises " active , conscious and joint participation " .
In other words , that " key link " of human development and practice figures prominently in the Bolivarian Constitution .
But , it ’s not just words .
There has been a conscious attempt to develop new institutions which allow people to transform themselves while transforming circumstances .
This is most apparent with the development of communal councils – councils based on 200- 400 families in urban areas ( and smaller in rural areas ) .
These councils , in which the general assemblies are the supreme decision - making body , are engaging in participatory diagnosis of their needs and participatory budgeting .
Of course , while they are a real place where people can develop through their protagonism , the problems they can deal with are limited by their size .
So , the step occurring now is the coming together of councils to form communes so they can take on larger responsibilities .
Here there is attention being given to ensure economic viability – units of productive activity oriented to social needs .
And the next step will be the coming together of communes to form communal cities .
In fact , a new state is being formed ( not easily and not without contradictions and conflicts with the old state ) ; Chavez has said many times that the communal councils are the cells of the new socialist state .
Although it is not as advanced , there also is a process going in the direction of workers ' management of state industries .
Here there has been great resistance from bureaucrats and managers against workers ' management , and some of the initial steps taken toward what was called co-management in Venezuela ( a partnership between workers and society ) were reversed .
However , in the last year the combination of workers ' militancy and Chavez has put workers ' management back on the agenda .
For example , workers in the state steel and aluminium industries , with Chavez ’s encouragement , have produced a socialist plan for their region and Chavez has insisted that what Venezuela has now is state capitalism and that , without workers ' control , you ca n’t have socialism .
The same thing is happening now in the electrical industry .
And , that appears to be occurring as the state moves into new sectors of the economy .
The central focus is definitely not self - interest – Chavez in particular is very conscious of the problems associated with that .
So , there is a real attempt in Venezuela to work at building the socialist triangle .
I do n’t want to minimise the problems and obstacles .
The goal is clear but it ’s a real struggle .
The eyes of the world are on Venezuela .
Something new is happening there , but some leftists are very critical of what they view as Chavez 's populism .
What 's your opinion ?
The spectre of populism is often raised when people talk about Venezuela but I ’m not certain that I know what they mean when they use the term .
In some cases , it reflects nervousness about the enthusiasm and movement of masses , and there ’s an implicit but repressed preference for that familiar model in which people enter a voting booth every few years by themselves and elect a government to do good things .
In other cases , people worry about a leader who may buy popularity by providing gifts from above for an unchanging client population .
But that is not what is happening in the Bolivarian Revolution .
While the poor definitely have gained significantly in terms of education , health and the general reduction of poverty , they are definitely changing and gaining a sense of power and dignity .
The idea that you ca n’t solve poverty without giving power to the poor , a famous statement by Chavez , and the development of those real mechanisms by which people are able to develop through their collective activity – that goes far beyond any concept of populism .
It ’s easy to talk about such questions abstractly from a distance , but in the real Venezuela , the deep rentist culture of corruption and clientalism on the one hand and apathy and despair , on the other , would make building a new society a difficult matter under any circumstances .
I think the real changes that are occurring would not be taking place in the absence of the leadership of Chavez ; and , it is essential to understand that this is a leadership that is part of a dialectical relationship with the masses .
That relationship is what propels the process forward .
What 's going on now in Venezuela ?
In this part of the world we get news only if Chavez is doing or saying something mass media find attractive ...
And we should add negative .
That is not unique to this part of the world .
It is true in North America and elsewhere as well .
What is transmitted internationally by the mass media about Venezuela is in general the perspective of international capital ( which , naturally , is not enthusiastic about the emergence of a socialist alternative ) and , in particular , the perspective of the viciously anti-Chavez opposition media within Venezuela .
In fact , many of the stories that appear in the international press are little more than rewrites of items in Venezuela 's domestic press ; and graphic images transmitted by CNN , for example , come from its local affiliate Globovision ( often called Globoterror by Chavists ) , a 24 - hour anti-Chavez news and opinion channel .
If you want to find out what is going on in Venezuela on a regular basis you basically have to go to the internet because local people and visitors ( who are not , for example , afraid to go into the poor barrios ) are reporting on what is happening and how life is changing .
With the help of online translation programs , you ’ll get a quite different picture and you can understand the changes and struggles happening in Latin America .
Do you think the current crisis of capitalism will lead to a rejection of capitalism in other parts of the world and the search for a socialist alternative ?
As we know , after the great depression of the 1930s , capital restructured itself and instead of a new and better world we got the Bretton Woods agreement and the International Monetary Fund and World Bank .
Is n't the ongoing crisis only a new method for strengthening the old system ?
A crisis in capitalism is not the same as a crisis of capitalism .
In the absence of subjects prepared to struggle to change the system , capitalism has a free hand to try to restructure itself .
That is certainly what we see occurring as the G20 is invented to take the place of the G7 ; it ’s a recognition that restructuring international capital involves the incorporation of the new capitalist actors ( especially China , India and Brazil ) .
Whether that attempt to restructure will succeed , on the other hand , remains to be seen .
The more important question , though , is whether the attempt to make the working class pay for the deficiencies of capitalism will produce new actors who are increasingly oriented toward putting an end to capitalism .
That was the pattern in Latin America , and we can see resistance at this time in Greece and I suspect we ’ll see it elsewhere .
I think that is important and has much potential .
But resistance in itself can just raise the costs of particular measures to capital and may lead no further than to some reforms .
To go further , I think it is necessary both to understand the nature of capital and also to have a vision of a socialist alternative .
I think the first of these is beginning – as indicated by the growing interest in Marx in the context of the crisis .
We need to work on the second , too , to make it clear that socialism is not about a state - controlled and - dominated society ; rather , the socialism we need to struggle for must be about creating the conditions for real human development .
Will the ongoing crisis be a new method for strengthening the old system ?
Only struggle will decide that .

Craig Clasen was hunting yellow fin tuna with fellow fisherman Cameron Kirkconnell , photographer D.J Struntz ( DJ Strunz ’s portfolio ) and film maker Ryan McInnis in the Gulf of Mexico when a 12 ft .
Tiger Shark aggressively approached and circled Ryan McInnis in deep waters south of the Mississippi River ’s mouth .
Regarded by many as two of the world ’s best free diving spearfishermen , Craig and Cameron have come into contact with thousands of sharks .
Craig Clasen immediately swam to his friend with his spear gun .
‘ I positioned myself between Ryan and the shark and I tried to watch it for a second , hoping it would pass us by , ’ explained 32 - year - old Mr Clasen .
‘ I noticed that the shark was getting tighter and tighter and just kept trying to get a back angle on us and behaving in an aggressive manner .
‘ The shark made a roll and looked like it was going to charge us so I just went ahead and took the conservative route and put a shaft through its gills .
‘ Cameron and I have been around sharks for years and we all have a lot of experience with them but this encounter had a different feel to it .
‘ Down in my core I really felt the shark was there to feed .
I did n’t want it to come to that . ’
Craig spent nearly two hours wrestling with the giant 12ft shark , spearing it seven times and even attempting to drown the beast before eventually finishing it off with a long blade knife .
‘ Once I shot it in the gills I felt a moral obligation to finish the job , ’ says Craig .
‘ I did n’t want it to go on any longer than it had to .
I shot the fish like I would do any other fish and worked it up closer and did my best to kill it as humanely as possible .
‘ I speared it in the gills which I knew would kill it and from that I tried to put a shaft into its brain as quickly as possible .
‘ I shot it six times in the head with a spear and I was n’t having much luck – it was a slow drawn out process .
‘ Sharks are so resilient and so tough from millions of years of evolution they are just survivors .
‘ The best way and quickest way to finish the job and kill the shark and recover it was to get a rope around its tail , drag it from the back of the boat and attempt to drown it .
‘ In the end we had put a knife its skull once I got lose enough to it and use a long blade knife even after trying to drown it . ’

UPDATE :
When I wrote this post over a year ago , I had no idea it would garner such a big reaction and so strong opinions .
Ryan McInnis , the photographer at the incident , recently discovered the post and left a comment and his reaction .
As for everyone else , please keep it civil .
I will delete any flame comments , so far I ’ve had to delete multiple comments .
Ryan , thanks for your comment and for clarifying the story .
Here ’s Ryan ’s comment reprinted from below :
Wow …
I stumbled across this thread today and am amazed that 2 years after the incident there is still discussion about it .
I ’ll try to be brief :
– Spearfishing is the most ethical and sustainable way to provide seafood for oneself .
We were there to take tuna and wahoo .
– We were also there to capture video and images of a new product line for a company .
Businesses need promotional material of their gear in action .
– There was a combined 100 years of ocean experience in the water at the time this happened .
2 of us are from North Carolina where sharks are present on EVERY dive .
I personally have spent hours outside a cage with big great whites .
In other words , we know sharks .
– Our boat was over 50 yards away when this happened , getting out of the water would have been the first option of course .
But this event happened faster than the boat could get to us , and swimming away from an aggressive sharks is the last option .
– Once the decision had been made and the first shot fired ( which was a mortal shot ) , there was no other choice but to finish the fish .
They are tough and yes it took many more shots to end the struggle .
We took pictures and video because the initial danger was over .
– The mood was more than somber and the event cast a dark shadow on what was otherwise a great trip .
Killing a shark is an awful thing , and this was the first time in all of our years that it had been necessary .
– One of us was working on a story with Outside Magazine , they ran a photo as ‘ what you hope never happens ’… then the national media caught it ( 10 months later ) and before we knew it wild rumors and lies about the event began to spread .
And here I am today , still trying to explain why this happened .
What got lost in all of this is that I was nearly attacked by a fish twice my size and my buddy came to my rescue .
It ’s no different than a grizzly bear in Alaska being shot for charging a hiker .
It ’s terrible but it ’s part of sharing the outdoors with the natural residents .
We do n’t hate sharks but we do love spearfishing .
We did not benefit from this event at all , quite the opposite .

On June 1 , 2010 , thousands of Israelis gathered spontaneously in front of the Turkish Embassy in Tel Aviv to demonstrate in support of the Israeli Naval commando unit that killed nine passengers on the Mavi Marmara , a Turkish - backed boat from the Gaza Freedom Flotilla .
Egged on by the Israeli government and media , the demonstrators lashed out at Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan for his support of the Marmara , accusing him and passengers on the ship of terrorist ties .
Besides with the massacre of Turkish aid workers , the spectacle of massive Israeli protests against Turkey threatens to permanently rupture Israel ’s ties to its closest Muslim ally and further isolate the country on the world stage .
The rally provided a clear window into the mentality of many Israelis after the raid .
International condemnation has deepened the public ’s siege mentality , leading many demonstrators to claim that anti-Semitism best explained the world ’s motives .
The belief that the Mavi Marmara was a terrorist ship with support from an assortment of Islamic evildoers including Al Qaida was nearly unanimous , and was offered by rally participants as an excuse for their killing .
Many viewed the incident out in the shadow of the Holocaust , convinced that Marmara passengers had shouted at the commandos , “ Go back to Auschwitz ! ”
Such convictions were understandable in light of the aggressive propaganda campaign the Israeli Defense Forces and Israeli Foreign Ministry have waged in the wake of the flotilla raid .
The IDF has claimed that it discovered 40 “ Al Qaeda mercenaries ” on the Mavi Marmara and blasted out an audio clip purporting to show flotilla passengers proclaiming to the IDF , “ Go back to Auschwitz ! ”
Even though the IDF retracted its claim about Al Qaida operatives and was forced to concede that its “ Auschwitz ” audio clip was doctored , Israeli and American media outlets that reported the army ’s claims have not corrected their stories .
Consequently , many Israelis are accepting their government ’s view without a second thought .
As one demonstrator said , “ I believe every word our soldiers .
Every word ! ”
The rally was organized through Israeli Facebook groups and by the notoriously anti-Arab football club Betar Jerusalem .
It was only one of many spontaneous outbursts of extreme nationalism that have erupted across Israel since the flotilla raid .
Many participants in the rally remarked that they had not seen the public so thoroughly united behind the government in all their lives .
As one demonstrator put it , “ I ’m very happy [ about ] what happened because it united the country , and not all the Israelis , all the Jewish [ sic ] ; all united for a cause , and it ’s against the civil war that we always had . ”
BP shares have almost halved in value in the past two months as a result of the oil spill and the political storm that followed in the United States .

In a further blow to investors , the company announced last night that it would stop its dividend payments – traditionally among the most generous of all major companies – for the rest of this year at least .

Image caption Roads were empty during England 's first two World Cup matches
UK internet traffic rose by almost a third during England 's crucial World Cup match against Slovenia .
Figures released by internet service provider KC suggest that the game triggered a 31 % jump in web traffic , as users watched the game via the BBC 's live online stream .
Early figures suggest the total number of ' concurrent streams ' peaked at 800,000 although the total number of viewers will be many times higher .
The BBC said this was a viewing record .
Concurrent streams is the peak number of people who were watching or listening at any given point during the game .
It is not the same at the total number of unique users , which is considerably higher .
A spokesman for the BBC said the figure was a very early estimate , a more accurate figure would be released in the next 24 hours .
ITV came in for recent criticism when its servers struggled to cope with demand during the opening game between Mexico and South Africa .
Early reports suggest that the BBC servers managed to cope with the massive rise in demand .
A spokesman for the BBC said that they had " set aside as much capacity on our servers as we reasonably can " but warned that users ' own connection speeds could still have an adverse effect on the quality of the stream ,
" The open internet is n't an end - to - end managed network , so people 's experiences vary depending on their internet connection , " read the statement .
The surge in demand may well have been triggered by the fact many firms had made little , if any provision for their staff to watch the game in a more traditional way .
A survey of 1,500 small businesses by the software developer Sage found that only 20 % of firms had taken steps to prevent staff absenteeism during England 's games , with measures such as introducing a TV to the office during the tournament .
The World Cup 2010 has already broken several records for internet traffic .
Findings by Akamai suggest that global web traffic on the first day of the World Cup exceeded the limit set when Barack Obama won the US presidential election .
One the first day of the competition , traffic for news sites reached nearly 12.1 million visitors per minute , compared to 8.5 million visitors per minute during the night of the US presidential vote .
England play their next game on Sunday 27 June against either Germany or Ghana .

After months of speculation , I ’m finally heaving a sigh of relief .
Google Chrome will finally be here !
In an official announcement , Google ’s vice president of product management , Mr.Sundar Pichai confirmed the news of the launch .
The much awaited product from Google will be available from September 2010 .
Google Chrome OS is based on its highly successful browser by the same name .
As a first step , it is mainly targeted at netbooks .
The user interface is minimalistic and is expected to be high on performance .
The new OS is expected to be a direct challenge thrown at software giant Microsoft .
And experts feel that sooner or later , Google Chrome might eat into Microsoft ’s market share .
The best part of the OS is of course , that its open source ( Read free 🙂 )
So , thats good news for all you geeks out there .
Now , you ’re just a step away from laying your hands on Google ’s latest baby 😉

Like it or not , Call of Duty is going to have a subscription service attached to it sooner than we might think .
Activision has talked about adding a subscription service to its Call of Duty franchise in the past , but now CEO Bobby Kotick is itching to make it happen soon .
How soon ?
Tomorrow , if possible .
When asked by the Wall Street Journal what he would do with his company if he had one wish , he replied : " I would have Call of Duty be an online subscription service tomorrow .
When you think about what the audience 's interests are and how you could really satisfy bigger audiences with more inspired , creative opportunities , I would love to see us have an online Call of Duty world .
I think our players would just have so much of a more compelling experience . "
He left out that it would also generate millions of dollars , but that 's pretty much implied .
Kotick added that this kind of service is " hopefully " coming , and that he thinks " audiences are clamoring for it . "
But this is n't just about making money , it 's also about expanding the Call of Duty experience and creating something bigger , if Kotick 's further comments ring true .
He also said : " I think we could do a lot more to really satisfy the interests of the customers .
I think we could create so many things , and make the game even more fun to play .
We have n't really had a chance to do that yet . "
It would n't be crazy to expect a subscription service somehow associated with the Call of Duty franchise sometime by the end of 2011 if the top dog of Activision wants it to happen " tomorrow . "
I 'm wondering exactly what this would mean , though Kotick 's comments hint that he wants a persistent world that is still experienced through consoles rather than PCs .
You never know , the MMOFPS genre that has n't typically lit the online PC world on fire could be a perfect fit for the millions of people playing Call of Duty on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 .

Google is now activating 160,000 mobile phones using its Android software a day , equivalent to 4.8 m a month , according to the company 's chief executive , Eric Schmidt .
The number is also accelerating , having been put at 100,000 a day in the third week of May during Google 's annual I/O conference , Schmidt said – indicating sales growth of 60 % per month .
" We have seen a tremendous increase in adoption , " Schmidt said in an interview exclusive to the Guardian in the UK .
" We 've also seen a growth in the number of apps available for Android – there are now approximately 65,000 compared to only 50,000 a month ago . "
He believes that that means Android could have reached the volume necessary to become an essential mobile operating system – and perhaps the equivalent of Windows on PCs .
At those numbers , roughly 15 m Android smartphones would be sold every quarter , compared with a worldwide total of 54 m sold in the first quarter of 2010 , according to the research company Gartner .
Though Schmidt 's announcement was clearly timed to steal some of the thunder of Apple 's launch in five countries of the iPhone 4 on Thursday , Schmidt declined to compare the Android platform 's market position against its better - known rival .
Apple has said that it had orders of 600,000 in a single day for the iPhone 4 last week , and was unable to keep up with demand .
Google is notified whenever a smartphone using the Android operating system is activated by a mobile network .
In the US , a number of different models are sold on different networks from different manufacturers , including Motorola , which on Wednesday unveiled its latest Droid X phone on the Verizon network .
" It 's the best phone ever made on the fastest network , " Schmidt said – which could be seen as a dig at AT&T , which has the exclusive contract to sell the iPhone in the US but has struggled to satisfy users ' demands for mobile data bandwidth .
Asked whether he saw Apple or Nokia – which has the largest market share of smartphones – as Android 's biggest competitor , Schmidt said : " I try to spend my time not focusing on those questions . "
Android is a free mobile operating system which any handset maker can use and alter to produce a new version , while developers are able to write apps which will work on any specific version of the system .
However , while Apple has maintained a tight focus on its App Store , which has roughly 250,000 free and paid - for apps available , Google offers them via a " Marketplace " , and allows any app to run on Android " as long as it does not harm the network , " Schmidt said .
But calculations by a company called Larva Labs , which develops for Android , suggest that iPhone developers may be faring better financially than those on the Android Marketplace .
Steve Jobs said earlier this month that Apple has paid out $ 1bn to developers through a revenue split ( which has earned Apple roughly $ 420 m ) .
By contrast , Larva Labs reckons that Android developers have only earned $ 20 m in total from the Marketplace .
Schmidt said he had not seen the figures , but added : " Developers go where the volume is .
That 's the most important lesson of platform economics : it 's all about scale and volume .
It 's very important that developers get to a scale where they can see the ability to get to a very large audience .
We believe we have done so . "
Asked whether Android could become the equivalent of Windows for PCs – the dominant operating system – Schmidt said : " The advantage with Android is that anybody can use it .
In many ways it is better than Windows because it 's free , rather than Windows which had an ever - increasing price point . "
He declined to say whether Google has been talking to Nokia about the possibility of an Android - driven Nokia phone , or whether Google would release its own tablet computer similar to Apple 's iPad , which has sold 3 m units in 90 days .

Plant growth hormones : stem cell researchers elucidate complex interaction between auxin and cytokinin
The two most important growth hormones of plants , so far considered antagonists , also work synergistically .
The activities of auxin and cytokinin , key molecules for plant growth and the formation of organs , such as leaves and buds , are in fact more closely interwoven than previously assumed .
Scientists from Heidelberg , Tübingen ( Germany ) and Umea ( Sweden ) made this surprising discovery in a series of complex experiments using thale cress ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) , a biological reference organism .
The international team of researchers , led by Jan Lohmann , stem cell biologist at Heidelberg University , have now published their results in the scientific journal " Nature " .
( Nature , June 24th , 2010 )

All the above - ground parts of a plant - leaves , buds , stems and seeds - ultimately arise from a small tissue at the shoot tip , which contains totipotent stem cells .
Since plant stem cells remain active over the entire life of the organism , plants , unlike animals , are able to grow and develop new organs over many decades .
On the periphery of the tip , auxin triggers cells to leave the pool of stem cells , differentiate and form organs like leaves and buds .
Cytokinin stimulates stem cells to divide and proliferate ; it maintains the number of cells and thus the plant ’s growth potential .
Some of the genetic factors involved in cytokinin’s effect on plant growth were already known .
In the thale cress experiments , which concentrated on the growth zone at the tip of the shoot , Lohmann and his team now studied the role of auxin in the interplay of the two hormones .
It turns out that auxin directly interferes with a feedback loop involving two genes activated by cytokinin - ARR7 and ARR15 - which limit the effect of cytokinin .
Auxin suppresses these two genes , thereby boosting the effect of cytokinin .

" Auxin acts to support the pool of stem cells " , explains Jan Lohmann .
" When it triggers cells at the periphery of the growth zone to form organs , it still needs to ensure that enough stem cells are supplied . "
This keeps the number of stem cells from falling below a critical minimum , which is key for plant growth and survival .
" We ’re gradually beginning to understand how hormonal and genetic factors are interwoven to maintain the activity of the growth zone .
We now know that hormones and genes interact in multiple ways , each one affecting the other .
There are no solitary factors . "
1. Focus on the music .
Get it to the point where the audience only needs to hear it once to get it .
2 . Let people listen for free .
Then sell the physical product as a souvenir , and put out unique product online .
3 . One great track is better than ten mediocre ones .
4 . Do n’t worry about confusing the marketplace with more product .
It just allows new fans to discover a plethora when they finally tune in .
Meanwhile , the Internet allows the fulfillment of the true fan ’s dream , a steady flow of product .
In the old days , you were a fan of a band in high school , their next record came out when you were married .
Today , you can put out new songs while students are still in the same semester !
And you should !
5 . You must work live .
It ’s the best way to connect with people .
You ’ve got to be so good , you close the audience .
Performing is a different skill than playing in a studio .
Start honing your chops now .
Play anywhere and everywhere you can .
Not focused on the money , but the development of stage skills .
6. Radio is gravy .
People no longer believe radio builds career acts .
Do n’t be beholden to the airwaves .
See them as just another outlet .
7 . Make videos .
Creativity is key .
We ’re returning to the age of MTV .
Either play live , demonstrating your skills , which is how Andy McKee built a career on YouTube , or come up with an OK Go -type video .
Wow us visually .
The means of production are now in the hands of the proletariat .
Hell , you can get a Flip HD camera for $ 150 and you can edit on your computer …
8. Experience counts .
Everybody gets better the longer they do something .
9 . Haters abound .
If you ’re not being criticized , you ’re not doing it right , you ’re only playing in front of family and friends .
Hate intensifies the bigger you get , especially in the Net world , where everybody gets a voice .
There is no protection .
Wander into the world and experience the slings and arrows , toughen your skin .
10 . Respect your audience .
Do n’t send unsolicited MP3s , do n’t send unsolicited fliers .
Everything should be opt-in .
11 . Let your audience participate , let people help you .
They ’re dying to !
Stay in the houses of fans on the road .
Let fans design fliers and t- shirts .
Give them tools to promote you .
All they want in return is attention , and a bit of access .
These sneezers are your key to success .
Treat your core fans incredibly nicely .
In the old days it was about being nice to the PD .
Now you go directly to the fan .
12 . Put up live videos .
13 . Tweet .
14 . Be available on every social networking platform .
Of course , Facebook , but a new act could make headway using Foursquare .
Hell , have your fans come meet you at Starbucks !
15 . Press is a bonus .
Press is ignored by most people .
It ’s seen as hype .
Just keep thinking about being one on one with your fans .
16 . Do n’t think any one opportunity or gig is the key to success .
You never know what will break you through .
And most times , it ’s later than sooner .
And , if it happens too soon … momentum tends to peter out .
17 . Release dates are irrelevant .
You ’re in constant marketing mode .
But the best marketing is a great track , that will be spread far and wide .
That drop after the first week ?
It just got worse .
Was 33.9 % in 2000 , it was 62.8 % in 2009 .
SoundScan is spinning some phony baloney about pre-orders , old school " Billboard " is lamenting the lack of price and positioning and radio support , and you ’re sitting there saying …um , seems right to me !
The nineties are over .
Where the goal was to ship as much product as possible , create a public hoopla and not only see albums fly out of the store the first week , but for weeks to come .
First of all , people do n’t even want the album , they just want the track .
And most people do n’t care about the act anyway .
And they can ignore it .
In other words , you ’ve got to be in it for the long haul .
The really long haul .
You ’re better off not blowing your marketing budget in anticipation of the first week .
If you do n’t have a two year campaign in place , you do n’t believe in the project .
Or , you ’re working for a major label , inured to short term results , desperately trying to make sure you do n’t get fired .
In order to have sustained fans , you ’ve got to reach an audience with music .
Not with photo shoots , not with talking head TV appearances , you ’ve got to make sure people hear your music again and again .
But you should start with a small group .
That ’s what old wave media does n’t understand , how to harness the public , how to use social media to create a conflagration .
Old wave media believes you use social media to spread the word .
No , you infect fans , and then THEY spread the word on social media .
And it can take a very long time to happen .
And if you go for profits too soon , if you do n’t continue to improve the underlying product , you end up with something like MySpace .
A hit for a minute , then toast .
This is scary to the old timers .
They want insurance .
But that insurance can only be bought in a recording studio .
Yes , creators are more important than ever before .
Which is why labels keep going to the usual suspects , they do n’t want to take a risk .
But so many people are tired of this sound and have tuned out , and the oldsters are fighting over crumbs .
If you want longevity , you ’d better create a new sound .
Or at least an individual sound , a personality .
A good example of the future of music is Zac Brown .
He ’s been recording for years .
His album ’s been out for eons and he ’s still on the road .
Not on vacation .
Furthermore , word spreads about his passion for cooking , and his desire to feed fans .
This hook builds his audience .
Anybody can have a hit on the radio , but can you bring people to the show , can you get them to keep coming ?
My friend Jim Urie is lobbying to get ISPs to crack down on file - traders .
This is completely wrongheaded .
We do n’t want to cut down any access people have to becoming fans .
As for acquiring music … A better mousetrap is far superior to playing Whac - A - Mole .
Do n’t take away the cheese , make it more enticing !
We ’re never going back to the sales figures of yore .
Not because of theft , but because no one can get that kind of mindshare .
But you can get some traction .
If you ’re willing to work really hard , continuously , always leading with your music .

Real Madrid striker Gonzalo Higuain scored a hat - trick as Argentina saw off South Korea at Soccer City to all but book their place in the last 16 of the World Cup .
Higuain struck once in the first half and twice in quick succession after the break as Diego Maradona 's side made it two wins out of two in Group B and fired another warning that they are one of the teams to beat in South Africa .
An own goal from Park Chu - Young got Argentina off to the perfect start before Higuain nodded in , and after Martin Demichelis ' error allowed Lee Chung - Yong to pull a goal back , Maradona 's side got the goals their dominance perhaps deserved .
It was an authority they had exerted from the first whistle and , despite a spell of South Korean pressure in the second half as they pressed for an equaliser , Argentina were thoroughly deserving of the points .
South Korea coach Huh Jung - Moo , who played against Maradona at the 1986 World Cup , saw his team struggle to live with Argentina 's quick tempo and the quality of their pass - and - move football .
They took the lead when Lionel Messi 's free - kick from the left hit the unfortunate Park Chu - Young on the knee before flying in and the goal buoyed an already buzzing Albiceleste as they continued to attack the South Korea goal with pace and in numbers .
South Korea 's brief forays forward were resulting in the occasional shot from range , with Ki Sung - Yeung 's 25 - yard screamer flying narrowly over , but after Carlos Tevez had drilled a free - kick inches too high , Argentina doubled their lead thanks to more shaky defending .
This time , Messi and Maxi Rodriguez were allowed all the time and space they wanted to take a quick free - kick down the left and when Maxi 's cross was flicked on by Nicolas Burdisso , Higuain had the simple task of nodding in .
Angel di Maria then forced a flying save from Jung Sung - Ryong , and Messi thrilled the crowd with a brilliantly jinking run before clipping a shot narrowly wide from the edge of the box .
But with half - time looming , Dimichelis handed South Korea an unlikely lifeline .
Caught between deciding to clear his lines or pass back to his goalkeeper he did neither , and Lee nipped in to steal the ball off him and superbly finish past the advancing Sergio Romero .
Suddenly there was a game on , and the teams traded attacks after the break .
Higuain 's close - range finish brought a stunning save from Jung , and Tevez forced another save from Jung with his 20 - yard drive , while at the other end Yeom Ki-Hun wasted a golden chance to get South Korea back on level terms as he shot wide when through one - on - one with Romero after Lee 's fine pass .
Yeom paid the price when Argentina counter - attacked , and after Messi 's shot hit the post Higuain tapped in .
But they saved their best for last as Messi 's stunning chip enabled Sergio Aguero to cross for Higuain to head home to complete his treble .
It was the first World Cup hat - trick since Portugal 's Pauleta in 2002 and the first from an Argentine since Gabriel Batistuta in 1998 .
Zillow data for metropolitan Washington , D.C. , for instance , shows that housing prices on average have declined 33 percent since the peak .
But this average masks big differences .
In densely built inner suburbs , like Arlington , Virginia , and in the walkable , urban neighborhoods of the District of Columbia , prices typically dropped about 20 percent .
Housing on the suburban fringe , on the other hand , lost about half its value .
Many exurban homeowners who had purchased or refinanced in the mid-2000s are now well underwater .
Housing is such a large part of the economy that a sustained , robust recovery is difficult to imagine without a corresponding recovery in the building , buying , and selling of houses .
Indeed , housing has usually helped lead us out of prior recessions .
While home buying typically plunges when the economy turns south , life goes on .
People continue to age , children leave the nest , couples marry , babies are born , new jobs are taken .
When consumer confidence returns , the pent - up demand for different housing choices sparks a boom in construction and renovation .
The economic expansion during the 1990s , for instance , was fueled in part by a 44 percent rise in housing starts from 1991 to 1994 , providing substantial job growth early in the recovery .
But this time may be different .
As Zillow ’s satellite maps begin to indicate , what we face today is not just a cyclical housing problem , but a structural one as well .
Over the past decade , most house building occurred on the suburban fringe , in large part because that ’s where houses could be built most easily and quickly .
But now that the bubble has popped , we can clearly see that underlying demand in these areas is extremely weak , and oversupply is massive .
Nationwide , houses on the exurban fringes are now generally priced below the cost of the materials that went into building them .
That ’s usually the first step in the creation of a slum .
Owners have no financial incentive to invest in their houses if they will not get that investment back upon resale .
Developers have no financial incentive to build in those areas either .
Urban - style housing in walkable neighborhoods — including those in the inner suburbs — is what ’s in demand today .
And for a variety of reasons , that demand will intensify in the coming years .
Only by serving it can the country kick - start growth in an enormous and essential part of the economy .
Yet the creation of new , attractive urban spaces is slow and difficult , and becomes all but impossible without substantial new infrastructure .
Most of all , it relies on good transit options — especially rail links — around which walkable neighborhoods can develop .
Rail , biking , and walking infrastructure is the backbone of urban development , and as a country we ’ve for the most part neglected to build it in recent decades , in favor of new roads for new suburbs farther and farther away from metropolitan hubs .
To support growth in the next decade , we need to change that dynamic — and nourish our walkable urban spaces and neighborhoods .
Complicating matters , in these cash - strapped times we need to find a way to do so on the cheap .
Charred remnants remained this morning of the large Jesus statue iconic to Interstate 75 that was destroyed following an apparent lightning strike during a thunderstorm late Monday night .
-- Dayton Daily News
Why would God do such a thing ?
What could it possibly mean ?
Is the apocalypse nigh ?
Do I have to pay my parking tickets anymore ?
Herein , 19 possible reasons for His happy blasting of a six - story Jesus statue to fiery smithereens : *
1 ) You ever wake up one day and look at your leopard - print bedspread or your jacked - up Ford F - 150 pickup with the airbrushed scene from " Lord of the Rings " on the side , or maybe see your fifth wife 's giant box of pink wine in the fridge and go , " Oh my God , what the hell was I thinking ? "
You ever have that fine , epiphanic moment when you realize an eyesore 's an eyesore and it's time for some , you know , housecleaning ?
And what better way to rid yourself of some of the more hideous crap laying about than maybe tossing it into a nice bonfire ?
By the highway ?
In Ohio ?
God has those moments , too .
2 ) The late , great fundamentalist nutcase Oral Roberts , he who singlehandedly inflicted the nightmare of the megachurch on humanity , he who invented Oral Roberts University and spawned a hugely corrupt , slug - slick huckster son named Richard to run it into the ground , well , Oral reportedly had himself a hot little vision some 30 years ago , in which he claims to have encountered -- and chatted with -- a 900 - foot Jesus , which is as tall as the Chrysler building , thus making his casual conversation sort of like you talking to a flea .
Cute !
All of which is to say : A measly six - story , truncated half - Jesus made out of Styrofoam and coat hangers and Elmer 's glue , stuck on the side of an Ohio highway ?
You call that a vision ?
For that to be a real vision worthy of a pseudo - religious shyster worth his misfiring synapses , the thing should be on fire .
Aha !
3 ) I 'll let you in on a little secret :
God had nothing to do with it .
A shockingly large number of Americans do n't yet realize just how powerful the gay movement has become .
Few seem to comprehend what sort of nasty underworld forces have been unleashed thanks to all those sassy gay sitcom characters , the gay marriage movement and Ellen DeGeneres .
The homo energy wave has quietly been increasing in strength over the years and is now fully able , after millennia of bad Liza Minnelli impersonations , tight tank tops and Speedos , to actually control the elements .
Do n't you see ?
It 's all very timely , really .
Prop. 8 's ultimate fate is being decided as I write these words .
The evil gays needed to send a message to really freak out the homophobes .
Turning half the megachurch pastors , Catholic priests and Boy Scout leaders gay did n't seem to have any effect .
I 've got it !
Torch the giant Jesus !
So easy .
Next up : hailstorms of butt plugs during the Super Bowl .
Watch for it .
4 ) Oh sure , make all the jokes you want .
" God struck down his only son .
Again ! "
Or , " I guess God really hates Styrofoam ! "
Here 's what the fundamentalists think : " It 's genius !
Do n't you see God 's master plan here ?
He started a holy conversation !
We 're all talking about Jesus again !
He brought Christ back into the public consciousness !
Yay , God ! "
Sure , you could argue it's a form of the Savior that 's just a wee bit tacky , insulting and childish , not to mention a laughable piece of " artwork " you would n't wish upon a blind quadriplegic goat herder .
Whatevs .
As the Pharisees used to say : " No such thing as bad press , yo . "
5 ) He is resin .
6 ) The real Jesus of historical record , being a grizzled , husky , musky , dark - skinned Jew with short , curly black hair who rarely showered and smelled of goat droppings and dried sweat , and who had a thing for screaming random prophesies in the streets and talking about doom , fire and the unbearable hotness of Mary Magdalene , well , the real Jesus ' spirit has been quite displeased with being eternally depicted as a pale , soft - focus blond European hippie in bleached - out robes who likes to give lots of there - there - now hugs while watching professional sports .
Basta .
7 ) One word : S'mores .
8 ) Two more : Insurance money .
God has been eyeing the new Cadillac CTS Coupe .
In this economy ?
You do what need to do .
9 ) God : " Wait , what ?
That was supposed to be Jesus ?
It looked like Charles Manson after too many marshmallow peeps and a bad peroxide job .
Aw , dammit . "
10 ) Word has it the Hustler Hollywood sign sitting atop the adult bookstore across the street from the torched Touchdown Jesus was left unscathed , thus proving ( once again ) that God really does like porn .
And irony .
Or just needs a new contact lens prescription .
11 ) God is actually Larry Flynt .
12 ) Really , who does n't like to watch fundamentalists scurry about in a baffled frenzy , unsure what it all might mean , vowing to rebuild the tacky roadside hellbeast in honor of , well , of not really understanding much about divinity , or art , or how nature works ?
Not God , that 's who .
13 ) Thor had had just about enough .
14 ) Correction : Zeus .
15 ) Because God loves the smell of burning Styrofoam and fiberglass in the morning .
Smells like ... victory .
16 ) Reminder to all smartass born - again sons - of - god in the universe :
Do not toss your dad 's last carton of Camel menthols into the lake of fire as a gag .
He 'll flick his pinkie finger and torch your favorite little roadside attraction in an eyeblink .
So vengeful !
Shoulda known .
17 ) Hey , all kids and parents argue .
18 ) The revenge of science .
19 ) At last !
The End Times hath arrived !
Wrath , hellfire , lightning , burning Jesus , oil in the seas , plagues of grasshoppers , a black president , Gary Coleman dead , the works .
About time , no ?

Los Angeles city officials and downtown L.A. merchants were assessing the damage Friday morning after unruly fans celebrating the Lakers victory in the NBA Finals rampaged through the streets around Staples Center .
The Los Angeles Police Department deployed a huge force of officers hoping to prevent the looting and violence that occurred after last year 's Lakers championship win .
But although the situation in and around Staples Center was calm , there were scattered problems elsewhere downtown .
Crowds broke windows of storefronts , jumped on cars , set at least 15 small fires and threw objects at police .
The LAPD reported 38 arrests .
There were also several injuries , but the exact number was not clear .
An LAPD officer was hit in the head by an object apparently thrown at him and suffered a broken nose .
A Los Angeles sheriff 's deputy was hit in the head with a rock at a light rail station platform , said Sheriff 's Capt .
Mike Parker .
At 7th and Flower streets , a crowd of more than 500 people surrounded a Metro bus and numerous people attempted to pull the bus driver out through the driver 's side window , Parker said .
Deputies deployed tear gas and sting balls , causing the crowd to disperse .
They rescued the bus driver and the occupants of the bus .
A taxi driver was attacked , and his taxi was set on fire , Parker said .
While rescuing him , rocks and bottles were thrown at deputies , who used sting balls and stun bags to break up the crowd , he said .
They rescued the driver and , with the help of LAPD officers , took him out of the area .
Police fired non-lethal rounds to disperse a crowd at Figueroa Street and Venice Boulevard after several small fires were set .
Fires were also set at 11th and Hope streets , and at 7th and Flower streets , a taxicab was engulfed in flames .
At least one person was beaten as fights broke out on Flower Street near Olympic Boulevard , officials said .
A bicyclist was injured when struck by a Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department vehicle near 11th and Flower streets , according to the Los Angeles Police Department .
This week the House and Senate will appoint their conferees and begin work to merge the House and Senate versions of Financial Reform .
The stakes for America are high .
This article by Robert Kuttner previews the key issues :
… Despite the David - Goliath nature of this fight , a lot of good provisions are in either the House or Senate bills , and the challenge will be to make sure that the final law includes the stronger rather than the weaker version .
Among the key fights :
Derivatives : Senator Blanche Lincoln ’s language requiring that all derivatives trades be cleared on public exchanges , that no banking company with deposit insurance may also trade derivatives , and that sundry other loopholes be closed , survived fierce industry opposition and only lukewarm support from the administration .
Whether or not Lincoln wins her own primary Tuesday , this measure has increasing support of House and Senate progressives .
A companion measure by Sen. Maria Cantwell , which did not make it into the senate bill , would close more loopholes and require adequate capital for all such trades .
This approach now appears to have the support of both Senate Banking Chair Chris Dodd and House Chair Barney Frank , as well as Gary Gensler on behalf of the administration .
Banks want to continue their gambling games , and this is the number one target of the big banks to kill .
Consumer Protection : The House bill includes a free standing consumer financial protection agency , but it would be hobbled by the requirement that it report to a committee as well as limits on its jurisdiction .
The Senate version nests the proposed agency as an independent body inside the Federal Reserve , but without many of the restrictions .
This is one of the few provisions that enjoys the hands - on personal support of President Obama .
The challenge of the conference is to retain the best features of both bills .
Credit Rating Agencies :
It was the corruption of credit rating agencies that made possible the sub - prime meltdown .
Reform of these private agencies , such as Moody ’s and Standard and Poors , was not even part of the original legislation .
But a surprise amendment by Sen .
Al Franken requiring random assignment of agency ratings rather than payment of the agencies by clients narrowly passed the Senate and was included in the bill .
There is no House counterpart , and industry is gunning for this one .
But the House does provide that credit rating agencies are legally liable for deceptive practices .
Cover Auto Dealers : New and used car dealers are among the most notorious purveyors of deceptive bait - and - switch financing .
But the auto industry , which operates in every congressional district , worked with Senate Republicans on a parliamentary maneuver to win an exemption for car dealers ; a similar provision is in the House bill .
There is an outside chance that this could be reversed .
Both Dodd and Frank are sympathetic to reversing this outrageous carve - out .
Bring Back Glass - Steagall : Among the crucially important provisions that did not make it into either final bill is the Merkley - Levin amendment which would draw a bright line separating taxpayer - insured commercial banks from financial firms that gamble and trade derivatives and other risky other securities for their own accounts ( the " Volcker Rule . " )
There is still a decent chance that this could make it into the final bill .
Break up the Biggest Banks :
Another key provision that developed significant support but that was defeated in a floor right was the Brown - Kaufman amendment to limit the percent of deposits held by any one bank , and thereby break up the biggest banks .
But this measure will be back another day .
Duty to Clients : Among the most instructive revelations of the hearings , investigations and debates was the disclosure that big Wall Street houses routinely bet against their own customers .
An amendment providing that investment banks have a fiduciary duty to their clients was not included in the final senate bill , but has increasing support .
Fix the Mortgage Mess : The House and Senate bills both have modest reforms to tighten mortgage standards but no major breakthrough to end the logjam on refinancing distressed mortgages so that besieged homeowners can keep their homes .
This is also a fight for another day .
Despite its limitations , the financial bill is a start that progressives need to defend .
Given where we began , this process has come a long way .
At the outset , the administration was backing a far weaker bill .
House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank was hobbled by the presence of fifteen pro-industry " New Democrats " on his committee who weakened the bill at every opportunity .
As recently as March , Senate Banking Chairman Chris Dodd was on the verge of making a bipartisan deal with Committee Republicans for a measure that would have been reform in name only .
But as the public has begun paying more attention , as AFR has grown into the most effective financial reform coalition ever ; and as heroic progressive legislators have moved their colleagues , the bill has gotten better over time .
Other progressive leaders such as Elizabeth Warren and AFL - CIO President Rich Trumka have pushed public opinion , key legislators , and the Obama Administration .
All of this is no small achievement , given how esoteric most of these issues are to most voters … [ emphasis added ]

Michael Schumacher says he now regards the rest of the 2010 season as preparation for 2011 , with Mercedes looking unlikely to be a factor in this year 's championship battle .
The seven - time champion has yet to finish on the podium since returning to the sport , and is ninth in the championship at present - 59 points behind leader Mark Webber .
Schumacher admitted he had initially hoped to be a title contender from the outset , but was now taking a longer term view .
" You think in terms of the championship , that 's what is my aim and my focus , " he said .
" But then at one point you understand that your package is where it is and from there on you have to do a certain programme and process and that 's what we are going through .
" The year is still long .
I do n't think on my side that I 'm really in a position to win the championship , it 's more building up and organising things for what happens from next year onwards .
But you never know , it 's still a long year with many points to give . "
He insisted he was happy with the progress Mercedes had made so far .
" We are in a build - up process with the team that is going extremely well , " said Schumacher .
" I 'm very happy with how we work together , how we progress .
We do n't have the package to be in front right now , and after winter testing it was not expected to be .
But when I see where we are going , it 's very good . "
The German added that the Mercedes had not yet allowed him to recapture the feeling he had when on his best form in his initial career .
" Sometimes you have these very special races and moments where things really fit together perfectly and we are not there yet , " Schumacher said .
" I know I am coming there .
" It 's part of the reason that I 'm doing this , to get to that point .
But you need certain ingredients and we are still searching for those . "

I once knew a man who had small green leafy lumps all over his body .
He went to doctor and doctor 's first question was ' Have you been with a ' woman of the night ' ?
Yes , said the fella .
" Thought so " said the doc , " those are brothel sprouts " .

Stephen Hawking recently unveiled this $ 1.83 million clock at Corpus Christi College , Cambridge .
The frightening timepiece took seven years to build and is a tribute to John Harrison , allegedly the world 's greatest clockmaker .
The bizarre Corpus Clock visually explains that it relies on grasshopper escapement to function , and to let you know that time can never be regained once lost , that beast on top actually gobbles down time every 60th second .
Oh , and every hour , on the hour , the sound of a " chain dropping into a wooden coffin " is played to really pound home the " time is a destroyer " concept .
Wow , creepy .
Can you imagine this thing hanging on the wall in your house ?
I can -- I 'm rich as hell !
Hit the jump for a very worthwhile video of the thing in action .

I HAVE TO TRY THIS OUT !
THIS IS COOL .
I FEEL LIKE TYPING IN CAPS BECAUSE I DRANK SOME ~ ScreamingBadger ( https://www.deviantart.com/screamingbadger) :iconscreamingbadger : :iconscreamingbadger : :iconscreamingbadger : :iconscreamingbadger : :iconscreamingbadger : AND IT WAS DELICIOUS .
That 's all for now . :)
I was talking to someone recently about inking a project for them , and to rummage up some sample inked pages , I did a Google search for the above words “ Ty Templeton ink ” .
It seemed so much quicker than digging through my own files .
The internet is my friend .
I got what I expected , a bunch of pages from my various inking jobs over the years that people had in their collections and have scanned and put online .
All fine .
But I did n’t expect to find this :
That ’s my cover to Gotham Adventures # 1 … or a version of it … burned into someone ’s arm with needles and pain and the oh boy , sweet glavin !
The arm belongs to Craig Kandiko , and this and the other images I ’m going to show you are taken from his MySpace site which you can find here .
Craig is a Batman fan .
A serious Batman fan , and he ’s focused the meat and flesh of his fandom on the Gotham Adventures comic title as all of his tattoos are from covers of that series .
This is an ongoing project for Craig , as he ’s added to the Batman Animated gallery on his legs and other arms as the years have gone by .
I ’ll let you go to his site to see all his tattoos , some based on Bruce Timm , and some by Bob Smith – but since this is MY blog , I ’m showing you the two other tats he has with my artwork on his largest organ !
This is n’t the first time someone has tattooed my artwork onto their body .
I ’ve been sent a couple of images of a Riddler tattoo that a girl put on her lower hip a few years ago , and another one that features a JOKER I drew that ended up on someone ’s shoulder …. and a friend of mine has a design between her shoulder blades that I designed for her .
These are all small , singular tattoos that take up just a bit of someone ’s body , and I ’m flattered to see someone wanted my drawing or my character on them for life .
Craig is clearly the biggest Batman Adventures fan on Earth from this level of dedication .
So Craig , I salute you , and feature you on my blog .
I ’ll just say this , I often erase and redraw my figures while I ’m working on them .
Next time , I ’ll realize the importance to your very skin that I get every line right !

To share post :

You can parse a voting record .
Flip - flops  political ones  are fair game .
But do n’t talk about a woman ’s hair .
In one of those classic campaign gaffes , Carly Fiorina , the Republican nominee for the Senate seat held by Barbara Boxer , the California Democrat , was caught mocking Ms. Boxer ’s hair into an open microphone on Wednesday .
She also had a few tough words about the newly minted Republican candidate for governor and her B.F.F.- on- the - stump , Meg Whitman .
Ms. Fiorina ’s comments were , all told , really no more incendiary than a bit of warm pasta salad  who has n’t indulged in some off - the - record chitchat about the grooming habits of others now and then ?
But they presented her with a political problem that could haunt her throughout the campaign .
They both inform and confirm the image from her days as chief executive at Hewlett - Packard that she is tart and unpleasant .
And they open the entire campaign to perceptions , however tired or unfair , that women can be dragged down the road of pettiness , perceptions that detract from the serious and pressing issues of the day .
Iran has returned to the centre of international diplomacy , and with a vengeance .
A week after the crisis over Israel ’s assault on an aid - flotilla bound for Gaza , the United Nations Security Council on 9 June 2010 adopted a resolution imposing another tranche of sanctions on the Tehran regime over its contested nuclear programme .
The response - from Iran ’s ambassador at the UN to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at home - was characteristically vigorous .
In the anniversary week of Ahmadinejad ’s victory in Iran ’s disputed presidential election on 12 June 2010 , Iran ’s leadership is as determined as ever to withstand what it sees as unjust interference in its internal affairs .
But this is more than just another episode in an endless cycle of confrontation between Iran and the west in general and the United States in particular .
The Tehran - Washington polarisation remains one of the principal faultlines of global politics , but two additional elements in the current situation make it both more complex and more perilous than ever :
* the emergence of rising powers onto the global stage ( see Mariano Aguirre , “ Brazil - Turkey and Iran : a new global balance ” , 2 June 2010 )
* the deep concern in Israel about Iran ’s nuclear plans , and its influence over the Hizbollah movement in Lebanon ( see Robert G Rabil , “ Hizbollah vs Israel : the coming clash ” , 9 March 2010 ) .
A cascade of pressure
The Security Council Resolution 1929 , which imposes new restrictions on trade with Iran , was welcomed by Washington as a signal of the international - community ’s determination to take a tough line with Tehran .
The reality is more prosaic : after a lengthy process of negotiation among the council ’s permanent members , the content of the resolution was gutted in order to accommodate the concerns of Russia and China before they could vote for it .
Even then , it was opposed by two key non-permanent members of the council with influence in their region and in the majority - world , Turkey and Brazil ( see Leslie Bethell , “ Brazil : regional power , global power ” , 8 June 2010 ) .
The leaders of these two states , prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Lula , had agreed a uranium - exchange deal in Tehran on 17 May 2010 in an attempt to defuse the crisis ; this reflects both their ambition to play a more prominent role in the “ multipolar world ” and , more immediately , their deep concern about the possibility of an escalation of the crisis over Iran .
Turkey ’s active and confident regional diplomacy , not least the critical stance its government has adopted towards Israel ( before and after the assault on the Mavi Marmara , in which nine of its citizens were killed ) , has given the country a new profile across the middle east ( see “ Israel - Turkey - United States : Gaza ’s global moment ” , 3 June 2010 ) .
The challenge to leading Arab states that pursue a more conservative path , Hosni Mubarak ’s Egypt in particular , is evident ( see Sami Moubayed , “ Turkey 's Erdogan : Never a ' yes ' man ” , Asia Times , 10 June 2010 ) .
The sanctions issue is only one aspect of these evolving regional dynamics .
In themselves , the new measures will have little impact on a near - moribund Iranian economy ; and far from posing a threat to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s position , they may even ( as the Iranian analyst Ali Ansari suggests ) prove counterproductive by fuelling his regime ’s defiance of perceived western bullying .
A year after the eruption of street - protests following Ahmadinejad ’s contested election victory , a state that continues to work hard to suppress internal dissent can find a ready domestic audience by portraying the latest sanctions as part of an “ imperial ” agenda .
But three aspects of the sanctions package and their diplomatic context do have implications for Iran .
The first is that Russia is now unlikely to supply Iran with the S - 300 anti-aircraft / anti-missile system , as had earlier been agreed ( see " Russia to freeze missile sale to Iran , Putin tells Sarkozy " , Ha'aretz , 11 June 2010 ) .
The largely obsolete Iranian air - defence system would have gained great military benefits from acquiring the long - range S - 300 system ; the end of the deal will be a significant loss for Tehran .
The second is that Tehran may ( according to official Iranian media sources ) now revise its relationship with the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
The strong indication here is that Iran ’s government will limit the IAEA ’s access to Iran 's nuclear - energy facilities .
The cold rationale of this position is : if the UN Security Council is determined to sanction Iran more , even at a time when the Brazil - Turkey - Iran deal was on offer ( and even encouraged at one stage by the United States ) , why should Iran work with the United Nations ?
The third aspect is that the Barack Obama administration ( according to a report from Washington ) is preparing to shift the position on Iran 's nuclear ambitions that was elaborated in the national - intelligence estimate ( NIE ) published during George W Bush ’s presidency in December 2007 ( see David E Singer , " U.S. presses its case against Iran ahead of sanctions vote ” , New York Times , 8 June 2010 ) .
That NIE assessment - Iran : Nuclear Intentions and Capabilities - reached the conclusion ( surprising to many , given Washington ’s confrontational public stance towards Iran at the time ) that Iran ’s civil - nuclear - power programme was indeed developing rapidly , but that specific work on weapons - systems had largely ceased in 2003 ( see Jan De Pauw , “ Iran , the United States and Europe : the nuclear complex ” , 5 December 2007 ) .
The briefings now underway suggest that the the forthcoming NIE , while not directly contradicting the 2007 report , will find that Iran is ( possibly under the aegis of the Revolutionary Guards [ IRGC ] ) conducting applied - research programmes on matters such as the construction of nuclear - triggers .
The combination of these three factors amounts to a tightening of pressure on Iran .
At the same time , they do not portend any real prospect of United States military action against Iran .
Barack Obama ’s outreach to Iran during his first year in office , symbolised by his nowrooz ( new - year ) greeting in March 2009 , may have delivered little ; but his administration still maintains that it would prefer dialogue with Tehran leading to a negotiated solution .
But what applies to the United States most definitely does not apply to Israel .
A view to the north
Israel ’s plans and intentions towards Iran are a vital if uncertain component of the regional strategic landscape ( see “ Israel ’s shadow over Iran ” , 14 January 2010 ) .
It can not be said with any certainty that Israel is moving towards an early assault on Iran ’s nuclear - and missile - complexes .
What can be said is the view held by the current Israeli government of Binyamin Netanyahu - and shared to a great extent across the Israeli political spectrum - is that Iran ’s acquisition of nuclear weapons would represent an existential threat to Israel that must be prevented at all costs .
Binyamin Netanyahu outlined the three greatest strategic challenges to Israel in an important speech at the Sabin Forum in November 2008 .
In his view these are : Iran ’s nuclear ambitions ; missiles from Iran , Hamas ( in Gaza ) and Hizbollah ( in Lebanon ) ; and a pervasive international denial of Israel 's right to self - defence .
The attack on the Mavi Marmara on 31 May 2010 is part of the response to the last of these threats ( see Thomas Keenan & Eyal Weizman , “ Israel : the third strategic threat ” , 7 June 2010 ) .
The crisis over this event has received huge media attention , which to an extent has overshadowed an even more significant development in recent days : news in Israel both of the deployment of Scud missiles in Lebanon and of detailed Israeli military plans for a massive assault against Hizbollah .
The well - informed and reliable Defense News reports that the Israeli Defence Forces ( IDF ) have , since the failed war of July - August 2006 , fundamentally rethought its strategy and tactics .
The IDF is now ready for an even more intense - and , it is hoped , decisive - war with Hizbollah ( see Barbara Opall - Rome , “ Israel 's New Hard Line on Hizbollah ” , Defense News , 31 May 2010 ) .
At present , it seems that the planning for such a war does not envisage that it would be launched “ out of the blue ” but rather that it might arise from a provocation , a crisis with Iran - or sheer military miscalculation .
This “ known unknown ” notwithstanding , the details of the proposed operation are worth quoting at length :
“ … a new fight against Iranian - and Syrian - backed Hizbollah would see an all - out assault on the party 's arsenals , command centres , commercial assets and strongholds throughout the country .
But it would also include attacks on national infrastructure ; a total maritime blockade ; and interdiction strikes on bridges , highways and other smuggling routes along the Lebanese border with Syria .
Meanwhile land forces would extend a ferocious land grab well beyond the Litani River that Israeli brigades belatedly hobbled towards but failed to reach in the last war .
Finally , Israel would consider the kind of targeted killings that it now executes only in the Hamas - controlled Gaza Strip ” .
The Hizbollah movement which fought Israel to a standstill in the 2006 war - thus claiming victory in the aftermath - is now a senior partner in the Beirut government headed by Saad Hariri ; a third of Hariri 's cabinet are Hizbollah representatives ( see Zaid Al - Ali , “ Lebanon : chronicles of an attempted suicide ” , 20 May 2009 ) .
IDF planners view this domestic political compromise , the outcome of an extended and bitter post - war standoff , in terms of the Lebanese government ’s failure to control Hizbollah .
They draw the conclusion that Lebanon ’s national assets - including even the Lebanese army - are now legitimate targets .
Israeli claims that Hizbollah has now added Scud missiles to its already extensive arsenal - and may even intend to deploy them in northern Lebanon where they are difficult to counter - may or may not be correct .
But there is evidence that Hizbollah has greatly increased its arsenal of shorter - range weapons ; and its Iranian ally has steadily developed versatile solid - fuel medium - range ballistic - missiles that could reach deep into Israel and leave no part of the country immune ( see Amal Saad - Ghorayeb , “ The Hizbollah project : last war , next war ” , 13 August 2009 ) .
A last throw
The Israeli plans for a definitive war in Lebanon are part of a core military outlook that sees the demonstration of overwhelming military power against intransigent opponents who are resolutely against peace as the only route to security .
Before and after such armed confrontations , strong deterrence is needed ( see Avi Shlaim , “ Israel at 60 : the ‘ iron wall ’ revisited ” , 8 May 2008 ) .
An interview in Defense News with Israel 's deputy chief - of - staff , Major - General Benjamin Gantz , offers an unusually revealing insight into this mindset .
The journal paraphrases his warning “ that it could take repeated rounds of high - intensity wars to remove the Iranian - trained and financed threat from the north .
The aim , he said , is to prolong the periods of relative quiet between war fighting . ”
Major - General Gantz is then quoted directly :
“ Israel can not exist with protracted peaks of warfare .
Therefore we have to reduce them to reasonable levels - similar to the way we drove down terror in the aftermath of Defensive Shield [ the IDF 's operation in the West Bank in 2002 ] .
That way we allow our people to live reasonably under a protracted emergency situation until we fix it , and then we go back to square one . ”
“ I doubt there will be peace afterwards , but at least we 'll be able to extend the time between peaks …
Through strategic attrition - one round then another round - we 'll create a situation where each new round brings worse results than the last .
And that , in and of itself , brings a formidable deterrent . ”
Israel 's deputy chief - of - staff here exposes Israel 's security predicament ( see “ Hizbollah ’s warning flight ” , 4 May 2005 ) .
Israel is essentially impervious to any serious military attack by land or sea ; but the modern experience of rocket - assault - the Scud-attacks launched by Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq in 1991 , the hundreds of rockets fired by Hizbollah in 2006 , and even the crude devices launched from Gaza since the withdrawal of Israeli forces in 2005 - means that Israel is now living with a form of insecurity as ( or even more ) serious as anything since the Yom Kippur / Ramadan war of October 1973 .
The Binyamin Netanyahu government and much of Israel ’s military establishment think that peace is not now possible ; Israel can only be secure by being a fortress that periodically strikes out at its enemies to massive effect .
There are many dangers in this view ( see “ After Gaza : Israel ’s last chance ” , 17 January 2009 ) .
But its logic is also clear : that there is a real risk of another war before too long - and that this will be a double war , against both Iran and Hizbollah .
Up until today , whatever plan DC Comics had for dipping their toe into the world of digital comics was completely unknown .
When questioned at conventions , their answers rad from the reasonable ( " Wait and see " ) to the ridiculous ( " You ca n't read digital comics when a plane is taking off " ) .
Many fans , journalists , and retailers started to come to a conclusion : DC Comics is dragging their feet and in danger of being left behind .
Today , DC not only showed that they were playing their cards close to their vest , but they were waiting for an appropriate time to go all - in .
DC has now partnered with comiXology , the foremost digital comics gateway , and the PlayStation Network for a two - pronged distribution deal .
This puts their comics in front of the more than fifty million users of PSN and onto Apple 's iPad , iPhone , and iPod Touch , currently the trendiest of digital comics devices .
The current plan is to put an issue of Neil Gaiman 's " Sandman " online a week at Comixology , along with adding over one hundred issues of other DC titles a month to their digital library .
Releases for the launch include perennial fan - faves like " Batman : Hush , " " Fables , " and " Planetary , " and alongside the release of archive material there will will be day and date digital releases of " Justice League : Generation Lost , " a currently ongoing lseries .
This is kind of a big deal .
Marvel has , at best , flirted with the idea of day and date publishing .
Their upcoming " Iron Man Annual " is going to be released in stores and online at the same time , but that is currently all they 've announced .
DC , by announcing a continuing series as their step into the day and date arena , and a bi-weekly one at that , has instantly upped the ante , and it's a move that suggests that " Justice League : Generation Lost " is just the first of several ongoing day and date releases .
DC 's pricing structure is also a fascinating choice .
Rather than going with a flat fee of two dollars per issue , like Marvel has ( which has sometimes resulted in a digital issue that costs more than the printed copy ) , DC is using a tiered pricing structure .
Day and date releases will cost a full $ 2.99 , but prices will range from $.99 up to $ 2.99 .
Digital comics have been in a state of flux for the past few years , with several companies competing to become the leader in digital comics distribution .
Three companies were soon identified as being the most likely to succeed : comiXology , Graphic.ly , and Longbox Digital .
Right now , Longbox Digital promises a launch " on Macintosh and PC computer systems in Fall of 2009 , with handheld devices , eReaders , and game systems to follow . "
Graphic.ly offers Mark Millar and J.G. Jones 's " Wanted " as one of their featured titles , along with Mark Waid and Peter Krause 's " Irredeemable . "
Beyond that , most of their offered titles tend to be marginal Top Cow or Devil 's Due books .
Simply put , Graphic.ly does n't have enough titles that people want to read and Longbox Digital is still about as real as a unicorn .
comiXology , on the other hand , has had a comics app on the iTunes Store for a little under a year now , allows users to adjust their pull lists online , and built up a website that integrates with retailers .
They 've proved that they have what it takes to make digital comics work in a user - friendly way , and consequently have seen publisher after publisher sign up with them .
On comiXology 's Comics app , you can now find content from companies as varied as Marvel , Boom !
Studios , Dynamite , Dark Horse , SLG , and AdHouse .
Now , with the addition of DC Comics , comiXology wins almost by default .
They have the depth of catalog and variety of content needed to genuinely and truly make themselves a powerhouse in the world of digital comics .
On the same note , it 's fair to say that DC 's digital comics initiative is a shot directly across Marvel 's bow .
DC is leaping into the digital arena feet - first , and making the kind of splash that makes people turn their heads .
They may not have moved as quickly as some would have liked , but when they did move , they moved big .
While their first stab at day and date releases is promising , it is also going to force Marvel to make a play .
The relationship between DC and Marvel in the direct market has largely been one of constant and desperate one - upmanship .
This " Let 's Be Friends Again " strip is pretty close to accurately depicting their relationship .
Now that DC has one - upped Marvel 's digital comics strategy by going further with day and date and pricing , Marvel is going to have to rise to the challenge .
It may be a month from now , it may be around the time New York Comic - Con begins in the fall , or it may be the top of next year , but it 's soon .
Inside of a year , Marvel is going to have to take the plunge and meet DC 's challenge .
After that , we 'll really see what the digital landscape will look like .
For now , though ...
DC has scored a major win .
They put the doubters in check , put the ball back into Marvel 's court , and set the stage for expansion , not to mention opening the archives to a whole host of new fans .
There 's also this quote from DC co-publisher Jim Lee :
" " As both a comic book creator and Co-Publisher , it was incredibly important that our plan includes not only creator incentive payments , but also an innovative component that supports comic shop owners .
We see digital as an opportunity to grow our entire business . " "
The focal point of this statement is the phrase " creator incentive payments , " particularly given the questions about whether Marvel pays royalties on digital comics .
By specifically mentioning " creator incentive payments " and support for comic shop owners , Lee has not only positioned DC as the better man , but he has also quietly criticized Marvel .
Are we seeing a return of the classic Marvel and DC rivalry ?
Now 's definitely the time for it .
After unveiling what 's next for the most popular Windows Live client application , Messenger , and the most popular Windows Live web service , Hotmail , Microsoft is now ready to zero in on ( most of ) the remaining client applications in the Windows Live Essentials suite .
The Windows Live Essentials team says it focused on updating the applications in a way that complements Windows 7 ( and still works on Vista , but not XP ) .
Specifically , Microsoft says it focused on making three tasks easier : creating and sharing polished photos and movies with your closest friends , organizing your e-mail accounts in one place with flexible tools to be productive , as well as synchronizing files across your computers and accessing them from virtually anywhere with an Internet connection .
Microsoft is focusing on sharing so much because it says 60 percent of PC users share photos weekly and 25 percent edit and share videos .
At the same time , though , 50 percent of photos and 80 percent of videos that users take do n't get shared because they find it too hard to do so .
The Wave 4 release of Essentials still includes Windows Live Messenger , Windows Live Mail , Windows Live Writer , Windows Live Photo Gallery , Windows Live Movie Maker , and Windows Live Family Safety .
Windows Live Sync has received a major update and is now part of the suite .
The Windows Live Toolbar , meanwhile , has been replaced with the Bing Bar .
As we saw with the Wave 4 Milestone 2 leak , there are a lot of changes coming for each application , but Microsoft is only interested in outlining the features in Messenger ( already previewied in April ) , Mail , Photo Gallery , Movie Maker , and Sync .
" While you 'll see updates across all Windows Live Essentials applications in this release , we prioritized our investment in five primary applications based on the feedback we 've received from our customers , " a Microsoft spokesperson told Ars .
" We do n't have any specific details to share right now about the [ other three ] applications . "
In other words , there are n't many changes to expect for Windows Live Writer , Windows Live Family Safety , or the Bing bar .
Here 's what Microsoft is willing to share :
Windows Live Mail
Mail is still all about managing multiple e-mail accounts , calendars , RSS feeds , contacts and newsgroups in one place .
Offline access has been improved to encompass e-mails sent or calendar edits made while offline : they 're queued up and synced next time you get an Internet connection .
Shared calendars can also be accessed , viewed , and edited right from the program .
Windows Live Messenger integration means that you 'll be able to reply to a contact with an instant message right from the program since you can see their online status in the e-mail header .
As for inbox management tools , there 's conversation - threading ( different views for organizing messages ) and quick views ( filters that help you find certain items , such as unread mail from contacts only , flagged e-mails , all mail across inboxes , and so on ) for all your e-mail accounts , newsgroups , and feeds .
As we 've seen in leaked screenshots , you can now view your calendar without navigating away from the context of your inbox ( Microsoft is calling this Slim Cal ) .
Finally , Windows Live Mail will let you send up to 10 GB worth of photos via a link in one e-mail ( pictured above ) .
You can also add captions , layouts , and edit your photos directly while composing your e-mail .
Windows Live Photo Gallery
Photo Gallery is getting two very useful features : 1 ) Photo
Fuse allows you to take the best parts of multiple photos to combine them into one " perfect " photo with an easy - to - use editing tool ( pictured above ) , and 2 ) facial recognition technology finds pictures with people in them and deduces who is in those pictures based on who you have tagged in past pictures ( pictured below ) .
In addition , there are two new editing features : retouch , which help you remove things like blemishes , scratches , bruises , or stains from pictures , and batch auto adjust , which fine - tunes your photos ' exposure , color balance , and sharpness .
As for the actual program , the new Find Tab allows you to naturally filter your photos by faces , names , dates , geo-locations , descriptive tags , folder titles , or any combination of those , and the import feature works with Windows 7 to easily get photos and videos off your devices and organize them on your computer .
Windows Live Movie Maker
Movie Maker is getting AutoMovie themes ( pictured above ) .
AutoMovie will add a theme , which includes transitions , a title , captions , and a music soundtrack , to your photos and videos .
These same themes will be available in Photo Gallery 's slideshow mode .
Movie Maker is also getting better at editing audio and video : tailor your movie 's soundtrack or trim a video clip from either end .
The program can save in high - definition formats ( 720 p and 1080 p ) or to a portable device , such as a Windows phone or Zune HD player .
Sharing online on Facebook , Flickr , YouTube , or SkyDrive is built - in , and there will be plug-ins for other online sharing sites ( pictured below ) .
Some of this you 've already seen in Movie Maker 14 , the most recently updated Windows Live application .
Windows Live Sync
Sync lets you synchronize folders across your PCs and Macs .
Update a file on one computer , and it will automatically sync to the rest when they 're turned on and connected to the Internet .
Once your folders are synchronized , everything is available offline .
There 's also a remote desktop feature : leave your PC online , and you can access its files and apps from devices.live.com ( news of this one leaked back in August 2009 by finding your PC among the list of devices and clicking " Connect to this computer . "
What 's next ?
Microsoft is still refusing to share when it expects to release Windows Live Wave 4 .
A Microsoft spokesperson did , however , tell us that " tonight is only a preview , and the betas will be released in the coming months . "
Rumors have placed the public beta somewhere between the weeks of June 7 , 2010 and June 21 , 2010 .
That 's for Windows Live Essentials , meaning the client applications .
But what about the web services ?
Hotmail could start getting updated as soon as mid-month , but do n't hold your breath , as rollouts as large as this one tend to be done gradually .
The final release of Wave 4 should be done by the time we see Windows 7 Service Pack 1 .
John Goodman Weight Loss : Then and Now PHOTOS
We do n't know the secret of actor 's success but he appears to have shed a significant amount of weight in the past eight months , as evidenced by our before and after photo gallery .
Goodman , 58 , was on hand last night for the American Film Institute salute to director Mike Nichols at Sony Pictures Studio .
He was looking decidedly dapper in his well cut tux .
The veteran actor has been a television , film and stage mainstay for 35 years , perhaps best known for his role as Dan Conner on the television sitcom " Roseanne " .
He appeared in numerous films by Joel and Ethan Coen , and replaced John Belushi in the popular Blues Brothers Band .
He was the voice of Sully in the Disney Pixar film " Monster 's Inc. " , and had the lead role in the 1994 movie " The Flintstones " .
His latest films include " Thicker " , in pre-production , and " The Cross " , currently in production .
He is also slated to be the voice of Paul Bunyan in " Bunyan and Babe " and will reprise his role as Sully in " Monsters , Inc. 2 " .
Goodman has battled alcoholism for many years .
In a 2009 interview he said , " I had a 30 - year run , and at the end I did n't care about anything .
I was just fed up with myself .
I did n't even want to be an actor anymore .

Afghanistan Is Not Like Iraq , Even If The Same General Is In Charge
The odds that David Petraeus will be able to pull off a miracle in Afghanistan like he did in Iraq are very slim .
Doug Mataconis · · 7 comments
Thomas Ricks , a Washington Post military reporter who wrote Fiasco : The American Military Adventure In Iraq is out this morning with a piece explaining why General David Petraeus ’s success in Iraq does not provide any guideline for how his strategy and tactics might fare in Afghanistan :
What allowed Petraeus to succeed in Iraq was not the troop surge itself ; after all , a city as big and sprawling as Baghdad , with 5 million people living in two - and three - story homes , can swallow 30,000 troops without a burp .
Nor was it his development of a counterinsurgency doctrine for the Army .
The key tenets — such as focusing on protecting the population , while still going after the diehard insurgents , and splitting rather than uniting the enemy — were familiar stuff to anyone who had read the books .
It seemed novel only in the context of Iraq , where for many years the American commanders had terrified families by knocking down doors in the middle of the night , treating locals not as the prize to be won but as the playing field on which they confronted the insurgents .
Rather , Petraeus ’s critical contribution in Iraq was one of leadership :
He got everyone on the same page .
Until he arrived , there often seemed to be dozens of wars going on , with every brigade commander trying to figure out the strategic goals of a campaign .
Before Petraeus arrived , the top priority for U.S. forces was getting out .
After he took over , the No. 1 task for U.S. troops , explicitly listed in the mission statement he issued , was to protect the Iraqi people .
Of course , establishing cohesion in the nation ’s effort in Iraq took a lot more than issuing statements .
In spring 2007 , I watched Petraeus work hard to establish a consensus about what the goals should be and how to achieve them .
“ There are three enormous tasks that strategic leaders have to get right , ” he told me one day in Baghdad .
“ The first is to get the big ideas right .
The second is to communicate the big ideas throughout the organization .
The third is proper execution of the big ideas . ”
An astute bureaucratic operator , he used a variety of studies and panels convened in his Baghdad headquarters to pull together the big ideas of how to deal with the insurgency , how to better protect the Iraqi people .
These had the useful side effect of getting buy - in from civilian American officials in Iraq .
Just as important , he worked tirelessly with his military subordinates , going out and talking not just to the division commanders below him , but to their brigade commanders and even to the battalion commanders an echelon below them .
He issued letters to the troops explaining the new approach of living among the people and protecting them with small , vulnerable outposts .
He walked the streets and talked to Iraqis .
He also hired a leading counterinsurgency expert , David Kilcullen , an Australian infantry officer turned anthropologist , to coach American commanders , making sure that they not only talked counterinsurgency but that they also learned how to practice it .
In a series of interviews I conducted with Petraeus in 2007 and 2008 , one of his favorite words to use was “ relentless . ”
It is the best one - word summary of his approach .
When he arrives in Kabul , however , Ricks notes that Petraeus will find himself in a much less unified position than he had in Baghdad :
In Kabul , alas , Petraeus will find no such useful ally in the American ambassador .
Instead , the top U.S. diplomat there is Karl W. Eikenberry , who relentlessly opposed McChrystal ’s initiatives .
Unlike Crocker , Eikenberry has no strong base in the State Department and is not steeped in the history and culture of the region .
Rather , he is a retired general who in fighting with McChrystal over the past year used many of the same arguments that another American commander , John Abizaid , had used in opposing Petraeus ’s approach to Iraq .
That is no coincidence — Abizaid and Eikenberry have been close friends since they were West Point roommates in the class of 1973 .
On top of that , Petraeus will have to deal with Richard C. Holbrooke , who seems to have achieved little as a special presidential envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan .
And the general will face a host government even more troublesome than what he dealt with in Baghdad .
Indeed , the two biggest problems the United States faces in Afghanistan are the Karzai government and the Pakistani government — and neither of those really can be addressed by military operations .
McChrystal was dismissed because of the magazine article that laid before the world the sniping and backbiting between U.S. military and civilian officials in the Afghan war .
That is not going to end just because Petraeus goes to Kabul , or even because the president has said he does n’t like it .
It might end only when one person is put in charge of the overall American presence in Afghanistan , with the power to hire and fire .
Obama has not taken that step , so it is likely that the same nettlesome quarrels that exasperated McChrystal also will fatigue his successor .
What this seems to obviously argue for , of course , is a re-working of the civilian leadership on the American team in Afghanistan .
Obama has shown no signs that he’d be willing to do that and his reliance on Holbrooke in particular as his “ eyes and ears ” on the ground is quite apparent .
Until that happens , the personality conflicts that came to a boil in the McChrystal interview will , most likely , continue to exist .
Ricks misses the point , however , by just concentrating on the personality conflicts on the American team .
In addition to disunity among his civilian counterparts , after all , Petraeus will also encounter in Afghanistan a nation that is far less unified than Iraq ever was , and a civilian government that has far less credibility on the ground .
That fact alone argues strongly that a strategy that has , as it ’s base , the idea of unifying the country , will be difficult to pull off successfully .
Petraeus pulled George W. Bush ’s feet out of the fire in Iraq , but it ’s highly doubtful that he ’ll be able to accomplish the same thing for Barack Obama .

Samsung announced it will begin shipping a new fast 512GB solid - state drive sometime in July , with the storage unit using toggle - mode DDR NAND flash for even better performance .
The new Samsung 512GB SSD has a read speed up to 250MB/ sec and a write speed of 220 MB / sec .
The company said owners can transfer two entire DVD movies ( 8 GB of content ) in one minute or less .

Since Samsung ’s SSD uses a synchronous interface — allowing it to use a higher bandwidth — the drive should also include power savings from a new low - power controller .
Using the SSD automatically if it enters low - power mode could help extend a device ’s battery life around 60 minutes .
“ The highly advanced features and characteristics of our new SSD were obtained as a direct result of an aggressive push for further development of our NAND flash technology , our SSD controller and our supportive SSD firmware , ” said Dong - Soo Jun , Samsung memory marketing VP , in a press statement .

Samsung hopes the industry embraces its toggle DDR memory , which could help bring in the “ new wave of high - end SSD technology . ”
I ’m not as optimistic that this Samsung offering will help usher in a new era , but it should definitely help the industry make one more step in the right direction .
The use of the synchronous interface should increase with more manufacturers looking to expand from the asynchronous interface .
I especially like the power savings offered by this new SSD , especially since I use my notebook and netbooks for extended periods without AC power .
​ Maybe there should be an IQ test for police officers .
What was first thought to be one of the largest marijuana seizures in the Corpus Christi Police Department ’s history turned into an embarrassing incident for the cops , as the clueless officers spent a busy and exciting evening harvesting hundreds of harmless weeds from a city park .
The revealing incident began when a teenager riding his bike through Waldron Park in Flour Bluff discovered what he thought were pot plants growing there about 8 p.m.
Thursday , reports Bart Bedsole of KRIStv.com
The would - be junior narc wasted no time in excitedly reporting his “ find . ”
Police then self - importantly hauled away 300 to 400 medium - sized plants that they , too , believed were marijuana .
Exhausted officers only stopped collecting the harmless plants because it got too dark to work ; they planned to return bright and early in the morning to look around for more marijuana .
Trouble is , after spending more than an hour laboriously removing and tagging hundreds of plants , and then hauling it all to the police department downtown , testing revealed that none of it was marijuana at all .
“ This is exactly the caliber of police work that is done in Corpus Christi , Texas , ” wrote Derrick Sillers , one commenter on the original news story .
“ The residents of Corpus [ Christi ] and Nueces County should seriously be concerned with how their tax dollars are spent .
This is the same police department that serves , protects and investigates you . ”
Embarrassed officers have n’t given any word yet on what the plants actually were .
Neither did they explain how their big “ drug haul ” will be disposed of , now that they ’ve spent untold hours and plenty of taxpayer money clearing weeds out of the city park .
Image caption Eadgyth spent her childhood in southern England
Scientists have revealed that they think bones found in a German cathedral are those of one of the earliest members of the English royal family .
The remains of Queen Eadgyth , who died in 946 , were excavated in Magdeburg Cathedral in 2008 .
The granddaughter of Alfred the Great , King of Wessex , the Saxon princess married Otto I , Holy Roman Emperor , in 929 .
The findings were presented at the University of Bristol on Thursday .
A spokesman from the university said the bones were the oldest surviving remains of an English royal burial .
As the half sister of Athelstan , who is considered to have been the first king of all of England , Eadgyth had at least two children with Otto and lived most of her married life in Magdeburg , in what is now the state of Saxony - Anhalt .
She died aged about 36 .
She was buried in the monastery of St Maurice but her bones were moved at least three times .
She was finally interred in an elaborate tomb at Magdeburg Cathedral in 1510 , wrapped in silk in a lead coffin .
A study of the bones at the University of Mainz confirmed that the remains were those of a woman who died aged between 30 and 40 .
Professor Kurt
Alt found evidence that she was a frequent horse rider and ate a high - protein diet , including a lot of fish , hinting at her high status .
Director of the project Professor Harald Meller , of Germany 's State Office for Heritage Management and Archaeology , said : " Medieval bones were moved frequently and often mixed up , so it required some exceptional science to prove that they are indeed those of Eadgyth .
" It is incredible that we have been able to do this using the most recent analytical techniques . "
Banished to a monastery
Crucial evidence came from the study of teeth in Eadgyth 's upper jaw .
Researchers at the University of Bristol 's Department of Archaeology and the Institute of Anthropology at Mainz University studied strontium and oxygen isotopes that mineralise in the teeth when they form .
Dr Alistair Pike , from the University of Bristol , explained : " By micro -sampling , using a laser , we can reconstruct the sequence of a person 's whereabouts , month by month up to the age of 14 . "

The queen was interred in an elaborate tomb
They found the isotope results exactly matched records of Eadgyth 's childhood and adolescence in Wessex .
Professor Mark Horton said : " Eadgyth seems to have spent the first eight years of her life in southern England , but changed her domicile frequently , matching quite variable strontium ratios in her teeth .
Only from the age of nine , the isotope values remain constant .
" Eadgyth must have moved around the kingdom following her father , King Edward the Elder , during his reign .
" When her mother was divorced in 919 - Eadgyth was between nine and 10 at that point - both were banished to a monastery , maybe Winchester or Wilton in Salisbury . "
Her bones will be reburied in Magdeburg Cathedral later this year , 500 years after they were interred there in 1510 .
The Department of Justice is reportedly looking into Apple ’s bullying ways in the digital music market , where its iTunes music store accounts for 70 percent of digital music sales and 28 percent of all music sales in the United States .
At issue : Apple ’s objection to Amazon ’s sale of certain albums exclusively , for one day and sometimes in advance of their official release dates , as part of a Daily Deal program launched nearly two years ago .
Since then , Amazon ’s program apparently became too successful for Apple ’s liking .
Jobs and company began complaining to music executives about Amazon ’s alleged special treatment around March of this year , according to Billboard .
For Apple , the situation came to a head when Amazon began asking labels participating in the program for free promotion on MySpace and other sites .
“ When that happened , ” an anonymous music executive told Billboard , “ iTunes said , ‘ Enough of that shit . ' ”
Now , Apple ’s pressure on labels to withdraw or amend Amazon ’s special - deals program appears to have drawn the attention of the Justice Department .
The New York Times reports that Justice Department staffers are asking around at labels and digital music companies to find out whether Apple has unfairly exerted its dominance of digital music to try to crush Amazon ’s bargain music promotions .
The Justice Department was also reportedly looking into Apple ’s stance towards developers for its iPhone OS platform , and has likewise rattled its saber in Google ’s direction .
We can understand why Apple would object to Amazon making deals to sell music on the cheap in advance of its official release date , especially because the same labels typically call up the lawyers when people circulate pre-release music , and because the same labels have been largely responsible for the high price of the digital music .
However , we can also understand why the Justice Department would raise an eyebrow .
Apple could be overstepping its bounds in the eyes of antitrust authorities by pressuring the labels to end their participation in Amazon ’s bargain music program , which currently beats iTunes in pricing on several currently promoted albums , apparently with the labels ’ help .
This sort of thing sometimes leads to an investigation — and other times it ’s just a way to get the press to send a message to a company that it had better start minding its p’s and q ’s unless it wants a stern talking to .
For instance , after antitrust authorities said they were concerned about Apple ’s blockage of the Google Voice app , Apple relented HTML5 put Google Voice on the iPhone anyway , accessible through a Safari bookmark that looks like a home screen app .

The American Dietetic Association ( ADA ) wants to create a monopoly on state nutritional licensure .
This organization — which lists among its corporate sponsors soft drink giants Coca - Cola and PepsiCo , cereal manufacturers General Mills and Kellogg ’s , candy maker Mars , and Unilever , the multinational corporation that owns many of the world ’s consumer products brands in foods and beverages — already has a stranglehold on who can dispense nutritional counseling at the state level .
The latest battle is in Michigan .
So far , the Michigan Board of Dietetic and Nutrition has voted to accept the Commission on Dietetic Registration ( CDR ) as the sole certifying agency .
The CDR is the ADA ’s credentialing arm .
We recently sent Michigan officals a letter asking them to recognize more than one certifying organization .
We are requesting , at a minimum , the acceptance of reputable nutrition - based credentialing agencies such as the Certification Board for Nutrition Specialists ( CBNS ) or the American Clinical Board of Nutrition .
As our position paper notes , there is a major philosophical difference between nutritionists and dietitians — they are two entirely different fields of study and practice .
In general :
Nutritionists are health practitioners with comprehensive knowledge of the impact nutrition has on the whole body .
They focus on nutrition therapy for better health , metabolism , and biochemistry , and practice an integrative approach to health , concentrating on the prevention and treatment of chronic disease .
Dietitians ’ training focuses on institutional diets and food service management — developing diets for hospital patients , school food service programs , and nursing homes , although they can also provide individualized counseling on diet and disease .
Hospital food by law is controlled by dieticians , and almost everyone recognizes that the poor food in hospitals is a medical disgrace .
As noted , that there can be an overlap in the type of work each profession practices .
There are many different dietary and nutritional therapies to choose from , which is why freedom of consumer choice is absolutely essential in this field .
By accepting only a single credentialing agency — one run by the dieticians , not nutritionists — the Michigan board is establishing a “ one- size - fits - all ” dietician standard for both nutritionists and dietitians .
This removes all competition , essentially handing the ADA a monopoly over nutritional therapy .
Licensing in this field should not be an excuse for an ADA monopoly .
Michigan may not even realize that it is also barring the best - educated , most highly qualified professionals from providing nutritional therapy to Michigan residents .
Other credentialing agencies ’ standards are higher than those of the ADA .
The CBNS , for example , requires an advanced degree in nutrition , 100 more hours of supervised experience than the ADA requires , and a certifying examination ( even if the nutritionist has a doctoral degree ) .
It is outrageous that consumers should be denied access to expert advice on nutrition from the most highly educated and well - respected professionals in the field .
In order to adequately protect the profession of nutritional therapy , certifying organizations that specialize in nutrition ( and not simply dietetics ) must be recognized .
And we believe the citizens of Michigan — indeed , the citizens of every state — have the right to choose their form of nutritional therapy from as large a pool of professionals as possible .
Our website has a chart showing your state ’s licensing status .
ANH–USA advocates for access and choice — to ensure that consumers have unencumbered access to healthcare treatments , and that practitioners have the autonomy to practice in a manner that is truly in the best interest of their patients .
Because of this , last week we sent a special alert to our members in Michigan asking them to contact the Michigan Board of Dietetic and Nutrition to express their concern before the board meeting ( scheduled for today , Tuesday ) .
We have been working on this issue for two years , and since our involvement , we have involved our members in active states , and we have prevented any monopolies .
We ’ve stopped bills from going through in Wisconsin and New Jersey .
Michigan and Delaware had already passed legislation and are in the rules phase , but we were able to stall the rules process in Michigan and have gotten the CBNS included as a credentialing organization in Delaware , preventing a complete monopoly .
Grassroots activism is our strength .
We will keep you involved at the state level whenever and wherever you can make a difference .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama ’s muted call for comprehensive energy legislation failed to sway a hesitant Congress on Wednesday , with hopes for approval before November elections fading fast .

In his first national address from the Oval Office , Obama said on Tuesday the Gulf of Mexico oil spill provided a chance to break the U.S. dependence on fossil fuels and find new ways to power factories , automobiles and electric utilities so they emit fewer global - warming pollutants .
But he offered no specifics , and the lack of guidance frustrated some supporters and lent little urgency to an issue that has fallen down a crowded list of congressional priorities less than five months before the congressional election .
“ Some say you ’ve got to bring climate change to the floor of the Senate right now .
I do n’t think there ’s 60 votes for a climate change bill , ” said Senator Byron Dorgan , a member of the Democratic leadership , referring to the number of votes needed to overcome Senate procedural hurdles .
Dorgan instead favors quick passage of a less ambitious bill approved by the Senate Energy Committee last year encouraging broader use of alternative energy .
In an effort to whip up support in Congress for an energy bill , Obama will meet leading Republican and Democratic senators next week .
Democrat Joe Lieberman , Senate co-sponsor of a comprehensive energy approach , said Obama ’s involvement would make it easier to get something through the Senate .
“ I think the president is really focused on this now , and he can make all the difference , ” he told reporters .
But Obama ’s failure to specifically push for a comprehensive strategy in his speech was a missed opportunity , said Bill Galston of the Brookings Institution , a former adviser to President Bill Clinton .
“ The president ’s speech tacitly sounded the death - knell for the inclusion of serious climate change provisions in any energy bill that Congress might enact this year , ” he said .
After long and contentious debates on a healthcare overhaul and financial regulatory reform , Congress has little appetite for another major political battle that forces lawmakers to take difficult votes shortly before voters render verdicts on their work .
The legislative agenda for Congress is already jammed , as lawmakers try to complete work on the overhaul of financial regulations , confirm a new Supreme Court nominee , bolster job growth and consider possible action on immigration and taxes .
SENATE DEMOCRATS TO CONSIDER APPROACH
Senate Democrats will meet on Thursday to discuss their approach on energy and the environment , with Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi hoping to decide how to proceed by July 4 .
Obama ’s fellow Democrats are battling to retain control of Congress in November , when they face heavy election losses amid a broad wave of voter unhappiness over high unemployment and the stumbling economy .
Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana said it would be hard to pass a comprehensive energy bill this year , but the oil spill could help galvanize support .
“ It ’s going to be very difficult , but I do n’t think it ’s impossible , ” she said .
“ Big events like this move people , move the public and when the public moves , their leaders move . ”
Republican Senator Lamar
Alexander said an energy bill would take weeks of floor debate in a Senate that is already experiencing heavy fallout from the yearlong battle over the healthcare overhaul passed in March .
“ It ’d be hard to get all that done , ” he said .
“ I think we should take steps toward clean energy rather than try to do anything comprehensive . ”
Signs of election - year paralysis are already evident in Congress , where neither the Senate nor House has approved a budget blueprint this year and it appears unlikely they will .
“ A Congress that ca n’t pass a budget is going to pass the most expansive environmental legislation in decades within months of an election -- what are the odds of that ? ” asked Steven Schier , a political analyst at Carleton College in Minnesota .
The focus in Congress will be on the Senate , where global warming legislation has languished since the House narrowly passed a bill a year ago .
So far , the 60 votes needed for any legislation have not clearly emerged .
The Senate has a few options .
One likely outcome is that senators package a bill that gets tough on offshore drilling and also encourages more alternative energy sources .
A less likely outcome is that those elements of a bill are coupled with the comprehensive climate change legislation senators Lieberman and John Kerry are pushing to reduce U.S. carbon dioxide pollution by 17 percent by 2020 , from 2005 levels .
“ The president now needs to lay out the specifics .
What exactly are the steps we know we can take now ?
What kind of sacrifices can be made ?
How can every American help ? ” said Michael Brune , executive director of the Sierra Club .
You ’re ready to hit the trails and soak up all the cultures the world has to offer … but you have no clue how to say please , no thanks , or can I have a steaming cup of strong coffee straight up .
You slide into a mild panic about being overcharged for your hotel room or thinking you ’re ordering kidney beans only to end up with a steaming platter of sautéed kidneys .
True story .
It happened to me in China — me and my Pimsleur dictionary .
It ’s not the dictionary ’s fault , though .
Its job is to cough up words for me , not show me how to use them .
Still , lunch that day was a very illuminating experience !
The best way to avoid these kinds of situations is to tune up your language skills or at least get the basics down before you step on the plane .
Here are some places you can get language lessons , from free to pricey .

Maybe you can swap language lessons with someone .
You teach them English and they teach you French or Chinese .
Ask around and see what you find .
Otherwise , your local community college , small language schools in your community , or Berlitz are great choices for gaining a few language skills before you take off .
So dust off the old books , fire up your neurons and get studying .
The world is awaiting your arrival .
Oh lord how did they get in there ?
Are you positive it 's bees or just a malfunctioning sound of the T.V ?
It 's from craigslist so who knows .
If its actually bees they will die .
Admit it .
You always thought you were getting ripped off even though you bundled your cellphone with your Internet and added cable and a home phone to boot .
Well , you ’re right .
Rogers Communications on Friday announced about 300,000 customers never received the correct discounts for all of their bundling .
It seems there were some clerical errors and system - related issues with the Better Choice Bundles package that offered discounts of up to 15 per cent if you had all four services .
They ’ll be refunding about $ 30 million , including interest and taxes to current and former customers .
That sounds like a lot of cash but the average refund will be around $ 100 .
Another 200,000 customers , give or take , actually received a better discount than they should have but do n’t worry , you wo n’t have to give any of that cash back .
“ Once we identified the issue , we initiated a comprehensive review of current and former customer accounts to identify those that were not correctly billed , ” said Phil Hartling , a senior vice - president with Rogers in a news release .
“ We have been working around the clock to make this right and we apologize to our affected customers . ”
Customers do n’t have to do anything .
Notices are being sent out on June 22 and the correct discount will be applied against your next two bills .
All existing customers who paid too much will receive a credit on their account .
Former customers will get a refund cheque in the mail , if they have your current address .
Inspired by a trip to Disney , this Tiki bar is one of many hand - built structures in Steve Guizzo 's Aventureland themed backyard in British Columbia .
Starting with plans for a garden shed and using only rusted and weathered materials , he created a theme park worthy design which has entertained his friends and family for several years .
" It 's always evolving , " he says , and recently he has added a grill and plumbing to the bar .
Here are the basic step - by - step plans for Guizzo 's tiki bar — lanterns , fishnets and other trinkets not included .
For more on Guizzo 's creations check out his Web site .
Tiki Bar Plans ( PDF , 1.3MB , requires Adobe Reader )
1/2 yard driveway gravel or other aggregate ( for foundation base )
11 - 3 ½ x 3 ½ x 8 ' pressure treated fence post ( or 4 x 4s if desired )
12 1 x 6 x 8 ' pressure treated radius deck boards
21 - 2 x 4 x8 ' boards
7- 2 x 4 x9 ' boards ( for rafters )
35 - 1/2 x 6 x 4 ' fence cedar fence boards
21 - 2 x 4 inch brackets ( Simpson strong ties )
24 - 2 x 5/8 inch lag bolts
500 or more deck screws sizes ranging from 1 ¾ inches to 3 inches
1 - 2 ' x 8 ' x 1/2 " plywood G1S ( good one side , for your countertop )
Wood Stain
Decorative theme objects fishnets , lanterns , coconut shells , Tiki torches , Tiki carvings , etc
Step 1 : Laying the Foundation
First , select the location for your Tiki bar — Guizzo 's Tiki hut is a lean - to design and is intended to be built adjacent to a house .
Excavate the location of the floor base and fill the area with two inches of leveled driveway gravel .
Next , assemble the four fence posts to create an 8 x 6 foot base .
Measure diagonally from each corner to ensure that it is square .
Insert five 2 x 4s every 16 inches from the center and nail them to the fence posts with 3 inch deck screws .
Use 2 x 4 hangers to help hold them in place .
Make sure the base is level and square before continuing .
Step 2 : Making the Deck
Lay out and secure 12 pressure treated boards out over the base using 1 3/ 4 inch screws , leaving a 1 / 4 inch space in between each board for drainage and expansion .
Now , stain the deck .
Make sure the the pressure treated boards have been dry for a week before staining .
Pressure treating involves toxic chemicals , staining the wood while dry helps seal the toxins away from you and your guests .
Step 3 : Assemble the Walls
Assemble the front and back wall frames with six 3 1/2 x 3 1/ 2 fence posts using brackets and lag bolts to fasten .
The height of each wall will depend on where you build it .
In this example , the back wall is 96 inches and the front wall is 82 inches — any shorter and your guests may hit their heads on the gutter .
Use spare 2 x 4s to hold these in place .
Screw the posts into the floor by toe - nailing 3 - inch deck screws .
Attach the back of the wall to the house , either with mounting plates or directly into the side .
Step 4 : Design Tip
These 5 inch corner braces are a nice touch to hold the posts together .
Also , their weathered look adds to the Tiki theme .
If your hardware is new , a faux rust coating can be added in a two - part paint process which can be purchased at many craft stores .
Step 5 : Secure the Posts
Attach the front wall posts to the back wall beams with two 2 x 4s at the top outside corners with brackets and lag bolts .
Step 6 : Working on the Rafters
Now , start working on the rafters .
Place seven 2 x 4 x 9 ' boards every 16 inches from the center .
Make a small birds mouth notch ( right angled cut ) in each rafter to rest it on the top of the front frame .
Taper the bottom part of the overhang to increase headroom under the rafters .
The rafters can be attached to the back wall using metal hangers .
Step 7 : Framing the Counter
Using 2 x 4s , frame - in an area that will become the counter space and cupboards .
The counter should be about 42 inches high .
To create the base for it , run two 2 x 4s 24 inches apart across the vertical posts .
Then attach 42 inch vertical lengths every 32 inches for support .
Customize the inside of the counter to suit whatever you plan on putting in there — a small fridge , dishwasher or a sink .
Guizzo added a fifth vertical post on the right side of the structure to create a doorway and to support the bar .
However , a counter height vertical beam can be used instead .
Step 8 : Roof It !
Roof it .
This Tiki bar uses rusted tin roofing from an old barn .
However , thatched palm leaves can be used instead for a more authentic polynesian look .
Design tip :
Make ornate corner blocks out of scrap pieces of the deck boards .
Cut them to fit in square at a 45 degree angle , and freehand a design into them .
Make one , and use it as a template for the others .

The apparent source of the controversial WikiLeaks video " Collateral Murder " — a classified 2007 clip which showed a U.S. helicopter gunning down a Reuters journalist , his driver , and other innocent Iraqi civilians — has been caught .
Army intelligence Spc. Bradley Manning , 22 , was turned into authorities by a computer hacker after he bragged of his exploits over IM and e-mail from his base , 40 miles east of Baghdad .
Manning also said he leaked some 260,000 classified diplomatic cables exposing U.S. foreign policy warts , which is reportedly causing major jitters at the State Department .
Do Manning 's leaks make him a " national hero , " as WikiLeaks ' Julian Assange tweeted , or a villain who compromised national security ?
( Watch a Russia Today report about the WikiLeaks informant )
The only crime here is against Manning :
These videos and documents were classified because they are " embarrassing , " says Lew Rockwell in his LRC Blog .
Should sharing them with the whistle - blowers at WikiLeaks merit being " kidnapped " by your own government ?
The only " war crimes " committed here were by the " happy soldiers " Manning exposed in the " Collateral Murder " video .
That makes Manning a " military hero , " not a villain .
" Military hero arrested "
Manning is a traitor :
If Manning really thought he was bringing " wrongdoers to justice , " says Bob Owens at Confederate Yankee , he had plenty of legitimate " avenues to blow the whistle . "
Instead , he went all vigilante , and in the process committed what " would seem to be the very definition of treason .
I do n't know if they still hang spies from treason , but they should . "
" Brad Manning , I hope they hang you high "
Manning does n't matter much in the big picture :
The Pentagon had to spend a few days reacting to the " Collateral Murder " video , says Marc Ambinder in The Atlantic , but " WikiLeaks ' direct impact on U.S. policy has been , so far , rather negligible . "
Manning comes across as " a young , isolated , lonely figure ... aggrieved at the policy failures of his government . "
Crime or not , his mistake was having " bragged about his exploits " to a computer - hacker " snitch . "

HONOLULU —
The conspiracy theorists who cling to the false belief that President Obama was born outside the United States outrage many Democrats and embarrass many Republicans .
But to a group of Hawaii state workers who toil away in a long building across from the Capitol , they represent something else : a headache and a waste of time .
The theorists , known as birthers , have deluged the State Health Department here with so many demands for information about the president ’s birth in Hawaii that Gov. Linda Lingle , a Republican , signed a law this week allowing state agencies to ignore repeated requests from people who have had a request answered in the last year .
It comes none too soon for Health Department workers , who have been inundated with so many requests for the president ’s birth records that printouts of the e-mail messages they have received on the topic through March stands some 13 inches high .
Each one required a response , and many required consultations with state lawyers .
“ It became really , really a burden , ” said Janice Okubo , a spokeswoman for the department , who said that handling the hundreds of requests took up huge amounts of the department ’s time as it was trying to respond to an H1N1 flu outbreak .
Many requests , she said , came from the same handful of people .
The Flames may or may not have much in the way of roster movement this summer , but one player that a decision needs to be made about is Ian White .
The rearguard is a RFA on July 1st , and recent reports suggest a potential payday in the 3 million - plus range .
The Commissioner 's press conference Friday afternoon did bring the welcome news that the cap is likely to increase by about 2 million for next year , but the Flames are still in a precarious cap position , so " value for money " should be the watchwords when making a judgement on any potential contract for the Steinbach , MB. native .
Now I know that the entire concept of " value for money " seems like it 's lost on the Flames , but let 's suspend our disbelief , at least for the purposes of this exercise , and have a look at Ian White 's underlying numbers at EV with the Flames .
As usual when we review these sorts of numbers , the data comes from Vic Ferrari 's timeonice.com and Behind the Net .
White walked directly into the fire on arrival in Calgary , working with Robyn Regehr on the top pairing .
The two of them faced the other team 's best on the majority of nights , with an occasional assist from Bouwmeester and Staios .
First ,
White 's overall EV possession numbers while playing for Calgary :
Shots F/ A Shots % Misses F/ A Fenwick % Blocks F/ A Corsi % 224/207 .520 73/92 .498 93/101 .494
Those are pretty meh , to be honest , and the team 's percentages during that period were decent ( .517/.518/.523 for Shots / Fenwick / Corsi ) .
That noted , given the level of competition he was facing , it could have been worse , and it should also be noted that he played a fair bit behind Iginla / Stajan .
Those two got whipped pretty badly in terms of EV possession , so backing them up would sewer anyone 's numbers .
Since score effect is something that we pay attention to around these parts , White 's EV numbers when the game was tied :
Shots F/ A Shots % Misses F/ A Fenwick % Blocks F/ A Corsi % 69/60 .535 20/41 .468 31/34 .471
The Shots number is good , obviously , but unless Ian White has the voodoo ability to make people miss the net , I 'd be a bit concerned about the other numbers .
Again , it should be noted that he spent more time behind the , er , dynamic duo of Iginla and Stajan than any other forwards .
When the score was tied and Iginla was on the ice with White , the percentages were .468/.372/.414 .
Those are n't good .
Very , very bad , in fact .
Jarome had that effect on people this year , and as I noted when I looked at Jay Bouwmeester early in the season , there 's only so much any defenceman can do to affect possession when the forwards in front of them are struggling .
I 'm largely inclined to give White a pass based on that factor alone .
This next bit is an area I did n't want to revisit , but seems mandatory under the circumstances of White 's arrival .
One of the common refrains after the trade that brought White to Calgary was that , if nothing else , Regehr played much better hockey once he was away from Phaneuf .
I was never really completely sold on that notion , so I thought I 'd have a gander at Reggie 's Shots / Fenwick / Corsi percentages , with Dion and then with White :
With Dion overall : .463/.471/.503
With Dion tied : .513/.513/.525
With White overall : .532/.505/.503
With White tied : .523/.459/.476
Those are some pretty odd looking numbers , and my suspicion is that the Flames really sat back with the lead during Phaneuf 's time in Calgary .
No matter , the possession numbers do n't really suggest that Reggie was dramatically better once he shed Phaneuf .
He did n't suddenly turn into Steve Staios either , so the results should likely be declared as mixed .
If the stories suggesting some unrest around the team are grounded in fact , then the move can be defended on that basis , but I 've spent exactly zero seconds in the Flames ' dressing room , so I can only go on what happened on - ice .
As I said , based on that information alone , ascribing some sort of superior effort on Regehr 's part to the addition of White is stretching things a touch .
If you want to make the relative value for money argument , that 's another matter , and a defensible one , IMO .
I do n't want this to turn into a White - Dion thing , but I will add one piece of information in White 's favour .
When Phaneuf was with the Flames , the team 's ZoneStart was 50.3 % .
Dion 's was 53.7 % , which was easier than any of Bouwmeester , Regehr or Giordano .
During
White 's time in Calgary , the team ZS was 55.4 % , but his personal number was 53.4 % , second toughest for the D and just 3 D zone faceoffs behind Regehr , so any BS about soft minutes for White during his stay in Cowtown is just that .
When you have a tougher go than Jay Bouwmeester in that regard , you are n't shirking .
So , returning to the matter at hand , how did White manage an acceptable +/- number given those underwhelming possession figures ?
Our old friends the percentages made a timely appearance , would n't you know ?
White was +22/-17 in terms of EV goals during his time with the Flames , largely due to the team shooting 9.8 % when he was on - ice .
White shot 10.3 % himself , and both of those numbers are higher than what might be considered normal .
His overall PDO ( on - ice SH % and SV % ) was 101.6 .
Again , that 's a bit high and might be tough to sustain , although not impossible .
The number that really jumped out at me was White 's PDO when the score was tied .
During his time with the Flames , the SV % when he was on - ice in that scenario was .950 and the SH % was 11.6 , for a PDO of 106.6 .
When he and Regehr were both on - ice with the score tied , the numbers were .941 and 8.9 , for a PDO of 103 .
If you wondered why there was a sense that White and Regehr were doing well , I might suggest that it may well be because the bounces were going their way .
Luck 's a nice thing to have , but I would n't want to rely on it as a foundation for team - building .
So , with all that , what do we have here ?
Being completely candid , I had the feeling that White was playing a level of competition that was a bit too high for him , and the underlying numbers do seem to hint that may be so , even accepting the fact that the forwards in front of him left a lot to be desired .
In a perfect world , Ian White would make a very nice second pairing D-man , with considerable PP time and the odd PK shift making up his icetime .
That sort of player is pretty useful , and Ian White likely fits that mold quite nicely , but is that worth 3 - 3.5 million ?
Given his offensive production , it 's likely close , but I just can't shake the feeling that a 3.5 million a year deal would be paying right at the top of the market .
Maybe I 'm undervaluing him , but if Steve Staios disappeared , slotting Ian White into that 2.5-2.75 million pay range just feels like it fits a bit better .
It would n't set an outlandish precedent for Giordano 's looming UFA year , either , and that has to be a consideration for the team in any dealings with White .
Of course , with Sarich and Staios currently on the books , Ian White could be an ex-Flame by early July .
That would be a shame .
I might not be comfortable with him in the top pairing , but he 's better value now and for the future than either of those two gents by a considerable margin .

MASAKA , Uganda , June 10 ( UPI ) --
Police in Uganda said they are investigating the origins and purpose of a huge marijuana crop found in the garden of a convent .
Masaka district police officials said investigators discovered a marijuana plantation covering an entire acre of land in the gardens of the convent , which was not specifically identified by police , the BBC reported Thursday .

Southern regional commander Emmanuel Muhuirwe said two porters were arrested and released on bail pending charges while two nuns were questioned but not arrested .
One of the nuns was quoted as saying the marijuana was used as a health treatment for the convent 's pigs and other farm animals .
Scripting with IDA
Pro is very useful to automate tasks , write scripts or do batch analysis , nonetheless one problem is commonly faced by script writers : the lack of a certain function from the scripting language .
In the blog post going to demonstrate how to extend both IDC and IDAPython to add new functions .
Extending IDC
Every IDC variable is represented by an idc_value_t object in the SDK .
The IDC variable type is stored in the idc_value -> vtype field and have one of the following values :
VT_LONG : Used to store 32 bit signed numbers ( or 64 bit numbers if __EA64 __ is set ) .
Use idc_value -> set_long ( ) to set a value and idc_value -> num to read it .
to set a value and to read it .
VT_STR2 : Used to store arbitrary strings .
Use idc_value -> set_string ( ) to set a value , idc_value -> c_str ( ) to get a C string or idc_value -> qstr ( ) to get a qstring instance .
to set a value , to get a C string or to get a qstring instance .
VT_INT64 : Used to store 64 bit signed numbers .
Use idc_value ->i64 to read the value and idc_value -> set_int64 ( ) to set a value
to read the value and idc_value -> set_int64 ( ) to set a value VT_OBJ : Used to represent objects .
Such idc variable is created via the VarObject ( ) and attributes are managed by VarSetAttr ( ) / VarGetAttr ( )
and attributes are managed by / VT_PVOID : Use to store arbitrary untyped values .
Use idc_value -> pvoid to read this value and idc_value -> set_pvoid ( ) to set it
Now that idc_value_t is covered , let us explain how to add a new IDC function in two steps :
Writing the IDC function callback Registering the function
Writing the callback
The callback is defined as :
typedef error_t idaapi idc_func_t( idc_value_t * argv, idc_value_t *r ) ;
The argv array is initialized by the IDC interpreter and contains the passed arguments and the r argument is set by the callback to return values to the IDC interpreter .
Registering an IDC function
The IDC function callback can be registered with the IDC interpreter using this function :
bool set_idc_func ( const char * name , idc_func_t * fp , const char * args ) ;
Where :
name : designates the IDC function name to be added
fp : IDC function callback ( written in the previous step )
args :
A zero terminated character array containing the expected arguments types ( VT_xxx ) .
For example , an IDC function that expects two numbers and one string as arguments have the following args value : {VT_LONG , VT_LONG , VT_STR2 , 0}
When the plugin is about to unload ( in its term ( ) callback ) , it should unregister the IDC function by calling set_idc_func ( name , NULL , NULL )
Example
For the sake of demonstration , let us add getenv( ) to IDC :
sstatic const char idc_getenv_args [ ] = { VT_STR2 , 0 } ; static const char idc_getenv_name [ ] = " getenv " ; static error_t idaapi idc_getenv( idc_value_t * argv , idc_value_t * res ) { char * env = getenv( argv [ 0].c_str ( ) ) ; res->set_string (env == NULL ? " " : env ) ; return eOk ; } int idaapi init ( ) { set_idc_func(idc_getenv_name , idc_getenv , idc_getenv_args ) ; return PLUGIN_KEEP ; } void idaapi term ( void ) { // Unregister set_idc_func(idc_getenv_name , NULL , NULL ) ; }
Extending IDAPython
It is possible to extend IDAPython in two ways :
Modifying the source code of IDAPython
Writing a plugin to extend Python scripting
While the former method requires basic knowledge of SWIG , both methods require some understanding of the Python C API .
In this article , we will use the second method because it is more practical and does not require modification to IDAPython itself .
This process involes three steps :
Initializing the Python C API Writing the callback (s ) Registering the function (s )
If you ’re new to the Python C API , you could still follow and understand the code used in this blog post without refering to this tutorial .
Writing the callback
Let us wrap the following function :
// ints.hpp idaman ssize_t ida_export get_predef_insn_cmt( const insn_t &cmd , char * buf , size_t bufsize ) ;
which is used to retrieve the predifined comment of a given instruction .
We want to expose it as the following Python function :
def get_predef_insn_cmt( ea ) : " " " Return instruction comments @param ea : Instruction ea @return : None on failure or a string containing the instruction comment " " " pass
Here is the callback :
static PyObject * py_getpredef_insn_cmt( PyObject
* /*self*/ , PyObject * args ) { do { //
Parse arguments unsigned long ea ; if ( ! PyArg_ParseTuple ( args , " k " , &ea ) ) break ; // Decode instruction if ( decode_insn ( get_screen_ea ( ) ) == 0 ) break ; // Get comments char buf [ MAXSTR ] , *p = buf ; p += qsnprintf ( buf , sizeof ( buf ) , " %s : " , ph.instruc[cmd.itype ].name ) ; if ( get_predef_insn_cmt ( cmd , p , sizeof ( buf ) - ( p - buf ) ) == - 1 || *p == ' \0 ' ) break ; // Return comment as a string return PyString_FromString ( buf ) ; } while ( false ) ; Py_RETURN_NONE ; }
PyArg_ParseTuple( ) is used to parse the arguments .
This function can be likened to sscanf ( ) .
For a description about the format string please refer to the Py_BuildValue ( ) documentation
get_predef_insn_cmt( ) is used to fetch the comment and PyString_FromString ( ) is used to return a string Python object
In case of failures we use the Py_RETURN_NONE macro to return the Py_NONE value ( None in Python )
Registering the callback (s )
Unlike IDC callback registration , Python C API allows you to register more than a function at once .
This is done by describing all the callbacks in a PyMethodDef array :
static PyMethodDef py_methods [ ] = { { " getpredef_insn_cmt " , py_getpredef_insn_cmt , METH_VARARGS , " " } , {NULL , NULL , 0 , NULL} } ;
and then calling the registration function :
Py_InitModule ( " idapyext " , py_methods ) ;
Finally , to use this function , make sure you “ import idapyext ” before calling getpredef_insn_cmt

http://www.hexblog.com/?p=788 for important changes in IDA v6.5
The New York Daily News and the Miami New Times are reporting that Southern Baptist minister George Alan Rekers hired a male whore from Rentboy.com to accompany him on a 10 - day European vacation .
Rekers is the co-founder , with James Dobson , of the ultra - right wing Family Research Council , and a tireless campaigner against gay rights and equality .
Rekers has acknowledged both the financial arrangement and the fact of the 10 - day vacation trip with the rentboy .
This presents a sort of new Southern Baptist take on the Commandment that “ Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor ’s ass . ”
In fairness to Rekers , it should be pointed out that he says he hired the rentboy just to carry his bags .
( His teabags ? )
Rekers wants to have it both ways .
On one hand , he wants to say he just wanted a luggage carrier .
On the other , he wants to parade himself to other gay men as someone so well hung that when he travels , he needs someone along to carry his sack .
It ’s easy to ridicule Rekers and Ted Haggard and David Drier and Mark Foley and Larry Craig , and Ken Mehlman and Harriet Myers and all the other Republicans and evangelicals who live lives of hypocricy , while raking in huge bucks for preaching hate and divisiveness .
But too much joking may distract from the reality that the exposure of such hypocricy should be teaching us .
Rekers is a preacher who rakes in tens of millions of dollars every year .
Yet he risked throwing his position away for a few days of hot sex with a young boy .
Larry Craig sacrificed all the corporate lobbying money and perks a Senator can get for the possibility of a sexual quicky , with a middle - aged cop , in a public bathroom .
Ted Haggard gave up millions in income and television star fame for sex with another man .
What ’s the common theme here ?
SEX .
None of these men could control their sexual desires , even though lack of control risked their careers and incomes .
Eliot Spitzer could n’t control his desires .
Mark Sanford lost control internationally , while praying for strength ( or potency ? ) .
And John Edwards traded his chance at the White House for a roll in the hay .
Mormon demi-god Warren Jeffs is now in prison for sexually abusing young children .
How many ministers and priests have been unable to control their sexual desires , even after committing their lives to God ?
Sex and the power it exerts on us is universal .
The earliest statuary discovered from the earliest human societies focuses on sex .
The Bible chronicles who is sleeping with whom .
And groups like the Family Research Council , Focus on the Family , and the Moral Majority all preach that people should focus more attention on other peoples ’ sex lives than on any other social issues .
This is n’t a gay / straight issue or a Christian / non - Christian issue .
This is about power , money , and insecurity .
Consider the Muslim world .
The corporate media hounds us with horror stories about how Iran or the Taliban abuse women .
They make women wear burqas and avoid mixing with men .
But our great and good ally , Saudi Arabia , stones women to death for the crime of being victims of rape .
And leading clerics are calling for the death penalty for women who mingle with men in public areas , or attend classes at the new King Saud University .
Our own Southern Baptists ruled , just a decade ago , that women are biologically inferior to men and must subordinate themselves in every instance to men .
It is a central tenet of the Mormon Church that any man can become a god if he has sex with enough women and accumulates enough wealth .
To avoid the crisis that the Catholic Church finds itself in , some evangelical churches have joined the Southern Baptists in holding that sexual abuse by ministers should not be reported to the central church , but should be considered only a local issue , to be kept quiet locally .
People love to watch nature shows in which animals fight , sometimes to the death , over breeding rights .
Animals risk health and life for the chance at sex .
And so do people – its nature .
And it ’s not only men .
The Republican official who planned a junket to a lesbian bondage club , paid for with Republican Party funds .
was Allison Meyers – also now out of a job , thanks to her lust for lesbian sex .
Or is the party just blaming her because she is a woman ?
The way we deal with our difficulties of controlling our sexual desires is equally universal .
In every society , men who ca n’t control themselves blame women .
The Muslim explanation for enforcing burqas and restrictions on all sorts of activities is that women are so sexually overpowering that Muslim men can’t control themselves and will be driven to all manner of sexual distraction and misconduct if they are exposed to women .
The mullahs are clear about this problem – it is n’t the fault of the men but of the women who distract them .
The fundamentalist Christian churches take the same position .
When women are attacked , the first question is always , “ Did she encourage the attack ? ” “ How was she dressed ? ” “ How did she act ? ” ” What did she do to provoke the attack ? ”
Evangelicals and other for - profit religionists want to bans dancing , evil music , revealing clothes and make up .
These are things that women use to drive men wild .
Is it possible that the real fear of gay men is that , unlike the rest of us , they seem able to resist the temptations posed by all those dangerous , demanding women ?
No wonder they ’re so arty and creative – think of all the time they have , free from the need to fend off the attraction of women .
Whatever its cause , power seekers latch on to sex as a device for distracting attention from other issues and for controlling public behavior .
In Saudi Arabia , Iran , Afghanistan , Pakistan , and other countries where wealthy elites keep the great majority of people subjugated under oppressive laws and barely functioning school systems , Mullahs proclaiming their view of God ’s will are paid to preach that women should not be educated , allowed to drive , practice medicine or nursing , or do anything to improve social conditions , even while the male population may be distracted or decimated by war .
Here in the U.S.A. , corporations pay televangelists and right - wingers like George Rekers hundreds of millions of dollars a year to keep public focus on sex and away from pollution , workplace safety , political bribery , and other things that make corporations profitable .
Remember the civil rights movement ?
Remember how J. Edgar Hoover ( a homosexual right - wing hero ) used all of his resources to try to create stories about sexual misconduct by Martin Luther King and others ?
His hope ( and his sponsors ’ hopes ) were that the public could be distracted from concerns about civil rights by salacious stories about sex behind the marches .
And with the anti-war movement , when students joined together to protest , the “ liberal media ” was quick to focus on any excesses of the Summer of Love , Woodstock , communes , “ radicals ” planning demonstrations in between bouts of licentiousness .
Strange how little press is given to the misogyny of our Saudi friends , whose government is propped up by our tax dollars . .
Now , corporate - funded massive television ministries broadcast a drumbeat of sex stories and sexual outrage .
Now the corporate machine is in control – of everything but its worker ’s sexual needs .
Thus the recent hypocricies revealed by ministers Ted Haggard and George Rekers .
How thoroughly the machine controls the messages it wants preached , we see in its press release from Monday , May 10 .
Black employee Michael Steele was sent to make a public pronouncement that the U.S. Constitution had been perfect when written , and to condemn Thurgood Marshall for praising the 13th Amendment and other changes to that perfect document .
A black man condemning the end of slavery , just for a paycheck .
Is that any different from James Dobson partnering with a homosexual to fight against gay rights , just to make a buck ( or $ 100 million ) ?
Or from Sarah Palin praising churches that preach women ’s inferiority , also to get on the gravy train ?
Each of us has those barely controlled sexual desires .
But we need to understand that corporations pay Steele , Dobson , Palin , and others so much money precisely because keeping us focused on our sexual fears and insecurities , and away from the other things they do , is so profitable for them .

There are an estimated 2.8 million Turks or Germans of Turkish origin in Germany .
Eleven Germans were aboard the Mavi Marmara .
" We want justice for our comrades killed ! " said Hamit Savas , a kefiyyeh - wearing protester in Berlin .
" We insist on an end to the insane blockade of Gaza and freedom for our brother Palestinians . "
Paris , London and Dublin saw similar protests .
In Dublin , protesters were angry not only about the Marmara , but also about Israel 's stopping the Rachel Corrie yesterday , which carried Irish activists .
In Sweden , dockworkers announced yesterday that Israeli ships trying to dock and unload goods would be " ignored " next week .
A spokesman for the 1,500 strong Swedish Port Workers Union said it 's workers are being told to refuse handling Israeli goods and ships during the June 15 - 24 boycott .
A union spokesman , Peter Annerback , said the dock workers would use " detective work " to figure out if any Israeli goods were arriving on non-Israeli ships .
He urged other unions to join in similar initiatives .
Seven Swedish citizens were detained on board the Gaza - bound flotilla .
Norway announced yesterday it was canceling an upcoming special operations seminar because the Defense Ministry objected to the inclusion of an Israeli army officer in the program .
A spokeswoman , Maj. Heidi Langvik - Hansen , said it was " not the right time " to hear a talk by an Israeli officer [ identified only as Colonel Toledano ] .
In England , in Bournemouth , a coastal resort town with a large Jewish population and a Jewish mayor , there were calls yesterday to cut the city 's twinning links with Netanya .
In a letter to the local Daily Echo , resident Tony Williams charged that " the latest atrocity ' illustrated Israel 's " contempt not only for the rule of law but for the opinions of civilized nations throughout the world . "
Williams said : " Next year in Bournemouth we shall be electing councillors , and it is essential that all candidates standing for election state their position on the Palestine - Israel conflict . "
Mayor Barry Golbart said people should work for a " peaceful solution . "
Golbart said : " Speaking personally , and not as mayor , my position is that I am not an Israeli ; I 'm a Jewish man living in England .
It is an extremely sorry state of affairs , whatever the rights and wrongs of it , " he told the Echo .
Update : On 1 January 2012 , the office of the military advocate for operational matters notified B’Tselem that it had instructed the military police to investigate the allegations .
On 13 May 2013 the MAG Corps informed B’Tselem that the investigation had been completed and that the material had been sent to a military prosecutor for review .
On 14 Nov. 2013 the MAG Corps informed B’Tselem that the investigation file had been closed on 20 Sept. 2013 .
A Palestinian youth , Ahmad Sliman Salem Dib , 19 , died yesterday ( 28 April ‘ 10 ) after Israeli security forces shot him , in the morning , near the border fence with the Gaza Strip , while he was participating in a demonstration there .
The footage , filmed at the demonstration by Muhammad Sabah , B'Tselem 's field researcher in Gaza , shows a group of Palestinian and international activists walking in procession from the al - Shaja 'iya neighborhood in the eastern Gaza Strip to the border fence with Israel .
The youths , who were unarmed , reached a distance of a few dozen meters from the border , and stood facing an Israeli military post .
The footage shows a soldier standing by the post .
Some of the protestors threw stones at the post .
A single shot is heard .
The injured youth was evacuated to receive medical treatment at Shifaa Hospital in Gaza City , and died of his wounds later that day .
A previous shot , which was fired approximately ten minutes earlier and harmed no one , was not captured on tape .
The footage starkly contrasts the IDF Spokesperson 's statement that “ the force acted in order to distance the demonstrators and fired with the aim of distancing them .
The area by the border fence is a combat zone and the presence of terrorist elements there endangers the residents of Israel and the security forces operating in the area . ”
Using live fire “ for distancing ” is illegal .
The footage clearly shows that the demonstrators posed no threat to residents of Israel or to security forces .
B'Tselem has documented many events in which Israeli security forces have used lethal means against stone - throwers and unarmed demonstrators in the West Bank .
Since May 2008 , at least eight Palestinians have been killed by security forces during demonstrations .
Some of them were shot with live ammunition , while others were killed by rubber - coated metal bullets and gas canisters fired directly at them .
In addition , B'Tselem has gathered testimonies in recent years indicating that security forces have declared broad areas near the border fence between Israel and the Gaza Strip as “ death zones ” , in which open - fire regulations permit firing at anyone entering them , even if the person poses no life threat .
Some of these areas closed to Palestinians are cultivated agricultural areas that are a source of livelihood for many Gazans .
The present wave of demonstrations is part of a popular movement against the “ death zones ” .
In the past , officials denied that these areas had been closed to Palestinians , yet today , this procedure has become official policy and the army has even distributed pamphlets on the matter throughout the Gaza Strip .
CAMBRIDGE , Mass . —
When John Updike died of lung cancer in January 2009 , at 76 , there seemed little left to learn about him .
Not only was he among the most prolific writers of his time , but he was also among the most autobiographical , recasting the details of his life in an outpouring of fiction , poetry , essays and criticism that appeared with metronomic regularity in the pages of The New Yorker and in books published at a rate of almost one a year for more than half a century .
Yet Updike was a private man , if not a recluse like J. D. Salinger or a phantom like Thomas Pynchon , then a one - man gated community , visible from afar but firmly sealed off , with a No Trespassing sign posted in front .
Updike cultivated his embowered solitude early .
At 25 , with no books yet published , he fled New York ( and a writing job at The New Yorker ) and moved to the Massachusetts shore , an hour north of Boston , where he remained for the next five decades , perching eventually on an 11 - acre estate he shared with his second wife , Martha Updike , in Beverly Farms .
There he assumed the remote aspect of a literary squire , ensconced in a nest of second - floor offices overlooking the Atlantic and descending twice a week for rounds of golf at the exclusive Myopia Hunt Club .
He surfaced intermittently for interviews or readings , invariably presenting a mask of debonair geniality , only to retreat once more .
But all the while he was fending off the public , Updike was also leaving a trail of clues to his works and days : an enormous archive fashioned as meticulously as one of his lathe - turned sentences .
" The archive was vitally important to him , " Mrs. Updike said in a telephone interview , especially in his last days .
“ He saw it not just as a collection of his working materials , but as also a record of the time he lived in . ”
Today the material crowds an aisle and a half of metal shelving in the basement of Houghton Library , Harvard University ’s rare book and manuscript repository that sits atop stone stairs in Harvard Yard , a short walk from Hollis Hall , the redbrick dormitory where Updike lived as a freshman 60 years ago .
Figures from US scientists show Arctic sea ice is at a record low , while land temperatures are likely to hit new highs

New data from some of the world 's leading climate researchers and institutions suggest that 2010 is shaping up to be one of the warmest years ever recorded .
Scientists at the US National Snow and Ice Centre Data Centre ( NSIDC ) report today that Arctic sea ice – frozen seawater that floats on the ocean surface – is now at its lowest physical extent ever recorded for the time of year , suggesting that it is on course to break the previous record low set in 2007 .
Satellite monitoring by the NSIDC in Boulder , Colorado , shows that the melting of sea ice has been unusually fast this year , with as much as 40,000 sq km now disappearing daily .
The melt season started almost a month later than normal at the end of March and is not expected to end until September .
Meanwhile , research from the polar science centre at the University of Washington suggests that the volume of sea ice in March 2010 was 20,300 cubic km , 38 % below the 1979 level when records began .
Global surface temperatures may also be at a record high , according to leading climate scientist James Hansen and colleagues at the National Aeronautic Space Administration ( Nasa ) .
In a paper which is yet to be peer - reviewed but has been submitted to the journal Reviews of Geophysics , they suggest that the Earth has been 0.65C warmer over the past 12 months than during the 1951 to 1980 mean , and that the global temperature for 2010 will exceed the 2005 record .
Hansen , credited with being one of the first scientists to study climate change , dismisses sceptics ' claims that global warming " stopped " in 1998 .
" Record high global temperature during the period with instrumental data was reached in 2010 , " he writes .
" It is likely that the 2010 global surface temperature ... will be a record .
" Global warming on decadal timescales is continuing without let - up ... we conclude that there has been no reduction in the global warming trend of 0.15 - 0.2C / decade that began in the late 1970s . "
The Nasa research backs up findings by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association ( NOAA ) , the US national climate monitoring service that measures global temperatures by satellite .
This has recorded the hottest ever first four months of a year .
As a result of high sea surface temperatures , the Atlantic hurricane season – which officially started this week – is expected to be one of the most intense in years .
Last week NOAA predicted 14 to 23 named storms , including eight to 14 hurricanes – three to seven of which were likely to be " major " , with winds of at least 111mph .
This is compared to an average six - month season of 11 named storms , six of which become hurricanes , two of them major .

BANGKOK  Addressing the nation three weeks after a military crackdown on protesters , Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva presented what he called a “ letter to the Thai people ” on Thursday , calling for reconciliation in a country shaken and divided by months of turmoil and scores of deaths .
“ It ’s time to rebuild our home together , ” he said .
“ Hatred and vengeance ca n’t build our future . ”
The prime minister ’s speech introduced a five - point road map to “ national reconciliation , ” although he did not explain it in detail .
The plan , as he described it earlier , seeks to address social and economic disparities that are at the root of Thailand ’s divisions .
It also seeks to control the news media , which the government asserts instigated much of the recent turmoil .
It will discuss constitutional reform , uphold the honor of the monarchy , and investigate the violence that killed at least 88 , he said .
The prime minister made it clear that these steps were only a beginning and that he understood that Thailand ’s problems ran deeper than the confrontations in the streets that ended May 19 .
“ The process , I have always said this , will take a long time and will outlive this government , ” he said in his address .
At this point , who are you going to believe ?
BP , who stuck to the false “ 5,000 barrels per day ” story forever or the scientists who are reporting other plumes beneath the sea ?
Is this the type of transparency that Steven Pearlstein of the Washington Post was talking about when he praised BP ?
Unfortunately , this brings us back to the same old problem of Obama failing to take charge of this .
Let BP use their expert engineering ( however pathetic it may be or sound ) to do the deep water drilling to add the relief wells but beyond that , shut them down now .
BP should not be involved in the process of cleanup other than paying the bill .
They should n’t be telling scientists about the environment when the only thing BP knows is how to kill the environment .
They should n’t be confiscating tainted clothing that could be used in legal action against BP .
How thick is this team at the White House that they ca n’t get this into their heads ?
For an arrogant bunch , they sure look like 98 pound weaklings who get sand kicked in their face five times a day for weeks on end .
Everything is Excellent … except the AI
This is something that I have been seeing for a long time now .
I ’m sure we all have … and for good reason : A lot of times it is true .
Despite what I said in my 7 minutes at the AI Devs Rant at the 2010 GDC about how reviewers like to bitch about bad AI , unfortunately too often it is justified .
The juxtaposition of an otherwise good game in other areas with poorly executed AI development is a bit more tragic , however .
That does n’t point to a case of a smaller budget game .
It ’s an example of a well - funded project with either a priority or a talent problem .
Take this review of “ Lost Planet 2 ” in the Detroit News by Mike Neimoyer .
Let me first give you the commentary about the rest of the aspects of the game :
The storyline is thinly tied together and barely cohesive .
OK … admittedly he gripes about the storyline .
A lot of times that simply because you are doing a sequel of an established IP .
Moving on… ( emphasis mine ) :
The graphics are beautiful , and the environments are varied .
Lush jungle or swamp areas appear suddenly in the midst of the glacial ice fields , with waterfalls and towering trees , and then there ’s parched desertscapes or weather - battered coastal regions .
Not only is the landscape new and varied , but the Akrid , the natural inhabitants of the planet E.D.N. III , are back with new shapes , new designs and a whole new set of ( usually grumpy ) attitudes .
The scale of the largest of the creatures , the “ Cat - G type ” is impressive to say the least .
Like , God of War III - scale impressive .
The voice acting , for the most part , is well - done and up to the task .
The music itself , however , is excellent .
Swelling orchestral pieces accentuate the action sequences , and give the game an epic feel that would have been missing if they had used some “ generic rock - style track # 2 ” soundtrack .
Well done , Capcom .
Ok … so we have this love fest on the environment , the character modeling , the voice acting , and the soundtrack ( he even mentions later that he would love to have a CD of the soundtrack ) .
So what can possibly be wrong ?
Here ’s a montage ( again , emphasis mine ) :
The game is designed from the ground up to take advantage of four - player cooperative play .
And heaven help you if you do n’t have friends to play the game with .
As 1UP.com states , “ Brain - dead , unhelpful , and unresponsive , the computer - controlled team members are a liability rather than a resource . ”
You truly , truly need a human companion or three to completely appreciate what Lost Planet 2 has to offer .
For example , during one big boss battle , there are four separate tasks that need to be completed simultaneously .
With four humans working together , this bit of teamwork would n’t be too difficult .
Unfortunately , if you ’re playing solo with AI teammates , you ’re pretty much left to a snarled tangle of frustration and trial - and - error .
The level design is adequate , but I think that too much emphasis was put on the multiplayer portion , and not enough consideration for the solo player who will be reduced to using the criminally stupid AI companions .
Damn … so we have a Left 4 Dead - style game that is based around the idea that you have to cooperate with your teammates in order to not only survive but to actually complete mandatory parts of the campaign … and yet they do n’t provide you with the companions that can do so .
Early on we were all letting our enemies die quickly because we lacked the capability to make them smarter .
In the era of single - player , shooting gallery - style games , having sub - par AI was n’t too bad .
After all , our fallback mantra was “ the enemy wo n’t live long enough to show off his AI anyway . ”
I knew that was just a bad crutch when we were all saying it .
The truth is , early on we were all letting our enemies die quickly because we lacked the capability to make them smarter !
We were actually relieved that our characters were dying quickly .
That managed to fit well with our other AI mantra : “ Do n’t let the AI do anything stupid . ”
Unfortunately , the chance of the AI doing something stupid rose exponentially with the amount of time that it was visible ( and alive ) .
We are spending all this money on graphics , animation , voice actors , musicians … and leaving our AI to fester like an open sore .
Now that we are expecting AI teammates or squadmates or companions to come along for the ride , we have a much harder challenge .
( Back in 2008 , I wrote about this in my ( at the time ) regular column on AIGameDev in an article titled “ The Art of AI Sidekicks : Making Sure Robin Does n’t Suck “ . )
The problem is , we are spending all this money on graphics , animation , voice actors , musicians … and leaving our AI to fester like an open sore .
Certainly , it takes more money and time to develop really good AI than it does to do a soundtrack , ( I can speak to this , by the way …
I was a professional musician a long time ago and am perfectly comfortable with anything from writing , arranging , and recording multi-track electronic grooves to penning entire sweeping orchestral scores .
But that was in a previous life . ) but it seems like a little effort might be called for .
After all , the necessity of multi-player was built into the game design from the start … the necessity of a lush soundtrack was not .
To the defense of game companies , however , I ’m very aware the good AI people are exceedingly and increasingly hard to find .
The focus of the industry has changed in the past few years so that companies are trying to do better .
However , that often means a lot more AI - dedicated manpower than they have .
With many companies trying to find AI people all over the place , the demand has really out - stripped the supply .
Some companies have had ads up for AI programmers for 6 to 9 months !
They just are n’t out there .
Perhaps this is a time to pitch
Intrinsic Algorithm’s
AI consulting services ?
And now back to our program …
So it is n’t always that the company does n’t care or wo n’t spend the money on it .
It ’s often just the fact that AI is a very difficult problem that calls for a very deep skill set .
Unfortunately , most of the game programs that exist really do n’t even address game AI beyond “ this is a state machine ” .
Academic AI programs are good for “ real world AI ” but do n’t apply to the challenges that the game industry needs .
Unfortunately , many academic AI institutions and their students do n’t know this until they are rebuffed for suggesting very academia - steeped techniques that will fall flat in practice .
( And no , a neural network would not have saved the AI in Lost Planet 2 . )
So … in the mean time , here ’s the suggestion :
If your people do n’t have the chops to make the required minimum AI , do n’t design a game mechanic that needs that AI .

A simple salad spinner will save lives this summer , if everything goes as planned by two Rice University undergraduates .
The spinner has been turned , so to speak , into a rudimentary centrifuge that medical clinics in developing countries can use to separate blood without electricity .
Rice sophomore Lila Kerr and freshman Lauren
Theis will take their Sally Centrifuge abroad for nearly two months this summer as part of Beyond Traditional Borders ( BTB ) , Rice 's global health initiative that brings new ideas and technologies to underdeveloped countries .
Kerr will take a spinner to Ecuador in late May , Theis will take one to Swaziland in early June and a third BTB team will take one to Malawi , also in June .
Such field testing is important to Rice students as they develop a range of tools to enhance global health .
Kerr and Theis are minoring in global health technologies and took the Introduction to Bioengineering and World Health class taught by Rebecca Richards - Kortum , Rice 's Stanley C. Moore Professor , chair of the Department of Bioengineering and director of Rice 360˚ : Institute for Global Health Technologies .
" There was a whole range of projects to take on this year , and luckily we got one that was n't terribly engineering - intensive , " said Kerr , a sociology major from Dayton , Ohio .
" We were essentially told we need to find a way to diagnose anemia without power , without it being very costly and with a portable device , " added Theis , a political science major and native of San Antonio , Texas .
advertisement
They found that a salad spinner met those criteria .
When tiny capillary tubes that contain about 15 microliters of blood are spun in the device for 10 minutes , the blood separates into heavier red blood cells and lighter plasma .
The hematocrit , or ratio of red blood cells to the total volume , measured with a gauge held up to the tube , can tell clinicians if a patient is anemic .
That detail is critical for diagnosing malnutrition , tuberculosis , HIV / AIDS and malaria .
" The students really did an amazing job of taking very simple , low - cost materials and creating a device their research shows correlates nicely with hematocrit levels in the blood , " said Maria Oden , professor in the practice of engineering education and director of Rice 's Oshman Engineering Design Kitchen ( OEDK ) .
She was the team 's co-adviser with Richards - Kortum .
" Many of the patients seen in developing world clinics are anemic , and it's a severe health problem .
Being able to diagnose it with no power , with a device that 's extremely lightweight , is very valuable , " she said .
Kerr said the device spins tubes at up to 950 rpm .
Results with the push - pump spinner compare favorably to those obtained with the ZIPocrit , a miniature , battery - powered centrifuge used as part of Rice 's Lab - in - a- Backpack project .
The ZIPocrit spins up to 10,000 rpm and completes its task in four to five minutes .
But the manual Sally Centrifuge , named in honor of a landmark known as the Sallyport on the Rice campus , has other advantages .
First , it requires no electricity -- just a bit of muscle .
" We 've pumped it for 20 minutes with no problem , " Theis said .
" Ten minutes is a breeze . "
Second , it can spin up to 30 tubes at a time versus the ZIPocrit 's maximum of four .
Third , it has proven to be fairly robust .
" It 's all plastic and pretty durable , " Kerr said .
" We have n't brought it overseas yet , of course , but we 've trekked it back and forth across campus in our backpacks and grocery bags and it's held up fine . "
The centrifuge , assembled using plastic lids , cut - up combs , yogurt containers and a hot - glue gun , costs about $ 30 in parts , including the spinner .
The students expect to continue work on the device after their summer treks .
PRESIDENT OBAMA may be the most visible political casualty of the BP oil spill , but there is another big loser : the Tea Party .
A mainstay of cable news programming for much of the last year , Tea Party coverage all but vanished during the month of May , according to the media - monitoriing service TVEyes , as the spill dominated the headlines .
There are still people in funny hats shouting about bailouts and vowing to “ take back the government . ’’
But suddenly they ’re a lot less prominent .
It ’s seldom a good idea to think of cable news programming as a gauge of anything other than the decline of civic discourse .
Yet it ’s hard not to see a connection between the story that is captivating cable viewers and a shift in the national mood .
The Tea Party movement , animated by intense disapproval of government activism , has smacked up against an unprecedented environmental disaster that is providing a vivid daily illustration of why an activist government is sometimes necessary .
There is little doubt about which force is prevailing .
According to a CBS News poll , a majority of Americans now oppose offshore drilling , and nearly two - thirds say Obama should be doing more to stop the spill .
This desire for more aggressive government action is the antithesis of the Tea Party ethos , and poses a problem for a movement that had been gaining steam .
The addled response to the disaster from the Tea Party ’s icons has n’t helped .
Rand Paul , the GOP Senate nominee in Kentucky , implied that the spill was no big deal ( “ sometimes accidents happen ’ ’ ) and called Obama “ un - American ’ ’ for taking a hard line against BP .
Sarah Palin , who popularized the phrase “ Drill , Baby , Drill , ’’ claimed that Obama ’s response had been too slow because he was in the pocket of the oil companies ( harebrained even by her standards ) .
Sharron Angle , who upset the establishment candidate on Tuesday to become Nevada ’s GOP Senate nominee , wants to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency .
No surprise , then , that a Washington Post / ABC News poll this week revealed that half of Americans hold an “ unfavorable impression ’’ of the Tea Party , up from 39 percent in March .
None of this mattered while Obama was floundering .
The spill has diminished almost everybody , but him above all .
There ’s some irony in this .
A month ago his administration was adeptly handling three environmental crises at once : the tornadoes in Oklahoma , the floods in Nashville , and the early stage of the BP spill .
“ The response has been excellent , ’’ Representative Jim Cooper of Tennessee said then .
“ I ’ve seen more cabinet members in Nashville than I see in Washington . ’’
Alabama ’s Republican governor praised the administration ’s performance in the Gulf .
Praise for Obama is far scarcer today .
Politicians , like most Americans , have short memories .
An administration that once boasted of its prowess is now fending off comparisons to its predecessor ’s handling of Hurricane Katrina .
But that could be about to change .
Last week , Obama belatedly seemed to grasp that the oil spill posed a real problem for him .
He needed to do something about it , even if he could n’t plug the leak .
What he did was pick a fight over oil and attempt to draw a distinction between his own beliefs about the role of government and those of the Tea Party and its fellow travelers .
In a speech in Pittsburgh , Obama vowed to resuscitate a Senate energy - and - climate bill that was widely presumed dead .
“ The votes may not be there right now , ’’ he said , “ but I intend to find them in the coming months . ’’
Recognizing a useful villain , he tipped his strategy of “ rolling back billions of dollars of tax breaks to oil companies so we can prioritize investments in clean energy research and development . ’’
This is a sleight of hand , but possibly a clever one .
The White House is no closer to plugging the leak .
Oil will continue to poison the Gulf .
But if the locus of public debate is whether to deny oil companies tax breaks , and if voters come to associate government intervention in the marketplace with incentivizing clean technology rather than propping up General Motors , then Obama will find himself in a more advantageous position .
And the Tea Party may well be in the news again — just not in a way that it likes .

The woman , whose name was not in the police report , was walking on the beach near the Beachtown subdivision when she saw a backpack rolling in the surf about 11 a.m. on May 22 , Galveston police spokesman Jeff Heyse said .
She used her cell phone to call police , who discovered a black bag containing the cocaine bricks that weighed a total of 37 pounds 2 ounces .
Each brick was marked with bar codes and wrapped in a rubber sheet , a large balloon and another plastic layer , Heyse said .
“ There were barnacles growing on the bag so you know it was probably in the water a long time , ” he said .
He said the bricks were so wrapped so well that only four of the bricks had been contaminated by seawater .
The bag contained the first large quantity of drugs washed up on Galveston beaches in at least a decade Heyse said .
No one knows how or where the drugs got in the water , but typically they are thrown overboard when law enforcement attempts to board a smuggler 's vessel , he said .
Occasionally drugs wash ashore and the police keep quiet about it in hopes of finding the owner , Heyse said .
“ Unfortunately there was nothing in the bag that would lead them anywhere , ” he said .
Although the amount found was large , it amounts to a fraction of the cocaine brought into the United States , Heyse said .
Heyse recalled an entire ship loaded with cocaine being seized several years ago .
Dealers typically dilute the cocaine with baby formula or some other odorless , flavorless material , he said .
The 37 pounds would probably have been turned into 100 pounds of street product , Heyse said , or processed into highly addictive crack cocaine in home laboratories .

Paul Woodfield had already spent years fighting Dallas 's bike helmet law in county court , when the city decided to drop the original ticket he'd been given on a bare - domed ride around White Rock Lake back in 2007 .
With no ticket to fight , the Fifth Court of Appeals dismissed his three - year - old lawsuit back in January , figuring Woodfield did n't have much left to complain about anymore .
So when a cop called him out for riding without his helmet back in March , Woodfield was n't about to shy away from another scrap .
" She told me I have to wear my helmet , and I told her , ' No , I do n't have to wear my helmet . '
She said , The city law requires you to . '
I said , ' Well state law says I do n't have to , and I 'm not going to wear one , ' " Woodfield recalls .
" So she said , ' Pull over . ' "
Armed with a new $ 25 ticket , Woodfield 's got himself another fight : he filed suit yesterday , in federal court this time , against the holy trifecta of the City of Dallas , Dallas County and the State of Texas .
( Jump for the full text of the suit . )
Over the phone this morning , we reached Woodfield -- a dispatcher for Southwest Airlines who 's representing himself in court -- to find out why he was jumping into another long legal battle .
Helmet laws are contentious enough -- a rarity in the normally calm waters of the local bike community -- but Woodfield 's beef with the 1996 city ordinance is less about safety and more about the legal nitty - gritty .
" In part I 'm mad because I was ticketed for basically just minding my own business and enjoying myself .
But the council -- it 's just over - reached itself , " Woodfield says .
" They 've gone and dabbled in areas that they have no authority to be in , " he says , and " they have to be reined in . "
Most of all , though , there 's the issue of whether or not the city , strictly speaking , is allowed to pass a helmet law without state law to back it up .
When it comes to bike safety gear , the Texas transportation code requires reflectors and lights -- but not helmets -- also says cities can't make additional requirements conflicting with state law .
Legislators considered giving cities the right to enact local bike helmet laws in 2001 , but as Woodfield 's suit points out , that proposal never made it into law .
A ruling in state district court put a hold on tickets for riding without a helmet , but cops began handing out the tickets again in October last year .
Woodfield 's also concerned that the bike law is ostensibly about safety , but says it 's being used as an excuse to pull over suspicious - looking bikers .
Nor , he says , has the city followed through making sure bike shops around Dallas post a notice about the helmet law .
So far , he figures , he 's dropped as much as $ 1,500 into the fight ( he 's representing himself in court ) , but " in terms of time , who knows ? "
Far as he knows , Woodfield is the only guy in the country suing over a municipal bike law .

The rats still retained their memory of the chime and the shock , but the associated fear was greatly reduced .
As such , this research could have important implications for the treatment of anxiety and post - traumatic stress disorder .
PTSD in particular is thought to be at least partially caused by the brain 's inability to extinguish feelings of intense fear , and differences in levels of BDNF could explain why two people who share a traumatic experience can be affected differently by it .
BDNF therapies could potentially lead to a means not to forget our bad memories , but to help us live with them .

London is committing a veritable stick - up to get the assets of the Landsbanki bank .
When Landsbanki went bankrupt in October 2008 , it took with it its subsidiary , the online bank Icesave .
320,000 Britons and Dutch people had put their savings in Icesave , attracted by a 6.5 % interest rate .
Fearing that Landsbanki would repatriate its capital to Iceland , London froze the bank ’s assets via the arbitrary use of the antiterrorist laws .
In point of fact , London has used this legislation to extort gigantic concessions from a tiny country , Iceland .
London and Amsterdam have compensated the savings of their citizens , and are turning to Iceland for reimbursement .
Late in 2008 , Reykjavik was forced to sign on and recognize its obligation to pay in order to get the bank off the list of terrorist organizations .
London took advantage of the fact that Iceland was confronted with enormous public debt to impose draconian conditions : reimbursement will be made at a prohibitive 5.5 % interest rate , when the Bank of England practices a rate of just 0.5 % !
“ In the first years , we will be paying practically nothing but interest , ” pointed out Johannes Skulason of the In Defense association , which opposes the accord .
The total sum will come to nearly 3.8 billion euros , or 12,000 euros per Icelander .
Landsbanki ’s assets should allow reimbursement of 20,000 euros per account to the United Kingdom and the Netherlands , in line with the rules of the French Fonds de Garantie des Dépôts .
[ The Fonds was set up in 1999 and its principal mission is to compensate depositors of an institution which can no longer meet its liabilities . ]
But the Netherlands and Great Britain have compensated the total savings of the account holders and “ are forcing the Icelandic taxpayers to pay the difference , ” complained Johannes Skulason .
The Icelanders accept this obligation all the less as London has refused to allow the affair to be brought before an international court , and Iceland respected European legislation .
Moreover some legal experts think that , since Landsbanki did business mainly in Britain , it is up to London to pay .
The historic referendum on the ratification of the Icesave accord , set for Saturday March 6 , was obtained thanks to a petition signed by one - quarter of the voters .
The partisans of a “ no ” vote note that their mobilization has already forced London and Amsterdam to reopen talks .
The “ no ” camp hopes that this will force London and Amsterdam , which authorized Icesave to set up in Great Britain and the Netherlands , to assume part of the costs of the bankruptcy .
In July , the two countries paid no attention to the conditions imposed by the Icelandic parliament , which for the first time in history made reimbursement dependent on the country ’s capacity to pay .
Sen. John Ensign ( R - Nev. ) has admitted having a nine - month affair with a former campaign aide married to a top staffer in his office .
Ensign draws call to resign
Sen .
John Ensign is facing an increasingly uncertain future in the Senate , with a senior Democrat saying that the Nevada Republican should resign if allegations against him are true and other senators mulling the possibility of public hearings into his extramarital affair with a former staffer .
“ If it is true that indeed he did make these payoffs and all that kind of stuff , then I would think the honorable thing would be to resign , ” Sen .
Tom Harkin ( D - Iowa ) said in an interview .

Harkin added that he does n’t “ like the smell ” of a sex scandal that has “ cast a bad image on the Senate . ”
Harkin ’s public declaration — the first of its kind by a sitting senator — comes as Ensign ’s Senate colleagues stand to make life more difficult for him .
The bipartisan Senate Ethics Committee is not ruling out holding public hearings in the case , a move that some believe could help drive Ensign from office .
A number of senators signaled to POLITICO they ’d be supportive of seeing Ensign sit before a public forum to address the allegations , something that has not been done since the Keating Five scandal in 1991 .
Yet such a decision is not imminent , and it ’s unclear how party leaders on both sides of the aisle would rule on the matter .
Senate Ethics Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif . ) wo n’t say directly whether she wants public hearings into the Ensign affair .
Boxer , though , pushed hard for public hearings into the Bob Packwood sex scandal in 1995 , and she suggested in an interview with POLITICO that she ’s open to the same possibility in the Ensign case .
“ All you have to do is read the rules of the committee , which I did then and I do now , ” Boxer said .
“ And I follow the rules of the committee — I did then and I do now . ”
Other Democratic senators are supportive of such a step .
West Virginia Sen. John Rockefeller , who backed public hearings on Packwood , said he “ would have to be consistent ” with Ensign .
“ Situations change , but people do n’t , ” he said .
A third Democratic senator , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said he ’d back public hearings on Ensign as well , “ but I would hope he would do the right thing before then , which is to [ resign ] . ”
Ensign has admitted having a nine - month affair in 2007 - 2008 with Cynthia Hampton , a former campaign aide married to a top staffer in his office , Doug Hampton .
Ensign has also revealed that his parents paid the Hamptons $ 96,000 as they were leaving his office — raising questions on whether it was a severance package that had to be reported under federal law .
The Hamptons sought millions of dollars in additional payments from Ensign , but he declined to make them .
Some ethics groups have said that if the Hamptons were let go because of the extramarital affair , Ensign may have violated sexual harassment rules — and federal investigators are examining whether Ensign conspired to break federal ethics laws by assisting with the lobbying career of Doug Hampton after he left the senator ’s staff .
An Ensign spokeswoman did not respond to several requests seeking comment for this story .
Ensign has previously denied that he violated any federal laws or Senate rules , saying he will participate fully with the ongoing investigations .
Ensign lacks the support of the Republican leadership , and he could be on his way out of the Senate if his fate ends up in the hands of his colleagues .
“ It ’s not just because you might have had an affair with someone ; that ’s not a reason to resign , ” Harkin said .
“ But it ’s the other things — I said if it ’s true . ”
The Ethics Committee ’s rules allow it to hold public hearings during any stage of an investigation , and it is required to give the defendant an opportunity to request a hearing before it recommends disciplinary actions , which can range from a slap on the wrist to expulsion from the Senate .
The committee can decide to hold hearings behind closed doors , but a defendant may ask for it to be open in order to publicly air his or her side of the story .
“ The rules are clear when you have to go public , ” Boxer said when asked about public hearings .
“ There ’s a certain stage where they do go public .
Of course , we abide by the rules . ”
Some legal experts said it ’s unclear whether the Senate Ethics Committee can still hold a public hearing if a defendant waives his or her right to one or whether it would do so even if possible .
“ It would be highly unusual for an Ethics Committee investigation to be in public , ” said Ken Gross , a Washington - based ethics law expert .
Boxer would n’t acknowledge there ’s a gray area for such sessions .
She said the rules require public hearings “ in certain cases . ”
“ The same thing propels me now , doing what ’s in the rules — the spirit and the letter of the law , ” Boxer said .
It ’s not clear when public hearings might occur if they were to take place .
As much as the Democrats might like to make Ensign an election year issue for Republicans , Boxer has her own reelection race to run .
She has seen her poll numbers slide , meaning the three - term senator is going to have to spend more time back home in coming months , rather than in Washington overseeing the Ensign probe .
And the Ethics Committee would have to determine whether its aggressive moves could interfere with a separate Justice Department investigation into Ensign ’s affair .
A federal grand jury in Washington recently issued subpoenas to the National Republican Senatorial Committee and a half - dozen companies and individuals in Nevada , seeking information regarding allegations that Ensign offered to help Silver State credit card companies derail legislation in return for donations to the GOP committee .
Thus , the Ethics Committee probe could spill into the next Congress , meaning public hearings might happen ahead of the 2012 election , when Ensign ’s seat is up .
GOP leaders said privately that they do n’t want him to run for reelection .
For Boxer , the Ensign case recalls her early days in the Senate — and the furor surrounding sexual harassment allegations against Packwood , who faced charges of sexual misconduct brought by 29 women .
Boxer joined with women ’s groups like the National Organization for Women in calling for public hearings into the case .
With resistance from then - Ethics Committee Chairman Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) , the Packwood matter never came before a public hearing despite a fierce push by Boxer , who narrowly lost a Senate floor vote to force the issue into the open .
Packwood eventually resigned from the Senate , after the Ethics Committee recommended his expulsion .
“ We have an obligation to demonstrate to our constituents that we take seriously our constitutionally mandated responsibility to police ourselves , ” Boxer said on the floor in August 1995 .
“ By attempting to sweep our problems under the committee room ’s rug , we do the opposite .
The committee should do what it has always done in cases to reach this final phase — it should hold public hearings to investigate the allegations . ”
Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D - Mo. ) , who was elected in 2006 , said the Ethics Committee should n’t arbitrarily decide to conduct public hearings on individual senators but signaled she ’d like to see open forums regularly in ongoing ethics cases .
“ I think more of it should be public , ” McCaskill said .
“ Our ethics committees have not done an aggressive enough job in going after problems within the body . ”
American criminal and cult leader
Charles Milles Manson ( né Maddox , November 12 , 1934 – November 19 , 2017 ) was an American criminal and cult leader .
In mid-1967 , he formed what became known as the " Manson Family " , a quasi - commune based in California .
His followers committed a series of nine murders at four locations in July and August 1969 .
Although the motive for the murders was disputed by Manson , the Los Angeles County district attorney believed that Manson intended to start a race war .
[ 3 ]
In 1971 , he was convicted of first - degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of seven people , including the film actress Sharon Tate .
The prosecution contended that , while Manson never directly ordered the murders , his ideology constituted an overt act of conspiracy . [ 4 ]
Manson was also convicted of first - degree murder for the deaths of Gary Hinman and Donald Shea .
Before the murders , Manson had spent more than half of his life in correctional institutions .
When he began gathering his cult following , he was a singer - songwriter on the fringe of the Los Angeles music industry , chiefly through a chance association with Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys , who introduced Manson to record producer Terry Melcher .
In 1968 , the Beach Boys recorded Manson 's song " Cease to Exist " , re-titled " Never Learn Not to Love " as the B - side on one of their singles , but without a credit to Manson .
Wilson and Melcher severed ties with Manson around early 1969 .
The Los Angeles district attorney said that Manson was obsessed with the Beatles , particularly their 1968 self - titled album .
Manson had claimed to be guided by his interpretation of the Beatles ' lyrics and adopted the term " Helter Skelter " to describe an impending apocalyptic race war .
At trial , the prosecution submitted that Manson and his followers believed that the murders would help precipitate that war .
Other contemporary interviews and those who testified during Manson 's trial insisted that the Tate–LaBianca murders were copycat crimes designed to exonerate Manson 's friend Bobby Beausoleil . [ 5 ] [ 6 ]
Manson 's notoriety as an emblem of insanity , violence , and the macabre has also influenced pop culture .
Recordings of songs written and performed by Manson were released commercially , starting with Lie : The Love and Terror Cult ( 1970 ) .
Various musicians have covered some of his songs .
Although originally sentenced to death , his sentence was commuted to life with the possibility of parole after the California Supreme Court invalidated the state 's death penalty statute in 1972 .
He served his life sentence at California State Prison , Corcoran and died at age 83 in late 2017 .
1934 –1967 : Early life
Childhood
Charles Manson was born on November 12 , 1934 , to 16 - year - old Kathleen Manson - Bower - Cavender , [ 7 ] née Maddox ( 1918 –1973 ) , [ 8 ] in the University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center in Cincinnati , Ohio .
He was first named " no name Maddox " .[ page needed ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]
Within weeks , he was called Charles Milles Maddox . [ 13 ]
Manson 's biological father appears to have been Colonel Walker Henderson Scott Sr. ( 1910 –1954 ) [ 14 ] of Catlettsburg , Kentucky , against whom Kathleen Maddox filed a paternity suit that resulted in an agreed judgment in 1937 .
Manson may never have known his biological father .[ page needed ] [ 11 ]
Scott worked intermittently in local mills , and also had a local reputation as a con artist .
He allowed Maddox to believe that he was an army colonel , although " Colonel " was merely his given name .
When Maddox told Scott that she was pregnant , he told her he had been called away on army business ; after several months she realized he had no intention of returning .
In August 1934 , before Manson 's birth , Maddox married William Eugene Manson ( 1909 – 1961 ) , a " laborer " at a dry cleaning business .
Maddox often went on drinking sprees with her brother Luther , leaving Charles with multiple babysitters .
They divorced on April 30 , 1937 , after William alleged " gross neglect of duty " by Maddox .
Charles retained William 's last name , Manson .
On August 1 , 1939 , Luther and Kathleen Maddox were arrested for assault and robbery .
Kathleen and Luther were sentenced to five and ten years of imprisonment , respectively .
Manson was placed in the home of an aunt and uncle in McMechen , West Virginia . [ 18 ]
His mother was paroled in 1942 .
Manson later characterized the first weeks after she returned from prison as the happiest time in his life .
Weeks after Maddox 's release , Manson 's family moved to Charleston , West Virginia , where Manson continually played truant and his mother spent her evenings drinking .
[ 21 ]
She was arrested for grand larceny , but not convicted . [ 22 ]
The family later moved to Indianapolis , where Maddox met an alcoholic named Lewis ( no first name ) through Alcoholics Anonymous meetings , and married him in August 1943 . [ 21 ]
First offenses
In an interview with Diane Sawyer , Manson said that when he was nine , he set his school on fire . [ 23 ]
Manson also got in trouble for truancy and petty theft .
Although there were a lack of foster home placements , in 1947 , at the age of 13 , Manson was placed in the Gibault School for Boys in Terre Haute , Indiana , a school for male delinquents run by Catholic priests .
Gibault was a strict school , where punishment for even the tiniest infraction included beatings with either a wooden paddle or a leather strap .
Manson ran away from Gibault and slept in the woods , under bridges , and wherever else he could find shelter . [ 25 ]
Manson fled home to his mother , and spent Christmas 1947 in McMechen , at his aunt and uncle 's house .
His mother returned him to Gibault .
Ten months later , he ran away to Indianapolis . [ 27 ]
In 1948 , in Indianapolis , Manson committed his first known crime by robbing a grocery store .
At first the robbery was simply to find something to eat .
However , Manson found a cigar box containing just over a hundred dollars , and he took the money .
He used the money to rent a room on Indianapolis 's Skid Row and to buy food . [ 28 ]
For a time , Manson tried to go straight by getting a job delivering messages for Western Union .
However , he quickly began to supplement his wages through petty theft .
[ 25 ]
He was eventually caught , and in 1949 a sympathetic judge sent him to Boys Town , a juvenile facility in Omaha , Nebraska . [ 29 ]
After four days at Boys Town , he and fellow student Blackie Nielson obtained a gun and stole a car .
They used it to commit two armed robberies on their way to the home of Nielson 's uncle in Peoria , Illinois .
Nielson 's uncle was a professional thief , and when the boys arrived he allegedly took them on as apprentices .
Manson was arrested two weeks later during a nighttime raid on a Peoria store .
In the investigation that followed , he was linked to his two earlier armed robberies .
He was sent to the Indiana Boys School , a strict reform school . [ 32 ]
At the school , other students allegedly raped Manson with the encouragement of a staff member , and he was repeatedly beaten .
He ran away from the school eighteen times . [ 29 ]
While at the school , Manson developed a self - defense technique he later called the " insane game " .
When he was physically unable to defend himself , he would screech , grimace and wave his arms to convince aggressors that he was insane .
After a number of failed attempts , he escaped with two other boys in February 1951 .
The three escapees were robbing filling stations while attempting to drive to California in stolen cars when they were arrested in Utah .
For the federal crime of driving a stolen car across state lines , Manson was sent to Washington , D.C. 's National Training School for Boys .
On arrival he was given aptitude tests which determined that he was illiterate , but had an above - average IQ of 109 .
His case worker deemed him aggressively antisocial .
First imprisonment
On a psychiatrist 's recommendation , Manson was transferred in October 1951 to Natural Bridge Honor Camp , a minimum security institution .
His aunt visited him and told administrators she would let him stay at her house and would help him find work .
Manson had a parole hearing scheduled for February 1952 .
However , in January , he was caught raping a boy at knifepoint .
Manson was transferred to the Federal Reformatory in Petersburg , Virginia .
There he committed a further " eight serious disciplinary offenses , three involving homosexual acts " .
He was then moved to a maximum security reformatory at Chillicothe , Ohio , where he was expected to remain until his release on his 21st birthday in November 1955 .
Good behavior led to an early release in May 1954 , to live with his aunt and uncle in McMechen .

In January 1955 , Manson married a hospital waitress named Rosalie Jean Willis . [ page needed ]
Around October , about three months after he and his pregnant wife arrived in Los Angeles in a car he had stolen in Ohio , Manson was again charged with a federal crime for taking the vehicle across state lines .
After a psychiatric evaluation , he was given five years ' probation .
Manson 's failure to appear at a Los Angeles hearing on an identical charge filed in Florida resulted in his March 1956 arrest in Indianapolis .
His probation was revoked ; he was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment at Terminal Island , San Pedro , California .
While Manson was in prison , Rosalie gave birth to their son Charles Manson Jr. During his first year at Terminal Island , Manson received visits from Rosalie and his mother , who were now living together in Los Angeles .
In March 1957 , when the visits from his wife ceased , his mother informed him Rosalie was living with another man .
Less than two weeks before a scheduled parole hearing , Manson tried to escape by stealing a car .
He was given five years ' probation and his parole was denied .
Second imprisonment
Manson received five years ' parole in September 1958 , the same year in which Rosalie received a decree of divorce .
By November , he was pimping a 16 - year - old girl and was receiving additional support from a girl with wealthy parents .
In September 1959 , he pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting to cash a forged U.S. Treasury check , which he claimed to have stolen from a mailbox ; the latter charge was later dropped .
He received a 10 - year suspended sentence and probation after a young woman named Leona , who had an arrest record for prostitution , made a " tearful plea " before the court that she and Manson were " deeply in love ... and would marry if Charlie were freed " .
Before the year 's end , the woman did marry Manson , possibly so she would not be required to testify against him .
Manson took Leona and another woman to New Mexico for purposes of prostitution , resulting in him being held and questioned for violating the Mann Act .
Though he was released , Manson correctly suspected that the investigation had not ended .
When he disappeared in violation of his probation , a bench warrant was issued .
An indictment for violation of the Mann Act followed in April 1960 .
Following the arrest of one of the women for prostitution , Manson was arrested in June in Laredo , Texas , and was returned to Los Angeles .
For violating his probation on the check - cashing charge , he was ordered to serve his ten - year sentence .
Manson spent a year trying unsuccessfully to appeal the revocation of his probation .
In July 1961 , he was transferred from the Los Angeles County Jail to the United States Penitentiary at McNeil Island , Washington .
There , he took guitar lessons from Barker –Karpis gang leader Alvin " Creepy " Karpis , and obtained from another inmate a contact name of someone at Universal Studios in Hollywood , Phil Kaufman . [ 37 ]
According to Jeff Guinn 's 2013 biography of Manson , his mother moved to Washington State to be closer to him during his McNeil Island incarceration , working nearby as a waitress . [ 38 ]
Although the Mann
Act charge had been dropped , the attempt to cash the Treasury check was still a federal offense .
Manson 's September 1961 annual review noted he had a " tremendous drive to call attention to himself " , an observation echoed in September 1964 .
In 1963 , Leona was granted a divorce .
During the process she alleged that she and Manson had a son , Charles Luther .
According to a popular urban legend , Manson auditioned unsuccessfully for the Monkees in late 1965 ; this is refuted by the fact that Manson was still incarcerated at McNeil Island at that time . [ 39 ]
In June 1966 , Manson was sent for the second time to Terminal Island in preparation for early release .
By the time of his release day on March 21 , 1967 , he had spent more than half of his 32 years in prisons and other institutions .
This was mainly because he had broken federal laws .
Federal sentences were , and remain , much more severe than state sentences for many of the same offenses .
Telling the authorities that prison had become his home , he requested permission to stay .
1968 –1971 : Cult formation , murders , and trial
1968 mug shot
Cult formation
After being discharged from prison in 1967 , Manson began attracting a group of followers , mostly young women , from around California .
They were later known as the Manson Family . [ 40 ]
The core members of Manson 's group following included : Charles ' Tex ' Watson , a musician and former actor ; Robert Beausoleil , a former musician and pornographic actor ; Mary Brunner , previously a librarian ; Susan Atkins ; Linda Kasabian ; Patricia Krenwinkel ; and Leslie Van Houten . [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ]
Murders
The Manson Family developed into a doomsday cult when Manson became fixated on the idea of an imminent apocalyptic race war between America 's Black population and the larger white population .
A white supremacist , [ 44 ] [ 45 ]
Manson believed that Black people in America would rise up and kill all whites except for Manson and his " Family " , but that they were not intelligent enough to survive on their own ; they would need a white man to lead them , and so they would serve Manson as their " master " . [ 46 ] [ 47 ]
Late in 1968 , Manson adopted the term " Helter Skelter " , taken from a song on the Beatles ' recently released White Album , to refer to this upcoming war .
In early August 1969 , Manson encouraged his followers to start Helter Skelter , by committing murders in Los Angeles and making it appear to be racially motivated .
The Manson Family gained national notoriety after the murder of actress Sharon Tate and four others in her home on August 8 and 9 , 1969 , [ 49 ] and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca the next day .
Tex Watson and three other members of the Family executed the Tate–LaBianca murders , allegedly acting under Manson 's instructions . [ 50 ] [ 51 ]
While it was later accepted at trial that Manson never expressly ordered for the murders , his behavior constituted a conviction of first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder .
Evidence pointed to Manson 's obsession with inciting a race war by killing those he thought were " pigs " and his belief that this would show the " nigger " how to do the same . [ 4 ]
Family members were also responsible for other assaults , thefts , crimes , and the attempted assassination of President Gerald Ford in Sacramento by Lynette " Squeaky " Fromme . [ 52 ]
While it is often thought that Manson never murdered or attempted to murder anyone himself , true crime writer James Buddy Day , in his book Hippie Cult Leader : The Last Words of Charles Manson , claimed that Manson shot drug dealer Bernard Crowe on July 1 , 1969 . [ 53 ]
Crowe survived .
Trial
The State of California tried Manson for the Tate and LaBianca murders with co-defendants , Leslie Van Houten , Susan Atkins , and Patricia Krenwinkel .
Co-defendant Tex Watson was tried at a later date after being extradited from Texas . [ 55 ]
The trial began on July 15 , 1970 .
Manson appeared wearing fringed buckskins , his typical clothing at Spahn Ranch . [ 56 ]
On July 24 , 1970 – the first day of testimony — Manson appeared in court with an " X " carved into his forehead .
His followers issued a statement from Manson saying " I have " X'd myself from your world " . [ 57 ]
The following day , Manson 's co-defendants , Van Houten , Atkins , and Krenwinkel , also appeared in court , with an " X " carved in their foreheads . [ 58 ] [ 59 ]
Members of the Manson Family camped outside of the courthouse , and held a vigil on a street corner , because they were excluded from the courtroom for being disruptive .
Some of Manson 's followers also carved crosses into their heads . [ 57 ]
During the trial , members of the Manson Family appeared in saffron robes , and threatened to immolate themselves if Manson was convicted – just as nuns in Vietnam had done in protest of the war . [ 56 ] [ 60 ]
The State presented dozens of witnesses during the trial .
However , its primary witness was Linda Kasabian , who was present during the Tate murders on August 8 –9 , 1969 .
Kasabian provided graphic testimony of the Tate murders , which she observed from outside the house .
She was also in the car with Manson on the following evening , when he ordered the LaBianca killings .
Kasabian spent days on the witness stand , being cross-examined by the defendants ' lawyers .
After testifying , Kasabian went into hiding for the next forty years .[ page needed ]
In early August 1970 , President Richard Nixon told reporters that he believed that Manson was guilty of the murders , " either directly or indirectly " . [ 61 ]
Manson obtained a copy of the newspaper and held up the headline to the jury . [ page needed ]
The defendants ' attorneys then called for a mistrial , arguing that their clients had allegedly killed far fewer people than " Nixon 's war machine in Vietnam " .
[ 61 ] Judge Charles H. Older polled each member of the jury , to determine whether each juror saw the headline and whether it affected his or her ability to make an independent decision .
All of the jurors affirmed that they could still decide independently .[ page needed ]
Shortly after , the female defendants – Atkins , Krenwinkel and Van Houten – were removed from the room for chanting , " Nixon says we are guilty .
So why go on ? " [ page needed ]
On October 5 , 1970 , Manson attempted to kill Judge Older while the jury was present in the room .
Manson first threatened Older , and then jumped over his lawyer 's table with a sharpened pencil , in the direction of Older .
Manson was restrained before reaching the judge .
While being led out of the courtroom , Manson screamed at Older , " In the name of Christian justice , someone should cut your head off ! "
Meanwhile , the female defendants began chanting something in Latin.
Judge Older began wearing a .38 caliber pistol to the trial afterwards .
On November 16 , 1970 , the State of California rested its case after presenting twenty - two weeks worth of evidence .
The defendants then stunned the courtroom by announcing that they had no witnesses to present , and rested their case .
Manson 's testimony
Immediately after defendants ' counsel rested their case , the three female defendants shouted that they wanted to testify .
Their attorneys advised the court , in chambers , that they opposed their clients testifying .
Apparently , the female defendants wanted to testify that Manson had had nothing to do with the murders .
The following day , Manson himself announced that he too wanted to testify .
The judge allowed Manson to testify outside the presence of the jury .
He stated as follows :
These children that come at you with knives , they are your children .
You taught them .
I did n't teach them .
I just tried to help them stand up .
Most of the people at the ranch that you call the Family were just people that you did not want .
Manson continued , equating his actions to those of society at large :
I know this : that in your hearts and your souls , you are as much responsible for the Vietnam war as I am for killing these people .
... I can't judge any of you .
I have no malice against you and no ribbons for you .
But I think that it is high time that you all start looking at yourselves , and judging the lie that you live in .
Manson concluded , claiming that he too was a creation of a system that he viewed as fundamentally violent and unjust :
My father is the jailhouse .
My father is your system .
... I am only what you made me .
I am only a reflection of you .
...
You want to kill me ?
Ha !
I am already dead – have been all my life .
I 've spent twenty - three years in tombs that you have built .
After Manson finished speaking , Judge Older offered to let him testify before the jury .
Manson replied that it was not necessary .
Manson then told the female defendants that they no longer needed to testify .
On November 30 , 1970 , Leslie Van Houten 's attorney , Ronald Hughes , failed to appear for the closing arguments in the trial .
He was later found dead in a California state park .
His body was badly decomposed , and it was impossible to tell the cause of death .
Hughes had disagreed with Manson during the trial , taking the position that his client , Van Houten , should not testify to claim that Manson had no involvement with the murders .
Some have alleged that Hughes may have been murdered by the Manson Family .
On January 25 , 1971 , the jury found Manson , Krenwinkel and Atkins guilty of first degree murder in all seven of the Tate and LaBianca killings .
The jury found Van Houten guilty of murder in the first degree in the LaBianca killings .
Sentencing
After the convictions , the court held a separate hearing before the same jury to determine if the defendants should receive the death sentence .
Each of the three female defendants – Atkins , Van Houten , and Krenwinkel – took the stand .
They provided graphic details of the murders and testified that Manson was not involved .
According to the female defendants , they had committed the crimes in order to help fellow Manson Family member Bobby Beausoleil get out of jail , where he was being held for the murder of Gary Hinman .
The female defendants testified that the Tate - LaBianca murders were intended to be copycat crimes , similar to the Hinman killing .
Atkins , Krenwinkel and Van Houten claimed they did this under the direction of the state 's prime witness , Linda Kasabian .
The defendants did not express remorse for the killings .
On March 4 , 1971 , during the sentencing hearings , Manson trimmed his beard to a fork and shaved his head , telling the media , " I am the Devil , and the Devil always has a bald head ! "
However , the female defendants did not immediately shave their own heads .
The state prosecutor , Vincent Bugliosi , later speculated in his book , Helter Skelter , that they refrained from doing so , in order to not appear to be completely controlled by Manson ( as they had when they each carved an " X " in their foreheads , earlier in the trial ) .
On March 29 , 1971 , the jury sentenced all four defendants to death .
When the female defendants were led into the courtroom , each of them had shaved their heads , as had Manson .
After hearing the sentence , Atkins shouted to the jury , " Better lock your doors and watch your kids . "
The Manson murder trial was the longest murder trial in American history when it occurred , lasting nine and a half months .
The trial was among the most publicized American criminal cases of the twentieth century and was dubbed the " trial of the century " .
The jury had been sequestered for 225 days , longer than any jury before it .
The trial transcript alone ran to 209 volumes or 31,716 pages .
1971 –2017 : Third imprisonment
Post - trial events
1971 mug shot
Manson was admitted to state prison from Los Angeles County on April 22 , 1971 , for seven counts of first - degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of Abigail Ann Folger , Wojciech Frykowski , Steven Earl Parent , Sharon Tate Polanski , Jay Sebring , and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca .
As the death penalty was ruled unconstitutional in 1972 , Manson was re-sentenced to life with the possibility of parole .
His initial death sentence was modified to life on February 2 , 1977 .
On December 13 , 1971 , Manson was convicted of first - degree murder in Los Angeles County Court for the July 25 , 1969 death of musician Gary Hinman .
He was also convicted of first - degree murder for the August 1969 death of Donald Jerome " Shorty " Shea .
Following the 1972 decision of California v. Anderson , California 's death sentences were ruled unconstitutional and that " any prisoner now under a sentence of death ... may file a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the superior court inviting that court to modify its judgment to provide for the appropriate alternative punishment of life imprisonment or life imprisonment without possibility of parole specified by statute for the crime for which he was sentenced to death . " [ 72 ]
Manson was thus eligible to apply for parole after seven years ' incarceration .
His first parole hearing took place on November 16 , 1978 , at California Medical Facility in Vacaville , where his petition was rejected . [ 75 ]
1980s –1990s
In the 1980s , Manson gave four interviews to the mainstream media .
The first , recorded at California Medical Facility and aired on June 13 , 1981 , was by Tom Snyder for NBC's The Tomorrow Show .
The second , recorded at San Quentin State Prison and aired on March 7 , 1986 , was by Charlie Rose for CBS News Nightwatch , and it won the national news Emmy Award for Best Interview in 1987 . [ 76 ]
The third , with Geraldo Rivera in 1988 , was part of the journalist 's prime - time special on Satanism . [ 77 ]
At least as early as the Snyder interview , Manson 's forehead bore a swastika in the spot where the X carved during his trial had been . [ 78 ]
Nikolas Schreck conducted an interview with Manson for his documentary Charles Manson Superstar ( 1989 ) .
Schreck concluded that Manson was not insane but merely acting that way out of frustration . [ 79 ] [ 80 ]
On September 25 , 1984 , Manson was imprisoned in the California Medical Facility at Vacaville when inmate Jan Holmstrom poured paint thinner on him and set him on fire , causing second and third degree burns on over 20 percent of his body .
Holmstrom explained that Manson had objected to his Hare Krishna chants and verbally threatened him .[ failed verification ]
After 1989 , Manson was housed in the Protective Housing Unit at California State Prison , Corcoran , in Kings County .
The unit housed inmates whose safety would be endangered by general - population housing .
He had also been housed at San Quentin State Prison , [ 76 ] California Medical Facility in Vacaville , [ failed verification ] Folsom State Prison and Pelican Bay State Prison . [ 81 ] [ citation needed ]
In June 1997 , a prison disciplinary committee found that Manson had been trafficking drugs . [ 81 ]
He was moved from Corcoran State Prison to Pelican Bay State Prison a month later . [ 81 ]
2000s –2017
Manson , age 76 , June 2011
On September 5 , 2007 , MSNBC aired The Mind of Manson , a complete version of a 1987 interview at California 's San Quentin State Prison .
The footage of the " unshackled , unapologetic , and unruly " Manson had been considered " so unbelievable " that only seven minutes of it had originally been broadcast on Today , for which it had been recorded . [ 82 ]
In March 2009 , a photograph of Manson showing a receding hairline , grizzled gray beard and hair , and the swastika tattoo still prominent on his forehead was released to the public by California corrections officials . [ 83 ]
In 2010 , the Los Angeles Times reported that Manson was caught with a cell phone in 2009 and had contacted people in California , New Jersey , Florida and British Columbia .
A spokesperson for the California Department of Corrections stated that it was not known if Manson had used the phone for criminal purposes . [ 84 ]
Manson also recorded an album of acoustic pop songs with additional production by Henry Rollins , titled Completion .
Only five copies were pressed : two belong to Rollins , while the other three are presumed to have been with Manson .
The album remains unreleased . [ 85 ]
Illness and death
On January 1 , 2017 , Manson was suffering from gastrointestinal bleeding at California State Prison in Corcoran when he was rushed to Mercy Hospital in downtown Bakersfield .
A source told the Los Angeles Times that Manson was seriously ill , [ 86 ] and TMZ reported that his doctors considered him " too weak " for surgery . [ 87 ]
He was returned to prison on January 6 , and the nature of his treatment was not disclosed . [ 88 ]
On November 15 , 2017 , an unauthorized source said that Manson had returned to a hospital in Bakersfield , [ 89 ] but the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation did not confirm this in conformity with state and federal medical privacy laws . [ 90 ]
He died from cardiac arrest resulting from respiratory failure and colon cancer at the hospital on November 19 . [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ]
Three people stated their intention to claim Manson 's estate and body . [ 94 ] [ 95 ] [ 96 ]
Manson 's grandson Jason Freeman stated his intent to take possession of Manson 's remains and personal effects . [ 97 ]
Manson 's pen-pal Michael Channels claimed to have a Manson will dated February 14 , 2002 , which left Manson 's entire estate and Manson 's body to Channels . [ 98 ] [ 99 ]
Manson 's friend Ben Gurecki claimed to have a Manson will dated January 2017 which gives the estate and Manson 's body to Matthew Roberts , another alleged son of Manson . [ 94 ] [ 95 ]
In 2012 , CNN ran a DNA match to see if Freeman and Roberts were related to each other and found that they were not .
According to CNN , two prior attempts to DNA match Roberts with genetic material from Manson failed , but the results were reportedly contaminated .
[ 100 ]
On March 12 , 2018 , the Kern County Superior Court in California decided in favor of Freeman in regard to Manson 's body .
Freeman had Manson cremated on March 20 , 2018 . [ 101 ]
As of February 7 , 2020 , Channels and Freeman still had petitions to California courts attempting to establish the heir of Manson 's estate .
At that time , Channels was attempting to force Freeman to submit DNA to the court for testing . [ 102 ]
Personal life
Involvement with Scientology
Manson began studying Scientology while incarcerated with the help of fellow inmate Lanier Rayner , and in July 1961 , Manson listed his religion as Scientology .
A September 1961 prison report argues that Manson " appears to have developed a certain amount of insight into his problems through his study of this discipline . " .
Upon his release in 1967 , Manson traveled to Los Angeles where he reportedly " met local Scientologists and attended several parties for movie stars " .
[ 105 ] [ 106 ] [ 107 ]
Manson completed 150 hours of auditing .
[ 108 ]
Relationships and alleged child
In 2009 , Los Angeles disk jockey Matthew Roberts released correspondence and other evidence indicating that he might be Manson 's biological son .
Roberts ' biological mother claims that she was a member of the Manson Family who left in mid-1967 after being raped by Manson ; she returned to her parents ' home to complete the pregnancy , gave birth on March 22 , 1968 , and put Roberts up for adoption .
CNN conducted a DNA test between Matthew Roberts and Manson 's known biological grandson Jason Freeman in 2012 , showing that Roberts and Freeman did not share DNA . [ 100 ]
Roberts subsequently attempted to establish that Manson was his father through a direct DNA test which proved definitively that Roberts and Manson were not related .
[ 109 ]
In 2014 , it was announced [ by whom ? ] that the imprisoned Manson was engaged to 26 - year - old Afton Elaine Burton and had obtained a marriage license on November 7 . [ 110 ]
Manson gave Burton the nickname " Star " .
She had been visiting him in prison for at least nine years and maintained several websites that proclaimed his innocence .
[ 111 ]
The wedding license expired on February 5 , 2015 , without a marriage ceremony taking place . [ 112 ]
Journalist Daniel Simone reported that the wedding was cancelled after Manson discovered that Burton only wanted to marry him so that she and friend Craig Hammond could use his corpse as a tourist attraction after his death .
[ 112 ] [ 113 ]
According to Simone , Manson believed that he would never die and may simply have used the possibility of marriage as a way to encourage Burton and Hammond to continue visiting him and bringing him gifts .
Burton said on her website that the reason that the marriage did not take place was merely logistical .
Manson was suffering from an infection and had been in a prison medical facility for two months and could not receive visitors .
She said that she still hoped that the marriage license would be renewed and the marriage would take place . [ 112 ]
Psychology
On April 11 , 2012 , Manson was denied release at his 12th parole hearing , which he did not attend .
After his March 27 , 1997 , parole hearing , Manson refused to attend any of his later hearings .
The panel at that hearing noted that Manson had a " history of controlling behavior " and " mental health issues " including schizophrenia and paranoid delusional disorder , and was too great a danger to be released . [ 114 ]
The panel also noted that Manson had received 108 rules violation reports , had no indication of remorse , no insight into the causative factors of the crimes , lacked understanding of the magnitude of the crimes , had an exceptional , callous disregard for human suffering and had no parole plans . [ 115 ]
At the April 11 , 2012 , parole hearing , it was determined that Manson would not be reconsidered for parole for another 15 years , i.e. not before 2027 , at which time he would have been 92 years old . [ 116 ]
Legacy
Cultural impact
Beginning in January 1970 , the left - wing newspapers Los Angeles Free Press and Tuesday 's Child embraced Manson as a hero - figure , and Tuesday 's Child proclaimed him " Man of the Year " .
In June 1970 , Rolling Stone made him their cover story in " Charles Manson : The Incredible Story of the Most Dangerous Man Alive " . [ 117 ]
A Rolling Stone writer visited the Los Angeles District Attorney 's office while preparing that story , [ 118 ] and he was shocked by a photograph of the " Healter [ sic ] Skelter " that Manson 's disciples had written on a wall in their victim 's blood .
[ 119 ]
Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi pointed out the dispute in the underground press over whether Manson was " Christ returned " or " a sick symbol of our times " .[ citation needed ]
Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground reportedly said of the Tate murders : " Dig it , first they killed those pigs , then they ate dinner in the same room with them , then they even shoved a fork into a victim 's stomach .
Wild ! " [ 120 ]
Neo -Nazi and Manson follower James Mason founded the Universal Order , a group that has influenced other movements such as the neo -Nazi terrorist group the Atomwaffen Division .
The Universal Order 's name and logo is a swastika between the scales of justice , remotely designed by Manson.[ clarification needed ]
Bugliosi quoted a BBC employee 's assertion that a " neo-Manson cult " existed in Europe , represented by approximately 70 rock bands playing songs by Manson and " songs in support of him " .
Music
Manson was a struggling musician , seeking to make it big in Hollywood between 1967 and 1969 .
The Beach Boys did a cover of one of his songs .
Other songs were publicly released only after the trial for the Tate murders started .
On March 6 , 1970 , LIE , an album of Manson music , was released . [ 123 ] [ 124 ]
This included " Cease to Exist " , a Manson composition the Beach Boys had recorded with modified lyrics and the title " Never Learn Not to Love " . [ 126 ]
Over the next couple of months only about 300 of the album 's 2,000 copies sold . [ 127 ]
There have been several other releases of Manson recordings – both musical and spoken .
One of these , The Family Jams , includes two compact discs of Manson 's songs recorded by the Family in 1970 , after Manson and the others had been arrested .
Guitar and lead vocals are supplied by Steve Grogan ; [ failed verification ] additional vocals are supplied by Lynette Fromme , Sandra Good , Catherine Share , and others .[ citation needed ]
One Mind , an album of music , poetry , and spoken word , new at the time of its release , in April 2005 , was put out under a Creative Commons license . [ 129 ] [ 130 ]
American rock band Guns N' Roses recorded Manson 's " Look at Your Game , Girl " , included as an unlisted 13th track on their 1993 album " The Spaghetti Incident ? " [ failed verification ] [ 131 ] [ 132 ]
" My Monkey " , which appears on Portrait of an American Family by the American rock band Marilyn Manson , includes the lyrics " I had a little monkey / I sent him to the country and I fed him on gingerbread /
Along came a choo-choo / Knocked my monkey cuckoo /
And now my monkey 's dead . "
These lyrics are from Manson 's " Mechanical Man " , [ 133 ] which is heard on LIE .
Crispin Glover covered " Never Say ' Never ' to Always " on his album The Big Problem ≠ The Solution .
The Solution=Let It Be released in 1989 .
Musical performers such as Kasabian , [ 134 ] Spahn Ranch , [ 135 ] and Marilyn Manson [ 136 ] derived their names from Manson and his lore .

From the moment the president read the Rolling Stone article ’s opening paragraph , it was more likely than not that Gen. Stanley McChrystal would be sacked .
How Obama took command
Vice President Joe Biden was the first top administration official to know about the Rolling Stone article .
He was flying back from Chicago after a campaign event when Gen. Stanley McChrystal called him on Air Force 2 around 5:30 p.m. to apologize for comments in the article .
The vice president had no idea what he was talking about , so the call was brief , and Biden asked his aides to get a copy of the story .
Advertisement
Shortly before , Tommy Vietor , the assistant White House press secretary who handles national - security issues , had been e-mailed a PDF of the article by a colleague in the U.S. government .
Vietor forwarded the PDF to a few officials who tried in vain to read the tiny type on their BlackBerries .
So Vietor printed out a bunch of copies for the national - security inner circle .
He walked one into Robert Gibbs ’ office and handed him a copy , with key passages marked .
It would be a long night : Aides would still be in the West Wing at 10:30 p.m. and later .
President Obama had already gone to the Residence on the second floor of the White House , and Gibbs walked a copy over around 8 p.m.
Within an hour , top aides were talking about firing McChrystal .
A senior administration official recalled yesterday during a briefing for reporters : “ He read the first few paragraphs and decided that we should go to the Oval Office and get a bigger group of people .
…
He was angry . ”
His top national security aides had n’t left , and got together in the Oval Office to hash out what to do .
Before they were finished , they ’d decided to recall McChrystal from Kabul , which bought the president time to make a final decision about his fate .
What was McChrystal thinking ?
One theory :
He 'd seen the great luck General Petraeus had with glossy magazines , and thought that was what generals do , or that he'd have the same great results .
The White House asked the Pentagon for names of possible McChrystal replacements , sending a foreboding message .
Reporters thought maybe Gibbs ' harsh message at his Tuesday briefing ( a need for " competent and mature leadership " ) would be the pound of flesh , and that McChrystal would be saved .
No one on the inside thought that .
A top aide had said a key consideration in the final decision would be “ whether or not Stan gets it . ”
He did n’t seem to .
NBC News Chief Pentagon Correspondent Jim Miklaszewski happened to be on the steps of the Pentagon when McChrystal arrived yesterday morning for his meeting with Secretary Gates , before heading to the White House .
“ Mik ” says McChrystal “ bounded ” up the steps : " My question was , ' Have you already submitted your resignation ? '
' Come on , you know better than that .
No ! '
' When I asked " Will you ? " he was already rushing through the door and up the stairs to his meeting with Gates and never responded . "
A few hours later , McChrystal ’s black SUV had taken him in disgrace to his home at Fort Myer , while the rest of the national security team was meeting in the Situation Room without him .
From the moment the president read the article ’s opening paragraph ( “ ' How'd I get screwed into going to this dinner ? " demands Gen. Stanley McChrystal .
It 's a Thursday night in mid-April , and the commander of all U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan is sitting in a four - star suite at the Hôtel Westminster in Paris ” ) , it was more likely than not that the Afghanistan commander would be sacked .
Officials who participated in the discussions say no single passage was fatal to McChrystal .
But the opening was really bad :
It made the general sound more like a high - school knucklehead than a thoughtful warrior .
As one aide dryly told Playbook : “ The effect on allies was definitely a consideration . ”
Intrade , the online prediction market , on Tuesday night had the chance of the general ’s ouster at 75 percent .
It turns out that was low .
“ People felt like you cannot have different rules just because you ’re the top brass , ” an aide said .
“ A kid who is some PFC [ private first class ] , knows darn well that if he said these things about his commanding officer , he could potentially get thrown in jail . ”
From the beginning , according to participants , the controlling argument was : “ As a matter of civilian control and chain of command , this kind of disrespect is simply untenable and he has to go .
The article leaves murky the question of who is in charge , and sends the wrong signal , from the commanders down to the privates . ”
So the boot was always the default .
Officials say there was careful , extended debate about keeping McChrystal but it was always in the frame of , “ Let ’s examine the case for not accepting his resignation . ”
As one official put it , there were different schools of thought , but there were n’t different camps .
Both sides were argued , sometimes by the same people .
The best case for keeping the general always revolved around the mission : “ McChrystal is the right guy to see it through , and he needs to be chastened but go finish the mission .
A change in command would be disruptive and damaging . ”
That view never gained traction , and there was some relief when it became clear that the consensus was : “ We ’re better off without him . ”
Aides were concerned about “ the atmosphere of this having happened ” and the prospect of “ continuing with all of that stuff in the background . ”
McChrystal already had two strikes :
He had previous transgressions ( including the London speech in which he dismissed out of hand an approach to Afghanistan that could have wound up being the strategy ) .
Those had “ a cumulative effect ” and had “ taken their toll , ” as various aides put it .
And we are n’t exactly rolling through Kandahar , so he was n’t walking on water in the field , which was also in the back of some folks ’ minds .
“ You ’ve got to make the decision that gives the mission , writ large , the best chance of succeeding , ” another aide said .
“ The president would n’t have done this just to make a point .
The goal was n’t , ‘ Who do we like most ? ’ or ‘ Who is the perfect political operator ? ’ but ‘ Who can succeed ? ’
There were compelling reasons [ to fire him ] for the sake of the mission .
It was corrosive and damaging and unsustainable . ”
No serious consideration was given to “ relitigating ” the mission , which was why Petraeus was considered “ the perfect solution -- one that would mitigate , and perhaps eliminate , the down side of a change of command . ”
Other names were discussed , but Petraeus was discussed from the beginning .
A participant said : “ The name surfaced on Tuesday as a possibility and gained real momentum in a meeting with advisers before the McChrystal meeting [ in the Oval Office , which lasted 20 or so minutes ] .
The president was definitely leaning [ toward ] making a change going into the meeting , though wanted to hear the general out . ”
In the Rose Garden , the president would say : “ [ T ] his is a change in personnel but it is not a change in policy .
General Petraeus fully participated in our review last fall , and he both supported and helped design the strategy that we have in place . …
He has my full confidence , and I am urging the Senate to confirm him for this new assignment as swiftly as possible . ”
The passage that will live in history is : “ I ’ve just told my national security team that now is the time for all of us to come together .
Doing so is not an option , but an obligation .
I welcome debate among my team , but I wo n’t tolerate division .
All of us have personal interests ; all of us have opinions .
Our politics often fuels conflict , but we have to renew our sense of common purpose and meet our responsibilities to one another , and to our troops who are in harm ’s way , and to our country . ”
That was about more than the “ The Runaway General . ”
It was a message to Obama ’s entire team that it should function like his loyal , leak - free campaign .
A longtime Obaman told us : “ This was a loud appeal to keep our eye on the ball .
A war strategy is about more than any of its parts or personalities or egos or titles .
It ’s about getting the job done .
That was absolutely intended in those remarks . ”
“ Obama ’s war ” now has a new front .
Mining magnate Clive Palmer has retreated from his earlier claim that he had scrapped mining projects because of the Federal Government 's proposed resource super profits tax .
Mr Palmer owns one of the largest deposits of iron ore in the world , carved out in five separate projects .
The investment for the first development was secured before the super profits tax was announced .
Mr Palmer , a Liberal National Party donor , told Lateline last month he had canned two projects in Western Australia 's Pilbara region because of the tax .
He said one of those projects would employ about 3,000 people and generate about $ 2 billion a year in exports .
But now Mr Palmer has told tonight 's Four Corners program that he was probably exaggerating .
" Probably , it should have been , ' [ I am ] slowing them down , waiting to see what happens ' , " he said .
Mr Palmer says he still strongly opposes the tax .
But Federal Small Business Minister Craig Emerson says Mr Palmer has revealed that he is part of a scare campaign against the plan for a resources tax .
" Clive Palmer 's admission today that he is not cancelling projects just exposes as a scare campaign his activities and those of Tony Abbott and some other elements of the mining industry - a scare campaign against tax reform in this country , " Mr Emerson said .
Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan told Four Corners some of the concerns mining companies had about the tax were legitimate .

Update : After following up with the Mint , any shipments and deliveries of American Eagle 2010 edition both gold and silver are TBD and the mint has no idea on when these will be received if at all this year .
A small shipment of American Buffalo gold coins will go on sale on June 3 at noon .
The mint expects these to sell out promptly .
Earlier we reported that the US Mint has run out of American Eagle silver coins .
It turns out the Mint is also out of gold American Eagles .
Here is the US Mint page linking to various American Eagle subcategories .
And here is the specific “ availability ” of :
1. American Eagle Gold Proof Coins :
Production of United States Mint American Eagle Gold Proof and Uncirculated Coins has been temporarily suspended because of unprecedented demand for American Eagle Gold Bullion Coins .
Currently , all available 22 - karat gold blanks are being allocated to the American Eagle Gold Bullion Coin Program , as the United States Mint is required by Public Law 99 - 185 to produce these coins “ in quantities sufficient to meet public demand . . . . ”
The United States Mint will resume the American Eagle Gold Proof and Uncirculated Coin Programs once sufficient inventories of gold bullion blanks can be acquired to meet market demand for all three American Eagle Gold Coin products .
Additionally , as a result of the recent numismatic product portfolio analysis , fractional sizes of American Eagle Gold Uncirculated Coins will no longer be produced .
Update : Due to the continued , sustained demand for American Eagle Gold Bullion Coins , 2009 - dated American Eagle Gold Proof Coins will not be produced .

Comment on this article
When most of us think of climate change and global warming we think of the atmosphere – warmest decades on record recently , atmospheric CO 2 at record levels and climbing , increased floods , droughts , hurricanes , melting glaciers , etc .
When we do speak about the oceans , it is typically about heat content , Arctic ice melt , and sea level rise .
However , the 800 lb. gorilla in the room just might be ocean acidification .
The ocean has absorbed about half of all the anthropogenic ( human ) carbon emissions since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution ( Doney , 2006 ) .
The CO 2 that the oceans absorb is causing a lower pH which means the oceans are moving toward more acidic conditions .
The consequences could be dire .
Where Do Carbon Emissions End Up
The figure below ( Ruddiman , 2008 ) shows where the carbon emissions end up .
Fossil fuel burning and land clearance are sources of carbon while the oceans and land ( primarily due to vegetation ) are sinks for carbon .
The measured amount of carbon in the atmosphere is only 55 % of what is actually being emitted into the air .
According to the Global Carbon Project ( 2009 ) :
The global oceanic CO 2 sink removed 26 % of all CO 2 emissions for the period 2000 - 2008 , equivalent to an average of 2.3 GtC per year .
While the total amount of CO 2 being removed by the ocean is increasing , its efficiency ( the fraction removed of the total emissions ) appears to have been declining over the last two decades partially owing to the decline in efficiency of the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic Ocean where long term field observations and model results appear to be in agreement .
In 2008 , the oceans removed an amount of CO 2 slightly below average .
The amount of CO 2 that is absorbed by the oceans is a function of water temperature , pressure , and salinity ( salt content ) known as the solubility pump and biological processes known as the biological pump .
Colder , saltier water absorbs more CO 2 while warmer , less salty water absorbs less CO 2 .
There are various complex factors that control the biological pump and these are shown below .
Careful measurements show that the bulk of the CO2 being absorbed by the oceans resides in the shallowest layers ( Doney , 2006 ) .
Ocean Chemistry :
When carbon dioxide is absorbed by the oceans , it forms carbonic acid ( H 2 CO 3 ) , the same weak acid found in carbonated beverages .
Carbonic acid then releases hydrogen ions ( H+ ) into solution which lowers the pH of the water .
The full chemical reaction ends up leaving both bicarbonate ions ( HCO3 –1 ) and , to a lesser extent , carbonate ions ( CO3 –2 ) .
The normal pH of sea water in perfect conditions ranges between 8.0 and 8.3 ( slightly alkaline ) .
The pH of the oceans has already decreased 0.1 from pre-Industrial values due to the absorption of anthropogenic CO 2 and the projections are for the pH to lower an additional 0.3 by 2100 if emissions go unabated ( Ibid ) .
Although these changes appear to be small , these small pH changes may cause devastating effects on sea creatures that need carbonate ions to build their calcium carbonate shells .
The excess H+ ions combine with carbonate ions to make bicarbonate .
The result is less and less carbonate for shelled sea creatures .
The Shell Game :
Plankton is the base of the marine food chain .
Coccolithophorids , which are covered with small plates of calcium carbonate and are commonly found floating near the surface of the ocean ( where they use the abundant sunlight for photosynthesis ) are in danger with slightly lower pH values .
Other potentially endangered planktonic organisms are foraminifera and pteropods .
These life forms constitute a major food source for fish and marine mammals , including some species of whales .
And , of course , humans and other animals rely on a robust marine food chain .
The abundance of commercially important shellfish species ( i.e. , clams , oysters , sea urchins ) could also decline , which could have serious consequences for marine food resources ( Cooley et al. , 2009 ) .
Corals are also endangered with lower pH .
Corals are essentially calcium carbonate skeletons of the creatures that live inside them .
Coral reefs are the most productive and biologically diverse ecosystems in the ocean .
Coralline algae ( algae that also secrete calcium carbonate and often resemble corals ) contribute to the calcification of many reefs , too .
The Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia , for instance — the largest biological structure in the world — is simply the accumulation of generation after generation of coral and coralline algae .
Less obvious examples occur deeper down in the sea , where cold - water coral communities dot continental margins and seamounts , forming important fish habitats ( Doney , 2006 ) .
The calcium carbonate in corals or in the shells of other marine creatures comes in two distinct mineral forms : calcite and aragonite .
Aragonite and magnesium calcite are more soluble than normal calcite .
Thus , corals and pteropods , which both produce aragonitic shells , and coralline algae , which manufacture magnesium calcite , may be especially susceptible to harm from ocean acidification ( Ibid ) .
The saturation horizon is the level below which aragonite and calcite begin to dissolve .
The influx of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere has caused the saturation horizons for aragonite and calcite to shift closer to the surface by 50 to 200 meters compared with where they were positioned in the 1800s .
As the ocean becomes more and more acidic less and less of the sea will remain hospitable for calcifying organisms ( Ibid ) .
The outlook for coral reefs is bleak .
For those precious ecosystems , ocean acidification is but one of many environmental stresses , an onslaught that includes greenhouse warming , local pollution , over - fishing and habitat destruction .
Many coral reefs are already in decline , and ocean acidification may push some over the edge into nonexistence ( Ibid ) .
Any Good News ?
Phytoplankton need dissolved CO 2 and nitrogen ( N 2 ) to thrive .
These organisms may benefit from increased levels of those dissolved gas .
Some plants such as sea grasses may also thrive due to CO 2 fertilization .
Fu et al. ( 2008 ) note that several studies ( Hutchins et al. , 2007 ; Levitan et al. , 2007 ; Ramos et al. , 2007 ) have shown significant increases in N 2 fixation and photosynthesis in response to elevated CO 2 .
They conclude that anthropogenic CO 2 enrichment could substantially increase global oceanic N 2 and CO 2 fixation which would increase certain types of phytoplankton but only if there is enough iron ( Fe ) availability .
However , according to David Hutchins ( 2010 ) , Professor of Marine Environmental Biology , University of Southern California , USA , “ Some of the experiments that have been done so far suggest that the likely new dominant phytoplankton species in the future acidified ocean may be less able to support the productive food chains that we presently rely on to support healthy ocean ecosystems and fisheries resources . ”
Iron and the Carbon Sink :
Sunda ( 2010 ) and Shi et al. ( 2010 ) have noted that the acidification of the oceans may decrease the biological availability of iron which would reduce the ability of phytoplankton such as diatoms to absorb CO 2 .
These organisms play an important role in the ocean carbon sink .
Shi et al. found that the projected pH decrease by the year 2100 would reduce iron uptake by diatoms by 10 % to 20 % .
In addition , warmer ocean temperatures due to global warming do not allow as much dissolved CO 2 gas to be present .
According to the Global Carbon Budget ( 2008 ) , “ While the total amount of CO 2 being removed by the ocean is increasing , its efficiency ( the fraction removed of the total emissions ) appears to have been declining over the last two decades … ” ”
The oceans are already struggling to keep up with human emissions .
The figure below shows representative examples of impacts of ocean acidification on major groups of marine biota derived from experimental manipulation studies .
The response curves on the right indicate four cases : ( a ) linear negative , ( b ) linear positive , ( c ) level , and ( d ) nonlinear parabolic responses to increasing levels of seawater pCO2 for each of the groups ( adapted from Doney et al. , 2009 ) .
Marine Oxygen Holes :
Hoffman and Schellnhuber ( 2009 ) in their paper , Oceanic acidification affects marine carbon pump and triggers extended marine oxygen holes , modeled ocean acidification into the future assuming a business as usual CO 2 emission scenario .
Their research shows that by the year 2200 with atmospheric CO 2 levels reaching 1750 ppm , the sea - surface pH value drops by > 0.7 units on global average , inhibiting the growth of marine calcifying organisms .
They also found that as organic matter is oxidized in shallow waters when the carbon pump weakens , oxygen holes ( hypoxic or dead zones ) start to expand considerably in the oceans in the future — with potentially harmful impacts on a variety of marine ecosystems .
I am an optimist so I think that society will realize the consequences of increased CO 2 well before reaching 1750 ppm CO 2 however , the image above is a sobering reminder of what might happen in a worst - case scenario future .
The Unknowns :
When one reads Impacts of Ocean Acidification on Coral Reefs and Other Marine Calcifiers : A Guide for Future Research , ( Kleypas et al. , 2006 ) it becomes quite clear that the impact of ocean acidification on marine life is uncertain because it is essentially a fledgling field .
It was not part of the IPCC TAR ( 2001 ) however the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report on Climate Change ( 2007 ) stated in the Summary for Policy Makers , “ The progressive acidification of the oceans due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide is expected to have negative impacts on marine shell - forming organisms ( e.g. corals ) and their dependent species . ”
Ocean acidification and its impact will be seriously addressed by the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC to be released in 2013 .
The Knowns :
According to Iglesias - Rodriguez , Doney , Widdicombe , Barry , Caldeira , & Hall - Spencer ( 2010 ) : “ The rate of human - driven ocean acidification is about 100 times faster in the surface ocean than that experienced by marine ecosystems globally for tens of millions of years . ”
According to Barry , Schmidt , & Caldeira ( 2010 ) : “ Other than at times of the great mass extinctions , there is no evidence in the geologic record for sustained rates of change in atmospheric CO 2 that have been as great or greater than today’s .
Even during extreme ocean chemistry changes in geological history — for example , during the Paleocene / Eocene thermal maximum ( PETM ) 55 million years ago when carbonate minerals dissolved in most of the deep and intermediate ocean — these changes probably happened over several thousands of years .
In general , ocean life recovers from extinction episodes by adaptation and evolution of new species , but this takes roughly 10 million years to achieve pre-extinction levels of biodiversity . ”
Although much is unknown , it seems clear that humans are altering the oceans in a manner unique to their history and to the history of the marine life within .
Just as the grand experiment we are undertaking with the climate , we are doing the same with the oceans .
The results of both of these experiments will likely be harmful to life on this planet .

Internet porn sites may soon have the option to move off the " .com " main street of the Web to their very own adult - only domain : " .xxx . "
But industry experts say the adult world is divided over whether or not there is actually a need for a dedicated virtual red - light district .
The Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) , an international Internet oversight group , announced Friday that it would proceed with a proposal to register " .xxx , " after rejecting the same application three years ago .
Peter Dengate
Thrush , chairman of ICANN 's board of directors , told ABCNews.com that the board had previously rejected the .xxx proposal by ICM Registry , LLC because of disagreement over whether or not a community of adult content providers backed the proposal .
One of ICANN 's application requirements is that a community sponsors each proposal , and he said , " There was doubt about the size and strength of the community .
And the commitment to the process . "
ICANN Reverses Decision , Moves Ahead With .XXX Domain
But after an outside panel reviewed ICANN 's 2007 decision , its board ruled today to reverse its decision to block the .xxx suffix and proceed with the process .
Thrush said there are still several steps to complete before the .xxx domain is ready for use , but he added that if everything moves quickly , the process could be completed in six to eight months , though it could take longer .
Still , Stuart Lawley , president of ICM Registry , is confident that the .xxx domain will ultimately reach the Web .
" I think there is almost zero chance of this not happening , " he said , adding that the volume of requests to reserve Web addresses " is going up by the minute . "
He said that as of Thursday he'd taken about 110,000 reservations , and overnight received 2,000 more .
By the time the registry launches , he said he expects the number of registrations to reach 500,000 .
According to his research , there are about 5 or 6 million adult sites on the Internet and , if all goes well , he said he could potentially capture 2 to 3 million of them over time .
Adult - Only Domain Could Help Parents Filter Content , Advocate Says
Though Lawley charges $ 60 to register a .xxx site , rather that the the $ 10 charged for generic .com sites , he said he hopes to convince adult content providers that his domain names can draw more traffic .
He said the .xxx sites will adhere to a higher code of conduct in terms of dealing with customer data and keeping sites free of malicious content .
He also said there would be a benefit to families that want to block adult content from kids , as the .xxx domain ensures more effective filtering .
The uncommon domain also decreases the chance of children or others just stumbling on to a pornographic site .
For adult content providers , that means " more customers visiting on a more regular basis and feeling more confident to spend money on those sites , " he said .
" Over a period of five or 10 years … we hope it will become the preferred domain of choice for the adult industry . "
Industry Divided Over Value of .XXX
But industry observers say owners of adult sites are split over whether or not the Internet change is a positive one .
" There are two different camps .
The kind of business folks who look at every opportunity as a business opportunity and those who are very … protective of the potential ' ghettoization ' of the industry , " said Alec Helmy , president and publisher of XBiz , an adult industry news outlet .
He said some skeptics worry that creating a .xxx domain could make it possible for governments to require adult sites to use the dedicated suffix and then potentially block them all at will .
Others say adopting a .xxx domain in a .com world will make it harder for potential customers to find adult sites of interest .
" It 's a hot topic on the various message boards , " Helmy said .
" The value proposition of the .xxx -- is this something that the industry needs , or is it just some other way for another entity to make money ? "
But even as the debate rages on , he said it appears that the big names in the industry are registering their names on the .xxx domain as a precautionary measure to protect their brands and future real estate .
Even Critics Could Ultimately Adopt .XXX
" If you 're Playboy I think you would want to register Playboy . xxx [ before ] some Joe Schmoe , " he said .
Though he does n't see .xxx replacing .com , he said that as the .xxx proposal progresses , he expects even critics to come on board .
" The way the media has covered the latest development is that this is on the way to being approved , " he said .
" If it does , I think a good proportion of those who are opponents would probably find one way or another to protect their brands by registering domain names .
If you can't beat it , join it . "
BP CEO Tony Hayward takes a first hand look at the recovery operations aboard the Discover Enterprise drill ship in the Gulf of Mexico , 55 miles ( 89 km ) south of Venice , Louisiana on May 28 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Sean Gardner
NEW ORLEANS ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government has launched a widely expected criminal and civil investigation into BP Plc's BP.L massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said on Tuesday , ratcheting up the pressure on the beleaguered British oil company .
“ We have begun both a criminal as well as a civil investigation as is our obligation under the law , ” Holder told reporters after meeting with state and federal prosecutors in New Orleans .
“ Our environmental laws are very clear . ”
Federal agencies , including the FBI , are participating in the probe and “ if we find evidence of illegal behavior , we will be forceful in our response , ” he said , adding that prosecutors had a “ sufficient basis ” to start a criminal probe .
After taking a tour of the oil spill , Holder said he saw “ oil for miles and miles , oil that we know has already affected plant and animal life among the coast . ”
The Justice Department has already demanded that the companies involved in the spill , including BP , Transocean Ltd RIGN.
SRIG.N and Halliburton Co HAL.N , preserve records related to the accident .
The Justice Department will examine the companies ’ actions for violations under the Clean Water Act , the Endangered Species Act , the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , which can be used to hold them liable for cleanup costs and reimbursement for government efforts .
Additionally , the Justice Department could pursue other traditional charges if they find the companies made false statements or obstructed the investigation .
“ As our review expands in the days ahead , we will be meticulous , we will be comprehensive , and we will be aggressive , ” Holder told reporters .
“ We will not rest until justice is done . ”
Kucinich : Flotilla raid jeopardizes US troops in Iraq
Some conservative commentators and lawmakers are pointing the finger of blame at President Barack Obama over Israel ’s raid on a Gaza - bound humanitarian flotilla that ended with the death of nine activists .
On Tuesday , Sen. John McCain told Fox News that the Obama administration ’s calls for a settlement freeze in the West Bank and in East Jerusalem set the stage for the deadly May 31 incident .

“ This is another step in a chain of unfortunate events beginning with President ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s insistence that there be a freeze , as a precondition for peace talks , a freeze on settlements in Jerusalem , ” McCain told Fox ’s Sean Hannity .
“ Jerusalem is the capital of Israel , not a settlement . ”
Talk show host Michael Savage linked President Obama to the flotilla raid much more directly .
Savage told listeners that he believed the Israeli commandos sent on board the Mavi Marmara were “ betrayed ” so that their deaths would be “ good PR ” for Israel ’s allies .
( No Israeli service members died in the raid . )
And he suggested it was the Obama administration that pressured Israel into “ dangling [ its ] soldiers like bait into a tank of sharks . ”
“ As far as I know , it was Obama ’s administration that told them how to do this attack , ” Savage said .
“ It was probably one of America ’s peace - loving generals , who knows which one of them did it . ”
Savage then went on to suggest an even stranger theory :
That the flotilla itself was set up by political extremists in the United States who have been linked to Obama .
“ There are Web sites that are alleging that this was orchestrated not so much by Turkey but by the United States , from Chicago , by Bill Ayres and Bernadette Dhorn , who are members of the Free Gaza group . ”

KUCINICH : FLOTILLA RAID JEOPARDIZES US TROOPS IN IRAQ
Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich , one of Congress ’ most outspoken progressive leaders , has circulated a letter he wrote to President Obama calling on the United States to “ redefine its relationship with Israel ” in the wake of the Gaza flotilla raid , and said Israel ’s actions posed a risk to US troops in Iraq .
Because the raid has strained Israel ’s relations withTurkey , the Israeli raid “ undermines United StatesÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ troops efforts in Iraq , since your administration ’s efforts to achieve stability in the region and to withdraw troops from Iraq has depended upon Turkey ’s cooperation through use of its air bases , ” Kucinich told Obama .

Kucinich said that while “ no one questions the right of Israel to defend its border , ” the country “ must account for our support , for the lives of our soldiers , for the investment of billions from our taxpayers .
Israel owes the United States more than reckless , pre-meditated violence waged against innocent people . ”
Kucinich added that the raid must have “ consequences for the Netanyahu Administration and for the State of Israel .
Those consequences must be dealt by the United States .
They must be diplomatic and they must be financial . ”

Penn Jillette :
If they could take out Galileo , why can't they take out Penn and Teller .
Was that your thinking ?
It was , yeah .
And then there was that ad in Variety from the Catholic League accusing you of " hate speech . "
Well remember , the Catholic League is just one divorced guy in his garage .
Or as Teller and I like to say , the Catholic League and his wife .
I love that it 's called hate speech when you have the audacity to suggest that pederasty and child rape might not be a good idea .
( Laughs . )
That 's a pretty odd definition of hate speech , if you ask me .
The Vatican episode is n't included on the season 7 DVD of Bullshit .
What happened there ?
Was that Showtime 's decision or yours ?
I swear to god , it was just a little oversight in the printing process .
( Laughs . )
Do you really think I 'm dumb enough to believe an avowed atheist who begins a sentence with " I swear to god " ?
The honest answer , and it's actually less fulfilling than the answer I just gave you , is I do n't know .
They never told me .
The DVD came out and the Vatican episode was n't on it and nobody had talked to us and I actually found out about it by fans going " What the fuck ? "
But of course when you try to say you did n't know anything about it , you sound like a cross between Nixon and an idiot .
Do you have any theories about what might 've happened ?
Maybe Showtime was nervous about a backlash ?
I think that has to be the case , even though the reaction was overwhelmingly positive , and what we said about the Catholic Church was actually much more conservative than what the New York Times said a few months ago .
We do n't actually say that the Pope himself was covering up child rape , which turns out to be the truth .
We do n't say that , because at the time we did n't have proof .
The funny thing is , if you look at the Vatican show now , after everything we 've learned over the past year , it almost plays an apology for the Catholic Church .
As you know , there are hundreds of people involved in a corporation , and I guess somebody at Showtime decided it was for the best to leave it off the DVD .
And maybe it was for the best .
I 'm always surprised when the corporate world does stupid things , because they 're often not very stupid in hindsight .
Like when South Park did an episode portraying Muhammad in a bear costume and Comedy Central said " Whoa , Nellie ? "
I think that said more about the Islamic group that made death threats against Trey and Matt than it does about Comedy Central .
I believe very much that the most damning thing you can say about Muslims is that you 're afraid to say anything because they 'll hurt you .
As opposed to other religions ?
I will forever stick up for Catholics and Christians in general .
With a small number of very horrible exceptions , they do play by the rules .
That 's a curious sentiment from somebody who 's gone out of his way to make fun of religion .
I do believe that a belief in god is crazy , but that does n't mean that the people who believe in it are crazy .
Those are two different things .
Ideas can be stupid and crazy and the people who hold those ideas are not necessarily stupid and crazy .
You 've said that you 're beyond atheism .
What does that mean ?
I have trouble believing that other people believe .
( Laughs . )
You think they 're lying ?
Japan 's Nissan Motor 's Leaf electric vehicle during a press conference on the pre-order announcement at the company 's global headquarters in Yokohama .
As the Gulf of Mexico disaster casts an ugly spotlight on the pitfalls of global oil dependency , Japan 's auto giants are moving into high gear in a drive to mass - market electric cars .

As the Gulf of Mexico disaster casts an ugly spotlight on the pitfalls of global oil dependency , Japan 's auto giants are moving into high gear in a drive to mass - market electric cars .
Nissan , Honda and Toyota are among car - makers now gambling that electric vehicles ( EVs ) with their zero tailpipe emissions will catch on and , some time in the future , start to drive traditional gas - guzzlers off the road .
If their bet pays off , green car proponents say , it could ring in a revolution that changes the very idea of what an automobile is , turning cars into electric appliances that drive smoothly , cleanly and silently .
US President Barack Obama called last Tuesday for a " national mission " to develop clean energy , speaking from the White House as gushing crude oil kept fuelling his country 's worst environmental catastrophe .
" The tragedy unfolding on our coast is the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean energy future is now , " he said in a sombre prime - time telecast .
Battery - powered cars will be a crucial part of that future , manufacturers promise , even as critics point to tough hurdles -- including higher sticker prices and ' range anxiety ' -- to gaining wide consumer acceptance .
An EV's energy consumption and carbon footprint are determined by the way its battery is charged -- meaning it can effectively be powered by anything from fossil fuel or nuclear plants to hydro , wind or solar energy .
A critical question will be whether sufficiently large networks of electric re-charging stations are built -- a chicken - and - egg question that has long held back the development of EVs , analysts say .
Cars that can be charged like a cellphone by plugging them into a wall socket , preferably during overnight off - peak hours , promise to shield consumers from volatile petrol prices and be cheaper in the long run .
Another benefit is that they emit none of the tailpipe pollutants that have covered the skies over cities from Los Angeles to Mumbai in smog .
Their efficiency is boosted because they are lighter , have motors that directly power wheels , preserving energy otherwise lost in transmission , and because the battery charge is topped up by regenerative braking .
Bullish Nissan , part - owned by Renault of France , will in December roll out its Leaf -- short for Leading Environmentally Friendly , Affordable Family car -- as the world 's first mass - produced electric car .
The five - seater hatchback has a top speed above 140 kilometres ( 90 miles ) per hour , a range of 160 kilometres ( 100 miles ) and can be recharged in eight hours , or rapid - charged to 80 percent of capacity in 30 minutes .
" We do believe this car is a game - changer in terms of this technology , and it will play a role in the future , " Simon Thomas , Nissan 's senior vice president of sales and marketing , said in London last month .
Nissan plans to sell 50,000 EVs in the United States , Japan and Europe per year in 2011 and 2012 and then 500,000 units in 2013 .
It predicts that by 2020 electric cars will account for 10 percent of the global auto market .
-- Japan enthusiasts drive electric car 1,000 kilometres --
Although experts foresee revolutionary change , they disagree on the pace .
" This could be a new industrial revolution , " said Mamoru Kato , analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Center .
" With EVs , you will no longer need traditional auto parts makers .
Carmakers will essentially become electronics makers . "
However , he predicted EVs wo n't really take off for another 10 years .
" I think the hurdle for their popularisation is very high , " he told AFP .
" It will take at least a decade to improve batteries so that they can sufficiently power vehicles .
After that , it will take more years to build up infrastructure , like battery power stations . "
Questions remain about global standards for electric plug - in systems , and about the supply of lithium for batteries and their safe disposal .
Batteries now make up about a half the price of an EV , typically between 10,000 and 20,000 dollars , and a key will be to make them cheaper and last longer , said Tatsuya Mizuno , analyst at Mizuno Credit Advisory .
" Generally , they have to increase performance while cutting prices , " he said .
" It will be difficult .
But prices of electronics parts are falling fast . "
Whatever the outlook , other major carmakers , among them General Motors , Ford , BMW and Daimler , plan to start selling EVs by 2013 .
At home Nissan will go head - to - head with Mitsubishi Motors which launched its all electric " i- MiEV " compact a year ago .
Toyota , which has for more than a decade sold petrol - electric hybrids such as the Prius , has promised to launch its own electric car by 2012 .
Last month it bought a 50 - million - dollar stake in Tesla Motors , a Palo Alto , California start - up that in 2004 began developing its Roadster , a boutique , " highway - ready " electric sports car with a range of about 245 miles .
The Silicon Valley firm this year also bought the former NUMMI factory in Fremont , California which until recently made Toyota 's Corolla and Tacoma vehicles , to build its Model S sedan and future Tesla vehicles .
Some industry players may leapfrog to EVs , PriceWaterhouseCooper said in a recent report , pointing to the " changing geography of the automotive industry " .
" Chinese automakers , for example , understand it will behove them to focus on developing electric vehicles rather than committing major resources to catching up on internal combustion engine standards , " it said .
In many countries , electric charging networks are now being built .
The company Better Place has built up EV infrastructure in Denmark and Israel where drivers can either recharge or swap batteries , focusing on customers such as government agencies and taxi fleets .
Nissan says it has partnered with 50 groups and communities around the world , from Australia 's capital Canberra to parts of England , to introduce EVs with subsidies and benefits such as dedicated highway lanes .
California is shaping up as the US test - bed for EVs , with the government offering rebates and backing a network of more than 5,000 charging stations , set to be up and running by 2012 .
Many will be at locations where people spend time -- including restaurants , hotels , malls and churches -- and some major retailers plan to offer electricity for free to attract customers , Dow Jones has reported .
In Japan pilot programmes in tourist spots and by city governments have given many people a taste of driving an EV .
A citizens group , the Japan Electric Vehicle Club , has fuelled the buzz .
In May it claimed a new world record when it drove its own EV , fitted with a stack of lithium ion batteries , for 1,003 kilometers ( 623 miles ) on a single charge .

THE Israeli government is haggling with the United States and Europe over the terms and composition of a commission of inquiry that it proposes to set up to investigate its lethal storming on May 31st of a Turkish ship bringing aid to Gaza .
At the same time , in close co-ordination with Egypt , Israel is offering to ease the blockade of Gaza , drastically reducing the list of goods it refuses to let into the territory .
These measures , the Israeli government believes , may stem the wave of international opprobrium that swept over the Jewish state following the ship incident , in which nine Turkish civilians died .
The Israeli prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , has told his ministers and senior officials to refrain from any public response to the blistering verbal attacks being made by Turkey 's prime minister , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , and members of his government .
The two countries , close allies for many years , still have important defence ties that Israel hopes to preserve despite the present crisis .
The Israeli army has already commissioned its own internal inquiry , headed by a retired general , Giora Eiland .
Although public opinion at home largely rallied behind the armed forces , many Israelis have criticised the failure to anticipate violent resistance aboard the Mavi Marmara , the largest vessel in a six - ship flotilla carrying peace campaigners and pro-Palestinian activists .
Israeli commandos dropped from helicopters , firing paintballs , and were apparently set upon by activists wielding clubs and knives .
According to the Israelis , this forced the commandos to open fire .
Mr Netanyahu has suggested that an inquiry commission comprising Israeli experts in international law could be joined by American and European observers .
The prime minister and his minister of defence , Ehud Barak , would appear before this commission and answer its questions .
His own suggested nominees , however , were two retired diplomats , one with outspoken right - wing views , and a professor of international law who is angling to be appointed — with Mr Netanyahu 's approval — as Israel 's ambassador to the UN .
The Israeli prime minister also made it clear that serving soldiers and officers would not be allowed to give evidence before the commission .
It would rely on the findings of the army 's inquiry board .
The commission 's ambit , in Mr Netanyahu 's blueprint , would also focus purely on whether the blockade of Gaza and the seizure of the peace flotilla were legal .
The broader questions of the wisdom and morality of the assault would be beyond its mandate .
The Americans reportedly want more international participation on the commission and a heavier - weight Israeli to chair it to give it greater credibility .
But both Israel and America want to avoid a repeat of the controversial UN report issued in September by Richard Goldstone , a South African judge , which accused Israel and Hamas , the Islamist group that runs the Gaza Strip , of war crimes during Israel 's three - week attack on Gaza which began in December 2008 .
On June 2nd the Geneva - based UN Human Rights Council , which initiated the Goldstone inquiry , voted “ to dispatch an independent international fact - finding mission to investigate violations of international law , including international humanitarian aid and human rights law ” .
But the council has a long history of criticising Israel and America and several European countries opposed the resolution .
Israel , meanwhile , has remained notably silent about Egypt 's decision last week to open the crossing between Gaza and Sinai at Rafah and its follow - up announcement on June 7th that the border would remain open indefinitely .
The blockade of the Gaza Strip , which has been in place since Hamas took power in 2007 , has been enforced by Israel and Egypt , acting separately , with the initial endorsement of America and the European Union .
A busy network of tunnels running under Rafah has , in any event , made a mockery of the Egyptian effort .
But Egypt has been building an iron barrier , sunk deep into the sandy soil , to thwart this subterranean traffic .
It is supposed to be finished by August .
Israel for its part has been praising Egypt of late for the meticulous nature of its measures to ensure that missiles and other weapons do not flow into the strip .
Although Israel indicates that it will now substantially ease the flow of goods across its own land - crossings into Gaza , its officials say there will be no let - up in the sea blockade .
One ship , they explain , can bring in more weapons than a fleet of lorries with hidden military hardware .
A potential cancer drug developed from an Australian rainforest plant is set to progress to human trials after fighting off inoperable tumours in pets , the company behind it said Monday .
Queensland firm QBiotics
Ltd said its drug EBC - 46 , derived from the seeds of a tropical rainforest shrub , was ready to be tested on humans after successfully treating solid tumours in more than 100 dogs , cats and horses .
" We 've treated over 150 animals ... with a variety of tumours and we 're prepared to move into human studies , " chief executive Victoria Gordon told AFP .
Dr Gordon said the results so far indicated the drug could work to counter a range of malignant growths , such as skin cancers , head and neck cancer , breast cancer and prostate cancer .
She said the drug works like a detonator inside tumours , prompting inactive beneficial white cells to begin to fight and destroy the cancer .
The company has spent six years developing the drug since the previously unknown molecule in the native Australian plant blushwood was discovered , and hopes to raise enough funds to begin human trials in 2011 .
Gordon said the compound proves the value of retaining Australia 's tropical rainforests .
" The world 's rainforests are an amazing biological resource which we need to conserve and cherish , " she said in a statement .
" Not only may they hold the secret to many new drugs , they are the home of more than half of all other species with which we share the planet . "
The Cancer Council Australia sounded a note of caution on the development , saying the company had not yet published its research .
" We have yet to see the results of this research published in a scientific journal , where they would be subject to independent scientific scrutiny , which is useful in determining the rigour of the research , " chief executive Ian Olver said in a statement .
" While it is encouraging to see success in animals , this has not been a good predictor of success in humans , " Professor Olver said .
" So , it is far too early to be able to class this as a breakthrough . "

Australians would be unable to access the internet without having anti-virus and firewall programs installed and a virus - free machine under a new plan put forward by a year - long parliamentary cyber - crime inquiry .
A prominent cyber- security consultant , Alastair MacGibbon , who is a former director of the AFP 's Australian High Tech Crime Centre and eBay 's former security chief , has called for the proposal to be taken a step further by forcing ISPs to monitor the security of users ' machines and block them from connecting if their browsers , security and operating system software are not up to standard .
But Peter Coroneos , chief executive of the Internet Industry Association ( IIA ) , has questioned whether such ideas are practical and says the government would not be able to enforce the content of ISPs ' contractual relationships with customers .
Other recommendations put forward in the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications - titled Hackers , Fraudsters and Botnets : Tackling the Problem of Cyber Crime - include the establishment of an Office of Online Security and 24 - hour hotline where people could report cyber crime without having to go to a police station .
It also suggests a mandatory obligation on ISPs to inform users when their machines are infected and , if necessary , disconnect them from the internet until the affected machine is fixed .
Windsor police officers are working with the Windsor - Essex County Humane Society to find whomever is responsible for wrapping a condom around a young black Labrador 's genitals , forcing animal workers to put the dog down .
The dog , between one and three years old , was found Tuesday running loose and caught in the back of a schoolyard , according to The Windsor Star .
That 's when workers were horrified at the gruesome discovery .
“ Originally our vet seemed to think there was some bestiality or sexual activity involved , ” said Nancy McCabe , field operations manager for the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals .
“ But it ’s really hard to determine . ”
McCabe told The Detroit News that the dog had obviously been well - cared for , with a good coat and body weight .
But because of the pain , he had to be euthanized .
“ It was all bloody and red , it was turning black , it was disgusting , " she said .
As both the Star and CBC report , it 's the latest in a string of odd animal - abuse cases in Windsor .
Most recently , a 17 - year - old Windsor boy was arrested for beating and stabbing a cat before stuffing it into a bag to drown in its own blood .

Novell has just announced Pulse , an exciting and much anticipated cloud - based , real - time collaboration platform for the enterprise .
It provides a collaboration environment that is secure and draws on the best of instant messaging , document sharing , social connections , real - time co-editing and enterprise controls .
At Pulses heart beats Lift 1.0 , a Scala based WebFramework that has been used to provide all of the web services for the project .
You can enjoy a very professional Pulse demo given at Novell Brain Share 2010 or learn more about the product and service on the Pulse web pages or follow an introductory series of videos on YouTube : Pulse1 , Pulse2 , Pulse3 , Pulse4 and Pulse5
Daniel Spiewak , Developer and member of the " breakout " team that developed Pulse , talks about the project .
" The great Lift Comet support made the architecture decisions much easier .
We had already made extensive use of Comet so Lift 's fit was a real benefit .
The entire front end , the web application , was written in Scala .
Most of the back end is Java , though we do use Scala code to handle really complex functions , like rendering the Google Wave content schema into XHTML .
There are some administrative tools still written in C#.
Numerous backend services , all hang off of RabbitMQ and push data around through several asynchronous channels .
It can all get quite busy !
The front end application fits really nicely into this ecosystem , primarily because of its intense reliance on actors .
The entire front end is highly asynchronous , spending most of its time passing actor messages around from point A to point B .
It felt good to see all the pieces come together and just do the job rather well .
We 've become somewhat disillusioned with traditional concurrency control mechanisms , and so while we certainly could work with locks and mutexes , it 's so much easier just to send async messages .
However , there are still several areas where actors do not seem a good solution , the in - memory message cache for example .
In these cases , we generally use ( and possibly abuse ) the java.util.concurrent data structures .
We would certainly appreciate seeing a Scala STM to more soundly deal with this type of problem .
We use a patched version of Lift 1.0 due to the fact that later versions in the 1.0.x stream trigger a very intermittent bug in our application 's session management , and it was easier to just fork our own version of Lift rather than spend any more time trying to isolate the issue .
Dave Pollak , the originator of Lift , has been extremely helpful and we look forward to upgrading to the new features in Lift 2.0 and Scala 2.8 sometime in the near future .
The tooling support ( or lack thereof ) has certainly been a challenge , but not an insurmountable one .
Our team is split roughly 50/50 between the Scala Eclipse IDE ( version 2.7.7 ) and the Scala module for NetBeans .
Neither tool was particularly solid at that point , but with enough experience , it was possible to massage them into behaving appropriately .
The most important thing is that they both provide debugging support , which I believe is crucial to developing a non-trivial application in Scala .
The tool scene is not all darkness and rainclouds though , embedded Jetty works flawlessly with Scala and Lift , and ZeroTurnaround 's free JRebel license for Scala developers has saved us cumulative weeks in our development cycle .
Overall , both Scala and Lift have provided a great experience for us .
It did take some time for our team of former Java developers to get up to speed with the language and its idioms ( a process which led to the first drafting of the Scala Style Guide ) , but things are flowing along quite smoothly now .
Scala is certainly a more powerful language than Java , but its learning curve really is n't any steeper than your average scripting language .
Given enough patience and persistence , I would expect any team of competent developers should be able to get completely up to speed with the language in a month or two .
There is that initial hurdle , but the benefits are staggering once it is overcome .
Expressive , functional code , the cake pattern , built - in XML support , monads , the list just goes on .
These features ( and more ! ) have saved us countless man-hours working on Pulse and allowed us to deliver a product into production much sooner than I ever would have imagined . "
What with the Fort Hood mass murderer , the Christmas Pantybomber and now the Times Square Bomber , you may have noticed a little uptick in attempted terrorist attacks on the U.S. mainland in the last few months .
Rep. Lamar Smith did , and , at the House Judiciary Committee , he was interested to see if the attorney general of the United States thought there might be any factor in common between these perplexingly diverse incidents .
“ In the case of all three attempts in the last year , the terrorist attempts , one of which was successful , those individuals have had ties to radical Islam , ” said Congressman Smith .
“ Do you feel that these individuals might have been incited to take the actions that they did because of radical Islam ? ”
“ Because of … ? ”
“ Radical Islam , ” repeated Smith .
“ There are a variety of reasons why I think people have taken these actions , ” replied Eric Holder noncommittally .
“ I think you have to look at each individual case . ”
The congressman tried again .
“ Yes , but radical Islam could have been one of the reasons ? ”
“ There are a variety of reasons why people … . ”
“ But was radical Islam one of them ? ”
“ There are a variety of reasons why people do things , ” the attorney general said again .
“ Some of them are potentially religious … . ”
Stuff happens .
Hard to say why .
“ Okay , ” said Smith .
“ But all I ’m asking is if you think among those variety of reasons radical Islam might have been one of the reasons that the individuals took the steps that they did . ”
“ You see , you say ‘ radical Islam , ' ” objected Holder .
“ I mean , I think those people who espouse a – a version of Islam that is not … . ”
“ Are you uncomfortable attributing any actions to radical Islam ? ” asked Smith .
“ It sounds like it . ”
And so on , and so forth .
At Fort Hood , Maj .
Hasan jumped on a table and gunned down his comrades while screaming , “ Allahu Akbar ! ” , which is Arabic for “ Nothing to see here ” and an early indicator of pre-Post - Traumatic Stress Disorder .
The Times Square Bomber , we are assured by The Washington Post , CNN and Newsweek , was upset by foreclosure proceedings on his house .
Mortgage - related issues .
Nothing to do with months of training at a Taliban camp in Waziristan .
Listening to Attorney General Holder , one is tempted to modify Trotsky :
You may not be interested in Islam but Islam is interested in you .
Islam smells weakness at the heart of the West .
The post - World War II order is dying : The European Union ’s decision to toss a trillion dollars to prop up a Greek economic model that guarantees terminal insolvency is merely the latest manifestation of the chronic combination of fiscal profligacy and demographic decline in the West at twilight .
Islam is already the biggest supplier of new Europeans and new Canadians , and the fastest - growing demographic in the Western world .
Therefore , it thinks it not unreasonable to shape the character of those societies – not by blowing up buildings and airplanes , but by determining the nature of their relationship to Islam .
For example , the very same day that Eric Holder was doing his “ Islam ?
What Islam ? ” routine at the Capitol , the Organization of the Islamic Conference was tightening its hold on the U.N. Human Rights Council – actually , make that the U.N. “ Human Rights ” Council .
The OIC is the biggest voting bloc at the U.N. , and it succeeded in getting its slate of candidates elected to the so - called “ human rights ” body – among them the Maldives , Qatar , Malaysia , Mauritania and Libya .
The last , elected to the HRC by 80 percent of the U.N. membership , is , of course , a famous paragon of human rights , but the other , “ moderate ” Muslim nations share the view that Islam , in both its theological and political components , should be beyond discussion .
And they will support the U.N. ’s rapid progress toward , in effect , the imposition of a global apostasy law that removes Islam from public discourse .
Attorney General Holder seems to be operating an advance pilot program of his own , but he ’s not alone .
Also last week , the head of Canada ’s intelligence service testified to the House of Commons about hundreds of “ second - or third - generation Canadians ” who are “ relatively well integrated ” “ economically and socially ” but who have become so “ very very disenchanted ” with “ the way we want to structure our society ” that they have developed “ strong links to homelands ” that are “ in distress . ”
Homelands such as Afghanistan , Pakistan , Yemen and Somalia .
Hmm .
If you ’re wondering what those countries might have in common , keep wondering .
No words beginning with “ I - ” and ending with “ - slam ” passed the director ’s lips .
If the head of the Crown ’s intelligence service has narrowed his concerns about “ disenchanted ” “ second - and third - generations Canadians ” to any demographic group in particular , evidently it ’s classified information and ca n’t be disclosed in public .
The U.N. elections are a big victory for the Organization of the Islamic Conference .
By the way , to my liberal friends who say , “ Hey , what ’s the big deal about the Organization of the Islamic Conference ?
Lighten up , man , ” try rolling around your tongue the words “ Organization of the Christian Conference . ”
Would you be quite so cool with that ?
Fifty - seven Prime Ministers and Presidents who get together and vote as a bloc in international affairs ?
Or would that be a theocratic affront to secular sensibilities ?
The casual acceptance of the phrase “ the Muslim world ” – ( “ Mr. Obama ’s now - famous speech to the Muslim world ” – The New York Times ) – implicitly defers to the political ambitions of Islam .
And , if there is a “ Muslim world , ” what are its boundaries ?
Forty years ago , the OIC began with mainly Middle Eastern members plus Indonesia and a couple more .
By the Nineties , former Soviet Central Asia had signed on , plus Albania , Mozambique , Guyana and various others .
In 2005 , Russia was admitted to “ observer ” membership .
But along with the big headline victories go smaller ones .
These days , Islam does n’t even have to show up .
The Metropolitan Museum of Art has quietly pulled representations of Mohammed from its Islamic collection .
With the Danish cartoons , violent mobs actually had to kill large numbers of people before Kurt Westegaard was sent into involuntary “ retirement . ”
Even with “ South Park , ” the thugs still had to threaten murder .
But the Metropolitan Museum caved pre-emptively – no murders , no threats but best to crawl into a fetal position , anyway .
Last week , the American Association of Pediatricians noted that certain , ahem , “ immigrant communities ” were shipping their daughters overseas to undergo “ female genital mutilation . ”
So , in a spirit of multicultural compromise , they decided to amend their previous opposition to the practice :
They ’re not ( for the moment ) advocating full - scale clitoridectomies , but they are suggesting federal and state laws be changed to permit them to give a “ ritual nick ” to young girls .
A few years back , I thought even fainthearted Western liberals might draw the line at “ FGM . ”
After all , it ’s a key pillar of institutional misogyny in Islam :
Its entire purpose is to deny women sexual pleasure .
True , many of us hapless Western men find we deny women sexual pleasure without even trying , but we do n’t demand genital mutilation to guarantee it .
On such slender distinctions does civilization rest .
Der Spiegel , an impeccably liberal magazine , summed up the remorseless Islamization of Europe in a recent headline : “ How Much Allah Can The Old Continent Bear ? ”
Well , what ’s wrong with a little Allah - lite ?
The AAP thinks you can hop on the Sharia express and only ride a couple of stops .
In such ostensibly minor concessions , the “ ritual nick ” we ’re performing is on ourselves .
Further cuts will follow .

The Ayatana Indicators work has given us a crisp , clean basis for indicators in the panel .
We ’ve said they will all look a particular way , and behave a particular way .
And we ’ve said they will be placed on the right of the panel .
But why limit indicators to the panel ?
Let ’s make it possible for applications to use indicators themselves , for all the things that indicators are good at :
Conveying a particular state , such as whether or not the application is connected ,
Providing a handle for the indicator menu , to modify that state
We ’ll start with “ window indicators ” , or “ windicators ” for fun .
Windicators are indicators displayed in the window title bar that behave just like the indicators in the panel : they have an icon which shows state , and clicking on the icon brings up a menu .
Applications can create , update and remove window indicators using an API more or less like the AppIndicator framework first put to use in 10.04 LTS .
We ’ve carefully placed all the panel indicators on the right , and we ’ve carefully put the window controls and window title on the left .
So now we have all this space on the right .
As a pattern , it would fit to put the window indicators there .
Cody Russell is leading some work in Canonical around the technology which actually draws the window title bar and borders .
It ’s called “ client side window decorations ” .
We are moving the rendering of the window decorations into the app itself , so that you do n’t have the window manager and application drawing those pieces separately .
That simplifies certain things ( of course it also makes some things harder ) .
One of the most interesting consequences of the client - side decorations work is that it means that the application could more easily draw into the titlebar ( because the application is drawing the title bar ) .
And that makes it even more natural for the application to control the right side of the window title bar as well .
Update : Several commenters correctly pointed out that window indicators could just as easily be rendered by window managers in cases where the theme is not CSD - based .
CSD provided the inspiration for giving that space to the application , it ’s not essential to the implementation .
It would be fantastic for window indicators to be available on 😉
Less chrome , more content : banish the status bar
I ’m on a “ less is more ” kick with our design efforts , and one of the things I want to banish is wasted vertical space .
For netbooks , that ’s particularly important .
And a lot of applications have status bars at the bottom , for no good reason other than it was that way in Windows 3.1 .
Typically the application status bar has :
Some status icons ( “ online ” )
Some tools ( “ Yslow ” )
A transient status message ( “ Saving draft … ” )
We can replace these with a combination of windicators and temporary , overlay status bars .
I really liked the Chrome browser ’s use of overlay status messages , so kudos and thanks to them for the inspiration .
The net result of those two steps , in apps where we can , is to save about 5 % of the vertical space for your stuff – real content .
Prioritising examples for implementation
If you ’re interested in this idea , please join the Ayatana mailing list and participate in the design discussions there .
We ’d like to develop some patterns that are generic , so that we can use a common icon and possibly also common indicator menu entries for addressing the same issue in diverse applications .
Of course , applications will be free to use the mechanism for things that are unique to them .
Candidates for 10.10
It would be fantastic to implement a few of these window indicators for 10.10 .
Please help us choose the most useful cases !
Currently on the list are :
Online / offline status indicator and toggle options for the mail client , chat program or Gwibber , the broadcast messages application .

An “ unsaved ” indicator , that tells people that the contents of the file they are working on have changed and potentially lets them save it or set autosave properties .

Progress indicators , which show that an action is in progress , and possibly also indicate the extent of the progress .
The associated menu would enable one to pause or cancel the operation , and perhaps define the behaviour on completion of the action .

indicators , which would show if a document is shared with multiple people , and enable one to setup such a share .
Volume indicators , which would show the loudness of application audio streams , and enable one to set the volume for that specific application .
The key thing is that these indicators are entirely application - specific , and ideally only relevant to the window that you are actually looking at .
Just like Panel Indicators …
From a visual design point of view , again the goal would be to ensure that indicators are symbolic .
They would follow the same styling as Ayatana indicators :
Monochrome by default , with shape indicating the function of the indicator
Semantically colored : with red for critical problems , orange for alerts , green for positive status changes and blue for informative states that are not the default or usual state .
Integrated with the Netbook Edition Smart Panel
Last week I blogged about our decision to adopt a single , global menu for all applications , in the panel .
And I also said we would explore putting the window title * and* menu into the panel , when the window is maximised .
Of course , that means that we need to accommodate the window indicators in the panel as well .
So : when the window is maximised , and we are using a smart which can include both indicators and window titles , the window indicators will be inserted into the panel as well .
They will appear on the right of the panel , and be the leftmost indicators .
For example , here is the application , maximised ( note the dodgy Ubuntu logo in the top left – that ’s the panel , not the window title bar you ’re looking at ) :
In this configuration , the system achieves “ singular purpose ” : the entire screen is devoted to a single application , yet the Ayatana elements continue to serve their purpose , either systemic ( the battery indicator ) or application specific .

i Phone 4
EVO 4G
Screen 960 x 640 , 3.5 - inch 800 x 480 , 4.3 - inch Thickness 0.37 - inch 0.47 - inch Primary camera 5 megapixel 8 megapixel Secondary camera VGA 1.3 megapixel Video chat FaceTime Qik
If you put your ear up to the screen , you can hear these two beasts snarling at one another .
Hit up the gallery for more shots , along with some iPhone 3G for good measure .
Let 's see how they stack up on the big stats , shall we ?
Not enough for you ?
We 'll have a big comparison of all the " majors " for you shortly .
Now , there 's a lot left to learn about Apple 's FaceTime video chat service .
For instance , they called it " open , " but they also only mentioned a zero - configuration iPhone 4 to iPhone 4 calling setup .
Meanwhile Qik can make calls between EVO 4Gs , but also stream video live to the web ( while the iPhone needs to record and then upload to get " social " using its official apps ) .
No mention was made of the FaceTime call resolution , but given the fact that the front camera is merely VGA , it 's probably streaming at the same 640 x 480 that Qik is constrained to in the free service .
However , a premium version of Qik for $ 5 a month lets you go beyond that resolution , using the EVO 's higher resolution cameras .
Perhaps the largest distinction is the fact that the EVO can stream video calls over 3G or 4G , while the iPhone 4 is constrained to WiFi for the time being .
Naturally , we expect other video calling apps ( Skype , please ? ) to crop up on both platforms and give these initial offerings a run for their money .
i Phone 4 Impressions and Observations
Apple had a demo area for the media after the keynote , so I got to spend some time hands - on with the iPhone 4 .
The resolution of the “ retina display ” is as impressive as Apple boasts .
Text renders like high quality print .
One thing that Apple did n’t mention in the keynote , though , is that the LCD pixels are much closer to the surface of the touchscreen .
On existing iPhones ( and iPods , and iPads ) , there is not a lot of distance between the glass surface and the LCD , but there is some .
There ’s also a very narrow amount of air between the touchscreen glass and the underlying LCD .
If you ’ve ever got a bit dust under your display , that dust is in the air between the glass and LCD .
It ’s mentioned briefly in Apple ’s promotional video about the design of the iPhone 4 , but they ’re using a new production process that effectively fuses the LCD and touchscreen — there is no longer any air between the two .
One result of this is that the iPhone 4 should be impervious to this dust - under - the - glass issue .
More importantly , though , is that it looks better .
The effect is that the pixels appear to be painted on the surface of the phone ; instead of looking at pixels under glass , it ’s like looking at pixels on glass .
Combined with the incredibly high pixel density , the overall effect is like “ live print ” .
It also improves the field of view for the display — you can view the display from an oblique angle and it looks great .
Again , like print .
It ’s like a glossy magazine come to life .
A few other tidbits I noticed during my hands - on time with the phone today :
by Miguel de Icaza
Apple and its AppStore did for software programmers what Google 's AdWord did for bloggers and writers : it provided a mechanism for people to make money while doing what they love .
The AppStore takes a big weight from the shoulders of software developers by taking care of the distribution and billing system .
If I was in charge of the Windows 8 future ( or MacOS for that matter ) , I would try to reproduce that formula on my mainstream operating system .
And it seems from the leaked presentations that this is where Microsoft 's head is .
The leaked mockups for the AppStore are creative , but the entire slide deck misses the fundamental point that people are scared of installing software on Windows .
Everyone is scared of installing applications on Windows either because they break the system or because you might be accidentally installing malware .
In either case , the end result is countless wasted hours backing data up , reinstalling the operating sytem and all the applications .
An AppStore wont fix this .
For a Windows appstore to work , they need to guarantee that installing software wont ever break the system .
They need to produce an appliance that allows users to install and remove software in seconds , and yet , guarantee that installing and removing apps will never break the system .
This is not a problem that can be solved by hiring an army of curators and people that just sit all day rejecting apps .
To solve the problem , Microsoft needs to both alter their kernel to ensure the safety of the host OS and come up with a new way of distributing applications .
They need :
A sandboxed execution system .
Self contained applications , fully embedded in a single directory that require no installation .
A set of supported APIs that will run in the Sandbox execution system .
A public contract for extension points .
The Sandboxed Execution System : would prevent applications from touching the registry , installing any drivers , any hooks , any visualizers or any other deep integration features that applications typically use to integrate with the OS .
The sandboxed execution system would prevent applications from looking at the file system , except for locations that have been predetermined for sharing .
The kernel would have to enforce what files they get access to , what devices and what components they get access to .
And should be set to a bare minimum .
Self Contained Applications would be required to install software from the network , or from their appstore .
These applications would get absolutely no rights to modify anything outside their directory .
Any extension points that they could register with the system ( " open with " ) would have to be registered with the public extension point contract .
Public Contract for Extension Points
Any extension points like " open with " , or handlers for mime - types would be self contained in a manifest in the application directory .
Instead of having every app poking at the system registry and dumping their junk everywhere , applications would list all of their requirements from the operating system on the manifest and the OS would rebuild its internal data from all of the application manifests available from a user .
Limited APIs : File access APIs , display access APIs would have to be altered to give applications limited access to the host operating system , and to give them as little access to anything that most applications do not need .
The above obviously does not apply to frameworks like the .NET framework , Java or Adobe 's AIR .
But beyond frameworks , there are very few cases where an application really should have legitimate access to all of the features in the OS .
Video games certainly do not need it , and even applications like Visual Studio would not need it .
At first glance it might be possible to look at Fallout : New Vegas and think of it as nothing more than an expansion to Fallout 3 .
It uses the same engine and the core gameplay has largely been kept intact , so it does share some resemblance with its uncle .
But it only takes a second look to see that Obsidian Entertainment is placing its own unmistakable mark on the Fallout franchise .
A new Hardcore mode , tweaked combat , weapon mods , gambling , and a game world as big as Fallout 3 are just a few of the things fans will be raving about up to and beyond the release of this next entrant into the much - loved game series .
Obsidian , a development studio founded by some of the same people that created the original Fallout games , is back on the scene in a big way .
First , a little background info for those that perhaps do n't follow Fallout as closely as others .
These games take place in an alternate universe where Earth has gone through nuclear Armageddon , crushing society and splintering the survivors into warring factions desperate to scrape together an existence from the barren wasteland .
The catch is that this alternate future is based upon the sci- fi comics of the '50s and ' 60s , filled with atomic cars and talking robots .
Add in some dark humor , deep role - playing mechanics , and a wide open world to explore and you 've got a recipe for Fallout .
Another+clever+take+on+character+customization .
picks up three years after the events of Fallout 3 , but do n't expect the story to continue in a linear fashion .
This is its own self - contained tale with its own original characters -- it stands alone .
This time the setting is in the remnants of Las Vegas , aptly named New Vegas .
The nuclear war did n't destroy everything out here in the desert , though there was n't much to begin with .
Things have held together relatively well all things considered , leaving plenty of places to explore from downtown New Vegas and the Hoover Dam to the towns and settlements of the surrounding Mojave Wasteland .
It 's with Doc Mitchell that you 'll go through the streamlined character creation and customization setup .
Those who played Fallout 3 will be right at home here -- all of the same options exist for creating the look and feel of your character , plus a new age slider has been added -- but the entire process goes by much faster than the protracted childhood of the last game .
In a break from tradition , the main character is not a vault dweller raised in a protective fallout shelter that many fled to as the war began .
This allowed the developers to get you right into the action should you already be a veteran .
After a few questions about your personality , adjustments to the SPECIAL ( Strength , Perception , Endurance , Charisma , Intelligence , Agility , and Luck ) base stats , tagging a few skills , and receiving a new Pip - Boy 3000 arm mounted computer , you 're set free to run off into the wild blue yonder .
Adjustments to the structure of the opening moments have been made for both newcomers and experts alike .
Rookies might want to settle in for some Rorschach tests , word associations and grim humor at the hands of Doc Mitchell while the game decides how to craft your base stats before heading outside for a series of tutorial missions .
Pros , on the other hand , can blast through the opening , pick their own stats , and skip the tutorial quests .
They can even select the brand new Hardcore mode for some added difficulty .
Be warned : Hardcore mode lives up to its name .
Taking that option will make the game much more realistic by -- among other things -- adding weight to even little things like bullets , forcing the player to regularly eat and drink water to stay alive , requiring a doctor visit to heal broken bones , and making Stimpaks heal over time instead of instantly .
Not for the weak willed , but Obsidian is promising a treat for those that make it through to the end .
A Utah judge signed a death warrant Friday allowing the state to execute Ronnie Lee Gardner using a five - man firing squad , a spokeswoman for the Utah 's state court system told CNN .
Before signing the death warrant , Third District Judge Robin Reese asked Gardner if he wanted to be executed by the method he had chosen previously , spokeswoman Nancy Volmer said .
" I would like the firing squad , please , " Gardner replied .
It would be the state 's first use of the firing squad since 1996 , when John Albert Taylor was executed for the rape and murder of an 11 - year - old girl .
Taylor said he chose the method to embarrass Utah , which at the time was the only state that offered the firing squad as an option .
Gardner 's execution date was set for June 18 , 2010 .
However , Gardner 's lawyer said he planned to file an appeal , which could change the date , Volmer said .
Gardner was convicted of murder in the 1985 killing of an attorney during a courthouse escape attempt .
A change in Utah 's law took the firing squad away as an execution option .
But inmates , like Gardner , who have already chosen the firing squad can still be executed that way , according to the Death Penalty Information Center .
Oklahoma offers the firing squad as an option - but only if lethal injection and electrocution are later found to be unconstitutional , according to the Death Penalty Information Center .
The country 's most famous execution by firing squad was when Gary Gilmore was killed using a firing squad in 1977 .
Asked for any last words before guns were fired , Gilmore replied : " Let 's do it ! "
His execution was also the inspiration for Norman Mailer 's book " The Executioner 's Song . "

“ Good manners will open doors that the best education cannot . ” - Clarence Thomas
Why Table Manners Matter
As a young Marine Corps Officer , I was dumbfounded one afternoon when after training on the Mark19 we transitioned into a class on proper table manners .
Taught by a petite older woman , the class covered the basics of dining etiquette .
We practiced these skills at various unit dinners over the next six months .
At the time , I thought the classes were useless and a waste of my time .
Yet as it turns out , while I never again fired that heavy grenade launcher , the skills I learned those evenings concerning table manners have enhanced my enjoyment of dining for over a decade .
Whether dining with a 4 star general , toasting with a Medal of Honor recipient , or sitting with friends and family on Christmas Eve , an understanding of dining protocol makes time spent with others around a table more enjoyable .
When you know the rules there is no awkwardness or questions about how things should be done ; instead there is only opportunity to spend quality time with the company present .

The Need for Better Dining Etiquette
When I began to spend more time outside of military circles I noticed that many men had never been taught proper dining etiquette .
I was amazed when I returned to graduate school and met people who were spending 100 K on their education but were sabotaging their own interviews over a meal that they ate from their plate like a horse .
Still other times I would witness friends embarrass themselves by eating half the food on their plate before noticing everyone else was waiting to give thanks .
A man in the year 2010 , like his great - grandfather in the year 1910 , still sits and eats three meals a day .
The purpose of this article is to give you the basics to dine with respect like he did .
If nothing else , live by these four rules :
Pay attention to your hosts – Being an observant diner and picking up on cues from your host will enable you to avoid 95 % the embarrassing situations you could find yourself in .
Simple things like waiting to eat until you see others eating and using the utensils others are using will enable you to “ wing it . ”
However , this constant observing and following does not allow you to relax and enjoy the evening .
Chew with your mouth closed and do not talk with food in your mouth – Yes , in the year 2010 we still have a problem with men chewing with their mouths wide open .
And if you have something to say , refrain from filling your mouth the moment before .
In order to recover if expected to speak , only put a single bite in your mouth at a time .
The days of stuffing your mouth with as much food as it can hold are over .
Bring your food to your face , not your face to your food – You should n’t be leaning over your food , shoveling it into your mouth with a distance traveled of only 6 inches .
Instead , sit straight , balance a single bite on the utensil of choice and bring it directly to your mouth .
And never drink from your soup bowl .
Say Thank You , Please , and Excuse Me – These small words are magic and should be used liberally .
The First Rule of Dining Etiquette – Know Who You Are Dining with and the Setting
As the Boy Scout Motto goes , be prepared .
RSVP within 3 days of receiving an invitation , or if no invitation was sent ask what to expect and how many people will be in attendance .
Dress to the level you feel appropriate , you do not need a custom suit but I advise looking professional .
It shows respect to the host and chances are you ’ll be making important first impressions .
If you are visiting a person ’s home , consider bringing a small gift such as flowers in a vase or a bottle of wine .
If the meal is being hosted by a close friend , find out how you can help make their life easier – perhaps by bringing a dessert .
Arrive on time , but not more than 10 minutes early as last minute preparations are always underway on the host ’s end .
Informal Dining – Non-seated
By non-seated , I mean there will be no set time in which everyone sits around a table to dine as a group .
Examples are picnics and barbeques where people arrive , eat , and leave at various times .
And although table manners here are much more relaxed , there are still a few rules of dining etiquette you should pay attention to .
Take an average sized serving –
It is bad form to find you can only eat half the food on your plate and that your excess caused a fellow guest to miss out on the dish entirely .
Going back for a second serving , assuming there is plenty , is always a compliment to the chef .

Going back for a second serving , assuming there is plenty , is always a compliment to the chef .
Do not double dip –
If you really like the dip , and need every part of your chip covered in it , use a spoon and make your own dipping station on your plate .

Precutting meat – Cut for yourself and those immediately around you – do not cut the entire roast as it will cause the meat to dry out quicker .
– Cut for yourself and those immediately around you – do not cut the entire roast as it will cause the meat to dry out quicker .
Clean - up after yourself – Do I need to say more ?
Informal Dining – Seated
Informal Dinner Setting
By informal seated dining I mean that at some point all parties will be seated and a set meal will be served and conversation will take place over food .
Examples are recruiting events , business meals , or Easter dinner with the fiancée ’s family .
Below is a place setting you might see .
Note the word Luncheon could be substituted for breakfast or dinner , as you can see this set - up anytime of the day .
The general guidelines are this : everything revolves around the plate , forks to the left , spoons and knives to the right .
When it comes to silverware , you start on the outside and work inward .
Therefore , if in the picture above we had a fork for appetizers ( which we do not ) , it would be to the left of the dinner fork ( which is the one seen ) .
Your glass , when not in use , should remain in the upper right area of your setting .
Notice the water goblet is usually larger than your wine glass .
Formal Dining
Formal Dinner Setting
The first clue that you ’ll be attending a formal dinner will be the uniform – suits and in many cases black tie are required .
Although I will not be covering formal dining in this article – there is too much information to cover in a single post – do n’t be too alarmed if you have one coming up .
A man can learn the basics within 30 minutes of study and practice .
The picture below will give you an idea of the set - up you ’ll face .
The Napkin
Place your napkin in your lap within 1 minute of sitting at the table to dine .
Do not tuck it into the front of your shirt collar like a bib or into your pants ; unfold it just enough to cover your lap ( usual leaving it half folded is enough , although fully unfolded is fine for larger men ) .
Although it can serve to protect your trousers from a spill , its main purpose is to enable you to seamlessly remove food from the sides of your mouth .
As such , use it when needed and when finished or excusing yourself from the table place it neatly to the left of your plate .
Do n’t hog all the food for yourself
When to Start Eating ?
The simple and safe answer to this question is when others do .
The reality is that it is often unclear , as that hot food is being served and the hostess along with a helper are still in the kitchen and a few guests are out wandering around out of earshot .
In this case , if hot food is being served and at least two people are seated , you may begin .
If the meal is orderly , and everyone is seated , then once three to four people have been served you may begin ( assuming a group larger than 4 – if 4 or smaller wait for everyone to be served ) .
The general guideline is to never eat alone , but to eat hot food while it is still hot .
A prayer , if to be said , should be initiated by the host but can be given by anyone .
It should be given before the meal is served .
Toasts , on the other , hand can happen anytime glasses are filled and except at formal events can be initiated by anyone ; oftentimes a guest toasts the host for their hospitality .
Do n’t reach across the table
Elbows , Reaching , and Spills
Placing your elbows on the table while the meal is in progress should be avoided ; however , there is nothing wrong with putting them on the table during a conversation between meals and during coffee or tea .
Reaching on the other hand is never allowed ; if anything is beyond your normal reach ( meaning you have to rise from your seat to get to it ) or is within another ’s personal space , always ask the person closest to pass the item you need .
And if something spills ?
First , deal with the item spilling and next do what you can to assist the host with the immediate clean - up .
And then forget about it and enjoy your meal .
Dealing with Food You Do Not Want
You simply do not want to try it – If you have n’t tried it , how do you know you wo n’t like it ?
Always try to take just a little of all dishes offered ; sometimes that little stays on the plate after a single bite , but at least the host was not offended .

You have a restrictive diet – Depending on how restrictive , you may want to notify your host beforehand so that they can make special arrangements .
I recently hosted a dinner where a number of the guests were fasting for Lent .
Although it required a little extra work , my wife and I were more than happy to accommodate our guest ’s diet restrictions .
If the event you are attending is large and the host is not easily accessible , you may want to eat well the meal before in the case you are forced to eat light that evening .

Saying no to alcohol – Being a non-drinker , I have run into situations where alcohol consumption is expected by all men present .
On many occasions when visiting family in Ukraine I have been pressured heavily to partake in traditional shots of Vodka .
My solution here is to take one glass , toast with the family , and then touch it to my lips .
This works for me , and now that I have built a reputation as a non -drinker the issue rarely arises .
The key is whatever your decision when pressured to drink , keep your choice consistent and you will run into less problems and hurt feelings .
How to Signal You Are Finished
The proper way to signal you are finished with your meal is to place your knife and fork in the 4:20 position .
Your fork should be closest to you with tongs pointed up , the knife with its cutting edge facing the fork ’s tongs ; not only does this tell a waiter or host that you are finished , it is the most stable position for your silverware when a person seeks to clear your place for dessert or drinks .
I ’m Finished with my Meal
Saying Goodbye
Before leaving , say thank you to your hosts – all of them .
If the event is large ( more than 30 people ) and you must leave immediately but your hosts are in the middle of entertaining other guests , you can pull a French leave and slip out without saying goodbye directly – in these situations it is prudent to ask a trusted friend , if present , to pass a goodbye message .
However , a follow - up call or message within 24 hours is mandatory to explain why you departed without saying goodbye .
Final Tips
Enjoy yourself and have a few drinks if you are so inclined ; however do not ruin your host ’s night by being the guy who after a half - dozen drinks starts making off - color comments and then argues loudly with his girlfriend .
Talk with people – I mean , really listen to them , understand what they say , and have a good conversation .
If you are the only person who has spoken for the last 10 minutes , you are not having a conversation – you are giving a presentation .
Turn the cell phone off and enjoy the moment .
Do not put it on silent , as nothing says “ Our conversation is less important than some random call ” than you peeking at your cell phone every 5 minutes .
You can live without Twitter and Facebook for a night .
The best way to acquire proper table manners is to practice them at every meal ; make them a habit , teach them to your children , and when you need them they will be there .
“ The dinner table is the center for the teaching and practicing not just of table manners but of conversation , consideration , tolerance , family feeling , and just about all the other accomplishments of polite society except the minuet . ” - Judith Martin

Ever since the famed Greek philosopher Plato first wrote of a fabled continent called Atlantis more than two thousand years ago , scholars have been locked in fierce debate as to whether such a place truly existed .
While a few rare individuals have taken Plato ’s words seriously , most scoff at the idea that an advanced civilization could vanish as completely as if it had never existed .
Such is a bit like imagining an elephant could walk through a snowdrift without leaving footprints , making it easy to ignore the entire subject and write it off as yet another example of New Age pseudo - science or , at best , an fantastic and historically indefensible fable .
And this is not an unreasonable position either .
After all , Plato described the place as being as large as Libya ( an ancient term for North Africa ) and Asia combined , making one reasonably confident it should be hard to miss .
And yet no one has managed to produce as much as a coral reef that might have marked its ancient shoreline , much less an entire submerged continent .
But the search continues and , if anything , appears to be growing in both scale and sophistication until today it has become something of a technological / historical holy grail for the twenty - first century .
Did Atlantis exist , and if it did , where could it have been ?
While no one can answer that question with any degree of certainty — though some attempt to — there are quite a few competing theories out there to consider .
Some of them are more plausible than others — and a few even have some support from the scientific community — but all of them are just guesses .
So now , without further ado , here is my list , in no particular order , of the top ten theories regarding the lost continent of Atlantis .
10 . Accounts of Atlantis are fictional
The traditional position maintained by most scientists and historians over the years is that Plato ’s account of a fabulously wealthy city as told in the Critias and Timaeus was merely a fictional story designed to both entertain and enlighten his readers as to the dangers of hubris and turning one ’s back on the gods , and was never intended to be interpreted as an account of a real place or real events .
Evidence for this is suggested by the fact that Plato tells us the island was given to the Greek god Poseidon , who fell in love with the beautiful daughter of Atlantis ’ first king — named , not coincidentally I suspect , Atlas — and begat numerous children by her , to whom he promptly parceled out parts of the island to .
He also tells us the Atlanteans were defeated by an alliance of Greek and Eastern Mediterranean peoples around 12,000 years ago — thousands of years before the earliest civilizations even emerged in the region — making the entire story unlikely to say the least .
The question , then , is that if we are compelled to take any of the story as true , are n’t we logically obligated to accept everything — including a procreating god and a skewed timeline — as true as well ?
Does give one pause to wonder .
9 . Atlantis was fictional but the accounts of a world - wide Deluge were true
Plato makes numerous references to a great deluge occurring thousands of years before his time that destroyed almost the whole world , leaving only a tiny fragment of humanity left to repopulate the globe and start civilization anew .
The story of Atlantis , then , while itself a manifestation of Plato ’s fertile imagination , may have been inspired by a real historical event — in this case , a massive global flood — that may have taken place ten thousand years before he was born .
Could this be some distant memory of the end of the last Ice Age , when global ocean levels rose by hundreds of feet in just a few centuries , submerging entire landmasses in the process , embellished through each retelling , or could it have been something else ( such as a meteor strike in the ocean that produced enormous devastation throughout the world ? )
8. Atlantis was a continent that existed in the mid-Atlantic as was destroyed by natural catastrophes
For the purest , this remains the traditional understanding and the one originally postulated by nineteenth century writer and Atlantisphile Ignatius Donnelly in his 1882 book , Atlantis , the Antediluvian World , who imagined the Atlantic Ocean to be no more than a few hundred feet deep and prone to occasional vertical shifting .
Since so little was known about the ocean in his day , his theory was considered plausible by many at the time — at least until the advent of modern oceanography , when it was determined that the Atlantic was up to five miles deep in spots and not prone towards creating massive continents .
While this essentially torpedoed poor Ignatius ’ hypothesis as far as science was concerned , some continue to hold to it with great tenacity largely because of Plato ’s insistence that the place existed just outside the “ Pillars of Hercules ” ( an ancient term for the modern Straits of Gibraltar ) , implying that it had to lie somewhere in the mid Atlantic .
7. Plato was referring to the ancient Minoans and the explosion of the volcanic island of Thera
An increasingly popular theory concerning the true nature of Atlantis — and one that has some acceptance within the scientific community — is that Plato was referring to a people native to the modern Greek island of Crete known as the Minoans , who were largely wiped out when the nearby volcanic island of Thera ( known today as Santorini ) erupted in 1600 BCE , producing tsunamis large enough to obliterate a number of Minoan coastal cities and do considerable damage around the entire Mediterranean basin .
Such a spectacular and massive catastrophe , obviously at the hands of displeased Gods , would have been remembered in the annals of Egyptian history to ultimately find its way into the mythology of Plato ’s day over a thousand years later .
The hypothesis , then , is that Plato was referring to that very catastrophe in a somewhat idealized form , the descriptions of Atlantis ’ vast resources and power unavoidably exaggerated or embellished with the retelling over the years and innocently passed on by the Greek philosopher .
6. Atlantis was a mythical retelling of the Black Sea flood
Another theory that has been recently postulated — and again has some support among scientists — is that Atlantis and the “ great Deluge ” told of by Plato was a mythologized account of another historical event that took place thousands of years before Plato was born : the breaching of the Bosporus by the Mediterranean Sea and the flooding of the Black Sea around 5,600 BCE .
It has been demonstrated that a number of civilizations may have flourished on the shore of the Black Sea ( then a fresh water lake half its present size ) at the time , only to find it all immersed under hundreds of feet of sea water in a fairly short time ( some estimates placing it at less than a year ) .
Such an event would have likely had a traumatic effect on the people of the region , who would have been scattered by the event .
As they escaped the rising waters and emigrated to other regions , each would have carried with them their own highly mythologized account of the flood that came upon them practically overnight , creating the inspiration for Plato ’s story .
5. Atlantis was referring to a more temperate Antarctica
The controversial suggestion by the late Charles Hapgood that the Earth ’s crust may have suddenly shifted some twelve thousand years ago ( he maintained that the Earth ’s crust floats upon a magma of molten rock like the skin of an orange and periodically shifts over the millennia due to subterranean and gravitational pressures ) has caught the imagination of many an Atlantis buff over the years .
According to Hapgood , because of this shift , at one time the continent of Antarctica was much further north than it is now — and temperate and populated by an advanced civilization to boot — and that this was what Plato was referring to as Atlantis .
Its sudden and catastrophic shift to its current icy position , then , destroyed the Atlanteans and made Antarctica the uninhabitable ice box it is today .
Though the idea has its supporters , the premise that the Earth ’s crust could shift so dramatically and suddenly has no support within the scientific community .
Further , Hapgood presented his theory before science came to fully understand the nature of plate tectonics , which did much to exile his “ sliding crust ” hypothesis to the realm of “ fringe beliefs ” where Plato ’s continent is concerned .
4. Atlantis was a reference to an ancient continent called Lemuria
Interestingly , the Greeks were not the only ones to maintain a belief in an ancient , island - bound civilization .
India and the Asian continent have their own tradition , which they call Lemuria — an island civilization that supposedly existed in the Indian Ocean .
The idea that such a place existed was first postulated by 19th century zoologist Philip Sclater as a means of accounting for the discontinuities he found in the biogeography of the Indian Ocean region at the time .
His premise that Madagascar and India may have once been part of a larger continent , which he named Lemuria , has been rendered obsolete by modern understanding of plate tectonics , which consistently demonstrate that while sunken continents do exist — such as the Kerguelen Plateau in the Indian Ocean — there is no known geological formation under the Indian Ocean that corresponds to Sclater ’s hypothetical Lemuria .
The name did at least lend its name to the tiny primates native to Madagascar known as a Lemur ( or was it the other way around ? ) so it was n’t a complete loss .
3. Atlantis was actually the mythological land of Mu
Mu is the name of a hypothetical continent that allegedly existed in either the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean , depending on who you listen to .
In either case , it was thought to have disappeared at the dawn of human history , its survivors emigrating to other continents to serve as the foundation for a number of later civilizations throughout the world .
Today , scientists generally dismiss the concept of Mu and of other lost continents like Atlantis or Lemuria ( see above ) as physically impossible , since a continent can neither sink nor be destroyed by any conceivable catastrophe , especially not in a short time .
Additionally , the weight of archaeological , linguistic , and genetic evidence is contrary to the claim that the ancient civilizations of the New and Old Worlds stemmed from a common ancestral civilization .
2. Atlantis was in Southeast Asia
If one looks at the geography of the planet at the height of the last Ice Age , they will notice the ocean levels were over two hundred feet lower then as a result of so much water being taken up in the massive ice sheets that covered most of North America and Europe .
As such , you can see that the island archipelago we know today as Indonesia was then a complete continent nearly as large as western Europe that stretches from Australia to the Indian subcontinent ( which also extends hundreds of miles further out to sea ) .
Temperate , sub tropical , and massive , it would have made a perfect place for an emerging civilization — perhaps even one as technologically advanced as our own today — to take root .
Could such a global civilization have emerged then , only to perhaps find itself destroyed by its own technology and all evidence submerged by the expanding ocean as the ice caps melted ?
Certainly , this would account for many of flood and advanced civilization mythologies maintained by many diverse cultures around the globe and explain many of the similarities between parallel structures ( pyramids , obelisks , stone carvings ) seen around the world today .
1. Atlantis was in the Bahamas , Bermuda , the Azores , Canary Islands , etc .
The idea that Plato was referring to a place in the Atlantic does not die easily , and so nearly any island or land mass lying anywhere between east coast of the Americas and Europe / Africa has been suggested as the locale for Plato ’s fantastic continent .
Unfortunately , none of these islands are particularly impressive in scope or size , nor do any of them suggest they once maintained anything approaching an advanced civilization in the distant past ( or even today , for that matter ) .
The Bahamas , because of the discovery off the coast of Bimini Island in 1968 of what appears to be a man-made harbor wall ( generally dismissed by scientists as a formation of beach rock containing artificial looking but purely natural fracture lines suggestive of a paved “ road ” ) and due to interest in the unproven but popular “ Bermuda Triangle ” legend , remains the odds - on favorite among many Atlantis buffs , though it is far from enjoying unanimous support .

CLEVELAND , Ohio — LeBron James recorded an interview with CNN's Larry King at his Bath Township home on Tuesday .
The segment , which is set to air at 9 p.m.
Friday on CNN , is part of a weeklong series of shows commemorating King 's 25th year at CNN .
The complete transcript of the interview was sent to a local television station .
The entire interview was posted online and obtained by The Plain Dealer , which independently verified the accuracy of the transcript .
Here are some highlights from the interview :
Larry King :
OK .
You are at a , you 're at a point I do n't think any basketball player in recent memory has ever been at .
You 're the , arguably , the most famous player in the game , you and Kobe [ Bryant ] .
But you are a free agent , and that 's exactly what it means . . . you 're totally free .
They can't make you an offer until July 1st .
But you can think about it now , because the money is going to be , all things equal , it 's going to be about the same .
So in your head , [ are ] there places you 'd like to go ?
I 'm not going to ask you to commit .
James :
Well , I mean , to me , I think my ultimate , my ultimate goal is winning championships , and I understand that me going down as one of the greats will not happen until I , you know , win a championship .
So for me , the team that I decided to go toward ( inaudible ) in Cleveland , that ultimately has -- has the best chance for me to win a championship not one year , but multiple years .
But for me to continue to get better and help that team win , I think , ultimately , would be my decision .
I 'm going to do what 's best for me and my family .
King :
So can we say it will not be a poor team , a team of players who you do not calculate would be there to win championships , because you can't play forever ?
James :
No , I can not play forever .
And that is absolutely right .
But the team that I go to or -- or , you know , whatever the case may be , will have an opportunity to win championships in multiple years and not just because of LeBron James .

King :
All right .
Do you lean at all toward the place you know the best ?
I mean do they have an edge going in . . .
James : Oh , absolutely .
King : Your home team ?
James : Absolutely .
Because , you know , this city , these fans , I mean , have given me a lot in these seven years .
And , you know , for me , it 's comfortable .
So I 've got a lot of memories here .
And -- and so it does have an edge .
But it 's a -- it 's a very -- it 's going to be a very interesting summer , and I 'm looking forward to it .
King :
You can tell me that you 're going to get together , you , with [ Chris ] Bosh and [ Dwyane ]
Wade and [ Amar'e ] Stoudemire and [ Joe ] Johnson and [ Ray ] Allen and . . .
James :
We can be like a little committee ?
King : Yes .
James : A little free - agent committee .
King :
No one can stop you .
You 're all free agents .
The league can't tell you not to do this .
James : Right .
King : " What if you go there and I go here and we go here ? "
Is that possible ?
James : I do n't know to that extent , but it will be fun .
It will be fun to get all the free agents together and , you know , figure out a way how we can make the league better .
King :
But you can get together and discuss for the better of the league . . .
James :
No , we can . . .
King : " If I went here and you played there , " right , you . . .
James :
Oh , I mean , and in certain situations where you may be able to pair with a -- with a group or one or two guys and -- and better that franchise and guys better these franchises .
But I think this is the most -- this is the most sought out summer in -- in basketball history , because of all the free agents .
King :
Are you the ringleader of the group ?
James : I am the ringleader .
King :
Do you want a say in who the coach is ?
James :
That 's not -- no , not really .
. . .
You know , a lot of great coaches have been part of this league for years .
But I 'm not one to go into the off year and say this is who I want my coach to be .
Now , there are some coaches , that , you know , if I had an opportunity to play for , I would be delighted .
But I 'm not as far as -- as picking a coach .
King :
Were you sad that your coach here was fired ?
James : Oh , absolutely .
I mean -- I mean , he was a great coach , five -- five great years we had together , and we turned a franchise that had n't seen a lot of things in a lot of years .
We won , you know , the Eastern Conference championship .
We [ had ] , you know , the [ most ] regular - season wins two years in a row .
We did a -- I mean , a lot of great things .
But ultimately , we both , myself and Mike Brown , did n't accomplish what we wanted to , and that was the NBA championship .
And I think we wanted it more than anybody else .
So it 's unfortunate .
I wish him the best , and I think he 's going to have a great coaching career .
King :
Have any of your Cavalier teammates asked you to stay ?
James :
Of course .
King :
How about this city ?
You know the -- listen , listen , these are economic times , and you are in the unique position of being very economically important to Cleveland .
You sell tickets .
You do more than that .
You support people in this city .
You 're very generous in getting involved with kids .
Do you take that into consideration ?
You 've got a lot on your shoulders .
James :
Well , I think as far as saving the city economically , I can't get too involved in that .
I can't let that be a decision of mine or what I do with my future .
But as far as what I do in the community , that has a lot to do with it , because what I do in the city of Akron and what I do in the city of Cleveland means a lot to myself .
And , you know , if our -- if I do n't do these things that I do on the community , locally , I will feel -- I will feel bad because I feel like , you know , any time when I was growing up , if I had ever got an opportunity to make it , I will always give back .
King : OK .
So I 'm not going to put words in your mouth .
All things being equal , is Cleveland sort of sentimentally the favorite ?
James : Oh , absolutely .
And it 's a -- it 's a Cleveland - Akron team , because I grew up in Akron .
I mean Akron is less than 30 miles south of Cleveland .
So , absolutely .
My whole family is here .
You know , when I played high school basketball , where I grew up , in the projects , a lot of -- a lot of things mean home for me here .
And -- and it's not just about the basketball court .
King : How about [ girlfriend ] Savannah [ Brinson ] and the kids ?
What say do they have -- well , the kids do n't have a say in that .
James :
Well , the kids got all the say .
I mean , I think they -- they 're going to support what decision I make .
You know , of course , they have a say , but , you know , they feel like , to this point , I 've been able to might -- make the right decision in my career , and they 're going to support whatever I do .
King :
You have n't made a decision yet , is that correct ?
James : Correct .
King : OK .
Would you say , all things being equal , you 're close ?
James : I 'm far from close .
I do n't -- I do n't -- honestly , I have n't -- because July is still a month away , less than a month away .
So I have n't -- I have n't began to , you know -- I 've thought about it , but I have n't began to strategize exactly .
The Kepler space telescope seeking Earth - like planets in a far - off region of the Milky Way has discovered more than 700 planetary " candidates " - some that just might be the right size and in the right places for life to be possible .
Astronomers on the Kepler team at NASA 's Ames Research Center in Mountain View said Tuesday they are not releasing data on 400 of those objects after finding them so intriguing they want more time to analyze them .
In their first full - scale scientific report since the mission began in March 2009 , the 28 members of the Kepler team announced they have found " viable exoplanet candidates with sizes as small as the Earth to larger than that of Jupiter . "
It was only 15 years ago that Swiss astronomers discovered the first " exoplanet " orbiting another star beyond our solar system .
Yet in only the first 43 days of its mission , Kepler discovered the 706 strange objects that astronomers are listing as candidates for planetary status .
NASA officials allowed the Kepler team to publish full details on 306 of them in a forthcoming issue of the Astrophysical Journal to give astronomers everywhere an opportunity to view and analyze them .
In an interview , Geoffrey Marcy , the pioneer planet hunter at UC Berkeley and a Kepler team member , reflected the group 's enthusiasm over those objects .
" It 's an overwhelming amount of riches , " Marcy said .
" It 's a planetary treasure map . "
" There is only one appropriate assessment of this technical accomplishment and the haul of prospective small planets : WOW ! " he added in an e-mail .
The details on everything Kepler has found so far , however , will be released in January , NASA said .
The Kepler space telescope was launched to scan a total of 156,000 relatively cool stars in the constellations Cygnus and Lyra .
In gathering Kepler 's data , the analysts at Ames look for a star 's quick dimming that would indicate some object was passing in front it - possibly , a planet .
Analysts must then distinguish between planets and the many " false positives , " as the planet hunters call them .
For example , they could be two closely linked twin stars , known as eclipsing binaries , which can cause the dimming of one by the other - making it hard for astronomers to distinguish the twins from a planet .
That is why the signals are so difficult to interpret .
" The team is working around the clock to process the data , " Marcy said .
" They 're measuring the brightness of 156,000 stars every half hour , achieving a precision of a hundredth of 1 percent - an utterly unprecedented achievement .
Bill Borucki , an Ames physicist who is the Kepler mission 's chief scientist , was in Denmark Tuesday , and NASA relayed a statement from him .
" The Kepler observations will tell us whether there are many stars with planets that could harbor life , or whether we might be alone in our galaxy , " he said .
In 2007 Mr. Ravisé - Giard , a long - serving member of the French Air Force , transitioned into Delphine Ravisé - Giard and began living as a transwoman .
Though the French military promptly changed her documentation to reflect her female identity , a French civil court soon told her she needed to have a full sex change to be legally considered female .
Luckily , their ruling got overturned by the Ministry of Justice , but now Delphine ’s facing yet another hurdle : a local chief prosecutor who says she needs bigger tits for the French legal system to consider her a real woman .
Luckily , Delphine ’s worked for many years with Trans Aide , a French group that offers legal and political assistance transgender individuals .
They ’re now pressuring the local courts to put France in line with the European Commission on Human Rights ’ recognition of transgendered individuals .
Namely , that one need n’t have surgery to be considered a woman .
It ’s likely that France will eventually come around to its senses , but until it does , Delphine has some smart takes on the absurdity of her shituation :
“ Of course , if the state applied the same test to cis [ non - trans ] women , it would have to redefine the gender of many French women .
But of course , this would never happen . ”
She added : “ What size breasts are required for a change in civil status ?
Will that breast size be established nationally by the Minister of Justice or will it be up to the personal tastes of individual attorneys ? ”
By their estimate , small - breasted women like English actress Keira Knightley would n’t pass for a woman , making it apparent that the French legal system is not only trans - phobic and classist but also misogynist and completely objectifying .
Just like America !

The ads were reportedly slated to air on Fox , CNN , and MSNBC in their DC markets but were “ pulled at the last minute ” for reasons unknown .
Allow me to clear the mystery : they were probably pulled because this is a bad idea .
But before we get into that , let ’s take a moment
Both former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and former Massachussets Gov. Mitt Romney backed the GOP 's first - place finishers in the South Carolina and Iowa gubernatorial races .
Primaries a win for Palin , Romney
If Sarah Palin and Mitt Romney decide to run for the presidency in 2012 , they 'll have some powerful friends in the early states that are key to winning the GOP nomination .
Mike Huckabee ?
Not so much .

All of it is part of the presidential election fallout from Tuesday ’s primaries in Iowa and South Carolina , two states so pivotal in the GOP nomination process that even their off - year state elections are carefully examined for their relevance to the next presidential race .
Both Palin and Romney backed the first - place finishers in the high - profile governors races in the two states — former GOP Gov. Terry Branstad in Iowa and State Rep. Nikki Haley in South Carolina — endorsements that are likely to pay dividends in the event either makes a bid for the presidency in 2012 .
Huckabee , on the other hand , bet on the wrong horses — he used his political action committee to invest heavily in the losing campaigns of businessman Bob Vander Plaats in Iowa and Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer in South Carolina , two candidates who finished some distance behind on Tuesday .
Branstad ’s victory and Haley ’s first - place finish — she ’ll face Rep. Gresham Barrett in a June 22 runoff — represent a subtle but possibly important shift in the conservative grass roots , which powered Huckabee in 2008 to an improbable win in Iowa and a strong second place showing in South Carolina .
Romney , meanwhile , finished a disappointing second in Iowa in 2008 , despite spending considerable time and money to build a commanding organizational lead in the traditional kick - off state .
The most obvious signals Tuesday were that GOP voters who showed up in South Carolina are comfortable with a woman heading the statewide ticket —
Haley would be the state ’s first female governor , if elected — and that Iowa Republicans preferred a more moderate conservative over a harder right Christian conservative .
For Palin , who is already popular with conservative activists in Iowa and South Carolina , her support for the GOP nominees — who serve as the de facto party leaders in the two states — means she now has important allies in exactly the right places for 2012 .
“ I think those endorsements help Palin more than they actually help the candidates themselves , ” said GOP strategist John Feehery .
“ She now has friends for life , and she has created the perception that she has her finger on the pulse of the Republican Party , which gives her more credibility as the party spokesperson . ”
Perhaps of more consequence for a potential Palin presidential bid , the former Alaska governor now has access to a network of staffers and activists with recent experience in winning contested statewide races .
For Palin , who is notorious for running an extremely lean operation and has never had to assemble a ground operation in those states , the assistance in marshaling staff and a field unit would prove invaluable .
Even if she does n’t seek the nomination , the 2008 Republican nominee for vice president has gathered important chits that will enable her to have a presence in the kingmaking GOP states .
Palin put even more of her political capital on the line in South Carolina , where she publicly defended Haley after she was accused in the closing weeks of the campaign of having extramarital affairs .
“ Those two states are pivotal for anyone who wants to be influential in presidential politics .
And whether she runs or not , we want her to be influential in presidential politics , ” said Marjorie Dannenfelser , president of the Susan B. Anthony List and one of Palin ’s strongest allies in Washington .
Palin and Haley are a natural fit , she explained , since they both exemplify the new energy and fresh faces that so many Republicans are clamoring for .
“ There are more new people involved , and that ’s what Palin brings , ” Dannenfelser said , noting that Huckabee just does n’t bring that energy anymore .
In a statement provided to POLITICO Wednesday , Palin congratulated “ the common - sense conservative candidates who proved again last night that the voice of the American people cannot be ignored in Washington any longer . ”
“ These candidates have the courage to stand up for their convictions , fight for what they know is right for their states and our nation , and buck politics as usual in order to put government back on the side of the people , ” Palin said .
“ It will be exciting to have these excellent candidates — especially those fearless GOP ‘ mama grizzlies ’ — take their message straight through to November and into office . ”
Some Republicans with ties to her potential 2012 rivals downplayed the significance of the June 8 results .
“ Endorsers have the ability to bring attention to a campaign and raise some money , ” said Chip Saltsman , Huckabee ’s presidential campaign manager .
“ But at that end of the day , campaigns are won or lost on the people and issues running , not the list of endorsements . ”
Kevin Madden , the former campaign spokesman for Mitt Romney , also shrugged at Palin ’s influence .
“ In each , the candidate that won ran a better race than their opponents , ” Madden said of the results in South Carolina and Iowa .
Romney , who is expecting to campaign with Haley in the fall if she wins the runoff , supported Haley before she was the clear frontrunner but has n’t received nearly as much attention for his ties to Haley as has Palin .
“ Nikki Haley represents a new generation of conservative leadership for South Carolina , ” said Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom .
“ Governor Romney spoke with her by phone on election night , and he expects to be campaigning with her again . ”
Former South Carolina Republican Party Chairman Katon Dawson said Romney ’s early endorsement proved helpful to Haley , but it was Palin who helped push her across the finish line .
“ Romney backed Nikki when she was at seven percent in the polls and gave her credibility , ” Dawson said .
“ Palin then knocked it out the park along with a well - run and funded four - week effort to close the race . ”
In Iowa , Romney was again an earlier endorser than Palin , who endorsed Branstad late in the campaign with the former GOP governor already leading the polls .
Huckabee , by contrast , endorsed Vander Plaats , one of his top Iowa aides , a year ago and campaigned for Bauer , the lieutenant governor who backed Huckabee in the South Carolina presidential primary , in December .
Huckabee lamented the “ unfortunate defeats ” of some of his candidates in a statement Wednesday .
“ I do n't support candidates based on how it will affect my political future , but how it will affect the future of the country , ” Huckabee said .
“ I do n't support candidates just because they may already have the money , momentum and machinery .
More often than not , I like to help underdogs who actually believe in something other than getting elected — who are principled , pro-life , proven conservatives whose stand on the issues is based on conviction and not political convenience . ”
The former governor still maintains a list of 372 activists in Iowa who were dispatched to raise funds and make calls for Vander Plaats , an existing political organization that Palin is unable to match .
Still , some GOP insiders view that as something of an asset since Palin does n’t owe any favors and is free to operate without constraint .
“ Palin has no history in the states or history in courting the party establishment structure , ” pointed out GOP lobbyist and power broker Ed Rogers .
“ No one can call in an IOU on Palin .
It leaves her free to side with rebels in a rebellious year . ”
Palin ’s successful involvement in the two states also reinforces the notion that her imprimatur , as much as anyone in the party , can move the dial for a segment of the GOP base .
“ Palin is still the hottest endorsement for Republicans in contested primaries , ” said Frank Donatelli , the chairman of GOPAC , an organization designed to elect Republicans to state and local offices .
Media Portrayals Of Men

People picket everything .
If someone kills a rat in a movie , members of PETA will be outside ready to bark .
If a TV ad depicts a woman as helpless , feminists worldwide will gather and boycott the product the ad is endorsing .
If any visible minority is stereotyped , you know that the relevant community will take issue .
And do n't even get me started on what happens if you crack a gay joke — but all this raises a question :
Who defends heterosexual men when they are depicted as hormonal rejects ?
Burping , farting , ignorant , and virtually useless ; that 's how the average man is depicted nowadays .
Why ?
Well , that 's easy : Because these men wo n't raise Cain about it .
Advertisers put their money on the men because they 're pretty sure that a lawsuit wo n't follow ; we just do n't get offended .
But should we ?
More and more it seems that women are being depicted as the intelligent , all - knowing beings , minorities are being portrayed as the wise and stylish ones , and average Joes are , well , the morons of the operation .
What 's going on ?
feel the sting
Why is it acceptable for guys to be portrayed as though they can't fend for themselves and need a woman to point out how useless they are ?
After all , stereotypes do stem from somewhere , so maybe most guys are virtually useless in certain aspects of their lives and need women to come in and rescue them .
Yeah , right .
Granted , men have been running the corporate world since the dawn of time , but in matters of pop culture , guys are never depicted in the most glamorous fashion .
In every TV commercial I see nowadays , men are controlled by either their cars , their hormones , their need for a brewski , their appetites or all of the above .
Do we really have no depth to speak of ?
Oh wait , big breasts , 12 o'clock ...
I 'm kidding .
Everywhere I turn , men are being belittled and no one is saying a word about it .
Maybe we should start protesting every time a woman in a movie says that " all men are pigs " or that " men always think with the wrong head ... "
Those things just are n't true .
But instead of tripping out , we just shrug our shoulders and move on .
Well , I 'm taking a stand , damn it .
As long as men are n't willing to draw up picket signs that say " Men are n't swine ! " and walk in circles in front of movie debuts and corporate buildings , mass media will continue to portray us as though we 're Neanderthals .
To be clear , anyone can make fun of us because there 's no harm in doing so .
you 're so insensitive
There are commercials that show women fantasizing about their perfect man , when in reality they 're boyfriends are fat couch potatoes .
But let 's say we turned the tables and showed a commercial where there was a fat woman whose boyfriend was imagining that she was perfect ?
Man , I could just imagine the drama .
It would be the hot topic onand you 'd have Rosie O'Donnell speaking out about the injustices against big women .
Fat women of the world are angry ...

× Expand Photo by Dave Saville After Hurricane Floyd struck eastern North Carolina in 1999 , displaced residents were housed in temporary FEMA trailers at this industrial park later discovered to have been built atop coal ash .
Coal ash is n't just dumped ; it 's increasingly being recycled into building materials and other uses .
But in states like North Carolina , the failure to adequately regulate one so - called " beneficial use " of the toxic - filled waste is putting communities at risk .
After coal is burned at power plants , leaving massive heaps of ash , not all of the waste ends up in landfills and impoundments like the one that failed catastrophically in east Tennessee in December 2008 .
A growing share of the nation 's coal ash is being reused and recycled , finding its way into building materials , publicly used land and even farmland growing food crops .
And despite the presence of toxins like arsenic , chromium and lead found in coal ash , these reuses go largely unregulated by state and federal officials .
The latest report from the American Coal Ash Association , the industry group representing major coal ash producers , found that of the more than 136 million tons of coal ash produced in 2008 , about 44 percent60 million tonswas reused .
Some of the reuses for coal ash , such as recycling it into concrete , are not particularly controversial even among environmental advocates , since they 're believed to lock in toxic contaminants .
But there are growing concerns about other reuses of coal ash .
For example , the recent revelation that Chinese - manufactured drywall made with coal ash was releasing noxious chemicals inside people 's homes spurred a CBS investigation that also found problems with U.S. - made drywall products .
The discovery led the Consumer Product Safety Commission to call for a closer look at drywall products made with coal ash .
Another popular destination for coal ash that is raising concern is its use as a substitute for fill dirt in construction projects .
Because this reuse can put coal ash directly in contact with groundwater , environmental and public health advocates fear serious contamination problems .
Right now , the Environmental Protection Agency is mulling new rules for the use of coal ash , including whether it should strictly regulate ash used in fills or simply put forward guidelines and leave oversight up to the states .
As federal officials consider how to regulate reuse of coal ash , North Carolina 's experience in overseeing structural fills provides a case study with valuable lessons for the entire country .
North Carolina has long been a leader in promoting the use of coal ash as structural fill .
Heavily dependent on coal , with 60 percent of its electricity generated by coal - fired plants , the state has a glut of ash to contend withand has been encouraging utilities to use it as fill for more than 20 years .
" It is encouraging to see the commitment being made to develop reuse applications for the coal ash as opposed to the continued use of county landfills , " stated a 1989 letter from North Carolina 's solid waste chief to ReUse Technology .
The Georgia - based firm is a wholly owned subsidiary of Charlotte - based Cogentrix .
That company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Goldman Sachs Group and operates a number of small coal - fired power plants in the eastern U.S .
Prior to Goldman Sachs ' purchase of Cogentrix in 2003 , ReUse transferred its ash removal operations and other assets to a separate firm called Full Circle Solutions .
The letter continued , " The Solid Waste Management Section has and will continue to support the reuse and recycling of waste materials when performed in a manner consistent with the environment . "
But the use of coal ash as fill has not always been done in a manner " consistent with the environment . "
Even though North Carolina began overseeing coal ash fills in 1994 after groundwater contamination was found at one fill site , state records and independent research show that the ruleswhich were cooperatively written by utilities and state regulatorshave failed to prevent coal ash fills from damaging the environment and threatening public health .
Facing South examined records from the state Division of Waste Management , which oversees the use of dry coal ash as fill , and the Division of Water Quality , which is responsible for fills that use wet coal ash from impoundments like the one that failed at the Tennessee Valley Authority 's Kingston plant .
We also considered the findings of a recent report from the Sierra Club 's North Carolina chapter titled " Unlined Landfills ?
The Story of Coal Ash Waste in Our Backyard . "
The public record shows that dry coal ash was used as a substitute for fill dirt at more than 70 locations across North Carolina from the late 1980s through 2009 .
Sites sitting on top of coal ash fills include airports , roads , industrial parks , shopping centers , office buildings , a municipal gym , a church , a science center at Duke University , a rifle range at a Marine base and livestock pens at a commercial hog farm .
Unlike new surface impoundments where coal ash is dumped in North Carolina , which now must be lined under state law , liners are not mandated for even the largest fill sites .
As a result , coal ash has contaminated groundwater or surface water in at least three structural fill sites across the state :
The Alamac Road site , Robeson CountyAbout 45,000 tons of coal ash from small power plants owned by Cogentrix were used as structural fill on nearly 13 acres of land .
ReUse began placing ash at the site in 1992 without proper state authorization , and state tests of groundwater near the site found levels of contaminants exceeding state groundwater standards .
In 1993 , the N.C. Division of Solid Waste Management issued a notice of violation , stating that tests showed " levels of arsenic , cadmium , chromium , lead , selenium , sulfate and total dissolved solids " exceeding safety standardsand that some of the contaminated samples came from a monitoring site near a private residence thought to have a drinking water well .
In response , ReUse removed the coal ash from the site in 1995 with plans to use it elsewhere , including at an agricultural demonstration project testing the ability of coal ash to enhance crop yieldsan increasingly common way for coal ash to be reused , especially in the Southeast and Midwest .
The EPA 's new proposals for coal ash regulation do n't address the agricultural use of coal ash , but the agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture are currently studying such uses and are scheduled to release a report of their findings in 2012 .
The Swift Creek site , Nash CountyReUse placed coal ash from Cogentrix plants as fill on a property along Highway 301 beginning in 1994 .
Two years later , the company got special permission from the Division of Waste Management to also use ash from a facility burning a mix of coal and shredded tires , which contain arsenic and other toxic substances .
A 2004 letter from the state agency to Full Circle Solutions reported that state tests of groundwater samples taken near the site found arsenic at almost three times the state standard for groundwater and lead at more than four times the standard .
The letter stated , " The detection of contamination beyond the boundary of the fill shows that constituents from the [ coal ash ] are migrating . "
Arthurs Creek , Northhampton CountyThough our own review of the division 's files did not turn up any mention of violations at the location , Sierra Club found records showing that state environmental inspectors discovered high levels of arsenic , iron and selenium in wetlands at the Arthurs Creek coal ash fill site in 2009 .
Since 2004 , the 21 - acre site has been the dumping ground for ash from Kentucky - based energy giant E.ON 's Roanoke Valley Energy plant near Weldon , N.C.
There are plans to eventually build office buildings and a parking lot atop the fill .
The problem of groundwater contamination at structural fill sites across North Carolina may be even more widespread , because state law does not require groundwater monitoring at such sites or even require regular inspections .
Most of the problems that have been found to date were discovered following complaints from nearby residents .
The areas of North Carolina contaminated by coal ash fills are notable for being poor and having large African - American , Latino and Native American populations .
While the statewide poverty rate is 14.6 percent , the poverty rates for the counties with known damage cases from coal ash fills are much higher : 15.5 percent in Nash County , 26.6 percent in Northampton and 30.4 percent in Robeson , according to Census Bureau data .
Those counties ' nonwhite populations are also greater than the state 's 26.1 percent , at 39.4 percent in Nash , 59.4 percent in Northampton and 64.2 percent in Robeson .
Water contamination is not the only problem that 's occurred at structural fill sites across North Carolina .
At some of the sites , work occurred without the required notification of state regulators .
At others , the companies improperly excavated the sites before placing the ash , increasing the risk that the coal ash would come in contact with groundwater .
And in some instances , coal ash generators may have made ash available for use as fill that should n't have been allowed because it contained excessive levels of contaminants .
For example , state Division of Water Quality records show that Progress Energy distributed ash for fill use that exceeded limits for arsenic .
" Based on your 2007 annual report , 14,025 tons of ash was distributed in December of 2007 in which the arsenic concentrations of all three samples exceeded the ceiling and monthly average concentration , " according to a March 2009 letter from the agency to the company .
" Based on the 2008 annual report , five out of the 12 ash samples exceeded the ceiling concentration . "
Progress Energy 's permit allows coal ash with arsenic concentrations exceeding those limits to be distributed for fill as long as it will be overlain by impervious surfaces like pavement so rainwater can't penetrate and leach out contaminants .
But the division was apparently not sure that was the case :
It asked the company for a site plan showing where the ash was used , but no plan was included in the files .
Furthermore , some coal ash fill sites in North Carolina had problems with erosion that left the toxic waste exposed , posing a direct threat to local residents .
Among those was the Fountain Industrial Park site near the city of Rocky Mount in Edgecombe County .
In 1989 , ReUse Technology in cooperation with the Edgecombe County Development Corp. began placing at the site ash from various Cogentrix plants , as well as from the coal - fired cogeneration facility at UNC - Chapel Hill .
Following Hurricane Floyd in 1999 , the industrial park was turned into a trailer park for about 370 eastern North Carolina families displaced by the disaster .
Many of the residents were from Princeville , a historic African - American community that was devastated by flooding from the storm .
By that time , the soil covering the fill had eroded , leaving ash exposed .
Employees of a nearby correctional facility , who for years had watched industrial - size trucks dumping large quantities of unknown materials at the site , began asking if this was a good place to locate a trailer park .
They brought their concerns to the attention of Saladin Muhammad with the group Black Workers for Justice , who was working with trailer park residents .
He in turn discussed the situation with graduate students at the UNC School of Public Health , and one of them , Aaron Pulver , investigated the situation for his master 's paper .
Pulver 's experience in trying to track down the history of the site shows how difficult it can be in the current regulatory environment for the public to get information about the use of coal ash for structural fill .
While the Edgecombe County development officer told Pulver a study of the land had been done prior to construction of the trailer park , she refused to release it to himas did the director of the N.C. Office of Temporary Housing .
When Pulver finally managed to get a copy of the report , he discovered there had actually been no thorough testing of the site for possible health impacts before the placement of the trailers .
His adviser , UNC epidemiology professor Dr. Steve Wing , raised concerns about inhalation of the coal ash dust and children ingesting it while playing in the dirt .
In response to mounting worries about the site 's safety , epidemiologists with the state health department collected samples from the trailer park for testing , comparing the results to EPA 's standards for potential health effects .
One of the samples exceeded those standards for two contaminants , with arsenic at 25 milligrams per kilogram compared to a recommended level of 22 , and chromium at 31 mg / kg compared to the standard of 30 .
However , a press release put out by the N.C. Department of Health and Human Serviceswith the headline " SOIL TESTS FIND NO PROBLEMS AT FOUNTAIN TRAILER PARK " said only that the soil samples " showed no significant risk " for the residents .
It did not mention the elevated arsenic and chromium levels .
The problems that have occurred at coal ash structural fill sites across North Carolina highlight the difficulty states face in overseeing ash placement programs in the absence of federal regulations .
Under North Carolina 's rules , companies placing dry coal ash as fill are supposed to record its presence on the property deed , a provision fought by Duke Energy , which , along with Progress Energy , is one of the state 's two big investor - owned utilities and a major producer of coal ash .
However , the Sierra Club found that only 56 percent of the closed structural fill sites that held 1,000 cubic yards or more of coal ash had complied with the deed - recording requirement .
State officials are n't required to do their own tests of coal ash fill to see if it has potentially dangerous levels of arsenic of other contaminants :
That 's left up to the companies , and there 's no rule to check the accuracy of what the companies report .
No advance permits are required for fills , even for the largest sites .
And while the state can comment on a company 's coal ash fill plans , it does not have the power to deny them .
Following the Kingston disaster in Tennessee in 2008 , state Rep. Pricey Harrison , D - Guilford , tried to change the way coal ash is regulated in North Carolina , including its use in structural fills .
In 2009 , she introduced a bill that would have created a permitting system for coal ash fills , but the final version of the legislation that passed the General Assembly and was signed into law by Gov. Beverly Perdue had the structural fill provision stripped out .
Instead , the measure simply subjected the state 's massive coal ash impoundments to dam safety rules , an approach aimed at preventing catastrophes like Kingston but that does nothing to protect against potentially more insidious environmental contamination from ash fills .
But even that basic safeguard was difficult to win at the state capitol , with the politically powerful utility companies and electric cooperatives working against it .
" They fought every aspect of the bill tooth and nail , " Harrison said .
" They lobbied hard against even a hearing . "
In May , Harrison introduced another bill to better regulate structural fill sites in North Carolina .
And as co-chair of the state Environmental Review Commission and House Environment Committee , she is also planning on holding hearings on coal ash next month .
Meanwhile , spurred by the Kingston coal ash disaster in Tennessee , North Carolina regulators have stepped up their inspections of structural fill sites .
In 2009 , they visited 48 sites and found violations at 28 of them , ranging from water contamination to a lack of cover that could stop coal ash from escaping fill sites .
But the regulators themselves acknowledge that more must be done .
" We 've been unable to bring the attention to this that we feel it needs , " said Paul Crissman , chief of the Division of Waste Management 's Solid Waste Section , which oversees dry coal ash fills .
Since the recession - triggered state budget crisis began in 2008 , Crissman 's staff has declined from 54 to 49 people , while the workload has increased .
He does not expect that situation to change any time soon , with state lawmakers facing a $ 1 billion budget gap .
" We 've got more work to do in a day than workers to put at it , " Crissman added .
While North Carolina 's regulatory approach to coal ash fill has proven inadequate for ensuring against environmental damages , the administration of Gov. Perdue does not support strict federal regulation of coal ash as hazardous waste .
In fact , her departments of transportation and commerce are both on record opposing that regulatory approach .
The state 's Utility Commission and the commission 's Public Staff also oppose strict regulation , citing cost concerns .
The lack of strong state rules for using coal ash as structural fill in places like North Carolina has caused community health and environmental advocates to rest their hopes for protective standards on Washington .
The EPA 's much - anticipated new proposals for regulating coal ash released earlier this month allow for the continued recycling and reuse of coal ash .
However , they draw a distinction between turning the waste into manufactured products , which would not be regulated under the proposals , and the reuse of coal ash in large fills , which , as the EPA notes , pose " an array of environmental issues " and would be regulated as a type of land disposal .
How the EPA will address the issue wo n't become clear until after the comment period for the proposed rules end and final regulations are announced .
The agency has not announced any time line for that .
In the meantime , patchwork and scattershot state regulations like those in North Carolina continue to carry the daya situation that environmental advocates say amounts to allowing utilities to push their ash waste problems onto the public in dangerous ways .
" Because this ' reuse ' is subject to little or no regulation in many states , " contend the watchdog groups Earthjustice and the Environmental Integrity Project , " some structural fills may be little more than dumpsites in disguise . "
everyone sits here and says the movie sucked , and that they didnt upload it they just downloaded it and watched .
Either way we ALL know downloading movies for free is illegal .
So what is the problem here .
you knew it was illegal , and if you got caught then shame on you .
You may think that red light at 1 am is stupid but if you run it and get pulled over do you cry about it saying that it was stupid no one was coming ?
No you dont , you STFU and pay the ticket .
So why is this any different ?
anyone who downloaded it , knew it was illegal and they broke piracy laws .
So stop trying to justify your actions because the movie in your opinion sucked or because you for some reason think you are above the laws we are all held to and can do what ever you want .
Dont do something illegal if you dont want to pay for it if you get caught .
End of story .
I for one am glad they are going after people .
I am a Photographer and a Director of Photography for cinematic productions .
I know how this hurts the industry .
You guys sit here and say they make enough money off movies .
How wrong you are .
Piracy affects my job .
Because its harder for people to get into the industry because fewer and fewer people pay for movies and these companies take a hit in revenue , which means less productions and less jobs .
No longer are movies a bidding option for me , I have to be signed on by a director or producer .
I do agree that they should be attempting to punish the people who uploaded these videos to be downloaded .
but at the end of the day you knew it was illegal when you clicked download .
So if you got a letter from Voltage , shame on you .
Barack Obama has given his full support to South Korea 's decision to act against Pyongyang for the torpedo attack on its warship , the White House said today , adding that the president has ordered the US military to " ensure readiness " to help deter future aggression by the North .
Earlier Seoul suspended all trade and investment with North Korea , banned the North 's ships from passing its waters , and vowed to take Pyongyang to the UN security council over the incident , in which 46 sailors died .
The White House said it endorsed South Korean president Lee Myung - bak 's demand that " North Korea immediately apologise and punish those responsible for the attack , and , most importantly , stop its belligerent and threatening behaviour " .
Seoul can continue to count on the full backing of the US , an official said , adding that military commanders were co-ordinating closely with South Korea 's government and defence department on ways the US could help if North Korea continued its threatening behaviour .
The official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions are continuing , said that was likely to include US assistance with military training exercises .
The US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , said the attack had created a " highly precarious " security situation in the region .
The South Korean president , in an address delivered at the war memorial in Seoul , said Pyongyang had to pay for its brutality over the sinking of the warship .
Lee accused Pyongyang of " incessant " attacks , listing incidents including a 1983 bombing that targeted a South Korean presidential delegation in Burma and the 1987 shooting down of an aircraft , in which 115 people died .
" We have always tolerated North Korea 's brutality , time and again , " Lee said .
" We did so because we have always had a genuine longing for peace on the Korean peninsula .
But now things are different .
North Korea will pay a price corresponding to its provocative acts . "
The South Korean moves followed last week 's findings by an investigative team of " overwhelming evidence " that the 1,200 - tonne Cheonan was sunk by a torpedo from a North Korean submarine on 26 March as the ship carried out a routine patrol of disputed waters in the Yellow Sea .
North Korea denies any involvement , and its main newspaper , the Rodong Sinmun , today described the investigation results as an " intolerable , grave provocation " tantamount to a declaration of war .
China , North Korea 's main ally and a permanent member of the security council , has so far described the sinking only as unfortunate and urged all sides to show restraint .
It is concerned that instability in its neighbour could lead to a huge flow of refugees and bring US military forces close to its border .
Japan 's chief cabinet secretary , Hirofumi Hirano , told a news conference he believed the country would " strongly support "
Seoul going to the security council , adding : " If that takes place , we would like to play a role , if given the chance , in getting China to recognise that it is in the same situation . "
The disputed maritime border where the Cheonan sank has seen repeated skirmishes .
South Korean military officials said a November firefight killed one North Korean sailor .
Daniel Pinkston , north - east Asia deputy project director for the International Crisis Group , said : " South Korea would like a [ security council ] resolution , but I think they are realistic and their expectations are low .
They are going to take whatever they can get there and look for whatever they can get from their friends and allies in a kind of coalition of the willing [ in a ] multidimensional approach . "
He said that although South Korea would like to see extra sanctions on top of those introduced following nuclear and missile tests by the North , it knew they were unlikely .
Instead it would be creative , with a package of measures such as increased military exercises , which would not only send a message to the North but exact a toll on its resources when it inevitably responded .

There ’s just one facility in the world where scientists and emergency responders can run full - scale oil spill response tests and research .
It ’s housed at US Naval Weapons Station Earle in Leonardo , New Jersey .
But when Sen. Robert Menendez ( D - NJ ) tried to arrange a visit to the facility earlier this week , he learned that the facility is presently inoperable .
Why ?
The tank researchers use to simulate spills has sprung a leak .
The Oil and Hazardous Materials Simulated Environmental Test Tank ( OHMSETT ) is owned by the Minerals Management Service ( recently renamed the “ Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation , and Enforcement ” ) .
The wave pool there , which is used to test oil spill response technologies and techniques , was closed last month “ because of multiple leaks ” and is expected to remain out of commission until sometime in July .
Menendez , a major opponent of offshore drilling , says the situation demonstrates just how unprepared the federal government is to handle an oil disaster like the one in the Gulf .
“ I believe that the fact that this facility is inoperable during the nation ’s largest oil spill is indicative of a complacency and lack of investment in oil spill response technologies , ” he wrote in a letter to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Monday .
“ The industry and even the government has substantially invested in new technologies to drill in deeper water and deeper into the Earth , but little has been invested in safety or oil spill response and clean - up . ”
The Department of Interior issued this response today , arguing that maintenance on the tank was planned and that the Coast Guard does n’t need to use the facility right now because they are “ too busy with the response ” in the Gulf .
Here ’s the full statement :
OHMSETT is currently closed to testing because of planned maintenance .
Prior to the closure , BOE consulted with the USCG to see if they needed the tank after the Deepwater Horizon incident and they said that they were too busy with the response .
No testing was delayed or postponed due to the planned closure .
The tests normally conducted at the facility are scheduled months in advance and are more oriented to advancing research and development than to addressing current issues .
If the research is promising , it can and often is developed into procedures or equipment used to deal with real - world events .
We also have the ability to bring the facility back on line in several days if the tank is needed for testing to help the spill response effort .
Even though it was inoperable at the time , Sharon Buffington , chief of the engineering and research branch of MMS , touted the tank as “ a vital component ” of MMS ’ oil spill research in testimony to a House panel on June 9 .
“ It is the only facility in the world that allows for full - scale oil spill response testing , training , and research conducted with a variety of oils in a marine environment under controlled conditions , ” Buffington told a House panel .
Now - dismissed MMS head Liz Birnbaum also talked up it at a hearing last month as integral to “ ensure that the best and safest technologies are used in offshore oil and gas operations . ”
Neither Birnbaum or Buffington mentioned that the facilty was offline .
Menendez , who is sponsoring an MMS reform bill in the Senate , says this is yet another example of why the divsion needs an overhaul .
“ The need for the MMS reform could not be clearer when the agency charged with preventing Big Oil from spilling into our waters cannot keep water in its own testing tanks , ” Menendez tells Mother Jones .
Seems like the hole in the bottom of the Gulf is n’t the only one we should be worrying about .
In the last 44 years , the Miranda warning has become as American as the Iowa State Fair .
Most of us could recite it in our sleep , particularly the part that goes :
You have the right to remain silent .
Police and prosecutors , who once saw it as coddling criminals , have learned to live with this modest obligation .
But not everyone is so adaptable .
Some people bridle at the notion of going along with something that protects the guilty as well as the innocent .
Five of them sit on the Supreme Court of the United States .
They read the Miranda protections the way W.C. Fields read the Bible : looking for loopholes .
That became blindingly evident this week when the court , by a 5 - 4 vote , ruled against a defendant who said he had been deprived of his freedom to keep his mouth shut .
After being arrested and told of his right to remain silent , Van Chester Thompkins proceeded to exercise it .
He refused to speak , beyond a few one - word responses to innocuous questions , such as whether his chair was hard .
But his police interrogators were not to be denied .
For nearly three hours they confined him in a small room and peppered him with questions .
Finally , Thompkins was asked if he prayed to God to forgive him for " shooting that boy down , " and he replied , " Yes . "
He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life without parole .
His lawyers said that having indicated his choice to remain silent , he should have been spared further grilling .
On their side is common sense , which says that if someone announces you are free not to speak , not speaking is an unmistakable way to convey your exercise of that prerogative .
But common sense is not always abundant in the halls of justice .
The Supreme Court claims that Thompkins ' persistent silence did n't suggest a choice to remain silent .
Its logic :
How can I know you do n't want to talk if you wo n't say anything ?
It does n't occur to the five justices that someone in the grasp of the police , after hours of relentless questioning , would conclude that his right to remain silent was meaningless — that he would be interrogated until he answered .
Justice Anthony Kennedy insisted there was no evidence the suspect had the slightest desire to invoke the privilege .
" Thompkins did not say that he wanted to remain silent or that he did not want to talk with the police , " asserted Kennedy .
If there is any doubt about the suspect 's preference , the court established , it will be taken as consent to be questioned .
If Kennedy were to try to strike up a conversation with someone at a bar , only to be ignored , he would assume she was dying to hear more .
Such obtuse logic is impossible to square with the 1966 Miranda decision , where the justices explained the psychological reality of a police interrogation .
Someone being held involuntarily in a station house , they knew , will tend to assume that he must cooperate or suffer painful consequences .
The Miranda warning is one way to convey to the suspect — and the cops — that he has rights they must respect .
" Unless adequate protective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings , no statement obtained from the defendant can truly be the product of his free choice , " declared the court .
But just giving the warning is not enough .
The court stressed that the police may not exploit ambiguities to nullify its effects .
" If the individual indicates in any manner , at any time prior to or during questioning , that he wishes to remain silent , the interrogation must cease , " it said .
" If the interrogation continues without the presence of an attorney and a statement is taken , a heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self - incrimination … " ( my emphasis )
Not anymore , it does n't .
Now , says the court , it is the duty of any accused person " who wants to invoke his or her right to remain silent to do so unambiguously . "
The " heavy burden " lands on the suspect .
If cops can trick him or wear him down , the justices say : Good for them .
Once upon a time , the Supreme Court tried to make sure that Americans under police suspicion could freely decide whether to exercise their constitutionally protected right against self - incrimination .
I 'm waiting to hear Kennedy and Co. express any similar commitment .
And their silence is deafening .

As an undergraduate I dabbled in Classics , and I remember being surprised by the term hapax legomenon ( ἅπαξ λ εγ όμενον ) .
That 's " written once " -- a word that occurs in only one place in the written record .
It seems impossible , but happens surprisingly often : over 300 words in the Iliad appear nowhere else in Greek .
So much has been lost ( all but 7 of Sophocles ' 123 plays , for instance ) that every text that survives is precious .
They communicate the self - understanding of their cultures -- which helped shape the modern world -- and have commanded scholarly attention for centuries .
For these artifacts of a long - vanished world , passed down by generations of hand copying , merely establishing the text requires careful study of crabbed handwriting and critical comparison of divergent copies .
Modern scholars of Ancient Greek and Latin , continuing in this tradition , are working to create comprehensive electronic editions of these texts .
For anyone who remembers studying Latin the old way , constantly paging through a dictionary , these electronic texts are a revelation .
Now we have Caesar 's Gallic Wars ( Perseus Digital Library ) with every word parsed and translated , along with linguistic commentary and a collection of references to the text from other works .
We can read about Sophocles ’ 123 plays in the Stoa Consortium 's electronic edition of the Suda , a 10th - century Byzantine Greek encyclopedia .
And scholars around the world can now consult a high - resolution digital scan of Venetus A , one of the best manuscripts of the Iliad , at the Center for Hellenic Studies .
I 'm pleased to announce that Google Books is now assisting this work by sharing high - resolution digital scans of over 500 volumes of Ancient Greek and Latin , dating from the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries .
( Of course , downloadable versions of over a million volumes in all fields are available from books.google.com , in a more compressed form . )
Jon Orwant and I created this collection using a list of several thousand important Classics volumes identified by our collaborators Professor Gregory Crane and Alison Babeu of Tufts University .
We are analyzing additional volumes and expect to be able to release more high - resolution scans in the future .
These scans will aid the development of accurate OCR ( Optical Character Recognition ) algorithms for Ancient Greek , and provide the basis for electronic versions of important editions of these Classics texts ; but perhaps their greatest value will be for the development of new methods in this emerging field .
We ’re honored that Professor Crane called this donation “ a major contribution to what scholars can do . ”
One recent afternoon , just after the dismissal bell rang , shrieks emerged from a crowd of students waiting for the XH SEPTA bus at Washington and Musgrave .
One teen ran over and threw water on another , who almost stepped in front of a passing car on Washington .
Appearing angry , the victim stormed at the splasher .
They yelled at each other but soon erupted in laughter .
TORONTO , Canada —
A political convention where people shout , “ Drill , baby , drill ” is not one you ’re likely to see in Canada .
That kind of rapture better fits our neighbors to the south .
Here , things are done more discreetly .
It took the blowout at the BP oil well in the Gulf of Mexico before most Canadians gave any thought to the potential for a similar catastrophe off their shores .
And when questions were raised , the answers were revealing .
Canadians learned that major oil companies were for months lobbying the National Energy Board to ease safety requirements for offshore drilling in the environmentally sensitive Beaufort Sea — a body of water that includes U.S. and Canadian territorial waters north of Alaska and the Yukon .
Oil companies wanted Canada to relax regulations on its side of the Beaufort that require a relief well to be drilled in the same season a main well is completed .
In the event of a blowout , relief wells are used to reduce the pressure and , therefore , the amount of oil that would gush into the sea .
In the Gulf of Mexico , a relief well would have made all the difference .
Without one , BP was reduced to using mud , golf balls and rubber tires in a failed bid to tap the geysers of crude killing marine life and the livelihood of fishermen .
Canada ’s regulator had set June 3 and 4 to hear the request by Imperial Oil — backed by the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers and other major oil companies — to ease the same - season relief well rule .
In a pre-hearing submission to the National Energy Board earlier this year , Imperial argued the building season in the Artic is too short for a relief well to be finished in the same season .
A main well , it added , takes two or three summers to complete .
Imperial further argued that insisting on a same - season relief well would essentially block deepwater drilling in the energy rich Arctic .
It instead called on the board to emphasize measures that prevent spills .
The company conceded , however , that a blowout in the Beaufort Sea could spew crude for up to three years before a relief well could be drilled .
BP backed Imperial ’s main argument .
In its pre-hearing submission to the Canadian regulator in March , it said relief well rules “ ought to be rescinded ” and replaced by preventive measures that allow more time to drill the relief well .
These lobbying efforts were brought to a halt in mid-May by the ecological disaster in the Gulf of Mexico .
Imperial suddenly called for a postponement of the hearings until after an investigation determines the cause of the Gulf blowout .
The National Energy Board agreed , adding it would now conduct a full review of its offshore drilling regulations .
Several companies , including Imperial , have leases to drill offshore wells in the Canadian Beaufort Sea , but none have yet received permits from the regulator to do so .
( Canada does , however , have offshore rigs in the Atlantic Ocean , producing about 12 percent of the country ’s crude oil supply . )
Gaetan Caron , the National Energy Board ’s CEO , assured a parliamentary committee May 13 that there will be no drilling in Canada ’s portion of the Beaufort until at least 2014 .
Still , one committee member suggested Caron may be too soft on the oil industry , noting he once said his regulating agency ’s top priority is to “ contribute to innovation and economic growth and to reduce the administrative burden on business . ”
Oil companies are scrambling to get their hands on the Arctic ’s vast and untapped natural resources .
The scramble has become more intense as global warming melts the Arctic ice , opening up waterways for tankers and offshore drilling .
It ’s no small irony that the burning of fossil fuels is melting Arctic ice , thereby allowing for more drilling for fossil fuels in the Arctic .
A scientist who used to be a senior official at Environment Canada , William Adams , warned the same parliamentary committee in May that an oil spill in the Beaufort Sea would have a “ catastrophic ” impact on the ecosystem , which includes the summer breeding grounds for bowhead whales , and accelerate the melting of sea ice .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper has said there will be no drilling in the Arctic “ unless the environment is protected . ”
Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon later described Arctic oil extraction as “ a commercial activity of immense potential . ”
There are growing calls for a moratorium on offshore drilling across the Arctic .
A recent public opinion poll found 54 percent of Canadians want deep - water oil drilling “ suspended until safety can be reasonably assured . ”
Another 23 percent want it banned outright because it is “ not worth the risk . ”
One of the problems with oil spills is that they do n’t recognize international boundaries .
Greenland has issued offshore exploration licenses in Davis Strait , near Baffin Island on the eastern side of Canada ’s Arctic .
And President Barack Obama ’s administration — while suspending additional sales of offshore oil leases — is allowing Shell Oil to proceed with plans to drill exploratory wells on the American side of the Beaufort Sea and the adjacent Chukchi Sea , near the Arctic National Wildlife Refugee .
Obama seems to have the backing of Americans .
An NBC / Wall Street Journal poll May 12 found six out of 10 Americans support more offshore drilling , despite the Gulf Coast oil spill .
“ Drill , baby , drill . ”
Trion Worlds , publishers of “ Rift : Planes of Telara ” responded in a filing to the “ Rifts ” trademark infringement lawsuit filed by Palladium Books .
You can view the original Palladium lawsuit filing in my earlier post .
[ pullshow ]
I suggest you download that paperwork and take a quick look before reading the Trion response , as the Trion paperwork is essentially a point - for - point refutation of Palladium ’s arguments .
Trion responded very aggressively to Palladium ’s claims .
Foremost among their response is the claim that Palladium has no right to the “ Rifts ” trademark on video games at all !
In fact , Trion intends to challenge the trademark with the US Patent and Trademark Office .
Here is the relevant section of the filing .
Trion Worlds is filing petitions to cancel Palladium Books ’ trademark registrations for fraud on the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( “ USPTO ” ) .
Palladium Books cannot seek injunctive relive based on these registrations and has made no showing of any common law trademark rights .
The filing argues that the lack of any “ Rifts ” video game in the past few years makes the trademark subject to cancellation .
The poor showing of the “ N - Gage ” “ Promise of Power ” game merits mention several times .
Trion Worlds also goes on to directly attack the popularity and value of “ Rifts ” as an intellectual property .
As time has gone one , [ pullthis ] Palladium Books ’ games have become less relevant , and seem to have waned in popularity and commercial success [ / pullthis ] ( the Main RIFTS book has only sold 250,000 copies in over 20 years on the market ; , 45,000 of those were in its first year ) .
Ex . 2 . Even its fans bemoan the lack of originality in the RIFTS materials and unwieldy set of rules .
Trion also argues that there are many examples of the word “ Rift ” in the fantasy and science - fiction world .
Examples provided included several fantasy novels with “ Rift ” or “ Rifts ” in the title , various movies and other media products ( including “ Tripping the Rift , ” which gave me a chuckle ) and a section detailing Raymond E. Feist ’s “ Riftwar Saga . ”
There are several other interesting sections , but one paragraph caught my eye .
The only “ games ” that Palladium Books has ever produced in any significant numbers are its series of “ pen and paper ” role - playing game books .
These games are played by a small group of players sitting around a table , rolling dice , and talking about what their “ characters ” are doing .
In sharp contrast , MMO games like the R:PoT Game are played online with a computer , feature advanced , realistic graphics and involve the simultaneous interaction of thousands–or even millions– of players .
For a comparison of the very different gaming experiences , please see Exhibit 14 ( photos ) and 15 ( YouTube videos ) .
The contrast is striking , and demonstrates that even if both products could broadly be described as “ role - playing games ” that involve the ubiquitous storytelling element s of inter-dimensional “ rifts , ” they are only as “ related ” as ping - pong and basketball , both of which are “ games ” that involve the use of “ balls … ”
Make of this argument what you will .
There is simply too much in this document for me to regurgitate , so here is the original document for your examination .
Trion World ’s Response to the Palladium Rifts Lawsuit
Palladium quickly responded with this filing from Kevin Siembieda .
Kevin Siembieda Responds to Trion Worlds FIling
Mr. Siembieda responds on a point - by - point basis to the Trion filing .
Here is Mr. Siembieda ’s response to the “ waning popularity ” contention .
Finally , Trion tries to paint Palladium and me as “ has beens ” and that no one in the gaming world knows us or pays any attention to us .
The fact is , however , that Palladium and RIFTS are extremely well known in the industry and RIFTS ® is considered one of the seminal RPGs .
We are so well known that in November 2009 , Blizzard , the makers of World of Warcraft– the world ’s most successful MMORPG in history – flew me in as a special guest to speak to their writers about writing and game design .
During the seminar , they asked questions that referenced the tremendous influence RIFTS ® and my work have had on today ’s videogame designers , as well as asking me why there has n’t been a Rifts MMORPG yet .
Both of the documents make for interesting reading .
I will keep you apprised of any further developments .

TACKLES : The Nude Blacks and Welsh Leeks in action .
Tackles were on display on Saturday at the Nude Blacks seventh annual rugby " international " , played in fine deep south conditions .
Mostly made up of Otago University students , the Nude Blacks defeated the Welsh Leeks at Dunedin 's Logan Park Sports Ground – watched by a crowd of fully clothed fans .
Ex–All Black John
Timu officiated at the game .
Highlights of the match include a nude haka , which the " Welsh " team responded to with some attempted Morris dancing , before brandishing and tossing leeks at the Nude Blacks .
The game even brought back the biff , with a mock punch - up bringing memories of Buck Shelford and Huw Richards ' stoush in the 1987 Rugby World Cup 's semi-final .
A fully clothed streaker took to the field , before being taken down by a woman adorned in nothing but a police hat .
Event organiser Ralph Davies said the weather was , unfortunately , fine for the game .
" We prefer Antarctic southerlies and about 3 degrees just to challenge the players a bit , " he said .
The 500 - plus audience lined the sides of the field .
The event was played at 2.15 pm , as an unofficial curtain - raiser to the All Blacks game against the Welsh in the clothed form of the game at Carisbrook .

That the conflict in Afghanistan was n't an active issue in the election suggests that it is in danger of being regarded as a condition to be endured rather than a problem to be solved – much as the war in Iraq became before British troops withdrew .
In their different ways , two new books – David Finkel 's The Good Soldiers ( Atlantic ) and Sebastian Junger 's War ( Fourth Estate ) – offer perilous insights into the nature of that condition .
The Good Soldiers is the result of eight months spent with the US 2 - 16 Infantry Battalion in Baghdad , part of " the surge " confidently announced by President Bush in January 2007 .
War is an account of Junger 's time embedded with a platoon of American soldiers at " the tip of the spear " in the lethal Korengal Valley in Afghanistan .
Writers are not obliged to deal with current events , but it happens that the big story of our times – the al - Qaida attacks on New York and the Pentagon , and the subsequent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – is being told in some of the greatest books of our time .
These books do not , however , take the shape and form often expected : the novel .
So Finkel and Junger have their work cut out if their contributions are to squeeze on to a shelf of first - rate books that already includes Steve Coll 's Ghost Wars ; Lawrence Wright 's The Looming Tower ; George Packer 's The Assassins ' Gate ; Rajiv Chandrasekaran 's Imperial Life in the Emerald City ; and Dexter Filkins 's The Forever War .
Lower the bar only slightly and room would have to be made for books by Thomas E Ricks , Jane Mayer , Evan Wright and Ahmed Rashid .
And there 's no sign that the supply is about to dry up .
August sees the publication of Jim Frederick 's Black Hearts , which investigates the disintegration , under intolerable pressure , of a platoon of American soldiers of the 502nd Infantry Regiment in Iraq 's " triangle of death " in 2005 - 06 , culminating in the rape and murder of a 14 - year - old Iraqi girl and the execution of her family by four members of the platoon .
As Packer put it in his recent collection of essays , Interesting Times : " The press redeemed in Baghdad what it had botched in Washington . "
Reportage , long - form reporting – call it what you will – has left the novel looking superfluous .
The fiction lobby might respond : it 's too soon to tell .
A decade of literary silence followed the armistice of 1918 .
It was n't until 1929 that a novel appeared that made imaginative sense of the first world war .
Erich Maria Remarque 's
All Quiet on the Western Front answered an unspoken need and helped to create the conditions in which other war novels might , in the words of the hopeful Richard Aldington " go big " .
Since then , however , the lag between a given war and the appearance of books about it has shrunk .
Norman Mailer 's The Naked and the Dead appeared in 1948 .
In terms of its timing , Joseph Heller 's Catch - 22 ( 1961 ) was a strange and fortuitous case : a novel about the second world war that seemed to anticipate the absurdity of Vietnam .
The defining prose work to come out of that conflict was a book of reportage , Michael Herr 's Dispatches ( 1977 ) , while the first Gulf war received its most memorable prose expression in Jarhead ( 2003 ) , Anthony Swofford 's account of his time in the marines .
The precedent set by Herr and followed , in off - kilter fashion , by Swofford , seems unlikely to be reversed .
If there were ever a time when the human stories contained within historical events – what Packer calls " the human heart of the matter " – could only be assimilated and comprehended when they had been processed by a novel ( War and Peace is the supreme example ) , that time has passed .
As David Shields put it in his recent manifesto , Reality Hunger : " A while ago the imaginative thing – the supposedly great thing – would have been to write a ' novel about Vietnam ' , but I just feel in my bones how little I could read that . "
You do n't have to sign up for Shield 's anti-novel jihad to feel that what he says about Vietnam holds good for Iraq – only more so .
What about character and story ?
The characters are there in the non-fiction accounts , fully realised in flesh and ( often awash in ) blood , in the way that we expect fictional characters to be .
Lawrence Wright has spoken of how , in the process of researching the 9/11 attacks , he came to realise that certain people could serve as " donkeys " who bore the weight of larger historical drives or circumstances .
Part of the success of The Looming Tower derives from the way that these donkeys are presented as complex and developing individuals , never simply as beasts of narrative burden .
And while their destinies fatefully converge on the twin towers in a way that is almost novelistic , the book 's suspense and momentum do not reduce the idea of narrative to page - turning compulsion .
Although Finkel was often in the thick of the action described , he removes himself absolutely from his own narrative .
In this respect The Good Soldiers is like a traditional third - person novel , with a near - omniscient narrator – or an Isherwood - style camera , recording but not judging .
What this camera records – what the soldiers endure – almost defies belief .
The combat is dreadful , the immediate aftermath worse : " Someone , maybe a medic , was pushing up and down on his chest so violently it seemed every one of his ribs must be breaking .
' You need to go harder and faster , ' the doctor in charge told him .
The medic began pushing so hard that pieces of Reeves 's shredded leg began dropping on the floor . "
The long - term aftermath is worse still as the book 's central character , Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Kauzlarich , visits the ruined soldiers and their families – recovering and not recovering – back in the States .
" There was so much of Duncan Crookston missing that he did n't seem real .
He was half of a body propped up in a full - size bed , seemingly bolted into place . "
In the course of the book you see Kauzlarich – " Lost Kauz " , as he becomes known – and other good men " disintegrate before your eyes " .
Their efforts are heroic and futile .
Wright 's idea of the donkey is enlarged so that the experiences of one group of soldiers encapsulate the larger quagmire of the US in Iraq – a quagmire that is tactical , strategic , moral and political .
( Frederick does something similar in Black Hearts . )
The starkness and magnitude of Finkel 's material demand an unerring control of tone .
Even at its most matter of fact , his prose finds a hypnotic calm in the repetition of exposure to extreme danger : " Eyes sweeping , jammers jamming , the convoy moved along route Pluto . . . "
At times there is an eerie , damaged lyricism : " Hours later , as the sun set , the sky took on its nightly ominous feel .
The moon , not quite full , rose dented and misshapen , and the aerostat , a grey shadow now rather than the bright white balloon it had been in daylight , loomed over a landscape of empty streets and buildings surrounded by sandbags and tall concrete blast walls . "
One of these details acquires hideous poignancy later when a soldier is shot in the head ; he survives but his head assumes the " dented and misshapen " aspect of the moon .
With touches like this Finkel demonstrates how the chaos of events can be given narrative shape by scrupulous observation and phrasing .
A lesser but still thrilling book , War plunges the reader into the adrenalin - mist of combat .
Like the soldiers around him , Junger is less interested in " the moral basis of the war " than the immediate experience of combat and its " twisted existential " ramifications whereby " each moment was the only proof you 'd ever have that you had n't been blown up the moment before " .
Often his senses were so overwhelmed by the experience that it was only by consulting video footage he had shot during firefights that he was able to understand and write up what had been going on .
This feeds into another of Junger 's interests : the complex mixture of military training and biochemical processes – the body 's emergency surges and shutdowns – that enable a person to function in danger while the instinct for self - preservation programmes him to curl up in a ball or flee .
Actually , it turns out not to be so complicated after all .
Courage , Junger learns , is love : a willingness to lay down your life for others who , you know , would do the same for you , because in certain situations there is no such thing as " personal safety " ( " what happened to you happened to everyone " ) .
There is also the fact that combat is so " insanely exciting " that " one of the most traumatic things about [ it ] is having to give it up . "
War is written in the first person ; unlike Finkel , Junger is present in the events he records , but discreetly , unobtrusively .
The most extreme contrast to Finkel 's narrative self - effacement is the style of Dexter Filkins , whose The Forever War operates at a comparable level of literary excellence .
Filkins is obviously an heir of Herr – he is so bad boy , so gonzo , which can be grating at first .
Apart from a few details of transport and costume , this early glimpse of the Taliban could have been lifted straight from Hunter S Thompson 's Hell 's Angels : " Man , they were scary .
You 'd see them rolling up in one of the Hi-Luxes , all jacked up , white turbans gleaming ; they were the baddest asses in town and they knew it , too . "
A man who has " lived through everything , shootings and bomb blasts and death " , Filkins is the latest incarnation of the reporter as renegade , " untethered , floating free , figuring out the truth by a different set of standards " .
Like Junger , he is willing to get to the place of maximum danger , but tends , when he gets there , to drift into digressions that wind us more tightly into the scene .
At which point , a still more illustrious antecedent comes to mind : Ryszard Kapuscinski .
( Perhaps we can also glimpse the ghost of Alan Moorehead , the great Australian reporter of the second world war . )
This willingness to digress , to operate in territory that shares a border with fiction , does not meet with universal approval .
Several years ago I went to a talk given by Jon Lee Anderson , who had just published The Fall of Baghdad .
During the Q&A afterwards I asked if he felt any tension between the New Yorker 's famous emphasis on factual accuracy and the urge to embellish – even if it tugged one away from an objective reporting of the facts – that made Rebecca West and Kapuscinski great writers ( if potentially unreliable reporters ) .
Anderson dismissed the question with magisterial impatience .
With the bullets flying , any thoughts of literary embellishment were luxuries he could n't afford ; his only concern was to report things accurately .
Filkins , I 'm guessing , would have been more sympathetic , as even an atrocious incident , such as coming across the head of a suicide bomber who has detonated himself in a crowded market , can become a source of horror - comedy : " They 'd placed it on a platter like John the Baptist 's , and set it on the ground next to an interior doorway .
It was in good shape , considering what it had been through . . .
The most curious aspect of the face was the man 's eyebrows : they were raised , as if in surprise .
Which struck me as odd , given that he would have been the only person who knew ahead of time what was going to happen . "
It 's not just a question of tone .
As with Kapuscinski's The Soccer War , the pieces in The Forever War often have the narrative shape and moral resolution of fiction .
" Pearland " recounts an episode from the assault on Fallujah in which Filkins and a photographer are responsible for the death of 22 - year - old Lance Corporal William Miller .
The story ends with multiple layers of dreadful , unresolved irony .
Books of this kind make one feel thoroughly duped by Kathryn Bigelow 's Oscar - winning The Hurt Locker .
As with the HBO adaptation of Evan Wright 's Generation Kill ( written by David Simon and Ed Burns ) , the viewer is immersed totally in the experience of the American military in Iraq .
Both film and TV series are relentlessly gripping , especially The Hurt Locker , where every bit of trash – and there 's a lot of trash – is potentially life - threatening .
Indeed , the film is so nerve - shreddingly tense that it's only when you re-emerge into the safety of daylight that you realise how you 've been manipulated , how shallow the experience has been .
There is a thematic continuity here within Bigelow 's work :
The Hurt Locker serves up a military equivalent of the thrill - trips that Lenny Nero was hustling in her earlier Strange Days .
Lenny sells virtual reality experiences of everything from a girl showering to armed robbery .
And that – right down to the same camera techniques – is what we get here .
The new twist is in the nature of the simulated environment : all the thrills and spills of combat and bomb disposal in the privacy and safety of your own home - entertainment environment .
So impressive is the technical accomplishment that one forgets that the action , while ostensibly unfolding in the context of a real and recognisable war , is operating safely within the absurd liberties of Hollywood convention .
As if life as a bomb - disposal expert were not adrenalin - inducing enough , we are treated to a Bourne - style interlude in which William James implausibly pulls on a hooded sweatshirt , takes a pistol and goes on a one - man search for vengeance / justice at night , in Baghdad – and makes it back in one piece .
The series Generation Kill is , along with everything else , a sustained critique of the structural and conventional fictions of The Hurt Locker .
Taking no liberties with the facts of Wright 's account , it follows a convoy of US marines as they make their way from Kuwait to Baghdad .
Certain characters have more screen - time than others but there are no heroes .
As in a platoon , everything comes down to teamwork and ensemble playing .
The action is never contrived to assume the shape imposed by the demands of a good story .
This is one of the reasons why , ultimately , the immersion in the experience of war is more complete than in The Hurt Locker .
Despite their expertise and marksmanship , the extent to which the marines control their own destinies is minimal ; it pretty much ended , in fact , before the series began , when they signed up .
From the start we are sealed within the acronym - intensive argot and worldview of the USMC .
Our point of view is absolutely that of the marines .
The lessons dished out by their experiences are never moralistic but , as the situation deteriorates around them , the larger ethical and strategic impossibility of their position and purpose becomes unavoidable .
We are back to the quandary observed by Finkel in The Good Soldiers .
We are also back , more generally , to the relative strengths of non-fiction over fiction .
Of course one could easily imagine a novelist doing without any of the liberties enjoyed by Bigelow – but we would be left , then , with a novel that was almost a carbon copy of the best of these non-fiction books .
For the assumed skills of the novelist – an eye for telling detail , stylistic flair and so on – are deployed in abundance by many of these reporters , at least the ones who are ( there 's no dodging this bullet ) American .
Within every comparable category or type of book on Iraq and Afghanistan the Americans do it better than their British counterparts .
On either side of the Atlantic the books by journalists are , naturally , better than those by the people they are writing about .
It is clear from Generation Kill that Lieutenant Nathaniel Fick is a remarkable officer and human being .
In his partial autobiography , One Bullet Away , however , Fick is not able to impose his authorial personality on his version of the story from which he emerges with so much credit in Wright 's account .
Similarly , Desperate Glory – British journalist Sam Kiley 's Jungeresque account of his time in Helmand with Britain 's 16 Air Assault Brigade – is a better piece of writing than The Junior Officer 's Reading Club , former soldier Patrick Hennessy 's memoir of his tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan .
This is inevitable ; we do n't expect Wright and Kiley to be able to shoot more accurately or march further in full equipment than Fick or Hennessy .
But once we start comparing like with like – soldier with soldier , journo with journo – the Americans come out unambiguously ahead .
The reasons for this are not hard to fathom .
American writers are the beneficiaries of the deep pockets of the magazines that initially sponsored them .
In this respect the situation has not changed greatly since Vietnam when the photographer Larry Burrows was working for Life .
What his son Russell called " the real luxury " of that gig – that the magazine was " prepared to let somebody go and work for however long it took " – still holds true for print journalists lucky enough to be working for Rolling Stone ( Evan Wright ) , Vanity Fair ( Junger ) or the New Yorker ( Packer ) .
More generally , American journalists writing about the US military are the beneficiaries of the all - round flexibility and versatility of American English as deployed by the soldiers on whose lives they depend .
Officers and non-coms alike share a common idiom which is varied and animated by the racial and cultural make - up of the army .
In the British military , by contrast , the lack of this shared linguistic medium reflects the basic class division of the army , between officers and men , toffs and proles .
Instead of variety there is a straight choice .
And this applies not just to reported speech but to the register adopted by writers when operating outside the class perimeter of inverted commas .
As can easily happen when choice is demanded , the worst possible result is compromise that rinses out everything that might make either idiom compelling .
Kiley is " mad keen " to get the job done , but even when the experiences he records are terrifying , the writing is always comfortably unthreatened , except by clichés which are often , as they say in the military , danger - close .
" The air fizzes and crackles with bullets .
There seems to be no space between them as if they are being poured from a hose .
Rounds are smacking into the ground ; the dust is leaping around their feet .
Des can hear the fizzing sound made by bullets which are within a foot of his ear .
He can feel the hot whip of them on his face . "
Junger is as experience - dependent as Kiley but his prose ( " he saw a line of bullets stitching towards him in the dirt . . . " ) works like one of Lenny Nero 's virtual trips , sealing us within the experience he describes .
This is not to say that , by turning their attention to Afghanistan or Iraq , American reporters and journalists are on to a sure - fire success .
When Jon Krakauer became interested in the story of Pat Tillman he must have thought that he had found ( in Wright 's terms ) the perfect donkey : all - American boy wins lucrative pro football deal but , after 9/11 , chucks it in to join the army and goes to Afghanistan , where he is killed in an ambush .
Even more of a hero .
Then word begins to creep out that he was killed by friendly fire , and the military try everything in their power to conceal the truth .
It 's a potentially great story , and even though Where Men Win Glory reveals Krakauer 's limitations as a writer – for the historical background , he gulps down hunks of Steve Coll and Lawrence Wright without ever adequately digesting them – it remains an interesting failure in unexpected ways .
Krakauer sees that the military want Tillman to fit into their own heroic narrative , both specifically ( the ambush ) and generally ( football star sacrifices career to join army and then sacrifices himself ) .
But it is clear that Krakauer has seized on Tillman as the latest incarnation of the ideal of rugged and tragic individualism that made his earlier books Into Thin Air ( about a doomed Everest expedition ) and Into the Wild ( the story of Chris McCandless 's death in the Alaskan wilderness ) so compelling .
Viewed in this light the book compounds the kind of exemplary appropriation that it investigates .
One of the Tillman family 's grievances is that the army – specifically a commanding officer who was also an evangelical Christian – overrode Pat 's explicit wish for a secular funeral .
Later , after the family had refused to accept the findings of several investigations into Pat 's death , that same commander gave an interview in which he suggested that the Tillman family 's continuing dissatisfaction was due to its lack of religious faith .
In the larger scheme of Krakauer 's book it 's a fairly minor point , but the Christian commander turns out to be none other than Ralph Kauzlarich , the enormously sympathetic central character – the donkey carrying the heaviest load – in Finkel 's The Good Soldiers .
Just as characters interconnect with each other within a novel , so these non-fiction books and real - life characters interconnect with each other to form an epic , ongoing , multi-volume work in progress .
The biggest question mark about this proto - book concerns the way in which it is illustrated .
As Packer wrote in the essay quoted earlier , the press may have excelled itself in Baghdad , but " Iraq has not been a photographer 's war " .
Really ?
When there are so many strong pictures coming out of the current wars by Sean Smith , Michael Kamber , Tim Hetherington and others ?
( Hetherington was with Junger in Afghanistan and co-directed their forthcoming documentary Restrepo . )
Perhaps these are the exceptions that prove the rule , for Packer , it 's important to note , is talking about photographers , not photography .
In Iraq and Afghanistan we are perhaps glimpsing the end of the era of the combat photographer as a special category of occupation , the twilight of the photographer as novelist in the way that Capa ( whose famous photo from the Spanish civil war is now believed to be a fiction ) and Eugene Smith were visual novelists .
Current photography from the frontline is defined absolutely by what it is of rather than who it is by .
No photographer has been able to stamp a visual identity on what he depicted in the way that Capa or Tim Page managed , respectively , on D - Day or in Vietnam .
Perhaps photographs are now simply too ubiquitous for that .
So ubiquitous that , in a passage of Finkel 's book , " photographs " refers not to actual physical records of the kind collected by Wilfred Owen ( who carried photos of the dead and injured in his wallet ) but a way of seeing , a state of damaged mind .
Suffering from post - traumatic breakdown , one of the most heroic of Finkel 's soldiers explains that he keeps seeing " photographs . . .
Like a picture of Harrelson burning , in flames .
I can't get that out of my head . . .
It 's just a slideshow in my head . "
The debate about current combat photographs is less about their quality than whether it is appropriate or in good taste to publish them .
Last year the Associated Press caused a fire - storm of controversy by distributing a photograph from Afghanistan taken by Julie Jacobson .
Lacking any of the formal elegance of Burrows , just about in focus , it was unremarkable in every way – except that it showed 21 - year - old Lance Corporal Joshua Bernard in the process of dying from wounds after being hit in the legs by an RPG .
Bernard 's family were adamant that they did not want the picture published and were outraged when AP went ahead anyway on the grounds that it showed the human reality of war .
Filkins , Finkel and others witness events just as harrowing , and describe them in more explicit detail .
Their verbal records of these events became tributes for which they receive the gratitude of the bereaved and maimed .
Anyone who was there with a camera and an auto - wind could have taken a picture of the quality of Jacobson's .
Only a few supremely gifted – and courageous – individuals could have recorded the deaths of Miller or Reeves with the skill and power of Filkins or Finkel .
They are , to adapt a phrase of Martin Amis , " moral artists . "
The phrase is from an essay in The Moronic Inferno in which Amis claims that the non-fiction novel , as practised by Mailer and Capote , lacks " moral imagination .
Moral artistry .
The facts cannot be arranged to give them moral point .
There can be no art without moral point .
When the reading experience is over , you are left , simply , with murder – and with the human messiness and futility that attends all death . "
The essay is an old one , and the point can now be seen to contain its own limitation and , by extension , refutation .
We are moving beyond the non-fiction novel to different kinds of narrative art , different forms of cognition .
Loaded with moral and political point , narrative has been recalibrated to record , honour and protest the latest , historically specific instance of futility and mess .

FAQ and Release Notes
Rachel Maddow and Jeff Sharlet discuss the ties between C - Street , Pastor Rick Warren and an anti-gay bill in Uganda .
Good for Rachel for bringing some attention to this truly horrific story , unlike her cohort at MSNBC David Gregory who forgot to mention Uganda during the softball interview he gave Rick Warren on Meet the Press .
Mr. Warren responded by distancing himself from Martin Ssempa , but also by refusing to condemn the proposal saying , quote , “ It is not my personal calling as a pastor in America to comment or interfere in the political process of other nations . ”
Given with Rick Warren ‘s deep involvement with Pastor Ssempa on matters including gay rights and AIDS issues in Uganda , “ Newsweek ” magazine asked Pastor Rick Warren his opinion of this proposed “ kill the gays ” law in Uganda .
Do you remember Rick Warren ?
Him being selected to deliver the invocation at Barack Obama ‘s inauguration was the little black cloud that crawled inside the silver lining that day for a lot of Americans who support gay rights .
Who is supporting and promoting this legislation ?
Well , one of the proponents is a minister named Pastor Martin Ssempa .
He was a familiar face to American conservative Evangelicals , because Mr. Ssempa has been a frequent guest of Pastor Rick Warren at One Saddleback Church in California .
MADDOW : The government of Uganda is considering passing a law to execute gay people .
Execute as in by hanging a , quote , “ serial offender ” or an HIV - positive person who commits same sex act .
If enacted , this law would also impose a three - year prison sentence on anyone who knows of a gay person in the country but does n‘t report that gay person to the government within 24 hours .
In a moment , we‘ll speak with Jeff Sharlet who has written extensively about the secret of Evangelical religious organization called The Family .
We first started discussing The Family on this show when it emerged as a player in , not two , but three Republican sex scandals - those of South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford , Nevada Senator John Ensign and the alleged sex scandal involving former Mississippi Congressman Chip Pickering .
The Family , among other things , provides well - below market rent housing for a select group of members of Congress at its , until recently , nearly tax - exempt church on Capitol Hill - a house called C Street .
Jeff Sharlet is now reporting that there are n‘t just ties between American Evangelical Rick Warren and the “ kill the gays ” bill in Uganda .
He reports that , in fact , the president of Uganda and the legislator who introduced the “ kill the gays ” bill are more than just supported by American Evangelicals .
They are both members of The Family .
Joining us now is Jeff Sharlet , author of “ The Family : The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power . ”
He is also a contributing editor to “ Harper ‘s ” magazine .
Jeff , it ‘s nice to see you again .
Thanks for joining us .
JEFF SHARLET , AUTHOR , “ THE FAMILY ” : Good to be back , Rachel .
Thanks .
MADDOW : So who introduced the “ kill the gays ” bill and what ‘s his connection to The Family ?
SHARLET : It ‘s a member of parliament named David Bahati who has been very involved with a sort of conservative Evangelical revival in Uganda , very involved with a lot of American Evangelical groups and has also taken a leadership role in The Family ‘s Uganda operation through something called the African Student Leadership Program at the Uganda ‘s National Prayer Breakfast , which is an offshoot of the prayer breakfast The Family hosts every year here in the United States .
So he ‘s got this leadership role that puts him not just at the sort of the margin of things , but functioning as one of their key men on the ground in Uganda .
MADDOW : In the big picture , why is The Family interested in Uganda ?
Why are they interested in operating there ?
And what are their goals there ?
SHARLET : Well ,
The Family has always viewed its religious outreach , its worldwide spiritual offensive , as they describe it , in very clear geopolitical terms .
Uganda , right now , is an incredibly important country for world politics .
It ‘s functioning in many ways as a U.S. proxy with Sudan , with Congo , with Rwanda .
There ‘s oil in that general region and The Family needs to have a presence out there .
They ‘ve had that presence in Uganda since 1986 when they sent over a man to recruit Museveni who was then the new leader .
Didn‘t look like a bright Democratic spot in African leadership .
And they recruited him to be one of their main brothers , as they put it , for the whole continent .
MADDOW : So President Museveni in Uganda - he‘s not explicitly backing this horrendous bill .
But it is thought that he tacitly supports it , at least as far as I can tell , and that the ethics and integrity minister in his government is vocally in favor of this thing .
You ‘re saying he has Family connections that go back decades .
SHARLET : Yes , to 1986 .
And it ‘s hard to call it passive support when he ‘s coming out there and saying that homosexuality is a plot that ‘s sort of being imposed on Africa by Europe and that this is a time for Africans to rally together against sort of the foreign influence of homosexuality .
Now , Museveni is - the thought in Ugandan politics is that he ‘s sort of letting other guys take the lead on this .
But through his ethics minister , who is the main organizer of the National Prayer Breakfast in Uganda and it ‘s his right - hand man - he ‘s got a direct involvement .
And just last week , in fact , Museveni responded to questions from Uganda ‘s main newspaper , is he a part of The Family .
And his press secretary said , “ Well , I can‘t answer that . ”
But it certainly sounds like an organization the president would like to be a part of but only if they really , really hate homosexuals .
MADDOW : Wow .
That bastardization of that Groucho Marx quote is running through my head right now .
Back in July , Jeff , you uncovered a video and we played it on the show , of Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma , a Republican senator in the United States .
He ‘s got admitted association with C Street and The Family .
We played video that you found of him talking about his trips taken to Africa on the urging of leaders of The Family .
I just want a real quick clip to remind folks here .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
SEN .
JIM INHOFE ( R - OK ) :
If you ‘re a member of the United States Senate , in Africa , they think you are important , so you can always go to see the kings .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
MADDOW : You always get in to see the kings .
Is Sen .
Inhofe or any other American politician powerful enough among Ugandan politicians that they could derail this legislation if they wanted to ?
SHARLET : Well , working with colleagues , I ‘ve reached out to Inhofe ‘s office and he refuses to say a word about it despite the fact that he likes to boast of his incredibly close relationship with Ugandan politics .
He ‘s attended the Uganda National Prayer Breakfast .
He says , in fact , he has adopted the nation and he regularly travels over there in behalf of The Family .
Yet , he ‘s refused to condemn it .
Does he have the influence ?
We do n‘t know because he ‘s not exerting it .
It ‘s just like Rick Warren .
Could Rick Warren , who has designated Uganda a purpose - driven nation , make a difference ?
We do n‘t know because they ‘re not trying .
And I think that ‘s the kind of the bottom line with the American involvement .
There ‘s been a lot of American support for the guys who are promoting this bill and no pushback against this incredibly hateful piece of violence put in the legislation .
MADDOW : Jeff Sharlet is author of “ The Family : The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power . ”
Thanks , as always , for joining us , Jeff .
I really appreciate it .
SHARLET : Thanks , Rachel .
A SECRET Pentagon video showing an air strike in Afghanistan that killed dozens of children is set to be released by the fugitive founder of WikiLeaks .
Julian Assange , the Australian - born man behind the secretive web group , has been in hiding since last week following claims US authorities were '' hunting him ' ' .
US media reported that Pentagon investigators were trying to find him and discourage him from publishing confidential diplomatic cables allegedly leaked to him by a disillusioned intelligence analyst .
While Mr Assange 's location is unknown - he may still be in Australia - he has continued to send email and Twitter messages to supporters .
In an email sent on Tuesday , he suggested he would soon release a secret Pentagon video of a US air strike on Granai in western Afghanistan in May last year .
Just six weeks after launch , Microsoft 's Kin , the social phone we wanted to love , is dead .
Microsoft is ending its short life , sources close to Microsoft tell us .
Advertisement
There wo n't be a separate Kin product anymore .
Effective immediately , Andy Lees is shoving the entire Kin team into the core Windows Phone 7 team , so there will just be one big group to focus on Windows Phone 7 .
Advertisement
The major reason ?
Sales .
Microsoft never confirmed ( or denied ) that only 500 Kins were sold , but it 's clear that the response has been completely underwhelming .
Otherwise , why kill a project that was in development for years after just a few weeks ?
( And cost millions . )
A major reason it bombed , besides the weird , non-specific faux hipster marketing ?
Price .
Verizon priced
Kin's monthly service like a smartphone , even though it was n't one .
Even cutting the device price drastically did n't alleviate the high cost of the monthly plan .
( The confusing Kin , a Windows Phone 7 Phone by Microsoft flustercluck branding did n't help . )
Advertisement
The few people that did buy a Kin will still get support from Microsoft , but the future of promised software updates is up in the air .
It seems safe to say , though , Kin is n't going to evolve into the things we hoped it would .
At best , we have to hope the things we did love — Kin Studio — will make it into Windows Phone in some guise .

Microsoft 's official statement on the matter , for what it 's worth , is vague but telling :
" We have made the decision to focus on our Windows Phone 7 launch and we will not ship KIN in Europe this fall as planned .
Additionally , we are integrating our KIN team with the Windows Phone 7 team , incorporating valuable ideas and technologies from KIN into future Windows Phone releases .
We will continue to work with Verizon in the U.S. to sell current KIN phones . " [ emphasis mine ]

It 's not the first major innovative E&D project Microsoft 's slaughtered in recent months , but it 's the first that 's actually made it to market before being gutted .
Verizon , for the record , says " The phone is still an important part of our portfolio . "

All in all , still kind of astounding .
WASHINGTON , May 19 ( Reuters ) - Senator Blanche Lincoln , a key voice for financial reform , was forced on Tuesday into a Democratic runoff election in Arkansas and lost leverage for her plan to force big banks to spin off swaps desks .
She was expected to be the vote - leader in the primary and possibly win the nomination outright .
Instead , Lieutenant Governor Bill Halter ran neck - and - neck with her in a race colored by anti-Washington sentiment .
Her swap reform proposal would cost a handful of big U.S. banks billions of dollars in revenue .
It is one of the final issues in a mammoth Wall Street reform bill pending in the Senate .
The swaps - desk language was a hallmark of Lincoln - authored legislation to bring the $ 615 trillion market in over - the - counter derivatives under federal regulation .
While Lincoln said her proposal would “ ensure that banks get back to the business of banking , ” there was broad opposition to the idea within the financial industry and among some Obama administration officials .
Analysts said she probably would not prevail on the issue , even if she won the three - way Democratic primary .
They expected efforts to strip the language would begin immediately after the primary .
One alternative would be the so - called Volcker language to restrict derivatives trading by banks .
Banking Committee chairman Senator Chris Dodd proposed one resolution on Tuesday : send the swaps - desk proposal to a two - year review before a council filled with critics , effectively killing it .
Lincoln refused to soften her proposal .
In an election night speech , she said , “ Big Wall Street banks are unhappy with me because I am fighting to make them stop making those risky trades that have happened in the dark of the night . ”
Arkansas political analyst Blake Rutherford said Lincoln probably will have less political capital as an endangered incumbent .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid aims for a final vote on the financial reform bill in the next few days , with enough Republican support to assure passage .
At the same time the Senate will focus on the financial reform bill , Lincoln must prepare for a run-off election on June 8 with Halter .

German government crisis intensified by president ’s resignation
By Ulrich Rippert and Peter Schwarz
3 June 2010
The unexpected and sudden resignation of President Horst Köhler on Monday afternoon has further intensified the crisis of the German government .
It is the second resignation by a top - serving politician in just one week .
Five days earlier , Hesse Minister President Roland Koch ( CDU ) gave up his post in a deliberate affront to Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) .
But Köhler ’s resignation is much more significant .
Although the functions of the German president are mainly of a ceremonial nature , as head of state he nevertheless embodies the authority of the state and of the entire political system .
His task is often seen as maintaining people ’s confidence in the state and official politics in times of social and political crisis .
For this reason , the very manner in which Köhler resigned — without forewarning , without preparation and with immediate effect — created a political shock .
Even the chancellor , the foreign minister and Köhler ’s statutory replacement — the president of the upper house of parliament , Jens Böhrnsen ( SPD , Social Democratic Party ) — were only informed two hours in advance .
Köhler then explained his decision in just three short paragraphs at a press conference called at short notice , and left his office immediately .
He mentioned as the reason for his resignation the massive public criticism of an interview about the Bundeswehr deployment in Afghanistan .
On his way back from a visit to German troops in Afghanistan , the president had connected international military operations to Germany ’s economic interests .
He literally said that “ a country of our size , with its export - based economy and associated dependence upon foreign trade , has to realise that , when in doubt , or in emergency situations , it is also necessary to deploy our military forces to protect our interests . ”
The defence of economic interests by military means has been an established practice for some time , but no leading politician has previously stated this for fear of aggravating public opinion .
The media heavily criticised Köhler for doing just that , depicting him as a “ babbler ” , not mature enough for his position and unable to control his own remarks .
In his resignation speech , Köhler did indeed admit that his statement “ could have led to misinterpretation ” , but nevertheless considered the critique as lèse - majesté .
“ This criticism is entirely unjustified .
It shows no respect for my office ” , he said in justification of his departure .
The entire resignation episode was suffused with an atmosphere of panic , such as occurs only in times of acute social crises .
The journalists who were present were so bewildered that not one of them could even pose a question before Köhler took his wife ’s hand and left .
The resulting press reactions were indignant .
“ Probably no one has ever done so much damage to the office of the federal presidency as Horst Köhler did this Monday ” , commented Kurt Kister , the deputy chief editor of the Süddeutsche Zeitung , under the headline “ Köhler ’s desertion ” .
“ He tossed away the highest position in the country just because he felt insulted . ”
Other newspapers responded in similar fashion .
Since then , there has been no end to speculations about what could have led to Köhler ’s sudden step - down .
His thin - skinned character was given as a reason , along with his difficult personality and that he was never a trained politician .
Personality characteristics may have played a role , but they cannot ultimately explain why Köhler , after five years in public office , suddenly gave up his post .
To really understand such a panicked action , one has to consider the surrounding circumstances — a climate of uncertainty , tension and great anxiety .
The resignation of Köhler is a manifestation of the crisis of the government of Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and Guido Westerwelle ( FDP , Free Democratic Party ) , who “ invented ” him as a president .
The previously publicly unknown financial expert , who had made a career in the Finance Ministry , as president of the savings banks and head of the IWF , was chosen to stand for president by the then leaders of the Opposition in 2004 during a private meeting in Westerwelle ’s flat .
The idea was that he would pave the way for a conservative - liberal coalition to replace the incumbent Social Democratic - Green coalition .
In the end , Köhler was elected , but the conservative - liberal coalition did not materialise .
In the general election of 2005 , it lacked sufficient majority votes , so Merkel formed a grand coalition with the SPD .
When , in 2009 , the CDU eventually did form a coalition with the FDP , they were faced with a barrage of economic , social and foreign policy problems , which they were neither prepared for , nor able to address .
The deepest international economic crisis since the 1930s shattered all the certainties upon which German politics had been based since the end of the Second World War : orientation to Europe , close ties to the US , social consensus , a strong currency .
Even the European Union and its common currency , central to the strategy of German foreign policy over the last 20 years , are now in question .
Chancellor Merkel has reacted to this with zig - zag course of action , bringing upon herself criticisms of being indecisive and ineffective .
For a long time , she opposed financial help for highly indebted Greece , thus putting the existence of the euro at risk , only to make a sudden U - turn and agree to a bailout package of the unprecedented sum of €750 billion .
And while she had anchored a public borrowing limit in the constitution under the Grand Coalition , she has hesitated until now to implement the concomitant public spending cuts .
In contrast to her predecessor , Gerhard Schröder , she committed herself to a policy of close cooperation with the US , only to find that economic antagonisms with the transatlantic power are getting ever sharper .
Horst Köhler acted as a political and economic advisor to Merkel , but was just as clueless as she was .
At one point he would speak in favour of stringent public spending cuts , at another point he would rage in a populist way about the “ monstrous ” financial markets .
In between were long periods of silence .
Leading civil servants deserted his office , and there were numerous reports about the chaotic conditions in the presidential office .
Meanwhile , the star of the CDU / Liberal coalition was plunging like a falling comet .
It has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament , and support in opinion polls has fallen to 40 percent .
Conflicts within the government parties have intensified .
In this climate of general crisis , Köhler announced his resignation , thus delivering yet another blow to the chancellor .
According to information on Spiegel Online , Merkel was shocked by Köhler ’s decision , and by the obstinacy that he showed .
She had tried in a telephone call “ with unusually dramatic words ” to persuade him to change his mind .
She warned him that such an unprepared and unplanned step could trigger a constitutional crisis .
The confidence of citizens in the highest state office and in politics in general could be badly damaged , she emphasised .
She told Köhler that he was laying himself open to attack , if people could n’t understand his reasons for resigning .
She implored him “ many times ” to rethink his decision .
But he remained adamant .
It is hard to predict how this political crisis will develop further .
It is not to be ruled out that the CDU / Liberal coalition , or even Merkel herself , will fall by the wayside .
In leading industrial circles , there are loud voices calling for the return of the SPD or the Green Party to political responsibility to firmly implement social spending cuts .
In any case , such crises are dangerous , as long as the working masses have no political voice of their own .
The last years of the Weimar Republic were characterised by the decline and collapse of the bourgeois parties , until the economic , military and political elite finally decided to make Hitler chancellor .
The failure of the SPD and the KPD ( German Communist Party ) , who had split and paralysed the working class , instead of uniting it against the Nazis , made this possible .
Today , the SPD , the Greens and the Left Party are once again determined to defend the capitalist system with every means at their disposal .
They are prepared to take up government responsibility , to carry out budget cuts and to implement the related spending cuts against workers , the unemployed and pensioners .
So long as the working class does not intervene independently , the “ solution ” of the crisis will inevitably take on an increasingly reactionary and authoritarian form .
The public debate about the introduction of “ citizen ’s labour ” — a form of forced labour to be imposed on unemployment benefit recipients — is a sign of this , as are the proposals being made for massive cuts in social spending .
And discussion about deploying the military in defence of national economic interests , kicked off by Horst Köhler , will continue after his departure .
The resignation of Köhler , the trailblazer for the CDU / Liberal coalition , is symptomatic of a deep crisis in ruling political circles .
But this affords no grounds for complacency .
Rather , it should act as a spur to build a new party that shows a way out of the crisis in the interests of working people .
That is only possible on the basis of a programme that replaces capitalism with socialist society , a society that organises production to meet social needs and not the profits of banking and business concerns .
Unease this morning .
Is Labour as serious as they pretend about a progressive alliance ?
Talking to some high - ups on the progressive wing of the Lib Dems , they worry that some the Labour chief negotiators are just going through the motions while putting serious obstacles in the way .
They fear many in Labour agree with the neanderthal tendency represented by David Blunkett – no deal is better than giving true proportional representation to the Lib Dems .
This is odd and unexpected : they say Lords Mandelson and Adonis are extraordinarily positive and willing to give most things on the radical Lib Dem agenda .
Surprisingly it is those you might think on the left – Harriet Harman , Ed Miliband and Ed Balls who are foot - dragging .
This team of negotiators claim Labour can't guarantee to get real PR through the party and none seem keen on it anyway .
Their attitude , say my informants , is far from welcoming .
The suspicion is they would prefer to sit on the opposition bench and watch the Lib Dems be slaughtered by tying themselves to the Conservatives .
In this febrile moment everyone is jumpy as political life and death negotiations such as these throw up dark suspicions and intense anxiety on all sides .
The Lib Dems may be badly misreading Labour 's true intent in which case Labour 's negotiating team had better hug them tight and reassure them .
But if the Labour team really is trying to make a deal impossible , they are making a historic mistake .
Worse , they are betraying the people they stand for – every pensioner and poor family who always stand better protected by a left of centre government – however difficult that may be to construct .
Is Labour 's fatal fascination for a quiet life of internal debate ( or strife ) on the opposition benches getting the better of them ?
They should remember there is no guarantee they would n't be out of power for a long time , but the call of the wild is never far from their tribal instincts .
• More election comment from Cif at the polls
Huckabee said “ the sad thing ” was how much he loved campaigning — the constant stimulation , the endless opportunity to interact with people , the sport .
“ He ’s incredibly competitive , ” Rex Nelson told me .
“ Never overlook that .
If Mike Huckabee were to sit down at this table and play me in a game of checkers , he would beat my brains out .
He ’s really , really , really competitive , to the point of competing against his staff , competing against his wife . ”
But Huckabee was discouraged by the last election , throughout which he felt relegated to the periphery by other Republicans with more money and less substance .
“ It ’s almost like a reality show , ” he said .
“ It ’s who are we going to vote off the island ?
And you vote them off not because they ’re not capable of leading the island but because you ’ve found someone more entertaining . ”
I could n’t help thinking of a certain former governor of Alaska , and told him so .
He would n’t say anything , but he stared at the floor and laughed ruefully , shaking his head .
A few months ago , Huckabee was eating lunch at Blue Fin , a restaurant in New York — a “ city of flamboyant billionaires , ” as he once called it — where he spends half of every week , taping his show .
It has been an unexpected hit , and though many of the guests are low - profile or wacky ( the psychic Kreskin has made several appearances ) , Huckabee has also had some big gets .
On a recent episode , he politely discussed childhood obesity with Michelle Obama .
“ My view is that , if I host a show , the words ‘ host ’ and ‘ guest ’ imply something , ” he said , setting his Loro Piana overcoat on the banquette .
“ If I were to have you in my home , I would treat you with a certain level of civility .
When you walk in the door , I would n’t say , ‘ Let me tell you about you and your crazy left - wing . . . ’
You would be , like , ‘ I think I ’m leaving now , this guy needs some therapy . ’
So why would we do that in a public forum on television ? ”
A bad host , he said , was someone like David Letterman .
“ I just found him to be the most detached and — I ’m sorry to say this — arrogant jerk .
He was not warm . ”
( Huckabee had no similar critique of his Fox colleagues , some of whom can be less than courtly with their dissenting guests . )
“ Huckabee ” has the aesthetics of a local - access show : the host ends every episode playing bass with his house band , the Little Rockers , which is composed of fellow Fox staffers .
“ What he does well is break the rules of cable news , ” Bill Shine , the senior vice - president of the network , said .
“ The show is about him ; it ’s built around him , and not around the genre of cable news .
Sometimes I look at the guest list and think , Wow , Neil Sedaka ? ”
Huckabee has been in broadcasting since he was fourteen , when the man who ran the local radio station in Hope gave him a job reading news and weather .
Three years later , he took his wife - to - be , Janet McCain , on their first date , to a truck stop , after he covered one of her high - school basketball games for the station .
Huckabee continued working in radio while he and Janet attended Ouachita Baptist University , in Arkadelphia , Arkansas , where he majored in religion .
( They married after their freshman year . )
When he became a minister , he set up a twenty - four - hour local cable station that aired his sermons .
Huckabee has long “ believed that part of my calling was to use the media as a communication vessel for the Gospel , ” as he wrote in “ A Simple Christmas . ”
It was Huckabee ’s ease in front of a camera that enabled him to stay in the 2008 Presidential campaign as long as he did .
“ In March of ’07 , he said to me , ‘ This campaign is going to be over before it starts , ’ because he was dismally not raising money , ” Fedewa said .
“ He was staying at Motel 8s . ”
At the end of 2007 , Huckabee had raised less than nine million dollars , compared with Mitt Romney ’s fifty - four million — which he augmented with thirty - five million of his own money — and Hillary Clinton ’s hundred and seven million .
“ It ’s O.K . I did n’t marry you for your parking karma . ”

To compensate , Huckabee gave nearly twenty television interviews every morning for four months , from the run-up to the Iowa caucuses until he left the race .
“ We estimate that was two hundred million dollars in free media , ” Fedewa said .
“ The media was his base . ”
The strategy was to make Huckabee available to everyone , not just CNN and the 700 Club but “ The Colbert Report ” and Rolling Stone — “ the shows that your opponents will be too scared to go on , ” as Bob Wickers , one of Huckabee ’s campaign consultants , put it .
Huckabee is not uncomfortable around Democrats or comedians ; he is as happy talking to Jon Stewart about abortion as he is interviewing Gayle Haggard about her marriage , as he did on a recent episode of his own show .
And liberals tend to like him in return .
Even if you find his politics repugnant , you can still find yourself drawn in by his relentless niceness .
It does n’t mean you ’d vote for him , but it might mean you ’d have him on your show .
Huckabee was elected lieutenant - governor of Arkansas in 1993 .
In 1996 , Governor Jim Guy Tucker , a Democrat , resigned in disgrace when he was convicted of arranging nearly three million dollars in fraudulent loans .
On the day Huckabee was supposed to be sworn in as Tucker ’s replacement , Tucker called to say that he ’d decided to appeal his conviction .
Huckabee threatened to instigate impeachment proceedings if Tucker failed to step aside .
In the midst of the ensuing crisis , Huckabee gave an impromptu report to the media and the citizens of Arkansas , an impassioned speech that effectively established him as the governor .
In “ Character , ” he wrote that it was “ as clear an example as I ever expect to see of God ’s divine providence .
It was n’t my political skills or anything else of my own doing that had brought me to this moment .
Only God could have done this . ”
Huckabee told me about experiences he ’s had with divine inspiration : “ There ’ve been times when a thought would come to me . . . and as soon as I wrote it or said it I stepped back and thought , Whoa , pretty darn good . ”
I asked how he knew he was n’t just smart .
“ Well , nobody thinks that , ” he said , laughing .
“ Have n’t you read the blogs ?
I ’m a complete idiot .
I ’m not smart enough to run for President . ”
Huckabee invokes God constantly .
Yet he feels that his religiosity is overemphasized .
“ I ’m not one - dimensional , ” he told me .
“ I was the governor of Arkansas for ten years !
The lieutenant - governor for three !
To say that I stepped out of a pulpit last Sunday and said , ‘ Hey , I think I ’ll be President ! ’
No , I ’ve paid my dues . ”
Many people who have worked with Huckabee insist that his politics are influenced far more by pragmatism than by religion .
Huckabee ’s Presidential campaign manager , Chip Saltsman ( who got into trouble after the election for distributing a song titled “ Barack the Magic Negro ” to the Republican National Committee ) , said , “ The ‘ religion guy ’ was foisted on him by the media .
It was frustrating , a little bit .
We got ‘ former preacher ’ as much as we got ‘ former governor . ’ ”
Huckabee had more executive experience than any other candidate , Republican or Democratic , in the 2008 campaign ( with the exception of Tommy Thompson , who dropped out of the race after the Iowa straw poll ) .
“ And yet you did n’t hear a Chris Matthews saying , ‘ Governor , I want to talk to you about your education policy ; you did some innovative things , ’ ” he said .
“ No .
It was , ‘ O.K. , you were a Baptist preacher .
Let ’s talk about evolution . ’
It ’s , like , ‘ Are you an idiot ?
Is that the only thing you can ask me ? ’ ”
When Wolf Blitzer pushed Huckabee to say whether he believed in evolution , at a debate in New Hampshire in June of 2007 , Huckabee expressed exasperation that the question “ would even be asked of somebody running for President — I ’m not planning on writing the curriculum for an eighth - grade science book . ”
He said that the question was unfair , because it “ asked us in a simplistic manner whether or not we believed , in my view , whether there ’s a God or not . ”
As President , though , he would appoint the Secretary of Education .
And it is difficult to comprehend what is unfair about the question when he has written , “ Everything you do and believe in is directed by your answer to the ultimate question :
Is there a God ?
It all comes down to that single issue . ”
According to Huckabee , a person who believes God created man has a world view that is “ absolutely irreconcilable ” with that of someone who believes man created God .
And “ either by numbers or persuasion , one side of this polarized culture will defeat the other in setting public policy . ”
This is the defining paradox of Huckabee : his adamant resistance to being branded a zealot paired with his insistence that faith defines character and , consequently , has an essential place in government .
Some of this has to do with class sensitivity .
Huckabee would n’t mind being characterized as a Christian intellectual , but he is vigilant against people ’s using his background as a pastor to characterize him as a “ redneck from southwest Arkansas , ” as Nelson put it .
“ For somebody who plays at the high levels he plays at — the highest level , being a real contender for President — he is pretty sensitive . ”
The Arkansas press often taunted Huckabee for being thin - skinned , and Nelson said that “ some of that was legitimate . ”
Huckabee was a radical departure from what Arkansans were used to in their politicians .
He was a Republican governor — only the third since Reconstruction — in a state that had been dominated by Democrats , and by the Clintons in particular .
When he was elected lieutenant - governor , people regularly cleared the elevator at the statehouse when he got in ; his Democratic colleagues nailed the door to his office shut before he took occupancy .
There was also the matter of his wife .
“ Janet , she was different , ” Nelson told me .
“ She parachutes and sky - dives , rode jet skis down the river .
I think the snootier elements of old Little Rock , shall we say , wanted someone who was doing lunch at the country club and attending Junior League events . ”
Janet Huckabee was determined to make her mark as first lady by updating the Governor ’s Mansion .
During the renovation , the Huckabees lived in a trailer they installed on the property — which Huckabee sees as evidence of his frugality and populism , and which many other people mocked as impossibly hick .
“ That was not considered the classy thing to do , ” Don Bingham , who was the Mansion administrator under Huckabee , said .
“ I mean , living in a triple - wide ?
The governor ?
That ’s so typical barefoot - and - pregnant for the South . . . .
They were crucified for it . ”
Huckabee was also criticized for accepting personal donations — suits , furniture , a pair of thirty - seven - hundred - dollar cowboy boots , a chain saw — when he took office .
Many people attributed this to “ the preacher mentality : you ’re used to being pounded with gifts — ‘ pounded ’ is the old Southern word — and there ’s nothing wrong with it , it ’s not viewed as a moral failing , ” Max Brantley , the editor of the liberal weekly the Arkansas Times , said .
Huckabee faced twenty hearings before the state ethics commission during his time as governor .
He contended that he was being unfairly harassed because he was a Republican , and , in 2002 , he sued the commission on the ground that its rules were unconstitutionally vague .
“ Mike Huckabee sued the state ethics committee for the right to receive gifts ! ” Brantley said .
“ It just struck me as unseemly . ” ( Brantley ’s wife was appointed to a judgeship by Bill Clinton , and he personally filed several of the complaints heard by the committee . )
Brenda Turner , who was Huckabee ’s chief of staff during the decade he was governor , described the suit differently : “ We were just trying to say , Let ’s really put this in writing so we can comply , because we ca n’t comply with a moving target . ”
She went on , “ We would ask them , how do you want us to report ?
Then we would do that .
And then we ’d be chastised for doing it that way .
Think of this : you can write whatever complaint you want and mail it in and he would have to defend that , taking time and money . ”
Turner suspects that Huckabee will not run for President in 2012 .
“ He ’s actually living the dream that he ’s always had , starting on radio at fourteen and loving TV like he does , ” she said .
“ If he runs , it would have to be a calling , and it could n’t just come from supporters ; he ’d have to feel the Lord was calling him .
I do n’t feel like he has that urgency . ”
Turner worked for Huckabee for sixteen years , starting as a volunteer when he was her minister at Beech Street First Baptist Church , in Texarkana , but did not stay on for his run at the Presidency .
The reason , she told me , was that she was drained from a decade of defending him within the state .
She attributes the antagonism to a kind of xenophobia .
“ This man did n’t come from a business background , he did n’t come from a law background , he was a pastor , and that was somehow mysterious , ” Turner said .
“ My personal feeling is what we do n’t understand we fear .
And what we fear we seek to destroy . ”
As governor of Arkansas , Huckabee successfully championed laws that prevented gay people from becoming foster parents and banned gay adoptions .
“ Children are not puppies — this is not a time to see if we can experiment and find out how does this work , ” Huckabee told a student journalist at the College of New Jersey in April .
“ You do n’t go ahead and accommodate every behavioral pattern that is against the ideal .
That would be like saying , ‘ Well , there are a lot of people who like to use drugs , so let ’s go ahead and accommodate those who want to use drugs .
There are some people who believe in incest , so we should accommodate them . ’ ” These comments proved unpopular .
On his Web site , Huckabee accused his interviewer of trying to “ grossly distort ” and “ sensationalize my well known and hardly unusual views ” about homosexuality .
The student publication then posted the audiotape of the interview online .
Huckabee had not been misquoted .
Huckabee does not like to be thought of as a homophobe .
“ I ’ve had people who worked for me who are homosexuals , ” he insists .
“ And I do n’t walk around thinking , Oh , I pity them so much .
I accept them as who they are !
It ’s not like somehow their sin is so much worse than mine . ”
In a recent interview , Katie Couric told him that the Arkansas state representative Kathy Webb , a lesbian from Little Rock , had said , “ Huckabee does n’t seem to have a whole lot of tolerance and good will for gay people . ”
Huckabee seemed surprised .
“ It ’s not personal , ” he replied .
“ I could argue that people who want to change marriage are angry at me for wanting to keep it like it is ! ”
“ I love my mistress , but I must say I resent the leash . ”

But Huckabee does n’t just want to leave things the way they are ; he wants to change the Constitution to specifically prohibit gay people from getting married .
He has called homosexuality “ sinful and unnatural ” and is fond of amusing audiences with the witticism “ It ’s Adam and Eve , not Adam and Steve . ”
One afternoon in Jerusalem , while Huckabee was eating a chocolate croissant in the lounge of the Crowne Plaza Hotel , I asked him to explain his rationale for opposing gay rights .
“ I do believe that God created male and female and intended for marriage to be the relationship of the two opposite sexes , ” he said .
“ Male and female are biologically compatible to have a relationship .
We can get into the ick factor , but the fact is two men in a relationship , two women in a relationship , biologically , that does n’t work the same . ”
I asked him if he had any arguments that did n’t have to do with God or ickiness .
“ There are some pretty startling studies that show if you want to end poverty it ’s not education and race , it ’s monogamous marriage , ” he said .
“ Many studies show that children who grow up in a healthy environment where they have both a mother and a father figure have both a healthier outlook and a different perspective from kids who do n’t have the presence of both . ”
In fact , a twenty - five - year study recently published by the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that children brought up by lesbians were better adjusted than their peers .
And , of course , nobody has been able to study how kids fare with married gay parents .
“ You know why ? ” Huckabee said .
“ Because no culture in the history of mankind has ever tried to redefine marriage . ”
But in the Old Testament polygamy was commonplace .
The early Christians considered marriage an arrangement for those without the self - discipline to live in chastity , as Christ did .
Marriage was not deemed a sacrament by the Church until the twelfth century .
And , before 1967 , marriage was defined in much of the United States as a relationship between a man and a woman of the same race .
Regardless of the past , would n’t Huckabee be curious to know whether allowing gay people to marry had a positive or negative effect on children and society ?
“ No , not really .
Why would I be ? ” he said , and laughed .
Because saying that something ought to be a certain way simply because that ’s the way it supposedly has always been is an awful lot like saying “ because we said so . ”
And Huckabee is supposed to be the guy who questions everything .
In February , the Huckabees bought a place in Miramar Beach , near Pensacola , and Huckabee changed his voter registration to Florida Republican .
They still have a big house in North Little Rock , which they renovated after they left the Governor ’s Mansion , but Florida has certain advantages : the taxes are lower than in Arkansas , and it ’s easy to get to New York City .
It could also be politically advantageous to have a bulkhead in the Sunshine State should Huckabee decide to run for President in 2012 .
Huckabee says , “ The dogs like it there in the winter . ”
Lucrative and enjoyable as his television career has proved , it remains to be seen whether life in the private sector will be sufficiently stimulating for Mike Huckabee .
Janet Huckabee says that her husband is “ a workaholic . ”
Huckabee ’s sister , Pat Harris , told me , “ He was always the everything kid : student council , every club — from junior high on , he just sort of stood out .
Mr. Go-Getter .
My dad always said , ‘ Go and work the room , ’ and Mike did .
He had to be busy .
And you know what ?
He has n’t changed . ”
“ I do n’t know how to relax , ” Huckabee admitted one spring evening when he was having dinner with his wife at Rocky ’s Diner , in a strip mall in North Little Rock .
“ A cruise is best , ” Janet , who was wearing a basketball jacket and eating jalapeño poppers , said .
The Huckabees have been married for thirty - six years .
They went to school together in Hope , beginning in seventh grade .
“ We started dating at seventeen , got married at eighteen , ” she said .
“ What were we thinking back then ? ”
“ We were n’t ! ” Huckabee replied .
“ We were n’t thinking at all . ”
“ Our parents must not have been thinking , either . ”
“ If my kids had come to me and they were eighteen or nineteen and said we ’re getting married , I ’d have said you ’re crazy , ” he concluded .
A couple approached and asked to have their picture taken with the former governor .
“ I ’m a huge fan ! ” said the man , who was wearing a trucker ’s cap .
“ Did you run the marathon this year , Governor ? ”
“ No , ” Huckabee said , and sighed .
“ I wish I could .
I love running marathons . ”
“ You do n’t need to be doing that , ” Janet said .
“ You can run three or four miles .
That ’s O.K .
But you do not need to be training for a marathon . ”

The former vice - president suffered his last heart attack in February 2010
Former US Vice - President Dick Cheney is expected to remain in hospital over the weekend for tests after falling ill .
He was admitted to George Washington University Hospital on Friday after feeling unwell , spokesperson Peter Long said .
The 69 - year - old Republican politician has suffered five heart attacks in the past 32 years .
It is not clear if Mr Cheney 's visit is related to his previous heart troubles .
Mr Cheney felt ill and visited his doctor at the hospital , who then advised him to stay for further tests , according to a statement from his office issued late on Friday .
No further details have been released .
The former vice - president , who has had numerous health scares , suffered his last heart attack in February 2010 .
He was fitted with a pacemaker in 2001 .
Mr Cheney was vice - president under George W Bush .

It seems like it 's time to whip this one out of the archives : in an April , 2009 hearing , Joe Barton asked Energy Secretary Steven Chu where oil comes from .
Chu delivered a brief , accurate explanation grounded in science , but Barton -- presumably because Chu did n't say God created oil on the second day -- thought he 'd stumped Chu anyway .
So he went on Twitter and started bragging that he'd " baffled " Chu :
If Chu was baffled at anything , it was the fact that Republicans would make a fool like Joe Barton their top person on the energy committee .
Indeed , if the GOP wins a majority this November , Joe Barton will be the chairman of the House Energy Committee .

27 Avatar Questions , Answered By The Movie 's Designers
We had a ton of random questions about the making of this film , and luckily the designers had a ton of really thoughtful , interesting answers .

We were also lucky enough to hear from designer Scott Patton with Stan Winston Studio , who pointed us to these amazing digital sculpts his team did for the Na'Vi and other characters :
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst .
Everyone keeps calling it the Great Recession , as though they are not too depressed about the prolonged backslide in gross domestic product , which only recently resumed its upward climb .
Backslide may describe what happened to the market economy , but it does n’t capture what ’s happening now in families hit hardest by persistent unemployment .
They are suffering not a temporary setback , but a permanent reduction in their ability to develop their own and their children ’s capabilities .
Put in terms that economists are fond of , their human capital is being … decapitalized .
A recent article in The Atlantic by Don Peck eloquently describes the negative long - term effects of unemployment , which are particularly serious for the less - educated .
Isabel Sawhill of the Brookings Institution describes the “ permanent scarring ” of workers ’ economic prospects .
The economists Timothy Smeeding and Jeffrey Thompson , summarizing recent trends in inequality and poverty , also emphasize the plight of those who lack both financial and human capital .
Data on the percentage of individuals living in poverty have not yet been released for 2009 .
Ms. Sawhill summarizes efforts to project future trends this way : “ bad news on poverty , worse to come . ”
Her projections , developed in conjunction with Emily Monea , suggest that poverty rates for children could reach 25 percent by 2011 .
Research shows that child poverty reduces later educational attainment , perpetuating deprivation .
Reduced high - school graduation rates lead to higher crime rates and increased incarceration costs .
In California , as in many other states , it costs more to send someone to prison than to college .
The Great Deprivation is the result not just of increased income inequality compounded by persistent unemployment .
It reflects the limits of public policies designed for a bygone era .
A significant increase in the average duration of unemployment has rendered our system of unemployment insurance inadequate .
Future benefit extensions have become a bone of partisan contention .
Young workers , with limited work histories , often do n’t qualify for unemployment insurance at all .
Meanwhile , the only federal cash welfare system for single parents , revised in the mid-1990s to push recipients into paid employment , is so restrictive that many of the eligible do n’t even bother to apply .
A recent article in Bloomberg Businessweek by James Warren , finding low welfare rolls mysterious , suggests that many states may be more interested in cutting spending than extending aid .
In a cruel double - whammy , cuts in child - care assistance have forced some low - income mothers out of employment .
The fiscal stimulus provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 aided safety - net programs such as unemployment insurance and the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program .
But plans for a second round of fiscal stimulus face considerable opposition because of increased budget deficits .
Such deficits are easier to measure than human - capital deficits .
But it ’s not clear that they are more economically harmful in the long run .
Maybe a well - developed set of “ human capital accounts ” could improve our overall cost - benefit analysis .
Then , instead of merely cataloging deprivation , we could quantify the Great Human Decapitalization .
And heads might roll .
Hundreds of thousands of college students all over the United States have just graduated and are getting ready for their first taste of the real world .
Unfortunately for them , the real world is not always easy and it is not always fair .
In fact , for large numbers of recent college graduates , the transition to a world of high unemployment , brutal student loan payments and lowered expectations can be extremely sobering .
But the truth is that we have taught these young people to have a completely unrealistic view of the future .
We have told them to take out gigantic student loans without worrying about how they are going to pay them back , we have told them that if they get good grades and do everything “ right ” that the system will reward them with secure , fulfilling careers , and we have made high school and college so “ soft and cushy ” that most of these young Americans find that they do n’t have the discipline and the work ethic to make it when they actually do get out into society .
So needless to say , the first six months after graduation can be a complete shock for many college graduates .
In a piece recently published on MSN Money , journalist Joe Queenan described the tough environment that 2010 college graduates are being thrown into as they enter the real world ….
They will enter an economy where roughly 17 % of people aged 20 through 24 do not have a job , and where two million college graduates are unemployed .
They will enter a world where they will compete tooth and nail for jobs as waitresses , pizza delivery men , file clerks , bouncers , trainee busboys , assistant baristas , interns at bodegas .
But waiting tables , delivering pizzas or greeting customers at the local Wal - Mart is not what most college graduates signed up for when they invested tens of thousands of dollars and four years ( if not longer ) of their lives in an education .
Unfortunately , that is where our economy is at today .
“ Good jobs ” are very few and far between and those freshly graduating from college are finding themselves suddenly thrust into an extremely competitive job market .
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , in March the national rate of unemployment in the U.S. was 9.7 % , but for Americans younger than 25 years of age it was 18.8 % .
In fact , according to a recent Pew Research Center study , approximately 37 % of all Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 have either been unemployed or underemployed at some point during this recession .
But what makes things even worse for college graduates is that so many of them are coming out of school with absolutely crushing student debt loads .
Today , approximately two - thirds of all U.S. college students graduate with student loans .
But it is n’t just that they have student loans .
The loan balances that many of these students are graduating with these days are absolutely obscene .
The Project on Student Debt estimates that 206,000 U.S. college students graduated with more than $ 40,000 in student loan debt in 2008 .
Using 2008 dollars as a baseline , that represents a ninefold increase over the number of students graduating with that amount of debt in 1996 .
Most college students do n’t think much about all of the debt that they are accumulating while they are in school .
But once they get out , the sudden realization that they have gotten themselves into student loan payments that they cannot possibly handle can be completely demoralizing .
The New York Times recently profiled Cortney Munna – a recent college graduate who has not been able to get a “ good job ” and who now finds herself in student loan hell .
She recently told the New York Times that she would be more than glad to give back her education if she could just get out of all this debt … .
“ I do n’t want to spend the rest of my life slaving away to pay for an education I got for four years and would happily give back . ”
In recent years , millions of young college graduates have found that the “ great education ” that they thought they were getting actually does n’t get them very far at all in the real world .
In fact , they often find themselves taking jobs where they work right next to other people their age who never even went to college .
So a lot of young college graduates find themselves wishing that they could just “ return ” their education and get all that money back .
But there is no walking away from student loan debt .
The truth is that federal bankruptcy law makes it nearly impossible to discharge student loan debts .
Basically , once you get into student loan hell there is no escape .
So now we have hundreds of thousands of college graduates that ca n’t get good jobs and that have brutal student loan payments that they can’t possibly handle .
No wonder so many of them seem so angry and depressed .
But the funny thing is that so many that are still in college are so unbelievably optimistic about the future .
Edwin Koc , director of research for the National Association of Colleges and Employers says that those approaching college graduation are an extremely confident bunch … .
“ Over 90 percent think they have a perfect résumé .
The percentage who think they will have a job in hand three months after graduation is now 57 percent .
They ’re still supremely confident in themselves . ”
So have we done a good job of teaching them to have confidence in themselves or have we done them a disservice by allowing so many of them to live in complete denial ?
The truth is that the U.S. economy is in the process of collapsing , and we need to prepare our young people for the tough times that are ahead .
Life is going to require an extreme amount of hard work and discipline in the years ahead , and unfortunately those qualities are not in great supply among young Americans right now .
Actually , the “ real world ” is not going to be getting easier for any of us .
We are all going to require an attitude adjustment if we are going to successfully navigate the difficult times that are coming .
So let ’s not be too hard on new college graduates and other young Americans .
The truth is that the vast majority of us are “ soft ” at least to some degree because of the decadent society in which we live .
Let ’s just hope that somehow we can all find enough inner strength to endure the great challenges that are going to confront us in the years ahead .
A standard story :
In the bad old days , police gave lip service to law , but actually often looked the other way , issued street justice , planted evidence , or lied under oath , all to implement their own sense of who should be punished , to gain payola , or to bow to the necessities of political influence .
While this situation continues in much of the world , in our great nation , ta da , heroic legal activists appealed to our better natures , and shamed us into constraining the police , judges , etc. to actually follow the legal principles to which they give lip service .
Sure sometimes we find a few bad apples , but now we mostly do just apply the law neutrally .
This heroic myth is now colliding with rapidly falling costs of recording our interactions with police , and with each other .
When such clear evidence is usually available , we will have to either actually follow our legal principles , or be obvious about not doing so .
Surely we would n’t just make it illegal to record interactions with police , right ?
In far idealistic mode , many are tempted to accept this standard story , and assume that any laws against recording one ’s interactions with police must be a temporary error , surely to be overturned when the good voters become aware of the outrage .
We ’d never so transparently turn our backs on our core legal principles , right ?
Consider :
In at least three states , it is now illegal to record any on - duty police officer .
Even if the encounter involves you and may be necessary to your defense , and even if the recording is on a public street where no expectation of privacy exists .
The legal justification for arresting the “ shooter ” rests on existing wiretapping or eavesdropping laws , with statutes against obstructing law enforcement sometimes cited .
Illinois , Massachusetts , and Maryland are among the 12 states in which all parties must consent for a recording to be legal unless , as with TV news crews , it is obvious to all that recording is underway .
Since the police do not consent , the camera - wielder can be arrested .
Most all - party - consent states also include an exception for recording in public places where “ no expectation of privacy exists ” ( Illinois does not ) but in practice this exception is not being recognized . …
A few weeks ago , an Illinois judge rejected a motion to dismiss an eavesdropping charge against Christopher Drew , who recorded his own arrest for selling one - dollar artwork on the streets of Chicago . …
In 2001 , when Michael Hyde was arrested for criminally violating the state ’s electronic surveillance law – aka recording a police encounter – the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld his conviction 4 - 2 . ..
The selection of “ shooters ” targeted for prosecution do , indeed , suggest a pattern of either reprisal or an attempt to intimidate .
…
Recordings that are flattering to the police – an officer kissing a baby or rescuing a dog – will almost certainly not result in prosecution even if they are done without all - party consent . …
A recent arrest in Maryland is both typical and disturbing .
On March 5 , 24 - year - old Anthony John Graber III ’s motorcycle was pulled over for speeding .
He is currently facing criminal charges for a video he recorded on his helmet - mounted camera during the traffic stop . …
Cameras have become the most effective weapon that ordinary people have to protect against and to expose police abuse .
And the police want it to stop .
Happily , even as the practice of arresting “ shooters ” expands , there are signs of effective backlash .
At least one Pennsylvania jurisdiction has reaffirmed the right to video in public places .
As part of a settlement with ACLU attorneys who represented an arrested “ shooter , ” the police in Spring City and East Vincent Township adopted a written policy allowing the recording of on - duty policemen .
And this is all about the official rules .
I ’m pretty sure that unofficially , police have ways of punishing you for trying to record them , even if you are legally allowed to do so .
Consider also :
An obvious enabler of police corruption is the fact that internal affairs units , tasked with exposing corruption , usually report to the same police chief that would be embarrassed by such exposure , and who may also be corrupt .
An obvious solution is to make internal affairs more independent , e.g. , reporting directly to a city council or even a governor .
This is n’t some temporary lack of adaptation to a new tech ; the obvious solution has been possible , and ignored , for a long long time .
Now ask yourself honestly , in near mode , what you think will usually happen in ten years to someone who tries to visibly record their interaction with police .
Added 16June : New from the Post :
The decades - old wiretap law has suddenly become a fresh battleground for civil libertarians and bloggers who consider Graber ’s prosecution and a series of similar arrests a case of government overreach .
Count me as one of those bloggers . 🙂

Now , this is different .
A computer cracker , Luis Mijangos of Santa Ana , California has been arrested by the FBI for taking over more than 100 Windows PCs and using what he found on them to extort sexually explicit videos from women and teenage girls by threatening to release their personal data .
It started , from reports , like many other hacker attacks .
He trolled for victims on P2P ( peer - to - peer file - sharing ) and IRC ( Internet Relay Chat ) networks under the nickname " guicho . "
Mijangos is alleged to have sent out malware disguised as popular songs .
Once downloaded , Mijangos took control of their computers and used them to spread the malware to their friends over IM ( instant messaging ) .
He also planted " keyloggers " on their PC so he could record their every keystroke as they went about their daily computer use .
So far , we 're not talking about anything that does n't happen tens of thousands of times a day .
But , this is where the story takes a different twist .
Mijangos did n't just automatically use the infected computer to send out spam and malware or siphon off credit - card passwords and the like the way most botnet controllers would do .
No , instead , he went looking on his victim 's computers for sexually explicit or intimate images and videos .
If he could n't find any , he is accused of hacking e-mail accounts and , pretending to be their boyfriends , asking them to take such videos or photographs .
If they used a Webcam , he would also turn the Webcam on to watch the women and teen - aged girls .
Then , adding insult to injury , he would stop passively watching , like an Internet age peeping tom , and start demanding sexually explicit videos .
He is accused of telling the women that if they did n't deliver the goods , he would send their sexually explicit videos to their friends and family .
And , of course , he is alleged to have said that he'd also show their dirty laundry to the world if they went to the police .
Mijangos ' " defense " is that he did indeed hack into their computers but that he only did so at because their boyfriends and husbands asked him to find out if they were cheating on them .
Amazing , huh ?
Let 's just say he seems to have been a much better hacker than he is a defense attorney .
What can I say about this ?
By now , I 'd thought everyone knew the top ten basics of PC security .
It 's not like there 's anything new that can be said , except my constant encouragement for people to switch to more secure operating systems like Linux .
Hey , it seems to be working for Google .
Still , there is another issue here .
While I get that , as the Avenue Q song says , the Internet is for porn , I do n't think a lot of people get that if you 're going to expose yourself to a boyfriend or girlfriend over the net , there 's always a chance that it 's going to go public .
If there 's some photo , video , information , whatever , that you do n't want the world to see or know about , do not put it on an Internet - connected PC .
Mijangos is an exceptional case , but there are always people on the net who will take advantage of you given half a hance .
This story , " Sexual Assault via Internet " was originally published by Computerworld .
Happy 50th birthday , birth - control pill .
You and I grew up together .
As I approached early adulthood in the 1970s , you were being touted as the antidote for women ’s sexual repression , unplanned pregnancies , and the gateway to academic and economic success .
Women should be better off because of you .
But looking back on 50 years of experience , has this proved to be true ?
Economist Timothy Reichert looked at the statistics on how relationships between men and women have changed since the advent of artificial birth control .
In a recent article for the Journal of Religion and Public Life , he concludes that the widespread use of contraception has harmed women , and consequently children , in several ways .
Reichert believes the availability of artificial birth control created a dual marketplace , one being consumers of sex and the other those seeking marriage .
While birth control enables women to enter the sex “ market ” on equal par with men , the limited opportunities for female fertility and childbearing compel women to leave the sex market and enter the marriage market .
Men , on the other hand , have little biological restrictions on their ability to reproduce .
Therefore , they remain longer in the sex market .
This creates an imbalance : more women in the marriage market with fewer willing marriageable men .
Reichert proposes that there are several negative consequences as a result of this imbalance .
Contraception has led to more divorce .
Since there are fewer men willing to settle down , women are often settling for partners who are not right for them , but who are willing to marry .
Both partners are less committed to remain in the marriage .
Many view these as “ starter marriages . ”
Contraception also has led to more infidelity .
With less risk of conceiving a child outside of wedlock , there is less risk of getting caught .
Before the sexual revolution , infidelity was more limited to prostitution .
With widespread contraceptive use , the pool of willing and available female partners has grown .
Finally , there is an argument to be made that contraception creates a demand for abortion .
According to the Centers for Disease Control , data gathered on U.S. abortion rates from 1965 to 2005 shows that the rise in abortion rates mirrors the rise in contraception rates .
While many women had hoped that artificial birth control would prevent unwanted pregnancies , the data seem to indicate that abortion is the fallback when birth control fails .
Because women have relied on birth control to enter the sexual marketplace at earlier ages and for longer periods of time , it seems likely that there are more chances to misuse ormishandle contraception that leads to unplanned pregnancies and , consequently , abortion .
This 50th anniversary might be an opportune time to reflect on the sexual state of affairs regarding women and artificial birth control .
The pill appeared to allow women the same sexual opportunities as men , but at what cost ?
Perhaps if women would consider sex as a package deal — procreation and pleasure together — we might be less likely to settle for much less than perfect and command a stronger level of respect and responsibility on the part of men .
ELEANOR ROSSMAN writes from Camp Hill .
Men 's troubles begin during the earliest days in the womb .
Even though there are more male than female embryos , there are more miscarriages of male fetuses .
Industrial countries are also witnessing a decline in male to female birth ratios , and we do n't know why .
Some scientists have argued that the probability of a male child declines as parents ( especially fathers ) age .
Still others have cited the prevalence of pesticides , which produce more birth defects in male children .
Even when a boy manages to be born , he 's still behind the survival eight ball : he is three to four times more likely than girls to have developmental disorders like autism and dyslexia ; girls learn language earlier , develop richer vocabularies and even hear better than boys .
Girls demonstrate insight and judgment earlier in adolescence than boys , who are more impulsive and take more risks than their sisters .
Teenage boys are more likely to commit suicide than girls and are more likely to die violent deaths before adulthood .
As adults , too , men die earlier than women .
Twice as many men as women die of coronary artery disease , which manifests itself a decade earlier in men than women ; when it comes to cancer , the news for men is almost as bad .
Women also have more vigorous immune systems than men : of the 10 most common infections , men are more likely to have serious encounters with seven of them .
While depression is said to be twice as frequent in women as in men , I 'm convinced that the diagnosis is just made more frequently in women , who show a greater willingness to discuss their symptoms and to ask for help when in distress .
Once , at a dinner party , I asked a group of men whether they believed men were depressed as often as women , but were simply conditioned to be silent in the face of discomfort , sadness or fear .
" Of course ! " replied one man .
" Why do you think we die sooner ? "
