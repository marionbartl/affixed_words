Governments have short time horizons .
Faced with a long - term problem such as the actuarial bankruptcy of Social Security , it almost always makes political sense to stall , to find some way of putting off the political costs of dealing with it .
With luck , the problem may go away .
If not , the costs will fall on some other politicians in the future .
Now that Obama 's health care plan has passed , he will be under pressure to produce results that look to most voters better than the past , or at least no worse .
In the short run that should not be a problem , since most of the provisions of the plan are set well in the future .
Most of the taxes to pay for it come into effect in 2013 , the requirement that health insurance companies take anyone who applies , including those with pre-existing issues , in 2014 , the tax on high end health plans in 2018 .
The fine for not having health insurance starts in 2014 at $ 95 or 1 % of income , and reaches its full value in 2016 .
For the next few years , at least through the end of Obama 's current term of office , the controversy over the plan will be mostly a war of words , without much evidence on its real consequences .
Eventually that will change .
If , when most of the provisions of the plan are in effect , it appears to be working very badly , if health insurance is more expensive than it used to be , if many younger workers find they are being required to spend a lot of money for insurance they do n't want , there will be two political consequences .
One is that the Democratic party , strongly identified with the changes , will suffer a decline in its reputation .
The other is that whatever politicians are in office will look bad , since voters will blame current problems on those currently in charge .
The obvious solution is to find ways of pushing the costs of the program into the future .
Insurance companies take in money now in exchange for the promise of future payments .
Under political pressure to charge less and promise more , they may adopt the policy followed by General Motors when it solved its labor problems by paying striking auto workers with the promise of future pensions :
Make promises they cannot fulfill , in the belief that when the crunch comes the U.S. treasury will come to their rescue .
WaPo :
House may try to pass Senate health - care bill without voting on it
The Hill :
Dems move closer to passing Senate bill without actual vote
These two headlines are going to be difficult to explain when the House holds its vote .
How do they plan on reconciling the fact that they 're reporting on an actual vote , expected to take place later this week , when they 've already reported that there wo n't be one ?
The answer , of course , is that there will be a vote , and the headlines are misleading and inflammatory .
Meanwhile , confusion ( willful and otherwise ) fans the flames of panic on both the left and the right , the right insisting that self - executing rules ( not counting the 200 + Republicans used ) are , " the greatest constitutional crisis since the Civil War .
It would be 100 times worse than Watergate , " and the left worrying that the procedure creates constitutional problems .
But both sides make a single fundamental error , which I 'll illustrate with Jack Balkin 's example , that leads to all the rest :
Ezra Klein reports that Speaker Nancy Pelosi hopes to avoid asking House Democrats to vote directly on the Senate health care reform bill ; instead , she will incorporate the bill by reference in the House reconciliation bill , which will then be sent to the Senate [....]
Whether or not it provides plausible deniability , is it consistent with the Constitution ?
Stanford Law Professor ( and former judge ) Michael McConnell does n't think so .
The argument is simple :
To satisfy Article I , section 7's requirement of bicameralism and presentment , both houses must pass the same bill for the President to sign .
If they pass different bills , no law is created , even if the President signs both .
The first flawed premise in Balkin 's opening is that he believes the Senate health care reform bill will be incorporated by reference in the House reconciliation bill .
It will not .
Instead , the rule governing consideration of the reconciliation bill will incorporate a motion to agree to the Senate bill ( actually a Senate - amended House bill ) .
Agreeing to such a motion is perfectly routine and perfectly legitimate .
The House will be presented with the opportunity to vote up or down on a measure incorporating that motion , and by adopting it will in turn adopt a procedure for agreeing to exactly the same text as the Senate passed , which will be triggered by the House 's recording of a vote in favor of passage of the reconciliation bill .
At no point does the House amend or otherwise alter the text of H.R. 3590 as amended by the Senate .
The requirements of the Constitution are satisfied .
Mark Levin , complaining from the right , asks incredulously :
They 're going to present a rule issued by [ Rep. Louise Slaughter 's ] committee , with her as chairman , that says that the House already adopted the Senate bill , when we know it did n't ?
He'd be right to be incredulous if his premise were correct .
It is n't .
The rule will not say that the House already adopted the Senate bill .
It will say that the House , by adoption of the rule , agrees that it will manifest its assent to the Senate bill with its vote on reconciliation bill .
Can it do that ?
Yes it can .
The House , under its constitutional prerogative stemming from Art. I , Sec. 5 , determines its own rules of proceeding .
All the Constitution requires of it is that approval of bills be signaled by a recording of the yeas and nays in its Journal , and that the same text be agreed to by both houses of Congress .
By agreement under the rule , the House will indeed signal its agreement by the yeas and nays to the language of the Senate bill , but it will do so with its vote on the reconciliation bill .
But is n't that odd ?
A bit .
Could the House signal its agreement to the Senate bill with its vote on a bill establishing National Unicorn Day ?
Yes it could , so long as the procedure is agreed to by a majority of the House beforehand , the yeas and nays are recorded on the Journal , and the text of the Senate bill itself remains unchanged in the action .
And that 's exactly what happens here .
It 's no different in that sense than when the Senate agrees by unanimous consent to a House - passed bill .
Or when the House takes up a motion to agree to the Senate version of a bill , as opposed to bringing the bill itself to the floor and voting on that .
The House determines for itself , through its own rules , whether it will accept a Senate bill by calling it to the floor and voting on it directly , or instead by agreeing to a motion to agree to the Senate version .
In one case , the vote is on a pending bill .
In the other , the vote is on a procedural motion .
But either will do , thanks to Art. I , Sec. 5 , and the idea that that would suddenly be constitutionally suspect endangers probably 50 % or more of the entire body of federal law .
To Balkin 's credit , he proposes later in the piece a method by which " deeming " the Senate bill passed would be acceptable :
Despite Judge McConnell 's concerns , which are textually well founded , there is a way that " deem and pass " could be done constitutionally .
There have to be two separate bills signed by the President : the first one is the original Senate bill , and the second one is the reconciliation bill .
The House must pass the Senate bill and it must also pass the reconciliation bill .
The House may do this on a single vote if the special rule that accompanies the reconciliation bill says that by passing the reconciliation bill the House agrees to pass the same text of the same bill that the Senate has passed .
That is to say , the language of the special rule that accompanies the reconciliation bill must make the House take political responsibility for passing the same language as the Senate bill .
The House must say that the House has consented to accept the text of the Senate bill as its own political act .
At that point the President can sign the two bills , and it does not matter that the House has passed both through a special rule .
The luckiest part of this whole thing ?
That 's exactly what the plan actually is :
Option 3 : Place self - executing language in the rule for the reconciliation bill that deems the Senate amendments agreed to upon passage of the actual reconciliation bill in the House . [...]
The Speaker took care to say that nothing 's been finalized in terms of this decision , but her preference is clearly for # 3 .
Freak out over .
You may resume your normal level of confusion .
But there will be a vote , and the dopes who have run headlines saying there wo n't be would have some explaining to do when the vote is held and they report it .
Except that no one will demand that of them , because ... uh ...
The U.S. and European governments are moving toward a consensus on taxing large banks to cover the cost of any future bailouts rather than asking taxpayers to foot the bill , as happened regularly in past banking crises .
The tax proposals vary .
Germany and Sweden would use the money to fund a " resolution authority " that would use the money to shut troubled banks whose failure would put the broader economy at risk .
Others , such as France , would assess the fee after a crisis passed .
The U.S. is split .
Congress is moving toward imposing a levy to build a fund before a crisis .
The Obama administration favors the post - crisis option , a difference that will be worked out as financial - regulation legislation moves through Congress .

Addis Ababa , Ethiopia ( Reuters ) – Ethiopia has agreed to end a long - running row with world governing body FIFA over leadership of the country ’s football federation , giving the national team the chance to play in international competitions again .
Ethiopia were thrown out of the World Cup qualifying competition last year after refusing to honor an agreement reached with FIFA over restoring the local federations officially recognized leaders .
The Ethiopian Football Federation ( EFF ) held an emergency meeting on Friday and decided to comply with FIFAs requirements , including holding a meeting to elect a new executive committee , state television and local media said .

( CNN ) --
It was n't a long walk to Lisa Cochran 's car in the Costco parking lot , but by the time she got there her infant son was near death .
Cochran and her grandmother had just enjoyed a hot dog at the Salem , Oregon , wholesale outlet .
She had 7 - day - old Derrik out of his baby carrier as she ate and people at nearby tables asked about the infant 's age and expressed amazement that Cochran was already out and about after the pregnancy .
She put Derrik back in his Infantino " SlingRider " and headed out to the parking lot , but something was amiss when she reached the car , she said .
" He was not the right color .
He was yellow .
He had purple spots from where the sling rubbed marks on his face , " said Cochran , 27 .
Cochran called 911 .
Her fiancé , Jerrid Fowler , administered CPR .
An ambulance arrived and paramedics also tried to revive the infant .
" By the time I got to the hospital , they told me they were n't able to save him , " she said .
Cochran filed a lawsuit in January , asking for millions of dollars in damages and alleging that Infantino was negligent and liable for her son's May 7 , 2009 , death .
The death certificate cited compression asphyxia / suffocation as Derrik 's cause of death , Cochran said .
Infantino issued a recall Wednesday of two baby slings , the " SlingRider " and the " Wendy Bellissimo , " offering customers replacement slings .
The San Diego , California - based company said consumers should stop using the recalled slings immediately but did not take responsibility for any deaths .
" Our company is comprised of moms , dads , sisters , aunts , uncles and grandparents and we care deeply about the quality and safety of our products , " President Jack Vresics said in a statement .
" All of our products go through rigorous testing and we work closely with governmental agencies as well as other third - party testing organizations continually to ensure the safety of our products . "
Earlier this month , the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a warning about the use of certain baby slings , saying it had identified 14 deaths with sling - style carriers , most of them in children younger than 4 months .
On Tuesday , Health Canada issued a joint statement with the agency , saying three of the deaths appeared to occur in one of Infantino 's slings .
About 1 million of the slings were recalled in the United States , and about 15,000 were affected in Canada , according to the joint release .
Around 14,000 of the slings have been recalled in Europe .
" In the first few months of life , babies cannot control their heads because of weak neck muscles .
The sling 's fabric can press against an infant 's nose and mouth , blocking the baby 's breathing and rapidly suffocating a baby within a minute or two , " the joint statement said .
" Additionally , where a sling keeps the infant in a curled position bending the chin toward the chest , the airways can be restricted , limiting the oxygen supply .
The baby will not be able to cry for help and can slowly suffocate . "
Attorneys for Infantino referred requests for comment to a public relations firm that answered questions and sent CNN the statement from the company 's president .
The company is working with CPSC in its investigation , has alerted retailers and written letters to individual customers , spokeswoman Amy Colton said in an e-mail .
The company has not filed any pleadings in the case except for a notice to remove the case from the Marion County Circuit Court in Oregon to the state 's U.S. District Court .
Cochran is n't the only mother blaming Infantino 's " SlingRider " for an infant 's death .
Anthoinette Medley is planning to sue Infantino for the February 20 , 2009 , death of 3 - month - old Nelsir , said her lawyer , Alan Feldman .
Watch Medley discuss losing Nelsir
His twin , Timir , was in an identical sling over Medley 's other shoulder as she walked through the Gallery at Market East in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .
She saw an old friend who had n't seen her children yet , Feldman said , and Medley was eager to show them off .
" That 's when she discovered a tiny bit of blood on the baby 's bib and ran to the bathroom , " Feldman said .
Nelsir was taken to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital and pronounced dead later , Feldman said .
" I will never get to hear him call me Mommy .
I will never get to see him take a first step , " Anthoinette Medley told CNN affiliate WPVI .
Feldman said he is not satisfied with Infantino 's recall .
" If you recognize that your product is not safe , and you realize that babies have died , you should stop babies and moms from using the product , " he said .
Infantino 's president said the company 's announcement of a free replacement program reflects its commitment to safety as its highest priority .
" As a company , Infantino conducts extensive safety testing internally as well as with third - party experts , regardless of whether official safety standards have been established .
We will continue to play a leadership role in the industry and to cooperate closely with CPSC as it continues its investigation of all baby slings , " Vresics said .
Cochran said the sling came highly recommended , especially for breast - feeding mothers .
A neighbor had one , she said , as did a friend 's cousin .
She even carried Derrik to his first doctor 's visit in the sling .
" There were a lot of people who had this sling , and it seemed like a great thing , " she said .
Cochran said she broke down after Derrik 's death .
Simple chores became extremely taxing .
She neglected going to the grocery store and bank .
She had trouble getting out of bed , showering , even talking on the phone .
" I was kind of hysterical .
I was kind of not quite with it for several months , actually .
I neglected going to the grocery stores or anywhere I would commonly frequent , " she said .
" It was just hard to even be in a situation like this because the first thing everyone asks is , ' How 's the baby ? ' "
Cochran , a manager for a housecleaning service in Keizer , lost Derrik 's twin in the first trimester of her pregnancy , she said .
She is pregnant again with a girl who is due in June .
" I 'm doing a lot better , especially now that I have another one on the way , " she said .
" Hopefully , there wo n't be any more babies that die and any more families that have to go through what me and my family have gone through . "

But , it turns out , solid evidence for water on the moon was under our noses the whole time .
Tiny amounts of water have been found in some of the famous moon rocks brought back to Earth by the Apollo astronauts , scientists announced last Wednesday .
( Related : " Apollo 11 at 40 : Facts , Myths , Photos , and More . " )
The water levels detected in Apollo moon rocks and volcanic glasses are in the thousands of parts per million , at most — which explains why analyses of the samples in the late 1960s and early 1970s concluded that the moon was absolutely arid .
" Only in the last decade have instruments become sensitive enough to even analyze water at those kinds of concentrations , " said Gary Lofgren , the lunar curator at NASA 's Johnson Space Center in Houston , Texas .
Lofgen , who was n't involved with the new research , called it " solid work " worthy of further investigation .
( Read more about moon exploration . )
New Line of Evidence for Moon Water
Hints of water in moon samples first surfaced in a 2008 study in the journal Nature , in which scientists reported having detecting water molecules in lunar glasses from the Apollo missions .
That team , however , had n't been able to prove the water had n't been introduced to the moon rocks on Earth , perhaps through sloppy handling .
One way to determine a water sample 's birthplace is to measure the amounts of different hydrogen isotopes inside the water — a technique unavailable to the Nature team , said James Greenwood , a professor of Earth and environmental sciences at Wesleyan University in Middletown , Connecticut .
Isotope measurements can serve as fingerprints .
Water from Earth 's mantle has a different isotope ratio than water from a comet , for example .
When the Nature study came out , Greenwood was pioneering a technique that allowed him to study the chemical makeups of Martian meteorites .
He later applied his method to samples of the mineral apatite , culled from a variety of moon - rock types , to determine the fingerprint of the water molecules inside .
The work proves that the moon - rock water " is not from us , " he said at a presentation of his findings at the 41st Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston , Texas .
Water in the Moon Minerals
At the presentation , a second team announced the discovery of water in apatite - bearing rocks from one of the moon 's mares , dark regions thought to have been formed by ancient lunar lava flows .
( See " Volcanoes Rocked Dark Side of the Moon . " )
In part by bombarding the mineral with a particle beam from an electron microprobe , the researchers were able to calculate the amounts of the gases fluorine and chlorine within the sample .
Given known formulas for apatite , the amounts of fluorine and chlorine present suggest there 's another compound needed to complete the mineral 's crystal structure .
The missing molecule , the team concluded , must be hydroxide — a common component of apatite and a byproduct of the breakup of water .
The finding is " one of the first to detect water in a lunar magmatic mineral " and adds to evidence that moon magma , in general , contains trace amounts of water , according to geoscientist Francis McCubbin , who participated in the research .
But , though discoveries of moon water continue to mount , they 're really just drops in the bucket , said McCubbin , of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington , D.C .
" While there is a lot more water in the moon than we previously thought , " he said , " it is still orders of magnitude drier than the Earth and Mars and therefore completely consistent with the last 40 years of lunar sample observation . "
Where 's Moon Water From ?
Going forward , the researchers plan to investigate how water ended up in the moon .
The most common guesses center on the moon 's earliest days , shortly after it had been created by the collision of a Mars - size object with Earth .
One possibility , according to Wesleyan 's Greenwood , is that icy comets hit the molten young moon as it was still solidifying .
Another possibility , said the Carnegie Institution 's McCubbin , is that not quite all the water was driven off when chunks of Earth were flung spaceward to form the moon — in other words , the water may be from an ancient version Earth .

Unarguably one of the most important aspects of any design is its colors ..
Designers create the style of a site , as well as the movement it makes , the emotion it creates , and its purpose based largely upon the color choices they make .
Colors are powerful tools and an important thing all designers should understand when creating websites .
Color Terminologies
Many of you may have learned some color basics in school , but let ’s quickly review some terminology in order to get a better grasp on colors and how to use them .
Color Wheel Main Groups
Colors are traditionally shown in a color wheel , and from this wheel , we can separate colors into three main groups : primary , secondary and tertiary .
The three primary colors are red , blue and yellow .
These colors are the base colors that make up all the other colors on the color wheel .
Mix the primary colors together , and you get the secondary colors .
These are orange , green and purple .
Tertiary colors are comprised of the middle colors like yellow - green and blue - green .
They are created by mixing a primary color and a secondary color .
Relationships of Colors
There are plenty of terms to describe colors , which will be helpful to know later on when we discuss colors and their emotional meanings .
Complimentary colors are colors that compliment each other well and are located opposite of each other on the color wheel .
These are colors like blue and orange , purple and yellow , and red and green .
Analogous colors are those located right next to each other on the color wheel , so they usually match fairly well but provide little contrast when used together .
Color Groups Based on Emotions
There are color groups that are associated with emotions : warm , cool and neutral .
Warm colors evoke warmth like red , yellow and orange .
Cool colors make people think of cool and chilly colors like blue , green and purple .
Neutral colors , as the term suggests , do n’t create much of an emotion .
Colors like grey and brown are neutral colors .
The knowledge of all these terms can be used to a designer ’s advantage to help create meaning and suggest certain emotions in a web design without words .
One important thing to remember though is that with color , you may not always have a choice .
Many brands or trademarks such as school ’s have specific colors they use , so it is important to use those when doing a college ’s web design , or other trademarked company’s .
Types of Color in Design
There are two different color systems and both are used depending on what you ’re designing for .
RGB is short for Red Green Blue , which are the three primary colors of the system and is produced with light .
RGB is used on televisions , computer monitors , and any kind of screen .
CMYK , which is short for Cyan Magenta Yellow and Key ( Black ) is created by pigments and is used in print .
Designs on the web should be created using the RGB system .
Making Wise Color Choices to Convey a Meaning
Color theory is the practice of using the meaning behind colors to bring about a sensory experience .
This practice can be applied to web design with some knowledge and thought .
People will often disagree about what certain colors mean and what colors designers should use to implore a certain emotion .
However , what ca n’t be argued is that consumers do have emotional responses to colors .
When choosing colors for your designs , be deliberate ; do n’t use colors without purpose .
There is a lot more that should go into choosing a color than just using a random color generator , although sometimes that may be a place to start .
Instead , use colors that are appropriate for your target audience , the message that the client wants you to convey , and the overall feeling you want the user to experience on your site .
Warm colors will bring about sunny emotions and are wisely used on sites that want to call to mind a feeling of happiness and joy .
As a case in point , yellow became a popular color in web design in 2009 when the global economy was n’t doing very well and companies wanted their customers to feel sunny and comfortable on their site .
Cool colors are best used on professional and clean - cut sites to achieve a cool corporate look .
Cool colors stir up emotions of authority , establishment , and trust .
For example , cool shades of blue are used in many banking sites , such as Chase .
It would n’t be wise to use cool colors on a site about an upbeat topic because users will get the wrong impression .
What Colors Mean to Users
Most colors can be taken in a positive or negative manner , depending on how it ’s used , the other colors surrounding it , and the connotation of the site itself .
Here are some general meanings of popular colors .
Red
Red symbolizes fire and power and is associated with passion and importance .
It also helps to stimulate energy and excitement .
The negative connotations of red are rage , emergency , and anger , which stem from the passionate and aggressive qualities of red .
Orange
Orange is a combination of its two neighbors on the color wheel , red and yellow .
Orange symbolizes happiness , joy and sunshine .
It is a cheerful color , evoking childlike exuberance .
Orange is not as aggressive as red but takes on some of the same qualities , stimulating mental activity .
It also symbolizes ignorance and deceit .
Yellow
Bright yellow is a happy color representing the positive yellow qualities : joy , intelligence , brightness , energy , optimism , and happiness .
A dingy yellow brings about negative feelings : caution , criticism , laziness , and jealousy .
Green
Green symbolizes nature and has a healing quality .
It can be used to symbolize growth and harmony .
People feel safe with green .
Hospitals often use the color of green .
On the other hand , green is symbolic of money , showing greed or jealousy .
It can also be used to symbolize a lack of experience or a beginner in need of growth ( “ green behind the ears ” ) .
Blue
Blue is a peaceful and calming color exuding stability and expertise .
It is a common color used in corporate sites because of this .
Blue can also symbolize trust and dependability .
A cool shade can bring about the negative side of blue , symbolizing depression , coldness , and passiveness .
Purple
Purple is the color of royalty and sophistication showing wealth and luxury .
It also gives a sense of spirituality and encourages creativity .
Brighter purples can exude a magical feeling .
It ’s also great for promoting creativity and feminine qualities .
Darker purples can conjure gloominess and sadness .
Black
Although black is not a part of the color wheel , it can still be used to suggest feeling and meaning .
It is often correlated with power , elegance , sophistication , and depth .
It is said that wearing black on a job interview can show that the interviewee is a powerful individual , and the same goes with websites .
Black can also be seen negatively because the color is associated with death , mystery and the unknown .
It is the color of grief , mourning , and sorrow so it must be used wisely .
White
White — also not a part of the color wheel — symbolizes purity and innocence .
It also shows cleanliness and safety .
Conversely , white can be seen as cold and distant , symbolizing winter ’s harsh and bitter qualities .
Examples of Colors in Big Companies Sites
We ’ll look at some large company sites to get an idea of how they use color and what that color means to their users .
Nike
Nike changes their site often , but it is usually dark with mostly black and grey hues .
The black shows the power in their product , giving the impression that they sell quality products to sporty people .
The White House website is mostly white and light grey with some blue and red accents .
The white symbolizes hope and freedom , showing a value for safety and purity .
The red and blue are of course the other USA colors , but the blue shows stability and peace , while the red shows passion and energy .
Amazon ’s site is mostly white , which is the best color to use for contrast and readability .
It also shows cleanliness and helps users navigate the site freely .
There are orange and blue accents to help people feel at ease when on the site , as well as excited and hopeful to find their perfect purchase .
Verizon ’s main corporate branding color is red , which is used throughout the site .
This helps stimulate the excitement of users , showing a company that sells an exciting and fast - paced product .
The white background is used similarly to Amazon , helping users navigate the site by displaying a clean and orderly site .
Best Buy
Best Buy ’s site showcases dark blue hues , showing their stability and power in the electronic market .
Buyers are making large purchases from Best Buy and need to feel secure and peaceful on their site .
The yellow emits happiness and helps people feel excited and joyful while making their purchases .
Charles Schwab is an investment company , and in an unstable market , they need to make consumers feel peaceful on their site .
They use soft and dark blue tones to achieve this , creating a calming and peaceful atmosphere on their site .
The neutral brown is another corporate color and helps neutralize intrepid users ’ feelings .
The orange accents are used to generate excitement in buying stocks and help bring a happier feel to the site .
Dodge ’s site is mostly black which allows their images to pop .
They use a bright red for accents .
The black gives a powerful quality to the site , showing their products off in a sophisticated and masculine light .
Black is a great color to use to make products look expensive and worthy of value .
The red shows passion and excitement , as well as the hope to drive consumers to purchase the vehicles from a company that values commitment and quality .
The main color used in Whole Foods corporate branding , as well as their website , is green .
Whole Foods sells healthy and organic food for a premium price .
The green in their site design does well to show their healthful and pure values as well as their nature - loving products .
They also use some pale yellow accents that are very complimentary to the green , and it gives a joyful value to the site .
How You Can Use Colors in Websites
Colors give sites meaning without having to use descriptive words .
They create a lot of impact , whether you intend for them to or not .
They can help move a user ’s eye through your site , creating movement and motion that directs users around a page .
As seen in many of the corporate sites , they create emotions and values that help show users what the company is about and what kind of products they are selling .
Use colors to your advantage by carefully selecting complimentary colors and ones that showcase the values you ’re trying to sell .
Pairing colors can help change the meaning of a site altogether .
Pair a soft blue site that creates calming qualities with a bright orange , and you could change your site to be more exciting and joyful .
Maybe your client thinks the site you ’ve designed is too harsh with lots of dark grey hues .
Add soft blue colors and your site design could have a more calming and peaceful tone .

The Institute of Physics has been forced to clarify its strongly worded submission to a parliamentary inquiry into climate change emails released onto the internet .
The institute 's submission , to the science and technology select committee , said the emails from scientists at the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) contained " worrying implications for the integrity of scientific research in this field " .
The submission has been used by climate sceptics to bolster claims that the email affair , dubbed " climategate " , shows the scientists did not behave properly and that the problem of global warming is exaggerated .
The committee held its only evidence session yesterday and interviewed witnesses including Phil Jones , the climate scientist at the centre of the media storm .
In a statement issued today the institute said its written submission to the committee " has been interpreted by some individuals to imply that it does not support the scientific evidence that the rising concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is contributing to global warming . "
It says : " That is not the case .
The institute 's position on climate change is clear : the basic science is well enough understood to be sure that our climate is changing , and that we need to take action now to mitigate that change . "
The institute said its critical comments were focused on the scientific process , and " should not be interpreted to mean that the institute believes that the science itself is flawed . "
The statement appears to contradict sections of the original submission , which suggests the emails showed scientists had cherry - picked data to support conclusions and that some key reconstructions of past temperature cannot be relied upon .
The institute statement says its submission was approved by its science board , a formal committee of experts that oversees its policy work .
The Guardian has been unable to find a member of the board that supports the submission .
Two of the scientists listed as members said they had declined to comment on a draft submission prepared by the institute , because they were not climate experts and had not read the UEA emails .
Others would not comment or did not respond to enquiries .
An institute spokesperson said the submission was " strongly supported " by three members of the board .
" All members were invited to comment .
Only a few did , all concerned approved [ the submission ] unanimously . "

Almost without exception , these “ gurus ” are clueless , unimpressive self - promoters who have grabbed on to the latest thing that they think will get them some attention , respect and acclaim .
So many people added this title to their twitter profiles , in 2009 , that it became hard to find someone without the word “ guru ” .
This fairly recent post from BL Ochman talks about the number of people still doing this .
You can go to tweepsearch.com and confirm this for yourself too .
It is all so sad and it has created a situation that the word “ guru ” has lost the reverence that it once had .
The definition of the word shows it was once an honorable title .
But no longer .
It now draws ridicule , mistrust and scorn in the western world and online .
The odd thing is that a majority of these so called “ gurus ” have chosen this title for themselves .
This is the reason it has lost it ’s former meaning , as the title is one that needs to be placed on you by others , who value your worth and the contribution you can make .
Because these titles were self - bestowed , the wielders of this awesome new rank often made some fantastically stupid mistakes due to their own lack of knowledge .
For a great list of some of these , check out this post from mashable
Thankfully , rise of the social media gurus seems to have reached its peak , because there ’s a new , contrary , position gaining momentum .
It ’s the “ who the hell are these people to call themselves experts ” movement .
Posts like this one and this reflect that sentiment .
But the term is forever tarnished , in my opinion .
That ’s OK though , because I like the word “ sensei ” better anyway .
I am also lurking on the internet in places other than here .
( and in a VERY non - guru kind of way ) .

IRS – I take back all the nice things I recently said about you …YOU STINK !
Or it ’s probably congress who stinks , I ’m not sure who , but basically whoever is responsible for IRS Publication 15 ( Circular E – Supplemental Wages ) THEY stink .
This rule is going to cost us over $ 300 of our own hard - earned money .
The rule is regarding the tax treatment of bonus checks .
My husband receives a once a year bonus check in March .
According to the above rule , this check is taxed at a mandatory 25 % .
As I ’ve stated before our effective tax rate is a ridiculous 1.26 % .
I know , I do n’t have a lot of room to complain with a tax rate like that , but we have deductible mortgage interest and property taxes , deductible student loan interest , crazy “ city wage tax ” and state taxes , three kids and are squarely middle class so it ’s not like we are doing any creative accounting .
( I do n’t even bother with our meager charity deductions because I feel I little guilty about this . )
I changed the w4 withholdings to 15 exemptions this year to no avail !
The paychecks do n’t have a penny of Federal Taxes withheld and we will still get close to $ 3000 refunded .
The IRS will hold 23.74 % of that bonus check in their coffers from March 2010 until we get it back in the form of a tax refund in MARCH of 2011 .
In the meantime we will pay interest on credit cards with rates as high as 24.5 % .
In the past I did n’t care , I loved that BIG REFUND .
But now that we are serious about no debt , and have a plan in place to get rid of it all , I ’m a little miffed .
Each time I make a “ Debt snowball ” payment ( or “ debt avalanche ” payment to be more precise ) I choke a little when I see how much of it goes to the interest and not the principal .
That chuck of our money we have to wait a year for would really speed up the process and save us money in interest or go to beefing up the emergency fund which would earn interest for us .
Do you think I can invoice the government for all the accumulated interest we will pay over this year ?
I mean I do n’t expect them to pay interest on tax refunds when most people who CHOOSE to CAN avoid them – but what if the IRS wo n’t ALLOW you avoid a refund ?

This :
Of course , if you have n't figured it out already , this is limited to Pennsylvania .
That , however , does n't make it any less exciting .
My state is moving closer and closer to passing single payer , as this excellent history of recent developments in the statewide movement explains .
It had been a good year for Single - Payer in Pennsylvania already .
HealthCare4ALLPA , the organization leading the fight ( full disclosure : the author is an unpaid officer of that organization and an unpaid member of the Board of Directors ) to enact single - payer healthcare in the Keystone State .
Our Bill , HB 1660 and SB 400 was picking up steam ( one blogger , in describing the scope of the bill , observed " you will never see a more comprehensive plan . " ) , and had been endorsed by City Councils in Lancaster , Philadelphia , Pittsburgh , Reading , West Reading , and Wilkes Barre , as well as by the Allegheny County Council .
Together those councils represent more than 3 million people , about a quarter of the population of Pennsylvania .
A study of the cost of employee healthcare benefits paid by the combined governments and school boards within our state had documented a savings of nearly $ 2.3 billion dollars if the bill werer passed , and the study was getting noticed .
Our quest for funds to commission an Economic Impact Study that would validate the benefits of instituting our bill were beginning to bear fruit .
In October more than a thousand people -- primarily from all over Pennsylvania , but augmented by advocates from Rhode Island , New York , New Jersey , Massachusetts , Maryland , Delaware , Ohio and even Washingtron State who journeyed to Harrisburg in a show of solidarity -- gathered in the Capitol Rotunda on a Tuesday workday morning to demonstrate for the passage of our bill .
As I wrote about here , the bill for statewide single payer had a hearing late last year .
Not only that , but the hearing was led by Republican State Senator Don White , and that 's not even the full extent of the bipartisan support of this .
And Governor Ed Rendell has also pledged to sign the bill !
And all five Democratic candidates for governor have expressed support of the bill !
And both Arlen Specter and Joe Sestak have said that they intend to introduce bills in Congress that would end ERISA and make it much easier for states to establish single payer systems !
A lot of this exciting stuff , including the unanimous endorsement of the Pennsylvania Democratic State Committee , all happened this past weekend at the Winter Meeting of the Pennsylvania Democratic Committee .
This is an exciting movement for the single payer movement in Pennsylvania .
In the words of Jerry Policoff , " It had gone mainstream . "
And it 's the result of an independent political movement that supports a specific agenda , not a candidate or a party .
We do not gain support by raising money for candidates or threatening to stop our support .
The movement for fundamental health care reform is real and growing in Pennsylvania , and it 's done through community outreach , media outreach , and utilizing the will of the people : Pennsylvanians - and most Americans - want quality health care , not health insurance .
You can support this exciting movement by going to HealthCare4AllPA.org and donating or contacting your state legislators ( if you 're in Pennsylvania ) or going more in depth and becoming part of the movement .
Personally , I might be trudging through snow tomorrow to get a petition signed supporting the bill ...
UPDATE : Thanks for the rec list .
And here 's a comment from Jerry Policoff , the author of the article I quoted :
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , left , and Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) celebrate after the Senate approves a package of changes to the health care bill .
Health bill clears Congress
Congress completed its work Thursday night on the broadest social legislation in almost a half - century , as the House capped the yearlong legislative saga over health reform by signing off on a package of fixes to the newly minted law .
In the end , the titanic battle over remaking the American health care system drew to a close on a pair of votes drained of suspense — after the Senate approved the cleanup bill earlier Thursday .
The House approved the same bill , 220 to 207 .
Advertisement
The votes deliver twin victories to President Barack Obama , the health care overhaul on which he staked the first year of his presidency and a lesser - noticed provision that would carry out a major restructuring of the student loan industry .
“ The benefits for Americans start right now , ” said Rep. George Miller ( D - Calif . ) , the chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee , who also cited changes to the student loan system that Democrats included in the health reform cleanup bill .
“ That ’s the road to prosperity .
That ’s the road to freedom for America ’s families . ”
But Republicans warned that Obama had overreached in his effort to pass the bill , which employed fast - track rules to get around the possibility of a Republican filibuster .
“ The American people are asking , where are the jobs , but as we see today , the issue of government - run health will continue to be the focus on this body , ” said House Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio .
“ We ’re going to be back here fixing the flaws in this very flawed bill . ”
With Vice President Joe Biden presiding over the chamber , the Senate took the first step Thursday , passing the package of fixes , 56 to 43 .
But the work was n’t done quite yet .
That ’s because the last bit of drama on health reform had actually occurred early Thursday morning , when Republicans succeeded in finding two parts of the reconciliation bill that did n’t pass muster with the Senate parliamentarian , both regarding Pell grants for low - income students .
So the version passed by the Senate had to be passed again by the House — even though the House had already passed the landmark legislation Sunday night that Obama signed on Tuesday .
But since both houses must pass identical versions of legislation to send it to the president ’s desk , the House had to return for one final vote , with members nervous over any last - minute blow - ups that could endanger the reconciliation bill .
In the Senate , three moderate Democrats voted against the reconciliation bill — Nebraska ’s Ben Nelson and the two senators from Arkansas , Mark Pryor and Blanche Lincoln .
Lincoln faces a tough reelection fight this fall .
Republican Johnny Isakson of Georgia is ill and was n’t in the chamber .
No Republicans voted for the reconciliation bill in the House or the Senate , after just one Republican , Anh " Joseph " Cao of Louisiana , voted in November for the underlying health reform law .
Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) criticized the measure until the end , saying , “ It is the most unsavory sausage - making , Chicago - style bill I have ever seen . ”
He said the GOP mantra would be to “ repeal and replace ” the bill going forward .
“ We ca n’t just have the status quo , ” McCain said .
The Senate vote happened just as Obama took the stage in Iowa City , Iowa — his first stop since he signed the legislation Tuesday — hoping to promote the bill to the American public , which polls show is deeply skeptical of reform .
He told Republicans he welcomed the chance to debate them on the merits of the plan , particularly if they insist on pressing for a repeal of the law .
“ My attitude is : Go for it , ” Obama said .
“ If these congressmen in Washington want to come here in Iowa and tell small - business owners that they plan to take away their tax credits and essentially raise their taxes , be my guest . ”
The reconciliation bill makes a variety of fixes to the health legislation .
It removed controversial deals such as the Cornhusker Kickback and also pushes off implementation of an excise tax on high - cost “ Cadillac ” health plans until 2018 .
The final vote on reconciliation in the Senate came with little drama — but it followed weeks of tough negotiations between House and Senate Democrats over what should be in it and whether there would be the votes to pass it .
The top leaders in the Senate , Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid and his counterpart , Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , worked out a deal in the early morning hours Thursday to hold the vote at 2 p.m. — and it went off on time , with the final outcome not in doubt .
Sen. Robert Byrd ( D - W.Va . ) , the longest - serving senator , was wheeled into the chamber by an aide and shook hands with Reid before going to his place and waiting for his name to be called in the roll .
There was a humorous moment when Reid ’s name was called , and he said ‘ no , ’ before quickly correcting himself .
He made the same mistake when the Senate voted on the overall health reform bill on Christmas Eve .
The chamber broke out in laughter .
The legislative path that brought the Senate to Thursday ’s vote was tortuous and politically risky .
The Senate spent months trying to write a bill that could win 60 votes .
Democrats succeeded on Christmas Eve , only to lose their filibuster - proof majority a month later .
The White House and congressional leaders revived the bill after deciding on a two - step process — the House passing the Senate bill , followed by both chambers using fast - track rules known as reconciliation to pass a package of fixes .
This was the only way House members would agree to approve the Senate bill and the only way the Senate could make changes that the House wanted .
Reconciliation was fraught with challenges .
But Democrats successfully scrubbed the bill of any potential procedural land mines , preventing Republicans from stripping out any major policy pieces that would have endangered its passage in the House or the Senate .
Democrats also held together during the more than 13 hours of amendments , turning each one back .
While Republicans implored their colleagues to make changes , Democrats argued that any changes would send the bill back to the House for another vote , an outcome they worked mightily to avoid before the parliamentarian ’s ruling early Thursday .
That meant Democrats had to vote against such campaign ad fodder as a provision barring sex offenders from being given Viagra .
Once Republicans struck two minor provisions from the bill , sending it back to the House , some liberals suggested that Democrats had one last chance to fight for the public option .
But no senators took the bait .
Democrats insisted on keeping the bill as clean as possible so the House could give the measure swift approval — and then the party could be done with the health care debate once and for all .
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad ( D - N.D. ) said , “ Everybody feels committed , feels we ’ve done the right thing , knows that the things that are required to go back to the House are insignificant and the House has already told us , ‘ No problem . ’
So we do n’t want to change that . ”
The drama playing out on the Senate floor eventually became a battle of wills between Republicans and Democrats , with each side trying to outlast the other .
By the time senators filtered into the chamber Thursday afternoon , the final vote felt almost anticlimactic to Democrats who had expended so much energy to get to that point .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A mutation in a single gene can turn hybrid tomato plants into super producers capable of generating more and much sweeter fruit without genetic engineering , scientists said in a study released on Sunday .
Galdino Gonzalez , 56 , shows tomatoes to Reuters journalists at an urban vegetable garden in the Iztapalapa district , Mexico City , July 31 , 2008 .

The study also showed that using classic plant - breeding techniques can boost yield as dramatically as using genetically modified organisms , said researcher Zachary Lippman of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York .
The mutation in one copy of the gene boosted tomato yield by up to 60 percent and increased sugar content , Lippman and colleagues reported in the journal Nature Genetics .
“ When this gene is only working at half speed ... there ’s this rebalance of growth that ’s happening that occurs across the entire plant that gives you this increase in yield , ” Lippman said in a telephone interview .
The yield - boosting power of the gene known as Single Flower Truss , which controls when plants make flowers , worked in different varieties of tomatoes and in different environments , Lippman said .
“ No matter what soil type , no matter what sort of irrigation you give it , no matter what fertilization you give it , you ’re always having some sort of effect , ” he said .
“ We try to keep it conservative and say 60 percent .
Sometimes it ’s a little lower , sometimes it ’s even higher . ”
When both copies of the gene are working , the result is a completely normal plant .
“ But when one copy is working , you see the heterosis .
This is the magic of the discovery , ” Lippman said .
Heterosis , or hybrid vigor , is the genetic mechanism that makes offspring of cross - bred plants more vigorous than their parents .
Lippman said the finding could have significant impact on agriculture , and the next step was to look at the effect in corn , soybeans and other crops .
“ Our concept about using mutations in the hybrid condition extends beyond tomatoes , and I bet that if people start using this ... in other crops that they find similar effects , ” he said .
Lippman and colleagues at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Rehovot , Israel , screened gene mutations in more than 5,000 hybrid tomato varieties .
Plants were tested in fields in multiple locations in 2008 and 2009 .
Some farmers used pesticides and other did not .
The boost in crop yields was consistent , Lippman said .
Tomatoes were one of the first genetically modified crops .
Monsanto ’s “ Roundup Ready ” tomato , which resists the effects of the weedkiller Roundup , was first marketed in 1996 .

An artist 's impression of how an ant may sense smell , creating an odour map
Desert ants in Tunisia smell in stereo , sensing odours from two different directions at the same time .
By sniffing the air with each antenna , the ants form a mental ' odour map ' of their surroundings .
They then use this map to find their way home , say scientists who report the discovery in the journal Animal Behaviour .
Pigeons , rats and even people may also smell in stereo , but ants are the first animal known to use it for navigation .
I get the feeling that whatever task these ants have to solve , they succeed
Dr Markus Knaden , Max - Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology
Dr Markus Knaden and colleagues Dr Kathrin Steck and Professor Bill Hansson of the Max - Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena , Germany investigated how the desert ant Cataglyphis fortis navigates around its surroundings .
Each day , individual ants will leave the nest entrance and travel up to 100 m in search of food .
When they find some , they return straight home , somehow finding their tiny nest entrance again within a bleak , relatively featureless desert landscape .
Scientists knew the ant uses a sophisticated array of visual cues to find much of its way home .
But Knaden 's team has now found that the insect does much more than that .
First , they placed four odours marked A , B , C and D around a barely visible nest entrance .
They then tested the ants by removing and placing them in a remote location , without a nest entrance but with the same four odours .
The ants immediately headed to exactly where their nest should have been , confirming that they use the odours as olfactory landmarks .
When the odours were mixed up , the ants became confused and unable to navigate their way home .
" They had learned the olfactory scenery , " Dr Knaden told the BBC .
Ants with one antenna were also unable to navigate using more than one smell , confirming that the insects required two antennae , and an ability to smell in stereo , to find their way around .
Other animals both navigate using smell , homing in on a single odour , and may smell in stereo .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
In 2006 for example , rats were found to smell in stereo , being able to locate the direction of a food source with a single sniff .
Many scientists suspect that pigeons also use smells to find their way home .
But until now , none have been found to do both , using a stereo sense of smell to create an odour map of the surrounding world .
" I more and more get the feeling that whatever task these ants have to solve , they succeed , " says Dr Knaden .
" The hostile desert seems to demand a navigation strategy combining every possible navigational cue . "
It ’s fair to say that age has been a constant topic of conversation at recent UFC events .
Leading up to UFC 110 there was much discussion over the idea of a ‘ changing of the guard ’ , with ageing fighters like Mirko Cro Cop ( 35 ) , Wanderlei Silva ( 33 ) , and Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira ( 33 ) being under suspicion of potentially being past their best .
The previous month at UFC 109 the oldest competitor on the roster , 46 year old Randy Couture took on the second oldest , 45 year old Mark Coleman in the headline bout .
On the same card retirement was a distinct possibility for the loser of the Matt Serra Vs Frank Trigg bout , two ‘ veterans ’ with a combined age of 73 .
Coming out of these two events I began to wonder , what exactly is the average age of a UFC fighter ?
Since I found it difficult to find a definitive answer I decided to work it out for myself .
Here ’s what I found out .
—
The average age of the fighters currently competing in the UFC is 29.5 years old .
The most common age is 28 .
The youngest competitor is Rory Macdonald who is just 20 years of age .
The oldest competitor is Randy Couture at 46 years old .

So as you can see the UFC has a fairly mature roster with each division averaging out either just north or south of 30 years old .
The most interesting finding for me though was how the divisions differ when it comes to the number of fighters who are 30 years old or over ( as depicted in the pie charts above ) .
In the lightweight and welterweight divisions roughly two thirds of the competitors are under the age of 30 , which should help ensure the longevity of those weight - classes .
The middleweight division meanwhile has an adequate 50/50 split .
Things swing completely the other way when it comes to the heavier weight - classes however , with nearly two thirds of the light - heavyweight division being in their 30’s , and in the heavyweight division an overwhelming majority of 74 % are 3o or over .
The figures highlight how the heavyweight division in particular has struggled to produce young talented fighters in significant numbers .
Even the winner of last seasons heavyweight based TUF series ( which has often been a vehicle for younger talent to break through ) , proved to be a 33 year old veteran , Roy Nelson .
It ’s no surprise that a number of the older fighters mentioned at the start of this article , such as Couture , Nogueira and Cro Cop have all been familiar fixtures in the division in recent years .
It makes the few young fighters they do have , such as Stefan Struve ( 22 ) , Todd Duffee ( 24 ) and Junior Dos Santos ( 25 ) , particularly precious commodities , as they will help form the backbone of the division in years to come .
The same is somewhat true at light - heavyweight where fighters like Jon Jones ( 22 ) and Phil Davis ( 25 ) are currently being nurtured in the hopes that they can become future champions in the division .
At the same time , aquiring prospects outside the promotion , with the 24 year old Gegard Mousasi being a prime example , should be seen as essential in the future to ensure the continued success of the division .
It will be interesting to see how these figures change in the next 5 - 10 years as the sport continues to grow and evolve .
The belief has always been that as the sport grows in popularity , so will the number of youngsters who want to become involved in mixed martial arts .
If true that should lead to a dip in the average age of the competitors in the UFC .
That ’s all for now , but stay tuned for the next part of this feature when we ’ll be looking at the experience factor in the UFC .

If you enjoyed this article then you might like some of our other recent features :
Even the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has acknowledged that the operation is overused .
Though there is no consensus on what the rate should be , government health agencies and the World Health Organization have suggested 15 percent as a goal in low - risk women .
“ VBAC ” has become a battle cry , with fierce advocates on both sides — women who insist that they should not be forced into surgery versus doctors and hospitals who insist on repeat Caesareans , citing the risks of labor and concerns about liability and insurance .
Image
Originally , the mantra was “ once a Caesarean , always a Caesarean ” because of fears that the scar on the uterus would rupture during labor , which can be life - threatening for both the woman and the child .
But after an expert panel in 1980 declared it safe for many women , vaginal birth after Caesarean had a heyday : in 1996 , the rate reached 28.3 percent in women with previous Caesareans .
Then , there were some ruptures , deaths and lawsuits .
The obstetricians ’ group issued stricter guidelines , and the rate sank .
It is now below 10 percent , and some experts think the pendulum has swung too far the other way .
In Tuba City last year , 32 percent of women with prior Caesareans had vaginal births .
Its overall Caesarean rate has been low — 13.5 percent , less than half the national rate of 31.8 percent in 2007 ( the latest year with figures available ) .
This is despite the fact that more women here have diabetes and high blood pressure , which usually result in higher Caesarean rates .
The hospital serves mostly Native Americans — Navajos , Hopis and San Juan Southern Paiutes .
Four other hospitals in New Mexico and Arizona , run by the Indian Health Service , also offer vaginal birth after Caesarean to some women ( it is not safe for all ) and have relatively low Caesarean rates without harming mothers or children , whose health in the first month after birth matches nationwide statistics .
Doctors say there is no scientific evidence that Native American women are more able than others to have vaginal births .
This happens WAY too often .
In fact I am almost positive that … oh no .
I ’m doing it right noooooow .

From an article on WUSF :
Florida was the surprise loser in today ’s announcement of federal " Race to the Top " money – and a lack of buy - in by teacher unions is partially to blame .
Florida , once considered the top contender , came in fourth .
And there was " a significant gap " between it and the two winners , Delaware and Tennessee , according to U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan .
Both of those states had the support of most teacher union chapters – 100 percent in Delaware and 93 percent in Tennessee .
By contrast , only 8 percent of Florida ’s local chapters signed on to the grant application .
State education officials in Florida admit the lack of union buy - in probably hurt the application .
And relations have gotten worse since Florida submitted its application in January .
Republicans are pushing through a bill that would eliminate teacher tenure and base the certification and raises on how their students perform on standardized tests .
Time for a metaphor .
The Obama Administration 's Education Reform system is making each state submit a project , like a Science Fair .
One of the criteria ?
Cooperation with teacher 's unions when building the project .
Florida Republicans refused to do that .
Then they blamed the poor grade they received on the teacher 's unions , after refusing to allow us to help create the project .
They failed the test .
Following Senate Bill 6 , that means they should not receive 50 % of their salary .
From the Conducive Chronicle .
Florida Senate Bill 6 – innocuously titled Relating to Education Personnel–is the type of legislation that if passed , is a voter coalition - builder of the Most Certain to Vote : Florida ’s educators .
As summarized by Florida Today , the bill is " ... a measure that would gradually do away with tenure and eventually put teachers on an annual contract that would not be automatically renewed .
The legislation would create an evaluation system that would tie teacher pay to gains in student test scores . "
Teaching Moment # 1 : What do teacher tenure and the dodo bird have in common ?
Here in Brevard County , new Florida teachers are contracted annually for the first three years of employment .
A professional contract is subsequently offered and is subject to review every two years .
Professional contract holders cannot work towards continuing contract .
Continuing contract–commonly referred to as tenure and tossed about as a code word by many a state legislator , guaranteed to get the goat of those who feel educators have a cushy , part - time , guarantee of a job –has not been offered to educators for many years and is fast going the way of the dodo bird , as those who hold such contracts age out and retire from the profession .
It is most neatly and completely extinct .
Which could prove a similar fate to those state legislators who voted yea to SB - 6 .
Here at home , those state Senators include Mike Haridopolos ( R - District 26 ) and Thad Altman ( R - District 24 ) .
( Peruse the March 24 Roll Call vote here ) .
This is the most amazing time to be politically aware in Florida .
Our state is turning Blue like a snow - cone that just got drowned in azure sugar syrup .
Seriously , you should see this .
The Facebook pages of Charlie Crist , John Thrasher , and the Repulican State Congress are totally plastered with angry teachers .
More than half of them are disillusioned Republican voters .
Seriously , you have got to see this :
The Florida Senate Majority Office on Facebook .
They are being destroyed .
Watch the polls for Fl - Sen in the coming weeks .
Tell me if I am overreacting then .
I feel it , this state is flipping fast .
Charlie Crist lied to the TV .
A report in West Palm Beach quoted his office saying they had only gotten 400 emails in protest for Senate Bill 6 .
Guess what ?
We have 20,000 active Facebookers who took that personally .
Now we are sending our emails with copies to all the news stations as proof .
And then there is Marco Rubio .
The tape is around here somewhere on DailyKosTV .
He threatened to kill Social Security , in a state chock full of retirees .
By rewarding the only two states who worked with their teacher 's unions in Race to the Top funding , the Obama Administration redeemed itself .
By bungling the entire process so completely that they are threatening their own electoral prospects , the Florida Republicans destroyed their chances in November .
I gotta say it was a good day .
Abstract : Wrapup of the PHP UK Conference 2010 .
Uploaded slides of my talk " RDBMS in the social networks age " about graphs in the database .
Yesterday I attended the PHP UK Conference 2010 in London .
The organisers did a great job and everything went smooth .
Thanks to everyone who was involved !
The quality of the talks was quite good , and meeting other people is always a pleasure .
RDBMS in the social networks age - Slides
My talk ( RDBMS in the social networks age ) was in the first slot after the keynote , so I could get over with it soon and enjoy the rest of the conference :-)
According to the comments and the tweets , it was very well received .
I was a bit worried at first because the topic was highly technical and not easy to follow , but the audience was kind enough to bear with me :-)

Amendments made to the digital economy bill by the House of Lords threaten freedom of speech and will lead to British websites being blocked without due judicial process , the chief executives of leading technology companies said today .
The heads of the four largest UK internet service providers – BT , Orange , Virgin Media and TalkTalk – as well as Google , Facebook , eBay and Yahoo have all co-signed the letter , along with consumer groups , academics and the technophile television host Stephen Fry , objecting to amendment 120A to the bill , which was added to the bill last week with support from Liberal Democrat and Conservative peers .
Ministers had been seeking powers to amend copyright law and impose conditions or fees where infringements were taking place .
But the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats succeeded in removing the measures from the bill last week , replacing them with a more specific amendment handing courts the power to force internet service providers ( ISPs ) to block certain websites .
In a letter to the Financial Times , the online giants argue that the rules , if they become law , would fail to tackle copyright infringement as intended .
The amendment has " obvious shortcomings " , the 16 signatories say .
The letter says : " Endorsing a policy that would encourage the blocking of websites by UK broadband providers or other internet companies is a very serious step for the UK to take .
" There are myriad legal , technical and practical issues to reconcile before this can be considered a proportionate and necessary public policy option . "
The amendment had been roundly criticised last week when it was added , as critics pointed out that it could be used to block sites such as YouTube .
But Lord Tim Clement - Jones , one of the backers of the amendment , said last week that the intention was to deal with " cyberlockers " – a system that allows individuals to swap large files directly , rather than sending them by email or storing them on websites .
The House of Lords passed the amendment last week , replacing a clause that would have given broad powers to ministers to change the Copyright Act to respond to new forms of online infringement without the need for primary legislation .
But the letter 's signatories called the amendment " bitterly disappointing " , and explained : " Put simply , blocking access as envisaged by this clause would both widely disrupt the internet in the UK and elsewhere and threaten freedom of speech and the open internet , without reducing copyright infringement as intended .
To rush through such a controversial proposal at the tail end of a parliament , without any kind of consultation with consumers or industry , is very poor law - making . "
Responding to the letter , the chief executive of UK music industry body the BPI , Geoff Taylor , said that the amendment provided a " clear and sensible " way of dealing with illegal downloading .
Taylor added that the signatories to the FT 's letter have acknowledged that illegal downloading has to be dealt with .
" The amendment adopted by the House of Lords provides a clear and sensible mechanism to deal with illegal websites , " he said .
" Contrary to the claims in the letter , service providers would in every case be able to ensure that the decision as to whether a site should be blocked is made by the high court .
The court would be required to consider the extent of legal content on a website , any impact on human rights , and whether the website removes infringing content when requested .
So the suggestion that the clause would lead to widespread disruption to the internet or threaten freedom of speech is pure scaremongering .
" The signatories to the letter recognise that dealing with illegal websites is a legitimate concern , and have argued in the past that action against illegal downloading should focus on commercial operators .
Removing unfair competition from clearly illegal websites will encourage investment in legal online services and improve the legal internet experience for everyone . "
The digital economy bill is expected to be pushed through before parliament is dissolved for the general election , widely expected to happen on 6 May .
If it reaches a second reading by early April , when an election would be called , it could go into the " wash up " – the process at the end of a parliament when bills that have not been passed are hurried through .
The government would need cooperation from the opposition to achieve that with the bill – but it is not clear whether the Tories , who have objected to elements of the bill , as the " landline tax " of £ 6 a year to help pay for next - generation broadband , would support it .
Lord Clement - Jones had said the provisions , approved by 165 votes to 140 , would protect the creative industries by preventing access to websites where films and music were being provided illegally .
He told peers : " I believe this is going to send a powerful message to our creative industries that we value what they do , that we want to protect what they do , that we do not believe in censoring the internet but we are responding to genuine concerns from the creative industries about providing a process whereby their material can be satisfactorily accessed legally . "
Lord Clement - Jones said the " blanket nature " of the government 's original intention was " objectionable " .
He argued the new proposals were " more proportionate , specific and appropriate " .
The bill extends the role of media regulator Ofcom to include communications infrastructure and media content , and to appoint providers of local news in ITV regions .
It also includes powers to stop under - age children getting hold of violent computer games and contains measures to help the switchover to digital radio .
A former Safeway Inc. employee was sentenced Tuesday to spend seven months in home detention in connection with the federal investigation of defunct California tomato processor SK Foods .
Michael Chavez , 52 , of Fremont had pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud and accepting $ 5,000 in bribes from an official of SK Foods , which was based in Monterey .
Chavez was a corporate purchasing manager for the Pleasanton , Calif. , grocery chain from 2000 to 2007 , and responsible for negotiating deals for processed tomato products , court documents said .
At least one of those deals , for 500,000 pounds of processed tomatoes , came as a result of a $ 1,000 cash bribe from SK Foods .
In addition to the home detention , U.S. District Judge Lawrence K. Karlton in Sacramento sentenced Chavez to three years of probation and a $ 10,000 fine .
Neither Chavez nor Safeway officials could be reached for comment Tuesday .
Eleven people have been charged in connection with what prosecutors have described as a decade - long scheme by SK Foods and former Chief Executive Frederick Scott Salyer to illegally corner the market for processed tomato products .
Chavez is the second person to be sentenced in the case .
Robert Watson of White Plains , N.Y. , is serving a 27 - month prison sentence in Brooklyn , N.Y. , and was ordered to pay $ 1.85 million in restitution .
Watson , a former purchasing manager for Kraft Foods , pleaded guilty to mail fraud and accepting $ 158,000 in bribes from an SK Foods official .
Watson declined a request for an interview .
The status of Salyer ’s release from Sacramento County Jail remained uncertain Tuesday .
Last week , Karlton set bail at $ 300,000 in cash and $ 6 million in a property bond for Salyer , who is charged with multiple corruption counts .
The cash portion of the bail already has been submitted , and Salyer planned to put up his home in Pebble Beach , reportedly valued at $ 6 million to $ 7 million , as collateral for the bail bond .
But prosecutors argued that it should n’t be used as collateral because his former wife has filed a legal claim on the property .
The home is owned by Salyer ’s daughters ’ trust , and the trustee had agreed to let it be used as security for the bond .
Karlton agreed to further weigh the issue at a hearing Tuesday after defense attorney Malcolm Segal offered to find friends of Salyer willing to put up additional property to secure the bond .
But he later issued an order refusing to let Salyer use his Pebble Beach home as collateral .
In the order filed Tuesday afternoon , Karlton wrote that the defense had failed to convince the court that the legal claim “ will not sufficiently diminish the value of the Ronda Road property .
Accordingly , the court will not accept the Pebble Beach home as sufficient support for the bond . ”
The ruling , however , hinged on the defense team being able to access Salyer in the Sacramento County Jail , according to the order .

Avid Autopia readers are by now undoubtedly familiar with the antics of Bob Maddox , the mild - mannered jet - powered daredevil from Medford , Oregon .
The 800,000 or so of you who watched grainy YouTube videos of his jet - powered bike will no doubt be glad to learn that you soon may be able to see Bob jump from a plane in HD .
With a jet strapped to his chest , he 'll appear in a reality TV project he 's dubbed The Rocketman Show .
For the four of five readers who do n't know him , Maddox 's hobbies include skydiving and strapping pulse jet engines to whatever he can find – bikes , boats , his body , whatever .
If the Rocketman had organized the Olympics , jet - powered figure skaters would perform 300 mph double axels and Shaun White would still be tomahawking five miles above Vancouver .
And it would be awesome .
Now , Maddox tells us he 's been approached by folks at Magical Elves , the production company responsible for Top Chef , Project Runway and Treasure Hunters .
Seems they 're toying with the idea of making ol '
Bob a TV star .
" We e-mailed back and forth and I did a bunch of videos , and they seemed very positive about it , " Maddox said .
If the show makes it to the air , Maddox hopes to build jet - powered dragsters , Star Wars - style Podracers , go karts with 200 pounds of thrust , drone aircraft that double as skydiving platforms , and twin jet - engine mahogany speedboats .
" It 's kind of like MythBusters and Monster Garage , " Maddox said of the premise for the show .
" We 're designing everything and taking them out and driving them . "
Best of all , the show will provide him with the funds to build more jet - powered creations without relying on the occasional sale of his jet bikes on eBay .
" I 'm in woodworking and construction , which is totally in the toilet right now , so I have n’t been making too many things recently , " Maddox said .
That means Bob could finally experience his lifelong dream of strapping on four jet engines , shooting 25,000 feet into the sky and skydiving back to earth .
We want to see that on live TV , hopefully as a season finale and not a series finale .
Joining Maddox would be his nephew , also a skydiver , and Bob 's best friend , who plays in a local rock band .
The vehicles would be both high - speed and high - design , with Bob using his artist 's eye and cabinetmaking skills to design and build their exteriors .
Unlike the wrench - throwing antics of Orange County Choppers , most of the drama would come from the the very premise of the show : Maddox jumping out of planes and building , testing and piloting homebrew jet - powered vehicles capable of 300 mph .
" A lot of excitement would come from when we take out an engine that ’s making 1,000 or 1,500 pounds of thrust that nearly makes you pass out just standing next to it , " Maddox said .
" Even a mild - mannered guy like me gets excited . "
We 're still awaiting word from the Magical Elves about all of this .
Stay tuned .

TSA forces 4 year old disabled boy to remove leg braces to pass through airport security
When you read about a story like this you realize that we have gone too far in attempting to be politically correct .
A police officer and his wife were taking their four year old son to Walt Disney World to celebrate his birthday .
The Thomas ’ had more to celebrate than just their son ’s birthday .
Ryan Thomas was born prematurely and because of this his legs were not fully developed ; he just began walking with the help of leg braces .
When he tried to pass through airport security with his leg braces on the metal detector went off .
The TSA agent at the scene ordered Ryan to remove the leg braces and walk through the detector , to the surprise of his parents who argued that Ryan could not walk through on his own without the braces .
Ryan ’s mother offered to walk through with him for support but the TSA agent said that was not allowed .
Ryan had to walk through on his own .
The boys parents were allowed to walk through directly in front of and behind Ryan to protect him in case he fell ; he did not fall , he made it through the detector on his own .
Needless to say , Ryan ’s parents are not happy and they should n’t be .
But this is what we have come to as a country under Janet Napolitano and Barack Obama .
This administration is so damned concerned about offending Muslims that the TSA has reached the point where they must make a boy who is developmentally delayed take off his leg braces and risk injury so that we can show the world that we are not profiling Muslims .
This is disgusting , uncalled for , and totally reprehensible .
Here is the truth ; we have a profile of who the terrorists are , we can not admit it but everyone knows that it is true .
But we have to play this politically correct game and pretend that profiling does not exist , and you know what ?
With this administration it may not exist and that is a shame .
Profiling is not only not wrong , it is a necessary tool ; not only in fighting terrorism , but in fighting crime also .
When a crime is witnessed by an individual what is the first question that the police ask ?
They ask for a description of the criminal .
A description is a profile .
The police then look for a person who fits that description .
That is not wrong , that is how criminals are caught .
Will the police then question people who do not fit the profile of the criminal just so that they can claim they are not looking for a person of a particular race , no matter what race that is ?
I certainly hope not .
What would be the use of obtaining a profile if you are not going to use it to solve a crime .
It is no different in regards to terrorism ; we know who the terrorists are and what they look like .
Stopping people who fit the profile of a terrorist does not mean that you are accusing that person of being a terrorist , it simply means that you are doing your best to protect the public from terrorism .
Most clear thinking Muslims understand this .
The fact that we have reached a point in this country where Homeland Security is more afraid of offending the people we are trying to fight than they are of offending the parents of a four year old developmentally delayed boy– who obviously does not fit the profile of the people the TSA is looking for– in the interest of pretending that a profile of terrorists does not exist is just more proof that this administration lacks the courage it takes to fight terrorism .
The United States is granting Khalid Sheikh Mohammed– the admitted mastermind of September 11th , Nadal - Hasan– the Fort Hood terrorist , and the Christmas day bomber full constitutional rights as if they were Americans citizens and they are harassing four year old disabled children as they try to pass through airport security and we are supposed to think that this administration takes terrorism seriously ?
The Maldives Buys a New Island – That Floats
March 7th , 2010 by Susan Kraemer
Sea level rise creates new business opportunity and “ green jobs ” that we ’ll see more of , borne from the effects of climate change , as sea levels rise .
The first floating island has just been commissioned this week by the sinking island nation of the Maldives , from Dutch Docklands , whose past work includes part of the artificial islands comprising The World off the coast of Dubai .
[ social_buttons ]
Humanity is faced with possibly its worst problem in all of its history , in climate change .
It takes political imagination to make the changes needed to turn around the disaster bearing down on us .
Half of us have an IQ under 100 , so making this change and convincing all of us that we can do it ( by switching to renewable energy sources ) will be very much harder than just inventing fire was ( perhaps our last comparable climate change challenge ) .
Perhaps we can’t save ourselves , and adaptation may be our only chance .
Dutch Docklands is predicated on solving one result of this failure ; rising sea levels – by inventing and engineering floating islands .
Like inventing imitation glaciers , it ’s an example of the kind of lateral thinking that we ’ll need more of .
The company specializes in solutions for places where sea levels are rising , land is sinking or where sand shortages make traditional erosion control reclamation prohibitively expensive .
Underneath one of its artificial islands , marine life can adhere to the floating platform .
The floating island can be moored to land so that it is somewhat stable .
In very rough seas ( like when there ’s cyclones ) there would be some movement but most of the time it would feel like a solid island , not like being on a boat covered in sand .
The beach is completely floating and just as comfortable as a normal beach , ecologically sound and erosion free .
Under the sand would be a foam and concrete platform , gradually sloping down underwater , that to some extent cups the sand in the container shape .
The company tries to use methods and procedures that reduce impact on underwater life and minimize changes to coastal morphology .
Dutch Docklands claims to be able to retain the natural interconnection between tides , waves and current intact while creating miles of new beaches for permanent coastal expansion .
The CEO Paul van de Camp moved to Dubai from Holland because of the “ anything is possible ” spirit in Dubai , where he engineered the Australasian section of The World .
The design for the floating beach design is essentially the same as for some new floating islands Dutch Docklands is building to indulge the sheik in Dubai , in the shape of a rather cryptic phrase in Arabic .
By the end of the century , quite a bit of Dubai itself will also be underwater due to rising sea levels as a result of climate change .
The floating island commissioned by the Sheik should ensure the survival of a home for the 22nd century princely offspring .
But for the Maldives , replacing its land is already a matter of life or death .

Lib Dems seek web blocking
After Clause 16
LORD RAZZALL
LORD CLEMENT -JONES
112
Insert the following new Clause —
“ Preventing access to specified online locations
In Part 1 of the Copyright , Designs and Patents Act 1988 , after section 97A insert —
“ 97B

In determining whether to grant an injunction under subsection ( 1 ) , the Court shall have regard to the following matters —
( a)
whether a substantial proportion of the content accessible at or via each specified online location infringes copyright ,
( b)
the extent to which the operator of each specified online location has taken reasonable steps to prevent copyright infringing content being accessed at or via that online location or taken reasonable steps to remove copyright infringing content from that online location ( or both ) ,
( c )
whether the service provider has itself taken reasonable steps to prevent access to the specified online location , and
(d)
any other matters which appear to the Court to be relevant .
(3)
An application for an injunction under subsection ( 1 ) shall be made on notice to the service provider and to the operator of each specified online location in relation to which an injunction is sought .
(4 )
Where —
( a)
the Court grants an injunction under subsection ( 1 ) upon the application of an owner of copyright whose copyright is infringed by the content accessible at or via each specified online location in the injunction , and
( b)
the owner of copyright before making the application made a written request to the service provider giving it a reasonable period of time to take measures to prevent its service being used to access the specified online location in the injunction , and no steps were taken ,
the Court shall order the service provider to pay the copyright owner ’s costs of the application unless there were exceptional circumstances justifying the service provider ’s failure to prevent access despite notification by the copyright owner .

“ copyright owner ” includes a licensee with an “ exclusive licence ” within the meaning of section 92 of this Act ,
“ infringing content ” means content which is produced or made available in infringement of copyright ,

We 've been rumoring a WiMAX " HTC Supersonic " for a while now , and Sprint just dropped the hard news : the phone will be dubbed the HTC EVO 4G , will be released this Summer and it's easily the best specced phone we 've ever witnessed .
The hardware is of quite obvious HD2 descent , but with Android onboard and some nice aesthetic tweaks , the EVO 4G takes on a life of its own .
The handset is centered around a 480 x 800 4.3 - inch TFT LCD , with a Snapdragon QSD8650 1GHz processor under the hood ( the CDMA version of the QSD8250 in the HD2 and Nexus One ) , and even a helpful 1GB of built - in memory and 512MB of RAM -- hello app storage !
Even the battery is bigger than the HD2 , and the camera is an 8 megapixel monstrosity with flash , that 's capable of 720 p video , and is augmented by a 1.3 megapixel front facing camera for good measure .
The phone features HDMI out ( though you 'll need an adapter for turning it into a TV - familiar HDMI plug ) , 802.11b/g WiFi , and an 8 GB microSD card .
There 's that still - rare Android 2.1 underneath an updated version of HTC's Sense UI .
But ... despite all these wild features , what actually sets the EVO 4G apart is the fact that it 's Sprint 's first 4G phone .
The handset runs a combo of EV - DO Rev. A and WiMAX , with calls still being made over CDMA and the EV - DO / WiMAX options for data .
Interestingly , it sounds like concurrent data and voice use might be possible for the first time on CDMA carrier in this way ( killing AT&T's well - advertised differentiator ) , though Sprint says that 's still in the testing phase .
One other new feature is the Sprint hotspot app , another MiFi - style connection sharing number , which is obviously aided greatly by the WiMAX on board and can support up to eight concurrent users .
Follow after the break for our hands - on impressions and videos of the phone in action , including an up - close - and - personal test of the touchscreen keyboard .
Below you 'll find galleries of the phone by its lonesome and up against the Nexus One and iPhone 3G .
We 've got a graph comparing the Nexus One and Droid with the EVO spec for spec , and there 's also a pictorial shootout with the Desire and HD2 .
Pick your comparo poison !
Health care is etched on my mind these days not only because of the Capitol Cacophony but also because a husband and wife I know , my former neighbors , are undergoing the kind of heartbreak no family should endure .
Zack Liu and Jan Li , along with their two young daughters , lived a few doors away from me .
Then a couple of years ago they moved to Hong Kong , and paid $ 4,500 per year for a health insurance policy for Jan and the girls ( Zack was covered through his job ) .
Last April 24 , their world collapsed : Jan was diagnosed with late - stage stomach cancer .
Opponents of the reform proposals argue :
If you like the Department of Motor Vehicles , you ’ll love Obamacare .
But as the drama of Zack and Jan shows , the only bureaucrats more obdurate than those at the D.M.V. are the ones working for insurance companies .
The existing system is preposterous : we rely on insurance companies whose business model is based on accepting premiums from healthy people and devising ways to exclude from coverage those who most desperately need medical care .
Jan ’s stomach was removed , and she underwent extensive chemotherapy .
Then in October , her doctors discovered that the cancer had spread to her intestines .
She has been hospitalized ever since .
For a big man on campus — one of the biggest men , really — to sit in a makeup chair for nearly an hour , then put on a pair of ballet tights and take the stage for the Pacific Northwest Ballet ’s “ Nutcracker ” shows that Quincy Pondexter has a certain level of comfort in his own skin .
So , too , does walking into the Washington locker room to hear about it from players who wondered why their teammate , the one with the least rhythm , was the one chosen to dance , and from trainers who turned him into a tutu - wearing ballerina with an assist from Photoshop .
Pondexter smiles , but not at all sheepishly , about all of this .
It is part of the ride , as much a part of the college experience as being one of the M. C. ’s for a black - tie university fund - raiser ; finishing his degree in sociology , which he will do this week ; or hitting a last - second shot to win an N.C.A.A. tournament game , which he did last week .
In an era when so many of college basketball ’s best players view college as a way station to the N.B.A. , Pondexter is among the few players with pro prospects who not only stay for four years , but also savor the experience .
Yogi also won the Gundog group at the world famous dog show
A Hungarian Vizsla named Yogi has won Best In Show at Crufts .
The seven - year - old beat off competition from six other dogs in the culmination of the four - day show at Birmingham 's National Exhibition Centre ( NEC ) .
Yogi is the first Hungarian Vizsla to win Best in Show .
Handler John
Thirlwell said his " wonderful dog " from Carlisle , Cumbria , is likely to retire .
Rico , a Scottish Terrier from Russia , took second prize at Crufts , the largest dog show in the world .
And Judge Valerie
Foss said of the winning dog : " He is such a lovely mover , so powerful , so free .
" He is just a very , very good dog . "
The Kennel Club said nearly 22,000 dogs across 187 breeds were entered into this year 's Best in Show competition .
' Wonderful diversity '
Thousands had packed the arena to cheer on the finalists .
Earlier , judging of the Gundog category , which Yogi won , was interrupted by a streaker .
The dog showcase was broadcast on More4 this year after the BBC - which began screening Crufts in 1966 - announced it was dropping its coverage in 2008 .
That decision followed a BBC documentary which claimed Crufts allowed damaging breeding practices that caused disease and deformities .
Welfare concerns also prompted the RSPCA to withdraw its support in 2008 .
Kennel Club communications director Caroline Kisko said the canine show is " a celebration of healthy , happy dogs which recognises the special and unique bond between dogs and their owners " .
She said anybody who had watched the coverage " will have seen the wonderful diversity of dogs , the fact that they truly are fit for function and how much dogs and people enrich each other 's lives " .

Drones
by Tom Dillon
I ’ve never been able to explain what it ’s like to have my thoughts digitized .
Even after six years I can’t , not to someone who had n’t experienced it for themselves , at least .
Not to my parents , certainly .
They still think that renting my body to corporation while my mind surfs the net is on a level with prostitution .
The truth was that I kind of agreed with them , but scruples do n’t pay the rent .
“ Ma’am ? ”
I stepped forward to fill the void left by the previous customer , about whom I could remember nothing .
The kid behind the counter , the Drone , did n’t look anxious or annoyed , just blank with dead eyes .
If I looked closely , I would see a tiny antenna protruding from behind his ear , attached to the transponder that PolyCorp required all Drones to wear .
There were rumors about companies that paid a lot , whose Drones were nearly indistinguishable from non-digitized people , companies that ran everything from the brothels to the casinos to organized crime , at least insofar as those endeavors were still distinguishable from one another .
Nothing so elaborate for the clerks at Six - to - Midnight , though , just your basic retail software package .
“ Ma’am ? ” the kid asked again , with no sign of impatience .
I was glad to be dealing with a Drone .
It usually takes about an hour for my mind to get used to being in its own brain again .
Until then I just try not to be too annoying , and it ’s a lot easier when the other person is incapable of being annoyed .
“ Yeah , give me a pack of GPC ’s , ” I said .
“ That will be sixteen dollars and sixty - three cents , please , ” the clerk said .
An hour ago , it could have been me behind the counter with the PolyCorp widget behind my ear .
In the past , I had run into friends who were plugged in , mindlessly working at restaurants and grocery stores , but they had n’t recognized me .
I tried to picture myself behind the counter , dark hair and green eyes sticking out of a blue - and - white apron , but I just could n’t do it .
The truth is that I have no idea what they do with my body when I rent it out , except that it comes back in the same condition as I left it , although I have had a couple of times where I noticed scrapes and bruises .
You get compensated for those , though .
I gave the kid a twenty , and he meticulously counted back the change , coin by coin , dollar by dollar .
The kid was quick , in a mechanical sort of way , but the delay was still annoying , I just wanted to be home .
I shoved the money into my pocket in a wad that I would have to deal with later .
Then again , if the insurance companies did n’t keep such a close watch for red - flag items , I could have just paid with a card and saved myself the trouble .
At Palen Street , I turned left .
I do not know why I turned left , as my new route took me away from my apartment not toward it , but the weather was pleasant and I had nowhere to be .
I even harbored the secret hope that I might meet someone while I was out , although I knew how that would end , another hungover regret .
Palen Street took me towards downtown , and as I walked more people joined me on the sidewalk .
It was a little after five o’clock and the people all looked bleary eyed from the effects of digitization .
The only ones who did n’t walk along with the crowd were the suits , leaving their jobs as lawyers or dentists and heading straight for their cars in order to more quickly return to their homes in the exurbs .
By the time I reached the city center , the people were thick around me and I began to wonder if I was walking into a protest or something .
A part of me was excited by the prospect , but my more rational self hoped that it was just rush hour traffic ; I could n’t afford to be arrested .
Still I did n’t turn around .
The first sign of trouble came several blocks later , when a man in the crowd started flailing at the people around him .
It would be easy to watch it on video after the fact and say that the people around him should have just tackled him , but that ignores the reality of the situation , the instinctive reaction to it .
So the people around him panicked , and pushed into the people around them , and so on until the entire street was a roiling brew of chaos and barricaded cars .
Somewhere in there , more people started to change , and it was pretty clear that I was in the middle of a zombie attack .
I remember seeing the first attack , when I was a kid .
Nobody knew what was going on , and then someone drew the obvious comparison between the Drone mobs in the streets and the living dead .
All hell broke loose .
Hoarding , religion , survivalism , George Romero did more damage than the zombies themselves .
Not that I blame him , classics are classics .
Of course the zombies were n’t actually the living dead , just people with malicious software running in their heads .
No one had figured out how to make it contagious yet , so it was just a matter of waiting until the cleanup crew arrived .
Doing that should be pretty easy , just keep the zombies from getting a good grip on you and keep moving , but their programmed flailing worked on some primal aspect of the mind , reached right in and pushed the big red fight - or - flight button .
Between the zombies and the people in full - on panic mode , it was clear that I needed to get out of there .
I shoved my way to the edge of the street , and worked my way along the buildings until I found a door that was still open .
Sort of .
There were men in black suits with dark glasses standing on either side of it , weapons drawn , bodies like coiled springs .
A group of them had clustered around something , a person I presumed , and were moving towards the door .
Others in the crowd had the same idea as me , and were starting to converge on the building .
Fortunately , zombies tended to be easy to spot , incoherent with glazed eyes and a tendency to bite .
After a quick question , the people were ushered into the safety of the building , one by one .
“ Ma’am , what is the capital of Libya ? ” one of the guards asked when I got to the front of the line .
“ How the hell would I know ? ”
He did n’t answer , but waved me past him .
It was good that my entrance did n’t depend on answering the question correctly ; it would have sucked to get killed in the streets because I did n’t know my geography .
Behind me I heard him ask the next person what the word syzygy meant .
The security company probably had an entire division tasked with making up obscure questions .
I followed the stream of people into the building where we were ushered into a windowless conference room .
After a few minutes of sitting and waiting , the staffer who was assigned to watch over us was called away , shutting the glass door behind him on his way out .
The room was well insulated , and once the door was shut , the only thing I could hear was people muttering about the inconvenience of it all or the cell network being down .
More men in black suits were hurrying down the hallway towards the front of the building .
I had to pee .
None of the people in the room with me knew where the bathrooms were , so I just opened the door and took a right , the opposite direction that the suits had gone .
The hall led me to the elevator lobby , which also had a set of restrooms .
While I was washing my hands , I leaned forward to get an eyelash out of my eye , bracing my leg against the marble countertop .
Something sharp underneath poked through my jeans , causing me to yelp and jump back .
There was a knife taped to the underside of the countertop .
I pulled it down and peeled the tape off .
Only a little longer than the length of my hand , the entire thing was painted a matte black , glinting only where the blade had been ground to an edge .
Part of me wanted to just leave it on the counter , but I put it in my pocket anyway , not sure what I would do with it .
I could hear yelling coming from the front of the building when I exited the restroom .
It must have been getting really bad out there , I pictured the river of people heading downtown after work , only to have some bad software in their heads turn them into zombies .
The largest outbreaks had n’t had more than a few hundred zombies in any one area ; there could easily be thousands out there .
I got in the elevator and pushed the button for the top floor , figuring it would be the safest place in the building .
Before the door shut , more men in suits exited the elevator adjacent to me .
I began to wonder what sort of building I had ended up in .
The elevator opened into a roomy lobby that was peppered with plants and artwork .
I poked my head into a couple of rooms , and all of them– the conference room , the opulent bathroom , the putting course –were empty .
Finally I pushed my way through the massive and intricately carved double doors that dominated one of the lobby ’s walls .
It was an office filled with heavy wood furniture and with nothing but glass for exterior walls .
Whoever worked here , they were important .
Below , people were crawling like ants over the destroyed geography of the street .
Cars burned and the crowd was filled with jittery violence .
The military had arrived , and they were cutting their way through the dense crowd .
As mechanical as it looked from a distance , I ’m sure it was worse on the street , with Drones in convicts ’ bodies firing into the crowd with neither fear nor hesitation .
I did n’t want to watch any more .
Only I could n’t leave the room .
When I reached the threshold , my legs simply refused to move any farther .
In disbelief and shock , I walked back and made another attempt to leave with the same result .
That was when I realized that I had taken the knife out of my pocket , and everything clicked in my head .
I was no longer in complete control of my own body .
Somebody had , when I was at work , slipped some code into my brain , just like the zombies and soldiers below .
That same somebody wanted me to do something , and judging by the knife I was holding it was n’t going to be baking cookies .
My thoughts started to race .
How long had I been like this ?
When was the last time I had made a real decision ?
I forced myself to stop it .
Those questions were irrelevant .
I did n’t want to spend what were quite possibly my last minutes debating minutiae with myself .
The minutes ticked by , and I felt every second as I stood waiting for the door to open .
My entire life had boiled down to two options .
I could refuse , turn the knife on myself rather than give someone the opportunity to use body for something truly terrible .
Or I could just go with it .
I placed the tip of the knife against my left wrist , the blade parallel with my arm .
I gradually increased the pressure until I felt it slip into the skin .
A drop of blood welled up , spreading along the blade .
There was no resistance , an I knew that a simple jerk of my hand would open my veins and that with enough pressure the wound would be final .
I checked my phone again .
Still no service .
I no longer believed that the service was overloaded .
Most of the zombies in the mob below still had their phones on them , no doubt , the mesh network would reach practically to the suburbs .
There was little time left , no doubt .
I opened up the video recorder software and set it to upload as soon as it had a connection .
I pointed the device ’s lens at my face and spoke to it , trying not to let my voice shake , “ Mom , Dad , Johnnie , whatever happens in the next few minutes , I just wanted to let you know that I love you . ”
I stopped the recorder , saved the video , and set it to upload as soon as it found signal again .
It hurt to simplify our relationships down to that one fact , but it would take a lifetime of work to get it right .
I put the phone back in my pocket .
My head was starting to hurt as the situation tensed my muscles and I moved to sit down .
The door opened .
The man who entered the room was tall and handsome .
The sort of man you saw at the golf course in the middle of the day or at the helm of a ludicrously expensive yacht in the middle of the summer .
The sort of man who had become so used to wealth and control that those things had become as much a part of him as his childhood .
He was not some government bureaucrat , worn thin from trying to do too much with too little .
Whoever had control of me had sent me to kill some captain of industry .
It could have been much worse , a humanitarian or social justice activist .
A part of me was relieved , the rest of me was horrified at the first part ’s reaction .
“ C - Clara ? ” he asked , apparently as surprised by my presence as I was by the fact that he recognized me , even if by name not my own .
That was when I realized that his expression was n’t just surprise , it was fear .
I thought of all the men in suits , about what was being hidden by their dark glasses , and about how many of them would n’t be going home to their families at the end of their shifts .
I thought about what it must mean that he was not only surprised to see me , but afraid .
When I felt myself starting to lunge towards him with the knife outstretched , I leaned into it .
The human body contains a lot of blood , and I had to jump to clear the expanding puddle that was leaking out of the man ’s throat .
I had wiped the knife clean on his expensive shirt and tucked it back into my pocket , thankful that whoever had sent me had n’t also caused me to kill myself .
It was curious that someone would choose something other than the clean and neat crime , but I did n’t question my luck .
You do n’t discard a tool , I guess .
The elevator dinged when it reached my floor and I stepped in , pressing the button for the ground floor .
It was in the elevator that I began to pay attention to my surroundings , for the first time since I entered the building , and it was then that I noticed the logo that was tastefully etched into the frosted glass of the elevator ’s walls .
I knew the logo , it was the same logo that I saw when I arrived at the PolyCorp employee hub for work each morning .
I was in one of their administrative buildings .
I tried to remember the face of the man who I had just killed , but my memory was n’t working properly , and the best I could do was a fuzzy , face - shaped outline .
Whoever he had been , he had worked for PolyCorp .
Back in the elevator lobby , I felt a chill as the AC kicked in and the whole building seemed to drop a few degrees , snapping me back to the present .
I shivered one of those shivers that starts in your spine and works its way out to your fingertips and reached to pull my jacket tighter around me only to find that I was n’t wearing it .
I could n’t remember taking it off , but hoped that I had left it in the bathroom .
I found it hanging neatly on a hook next to the mirrors and I realized that I was covered with a fine mist of blood .
My pants were dark and the jacket covered up the spots on my shirt .
I tried not to think of the consequences of the coincidence .
By the time I got back to the conference room , the military was evacuating the building .
“ Ma’am ? ” a young man with dark skin and tattoos poking out from under his body armor asked when I looked in the room .
“ Sorry , I was in the bathroom , ” I said .
“ There are people waiting at the front of the building , ” he said .
“ Thank you , ” I said .
I tried not to look at his blank eyes as I passed him on my way out .

New polls published today suggest Labour 's electoral recovery may be stalling .
A YouGov poll for the Sun continued to give the Tories a modest five point lead , with Labour down two on 32 % and the Tories unchanged on 37 % .
But an ICM poll for the Guardian gave the Tories a healthy nine point lead , with David Cameron 's party up three points on 40 % and Labour on 31 % .
The details of the Guardian poll will make for depressing reading in Number Ten .
Of those who voted Labour in the last election , just 43 % think Gordon Brown is reaching out to their concerns .
But David Cameron appears unpopular as well , with just 42 % of voters thinking he looks like a competent prime minister and 33 % saying he would take the country in the right direction .
As strikes go , this one takes the cake ... or rolls out the barrel , and must have Australian - born Crown Princess Mary raising an eyebrow .
Scores of Carlsberg workers have walked off their jobs to protest the Danish brewer 's new limits on beer drinking at work .
At work in the Carlsberg factory .
Carlsberg spokesman Jens Bekke says 250 warehouse and production workers and truck drivers went on strike on Thursday on the second day of a rebellion against the new rules , which state workers can only drink beer in the canteen during the lunch break .
Bekke says previously Carlsberg had no restrictions on beer drinking as long as employees did n't get drunk on the job .
He says truck drivers are exempt from the new rules and are permitted to drink three beers outside the canteen .
But they still went on strike in sympathy with their colleagues .
Alcohol ignition locks on the trucks prevent them from driving drunk .

Adding information about a new content partnership between Foursquare and The New York Times , in conjunction with the Winter Olympics .
Foursquare , the location - based mobile application that is capturing the fancy of hip urbanites , is a bar game that lets users compete for points and badges when they go out at night .
But recently the service has been branching out beyond its bar - hopping origins .
On Tuesday , Foursquare is announcing a partnership with Zagat , the restaurant - guide publishers .
It plans to offer a “ Foodie ” badge that can be earned by checking into Zagat - rated restaurants in New York , San Francisco , Chicago and other major cities .
In addition to pointing toward a business model for Foursquare , the collaboration with Zagat underscores the popularity of the service and could help extend its reach to a mainstream audience .
It is one of several deals that the company has been hammering out .
Foursquare recently signed an agreement to integrate Bravo TV shows with the game aspects of its service , and it is working with Warner Brothers to promote the studio ’s romantic comedy “ Valentine ’s Day . ”
The company is working on a similar partnership with HBO , said Tristan Walker , Foursquare ’s head of business development , and The New York Times is experimenting with the service .
Some of these companies are paying Foursquare , Mr. Walker said , but he declined to disclose the terms of the deals .
Ryan Charles , a senior product manager at Zagat , said the collaboration was a natural progression for the company , which has dabbled in other creative online ventures , using Twitter and creating a so - called augmented reality application for Android - powered mobile phones .
“ We saw thousands of Foursquare users checking in to Zagat - rated restaurants , and saw an opportunity to present content to them as well as engage them in game - play , ” said Mr. Charles , who first heard about the mobile company last year at the annual technology conference South by Southwest Interactive .
In addition to offering a special badge for Foursquare users , Zagat will begin piping tips and recommendations into the Foursquare system , which already doubles as a user - generated city guide .
Foursquare users can submit their own suggestions for activities and dishes to order at a particular restaurant , which will pop up when their friends “ check in ” on Foursquare from that venue .
But the Zagat partnership will add a slightly different layer to the content by incorporating recommendations culled from the company ’s repository of reader reviews .
For example , users who check into a Zagat - ranked restaurant will receive suggestions about great dishes or the best dessert on the menu .
Zagat also plans to run a series of “ Meet the Mayor ” interviews on its Web site , featuring Foursquare users who have checked in enough times at a particular location to earn the “ mayor ” title .
“ There ’s an added incentive for users to be the mayor of a Zagat - rated restaurant , ” Mr. Charles said .
“ Also , visitors to our site who may not already know about Foursquare will learn about it .
It ’s a great cross-promotion . ”
Foursquare has also been forging partnerships with city transit agencies , universities and media companies , like the Canadian daily Metro News .
On Friday it will add The New York Times to the list .
In conjunction with the Winter Olympics , The Times will be offering recommendations to Foursquare users on restaurants , attractions , shopping and nightlife in Vancouver , Whistler and the nearby town of Squamish .
The tips will be pulled from The Times ’s travel and entertainment coverage .
Foursquare users who check in at one of the suggested venues will earn a New York Times Olympics badge , said Stacy Green , public relations manager for The New York Times Company .
“ Going forward , ” Ms. Green said , “ we are looking into other ways we can work with Foursquare in New York and other markets to integrate our strong travel and entertainment content . ”
SEOUL , South Korea —
In South Korea , where people often remove their shoes before entering homes , restaurants or funeral parlors , it is a nagging problem : people walking off with others ’ shoes , either by mistake or , sometimes , intentionally .
Still , Detective Kim Jeong - gu ’s jaw dropped recently when he opened the warehouse of an ex-convict in Seoul and found 170 apple boxes packed with 1,700 pairs of expensive designer shoes , sorted by size and brand , and all believed to have been stolen .
“ Shoe theft is not unusual here , ” Detective Kim , 28 , said .
“ But we gasped at this one . ”
The 59 - year - old suspect , a former convict identified only by his last name , Park , was a onetime used - shoe vendor who had been convicted twice in the past five years of pilfering shoes and operated around funeral homes , the police said .
Attached to major general hospitals , such facilities have 20 to 40 rooms where grieving families receive guests who bow on the floor in a show of respect for the deceased .
They usually arrive in their best shoes and invariably leave them outside .
They also linger for a while , eating , drinking and catching up with relatives , old friends or colleagues who have come for the same service .
How much energy does a vehicle use and why ?
A vehicle ( your car ) uses an enormous amount of energy to get us and our stuff around .
Some seem to be confused about what those energy requirements are , or how that energy is used .
So I thought I would try to clear the air on that subject .
I will try to stay away from excessive math .
I will also ignore some small details .
They are not important to your understanding .
My purpose is to explain the concepts .
To keep the length under control , this article is in two parts .
First we will look at what affects the energy needs of the vehicle .
Then , in part two , we will look at the actual numbers , and real world implications .
Ready ?
There are only four things that effect how much energy is necessary to move your vehicle .
The first is the weight ( mass , or amount of stuff ) of the vehicle .
This is important only when we need to change the speed – IE : Accelerate or decelerate .
As we shall see though , it is very important for that .
Two others factors are the frictional losses , mostly due to tires , and the aerodynamic drag – how much the air is pushing against the vehicle .
Finally , factor number four , gravity .
Of course it takes more energy to go up a hill ( fighting gravity ) than it does to go down one ( making use of gravity ) .
However , since Gravity would unnecessarily complicate this discussion , we are going to pretend the world is flat , which will then allow us ignore it .
With that out of the way , we are left with three things that determine your vehicles energy needs – Mass , Friction , and aerodynamic Drag .
So , let ’s take a closer look .
First up is the vehicle mass .
It takes certain quantity of energy to accelerate a given mass to a given speed .
That energy is actually converted from the mechanical energy your car engine ( or motor , or squirrel ) produces into the kinetic energy , ( or momentum ) , that is then stored in the mass of the vehicle .
Interestingly , once we are at a steady speed , the mass does not matter ( remember , the world is flat , we are ignoring gravity ! ) .
Once accelerated , and at a that steady speed , the vehicle ’s mass possesses all the energy that was put into it while accelerating as kinetic energy – also known as momentum .
And , it will continue to travel at that speed using no further energy , unless acted upon by another force .
Indeed this is how our interplanetary spacecraft operate , it is how our space probes go on for years without needing any fuel .
Unfortunately for us though , here on earth there are two other forces that exist to complicate our lives .
So , next up we have friction : Friction is always present ( there is no perfect system ) .
In a car , in addition to the bearings and gears , the primary source of friction is the tires against the roadway .
Now , this is can be a good thing because that friction , going by another name – traction , is what keeps your vehicle going in the right direction !
But , when considering energy , as long as the vehicle is moving it is having to overcome that friction , using some amount of energy in the process .
Friction is always trying to slow your car down by removing kinetic energy from it .
That means we have to continually add that energy back to maintain the same speed .
And , the last factor is aerodynamic drag .
Any time your vehicle is moving , air is pushing back , trying to slow it down by removing the kinetic energy from it .
Again , the same as for friction , we have to continually add energy to the vehicle to maintain a constant speed .
This is literally the amount of energy needed to “ shove ” the air out of the way .
A quick fun factoid : Aerodynamic drag increases with the square of the velocity , however , the power ( force ) needed to overcome aerodynamic drag increases with the cube of the velocity .
So , if you double the speed , there is four times as much air pressure pushing against you .
To overcome that drag will require eight times the power ( 2x2x2 ) .
A car going 50 mph may require only 10 horsepower to overcome aerodynamic drag , but that same car at 100 mph requires 80 hp !
Another fun fact .
As you can ascertain , when travelling at a fixed speed , the mass ( weight ) of the vehicle is of little concern .
A heavier vehicle will cause more frictional losses ( tires are squished more ) , but , if they are the same size as far as aerodynamic drag is concerned , it does n’t matter if your vehicle weighs 2000 pounds , or 200,000 pounds it will take the same amount of energy to keep it going .
Once in motion , it stays in motion until an outside force acts on it – in our case , friction and aerodynamic drag .
This is the reason railroads are incredibly efficient .
For their weight , they have very little frontal area ( aerodynamic drag ) , and since the wheels are steel , on steel tracks , they have much less friction than a road vehicle with rubber tires .
Of course , a train also does not start and stop very much .
There it is .
These are essentially the ONLY things that effect the amount of energy your vehicle needs !
( Note , for the physicists , I did say essentially ! ) .
Once again , they are :
The energy needed for acceleration , and the energy necessary to overcome mechanical friction and aerodynamic drag .
As to how much energy .
Well , there is a very fixed requirement for the amount of energy needed to accelerate a mass .
Issac Newton told us so !
The larger the mass ( more weight ) the more is needed .
An important point here :
It does not matter how quickly you accelerate .
The amount of energy needed and consumed to accelerate a specific mass to a specific velocity is the same .
This is true whether you impart it quickly to get to a certain speed , or if you take your time to attain the same speed .
In the end , the same mass at the same speed will contain the same amount of kinetic energy ( momentum ) .
The formula is kinetic energy = ½ times mass times velocity squared .
And , note that the velocity is squared .
So , to go twice as fast will require adding four times as much energy to the mass .
Now , you are probably wondering about Power .
Specifically Horsepower .
What role does it play ?
Well , we know that to accelerate a specific mass to a specific speed , we need to impart a specific amount of energy into it .
Is that specific ?
If we have “ more power ” defined as the capacity to do work , we can impart that energy to our mass faster .
That means we will achieve our velocity quicker .
But , we have used the same amount of energy .
We have simply put that energy into our mass quicker , and for a shorter period of time .
Think of a box of cereal .
The box is our energy source ( gas tank ) .
Inside that box are individual corn flakes .
Each flake is a BTU of energy .
In order to achieve a certain speed we need to transfer all of the flakes inside that box into our bowl ( our vehicle ) .
If we make a small hole in the top of the box , we can pour a certain amount of flakes through that hole .
With a small hole , it may take us 30 seconds to pour them all into the bowl .
If we make the hole twice as big , we can pour them out twice as fast , and achieve our objective ( speed to breakfast ) twice as fast .
Well , you ’ve hopefully figured it out by now .
The hole is our engine , and the size of the hole is the power that engine has ( HP - Hole Power ) .
Bigger hole ( power ) , quicker result .
But , note , we have transferred the same exact amount of flakes ( energy from the gas tank ) to achieve our goal , no matter the size of the engine ( hole ) .
We just did it quicker !
OK .
Hopefully you now have some idea of the factors that affect your vehicle ’s energy needs .
But , before we go on to part two , just for fun , lets figure out how much energy we need to accelerate a typical 3000 pound ( 1360 Kilogram ) car to 65 Mph ( 29 Meters per second ) .
We will use the formula for momentum .
Once again , it is : Momentum = the mass ( in kilograms ) times the square of the velocity ( in meters per second ) , divided by 2 .
The result is the number of Joules needed .29 squared is 841 times 1360 = 1143760/2 = 571,880 Joules .
As we will learn in part two there are 1055 Joules in a BTU .
So , we used 542 BTUs of energy to accelerate the car .
Does n’t sound like much ?
Well , we will get into that in part two .
Stay tuned !
On to part two !
The kicker , though , lies at the foot of the poster .
For thirty - five cents , you got a double bill : squeezed below Plastigrams was a small announcement for the second half of the program , D. W. Griffith ’s “ Way Down East . ”
And so the scene was set .
3 - D had the bells and whistles , but maybe that was all it had ; it was a Wonder Novelty , but a novelty nonetheless .
Meanwhile , real movies , less showy but more substantial , could get on with business as usual .
And that is where the matter rested .
In 1936 , for instance , audiences for M - G - M ’s “ A Tale of Two Cities ” were treated , beforehand , to a short 3 - D film called “ Audioscopiks , ” for which the company made three million pairs of red- and - green lorgnette spectacles .
You held them up to your eyes to watch a guy pitch a baseball ( “ Do n’t Forget to Duck ! ” the tagline ran ) , then lowered them for the Dickens , which remained a tale of two dimensions .
Not until the end of last year were the two halves of that entertainment fused into one , as Robert Zemeckis ’s “ A Christmas Carol ” saw Jim Carrey , in the role of Scrooge , rocket past us into the night sky clutching a chimney pot .
This was not because the same thing occurs in the original story but because 3 - D loves a human projectile even more than it does a baseball .
That ’s the rule : wonders must never cease .
To survey the filmography of 3 - D , from the days of “ Bwana Devil ” to a movie like “ Jaws 3 - D , ” which , in 1983 , earned eighty - eight million dollars worldwide , is to trespass upon a mythical land that is both laughed at and lost .
It ’s like hearing from survivors of Atlantis that the place was a bit of a dump .
And yet the myth is untouchable , because we cannot return to inspect it for ourselves .
Were I to nourish a fixation with the films of 1954 , I could easily buy a DVD of “ Rear Window ” or “ On the Waterfront , ” but I can no more grasp what it was truly like to put on my 3 - D spectacles and watch “ The French Line , ” with Jane Russell , than I can spirit myself back among the congregation of St. Thomas ’s Church in Leipzig , two hundred and twenty years earlier , to hear a Bach cantata .
There was a chance to see “ The French Line ” four years ago , when it screened as part of a magnificent - sounding roster of films at the World 3 - D Film Expo II , at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood , alongside such gems as “ Those Redheads from Seattle ” ( 1953 ) and “ Taza , Son of Cochise ” ( 1954 ) .
If you missed the show , however , all that remains of “ The French Line ” is the poster , with its portrait of Russell , arching her back in a bustier , and supported by the delicate slogan “ J.R. in 3D : It ’ll Knock Both Your Eyes Out ! ”
There ’s no proof that Howard Hughes wrote that line , but it has his paw marks all over it .
“ Taza , Son of Cochise ” is a special case , because it starred Rock Hudson and was directed by Douglas Sirk .
Those for whom 3 - D is , by definition , doomed to frippery tend to claim that no one of any distinction or sensibility would touch the stuff ; yet a trawl through the record reveals any number of first - rate stars and directors who reached into the third dimension .
There was “ Dial M for Murder , ” which Hitchcock shot in 3 - D , although he was annoyed by the bulk of the camera .
There was Curtis Bernhardt ’s “ Miss Sadie Thompson , ” with Rita Hayworth , which proffered , among other delights , “ special clip - ons for those who already wear glasses . ”
John Farrow directed John Wayne in “ Hondo , ” and Rudolph Maté , who , as a cinematographer , had shot masterpieces such as “ The Passion of Joan of Arc ” and “ Gilda , ” directed Robert Mitchum and Jack Palance in “ Second Chance . ”
You could watch the Three Stooges , perhaps confusingly , in 3 - D , in “ Pardon My Backfire , ” and you could watch Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis in 3 - D in “ Money from Home . ” I still wonder how the première went .
Martin , living as he did in a bifurcated fuzz , was presumably the only man in history who could watch a 3 - D movie without needing the special glasses .
Yet , to be brutal , one has to ask : how many of these movies have endured , in any format , in the course of the fourth dimension ?
We still cling to “ Dial M for Murder , ” but mainly for Grace Kelly , and for Hitchcock ’s masterly handling of her trial scene .
To be fair , “ Kiss Me Kate , ” the M - G - M musical with Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel , was a 3 - D hit , though mainly for the Cole Porter songs , like “ Always True to You in My Fashion ” and “ Too Darn Hot , ” which existed long before the movie did and will resound after it has crumbled into dust .
“ Taza , Son of Cochise ” now feels like a hiatus in Sirk ’s career between “ All I Desire ” and “ Magnificent Obsession . ” 3 - D , he said , “ was just an experiment , ” and one is tugged toward the mean suspicion that , though often a boost to a film ’s immediate prospects , it soon became something that we could take or leave .
Worse still , it may have hardened into a hindrance .
When David Thomson , in “ The New Biographical Dictionary of Film , ” describes “ Inferno , ” a Robert Ryan picture of 1953 , as “ a modest venture , handicapped by 3D , ” is he revealing an unjust prejudice , or a bitter truth of the time ?
Certainly , Oliver Wendell Holmes could not have conceived of a more ironic fate for his beloved stereoscopy ; namely , that the very quest for depth should dwindle into a grim guarantee of superficiality .
Was it the blandishment of the quick shock which insured that , for seventy years or more , almost every adventure in 3 - D would wind up as little more than an extended Plastigram ?
As late as last year , in “ My Bloody Valentine , ” a naked blonde hurled a pistol across a parking lot at a no - good truck driver ’s head — or , apparently , through the screen and straight at our heads , for the sake of a passing “ Ooh , ” with no thought as to the rupture of dramatic flow .
That is why so many 3 - D films have taken refuge at the cheesier end of the market , in horror and pornography , where the slash of a knife or the swell of a bosom can allow the technique to strut its stuff .
This is fatal for the maturing of any medium , as the fundamental need to tell a story , or to conjure a subtlety of mood , is trounced and swept aside by the sudden opportunity to show off .
I clearly recall sitting through “ Amityville 3 - D ” and “ Friday the 13th , Part III ” and feeling the last traces of genuine atmosphere drain away , to be replaced by a litany of giggles .
As for “ Jaws 3 - D , ” I was mildly surprised that the offending shark should feel so much less frightening than it had in Spielberg ’s original , given that we were now being introduced , as it were , on a snout - to - snout basis .
The comedy of such encounters became inescapable , nowhere more so than when fish were replaced by the even wetter business of sex .
Laughter is never far from the conjoining of bodies onscreen ; it is , in its way , a hangover of our Puritan pudeur , but , with the approach of 3 - D , it drowned out any hope of a softer cry .
The heart , along with every other organ , sinks as one follows R. M. Hayes in his steady , alphabetical assessment of the boom in 3 - D erotica .
How relieved are you that you did n’t bruise your libido with a trip to “ Scoring ” or “ Campus Panty Raids ” or “ The Starlets ” ?
The last of these arrived in 1976 , in QuadraVision , of which Hayes remarks , with some severity , “ The fourth dimension was supposed to be the explicitness of the hardcore sex scenes . ”
The level of realism delivered by “ Secrets of Ecstasy ’ 72 , ” according to one advertisement , meant that “ you can almost feel the pulsing warmth , ” but the faint regret in that “ almost ” is fleshed out by an interview that Ray Zone conducted with Arnold Herr , who shot 3 - D porno films , mostly in the nineteen - seventies , for a company called Deep Vision .
His memories of “ The Playmates ” are fondly exact : “ She ’s grinding and moaning .
The camera moves up to her right breast .
Then you see this enormous tongue from the lower part of the frame move up and start to lick her breast . ”
The tongue in question , it transpires , came from a cow , though any fears that the rest of the cow was still attached to it are quickly laid to rest :
“ We had it on a broom handle and we had something under it to animate it .
We also spritzed it to make it look moist . ”
Clearly , something had to give .
This on - the - hoof inventiveness , though enterprising enough , offered almost nothing to serious filmmakers , and still less to cattle breeders .
If 3 - D was to stay alive , it had to break new ground .
By good fortune , the ground ahead was digital .
We should not be taken aback by the pace with which digital production has invaded our moviegoing and colonized our eyes .
Nonetheless , it is still bracing to take one ’s seat for Tim Burton ’s new “ Alice in Wonderland ” and realize how snugly the whole experience has accommodated itself to the shape of modern film .
For a start , there are the glasses .
Most early viewers knew only the anaglyph — a red lens over one eye , a blue or green one over the other , complementing the dual projection of the film itself .
The nineteen - thirties saw increased competition from polarizing glasses , each lens of which blocked out part of the light from the screen .
These two technologies have duked it out ever since .
Anaglyph , which was ideal for black - and - white , and seemed bound for the scrap heap , has enjoyed an odd resurgence among computer users , for 3 - D games .
But moviegoers no longer want to be fobbed off with a piece of torn - out cardboard and plastic , which begs to be bent and scratched ; they want to look like downhill skiers , their wraparound mirrored lenses flashing on the slopes .
Polarization , therefore — preferably circular rather than linear , which means that you can tilt your head without getting a bad case of color - bleed — has carried the day .
Then , there are the coming attractions .
When I saw “ Alice , ” all of them were in 3 - D ; a child being taken to the cinema for the first time would presume that no other options were available .
People sighed with comfortable anticipation at the imminence of “ Toy Story 3 , ” and rustled with bewilderment at “ Tron Legacy , ” which is apparently designed to trap us like rabbits inside a digital world .
Indeed , until Alice made her entrance , in the main feature , no real people had passed before our gaze .
“ Curiouser and curiouser , ” she said , having stepped through the tiny door into Wonderland , yet what followed grew less and less curious , as we realized how tightly Burton had stuck to the blueprint of twenty - first - century extravaganza .
Lewis Carroll ’s tale is as brisk and bright as the Victorian child at its heart , more anecdotal than plotted , and Burton , spotting this , overcompensates by trading the domestic for the apocalyptic .
Humans galumphing bareback on outsized beasts , and blasted war zones , where ignorant armies clash by night : we could be back in Narnia , or in the set pieces of “ The Golden Compass ” — leagues away from the spiky language games that enliven Carroll ’s pages .
The most troubling aspect is that , while 3 - D lends an undoubted texture to these duels and pursuits , it also makes them strangely obvious ; we now demand nothing less than constant , localized amazement , and we therefore get nothing more .
No one should play down the hard , ingenious labor that such a project entails , yet something about it , as Alice sprang through the darkened air and slew the Jabberwocky , felt too easy .
There is also the “ Avatar ” problem .
“ Alice in Wonderland ” was shot in two dimensions and then converted , during postproduction , into three , and , to a theatre full of pedants — which is what we have become — there are holes to pick in the screen .
The flora through which our heroine passes is every bit as luxuriant as we expected , but not once do we sense ourselves yearning to catch and stroke it as we did those glowing woodland floaters — half jellyfish , half thistledown — that bloomed from the digital mulch of “ Avatar . ”
The bar , in short , is being raised at a vertiginous rate , and today ’s 3 - D viewers deride the effects that felt so special in “ The Polar Express , ” all of six years ago .
Those smooth , not quite real faces in which the director , Robert Zemeckis , likes to deal ( and continues to deal , to judge by “ A Christmas Carol ” ) now verge on the embarrassing , such is our craving for an alternative world in which we can place our trust .
Before our eyes , the idea of 3 - D vision has gone from hobby to heavy industry , from a treat to an essential , and from a creed to a need .
For devotees , it had to happen :
For today ’s 3D , riding on all - digital production pipelines , the benefits extend far beyond principal photography into postproduction and distribution .
Considering that 1950 ’s 3D is said to have been crippled by image - quality issues that could n’t be tackled in the analog age , this distinction is crucial .
Basically , a digital 3D movie should not give you a headache .
That is Bernard Mendiburu , writing in “ 3D Movie Making : Stereoscopic Digital Cinema from Script to Screen ” ( 2009 ) .
As a technical manual , it bristles with good advice , but , as a book of prophecy , it will scare the pixellated daylights out of anyone over forty .
Once the newfangled 3 - D is up and running , Mendiburu proposes ,
it will be unavoidable and ubiquitous , to the point that the very mention of “ 3D ” will disappear from posters .
At some point in the near future , you will go to see a “ flattie ” for nostalgia ’s sake , just as you sometimes watch black - and - white movies on TV today .
I hate to break it to Mendiburu , but there are film lovers who still go to the cinema to watch flatties that are not merely in black - and - white but are sometimes silent , too .
And we do so not out of nostalgia but precisely because those films are anything but period pieces .
Not long ago , I saw a new print of “ Gun Crazy , ” Joseph H. Lewis ’s bad - couple thriller of 1950 , and it felt considerably more dangerous and less dated than most of the new releases .
Not that such danger will deter the acolytes of 3 - D , who , far from scorning our preferences , will kindly offer to help .
According to recent reports , Reliance Big Entertainment , the Mumbai - based company that last year invested three hundred and twenty - five million dollars in DreamWorks Studios , has entered into partnership with In - Three , a California firm that converts 2 - D movies to 3 - D .
And not just new 2 - D , but old 2 - D as well .
If all goes according to plan , “ Twelve Angry Men ” could be coming back .
And they ’ll be angrier than ever .
There is more in this announcement to startle the movie nut than in any rumor of “ Avatar 2 : Blue Crush . ”
Faced with the thought of a 3 - D “ Casablanca , ” one is torn between outrage at such blind desecration and a sneaking wish to know — well , what the hell would it look like ?
The mind runs riot , in search of screenings past .
Imagine the older couple dancing , with slow grace , in “ The Magnificent Ambersons , ” with the younger pair behind them , watching in admiration from the stairs ; imagine the gentle ascent of the camera , at the end of “ Ugetsu Monogatari , ” as the child lays an offering on his mother ’s grave , and we gaze beyond him to the workers , with griefs and rituals of their own , toiling in the distant fields ; imagine the arrival of the train at the start of “ Once Upon a Time in the West , ” with those seamed , all - knowing faces so close to us and the railroad stretching so far ; imagine the flirtatious darting between trees , in “ Smiles of a Summer Night , ” as the maid half seeks to flee the randy groom in the background , both of them blessed and maddened by the midnight sun .
All these scenes depend on figures held in separate planes , and on the unspoken feelings that brim in the spaces between them ; would it weaken or intensify those feelings if the spaces were given solid form ?
Try asking Patrick von Sychowski , the chief operating officer at Reliance MediaWorks , quoted in the London Times : “ You ca n’t just press a button and have a computer do it .
You have to take artistic decisions , such as what ’s going to appear in the foreground . ”
Ah .
It is no slur on the skills of Reliance and In - Three to suggest that , statistically , they are unlikely to have a Welles , a Mizoguchi , a Leone , and a Bergman all sharing the same water cooler in Mumbai .
Maybe the past should be left in peace .
On the other hand , a name as distinguished as any of those was behind the most messianic tribute ever paid to 3 - D. Sergei Eisenstein , in his last article , published in 1949 , wrote that “ mankind has for centuries been moving towards stereoscopic cinema . ”
Hostility to such progress told of a reactionary stubbornness : “ Does not the musty conservatism with which news of work on the stereoscopic front is met in the West sound absurd and , in its way , insulting to the eternally developing tendencies of a genuinely vital art ? ”
Even if you ’re not convinced that “ Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs ” did that much to overthrow , or even lightly radicalize , a snoozing bourgeoisie , you have to be stirred by Eisenstein ’s call to arms , not least when he summons , as a witness , a passage from his own film “ Ivan the Terrible , Part I ” :

Sure , the R8 is no lame duck , and this is even more so once the sports car has been tuned by ABT Sportsline .
The result is a real model athlete , which does not just ooze power , but also does n't have a single gram of fat on its body .
With the limited version R8 GT R ( with only 25 units available ) engineers and designers have gone one logical step further : experience from motorsport flowed into the design , and all the components have been systematically trimmed to ensure a light - weight construction and optimal weight distribution .
As a result not just the bonnet , front and rear aprons , the adjustable rear wing or the tailgate are made of carbon , but the outline edge on the rear , the external mirrors and the door panel are also made of the same material .
The side windows are made of Makrolon - the high - tech polycarbonate does not just reduce weight , but also has impressive strength properties .
The result : the ABT R8 GT R is a proud 100 kilos lighter than its series counterpart .
How much motorsport the team , which comprises the current winners of the DTM and the ADAC GT Masters , actually brings to the road can be seen from the details : Recaro racing seats , a 4 - point seat belt system , stainless steel roll - over bar with seat belt attachment , hand - held fire extinguisher or an ABT Sports steering wheel made of carbon – the people at ABT have thought of everything .
" The R8 GT R is an uncompromising racing car for the road , and provides maximum performance " , states Christian Abt .
The successful motorsport racer indicates his responsibility for the development of this extraordinary vehicle and is impressed with the result .
" I recommend trying the GT R on a racing track from time to time , as the car is great fun to drive there " , says the General Manager of ABT who is responsible for technology .
The adjustable front panel allows sports inserts ; the ABT driver overalls , helmet , racing shoes and gloves are just as much as part of the effective GT R special equipment as an on - board video system and the expandable data module .
The well - trained sports car has enormous performance potential : instead of the series - standard 525HP ( 386 kW ) , the 5.2 FSI in the ABT R8 GT R provides a massive 620HP ( 456 kW ) and as a result the light car travels extremely quickly : the top speed is 325 km/h , it does 0 - 100 km/h in just 3.2 seconds and the GT R reaches the 200 km / h mark in a mere 9.9 seconds .
In order to ensure that the power can be optimally applied on the road and on the race track , height - adjustable ABT Sports suspension and adjustable dampers are standard on the ABT R8 GT R .
The ceramic brake system with modified brake pads has been adjusted to meet the enormous performance potential of the super sports car .
The extremely light ABT CR alloys round off the package .
On the front axle they are mounted in 9x18 inch and on the rear axle in 11x18 inch .
The Michelin sports cup tyres are the perfect choice for the car .
The ABT R8 GT R is a unique vehicle which provides maximum driving enjoyment .
It has been designed for driving at the limit : from the weight - optimised exhaust unit to the ABT Titanium special coating – ABT 's love of motorsport can be seen in every detail .
Lotus Racing and CNN International have today announced a partnership deal that sees the new team entering into a long - term agreement with the world ’s leading news network .
CNN ’s world famous logos will feature on the T127 race cars , the drivers ’ overalls and on all team clothing .
The deal will be managed by CNN ’s commercial Partner Solutions Group and is led by Rani Raad , senior vice president CNN International Advertising Sales .
“ The combination of two such iconic and aspirational global brands fits perfectly with CNN International ’s worldwide reach and brand positioning , ” said Raad .
“ This unique partnership with Lotus Racing takes CNN International into a new era of marketing and promotions and puts us in front of a worldwide audience of millions . ”
It is not clear how the deal will work but it will probably be similar to that which existed between Williams and Reuters , which was mainly used for top level corporate entertainment for customers of the news agency .
The CNN brand hardly needs more international exposure .

The scheme 's backers say that it will allow people to filter adult content A plan to create an internet domain specifically for adult websites will be resurrected three years after it was rejected by internet regulators .
The net 's governing body Icann will reconsider the .xxx scheme on 12 March .
Icann had previously given the domain the go ahead in 2005 , but reversed the decision two years later amidst protests from US conservative groups .
An independent review recently concluded that decision was unfair and that the plan should be reconsidered .
Icann ( Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ) has now confirmed to BBC News that its board will discuss the plan at its meeting in Nairobi , Kenya and could decide to back the proposals .
" If the contract is signed , we could be selling names by the end of the year , " said Stuart Lawley , chairman of ICM Registry , which put forward the plans for .xxx and would sell the domain names .
' Landmark decision '
The idea for a .xxx domain was first proposed in 2001 and was approved by Icann four years later .
The scheme is intended to create a silo for pornography on the internet .
" Those that do want to see it can ; those that do n't can filter it out , " explained Mr Lawley .
A season of reports from 8 - 19 March 2010 exploring the extraordinary power of the internet , including : Digital giants - top thinkers in the business on the future of the web Mapping the internet - a visual representation of the spread of the web over the last 20 years Global Voices - the BBC links up with an online community of bloggers around the world
BBC SuperPower season
However , the scheme is voluntary and adult sites will still be able to use other domains such as .com .
In 2007 , Icann overturned its original decision to allow .xxx domains to be sold amidst a firestorm of protest from conservative groups , predominately in the US , which opposed the plan on moral grounds .
Recently an arbitration panel of retired judges at the International Centre for Dispute Resolution ruled that the plan should be revisited after analysing evidence about the alleged interference .
" Our claim was that Icann came up with a lot of different excuses , " said Mr Lawley .
The board concluded that Icann 's decision to reject the .xxx plan was " not consistent with the application of neutral , objective and fair documented policy " and should be revisited .
Mr Lawley described it as a " landmark " ruling .
The non-binding decision will now be discussed by Icann on 12 March and a decision will be made whether to reconsider its approach to .xxx .
A spokesperson for Icann said there was " no indication what action the ICANN board will take " .
However , it is unlikely to overturn the decision immediately without consulting other members of Icann and the internet community .
The news comes as the sex.com domain , often described as one of the most valuable internet domain names , comes up for auction .
The web address is due to be sold in New York on 18 March with a starting price of $ 1 m ( £ 670,000 ) .

Who will ever forget the first time they saw the 45 - second shower - room murder in Hitchcock 's Psycho ?
I remember 1959 and 1961 as the years when my first two children were born .
But the first thing that comes to mind about the year in between was seeing Psycho , which I 'd been looking forward to since a radio programme I 'd produced the previous October , when Hitchcock had enticingly described Psycho as " my first real horror film " .
Entering the Plaza , Lower Regent Street , the day the film opened , I passed the cardboard cut - out of Hitchcock in the foyer , from which a tape recording of the Master 's familiar Leytonstone undertaker 's voice warned us what would happen if we gave away the ending .
Half an hour into the movie , when Janet Leigh stared out at us from the floor , a man sitting in front of me staggered into the aisle and vomited : testimony to the sensitive stomachs of the time , or ( as several other people I know witnessed a similar incident at the Plaza that week ) evidence that Paramount 's publicity department had hired a method actor for the film 's opening run ?
Such indelibly iconic moments have been part of moviegoing since the Lumière brothers ' first public screening of a dozen short scenes in December 1895 .
One of them had the audience recoiling from a train entering a station , another had them chuckling when a cheeky boy tricked a gardener into spraying himself with a hosepipe .
People judge a movie by the strength of its story and overall impact , but ultimately what they remember are individual moments and sequences .
This perhaps reflects the very nature of film , which is a rapid succession of still pictures that provide an illusion of motion .
And until the coming of cassettes and DVDs , few of us were able to see a picture over and over again or re-view a sequence .
So we had to replay it in our minds , and naturally we 'd often get it wrong .
Which is how " Play it again , Sam " entered the language instead of : " Play it , Sam , play ' As Time Goes By ' . "
James Stewart seems to have been thinking of this approach to cinema when he talked to Peter Bogdanovich about his craft : " What you 're doing is … you 're giving people little … little , tiny pieces of time … that they never forget . "
This is echoed by Walker Percy in his 1961 novel The Moviegoer .
Some people , his narrator says , " treasure memorable moments in their lives : the time one climbed the Parthenon at sunrise " , but " what I remember is the time John Wayne killed three men with a carbine as he was falling to the dusty street in Stagecoach , and the time the kitten found Orson Welles in the doorway in The Third Man " .
Likewise Jean - Dominique Bauby , the paralysed French writer , describes in The Diving Bell and the Butterfly how he'd lie in the hospital recreating favourite scenes from Touch of Evil , Stagecoach , Moonfleet and Pierrot le fou .
Canny film - makers have cottoned on to the idea , like James Cameron , who says : " You try to create one or more emotional , epiphanous moments within a film . "
These moments come in many forms – simple , complex , lyrical , violent , gentle , witty , romantic , revelatory – and , if they stick , become as real as any other memory .
They can range from the split - second close - up of the suave spy 's missing half - finger in Hitchcock 's
The 39 Steps to the protracted pursuit of Cary Grant by the crop - dusting plane in North by Northwest , from the in - your - face eye - slicing in Buñuel 's first silent movie , the avant - garde Un Chien Andalou , to the puzzling sequence of the Chinese businessman 's mysterious box in the same director 's mainstream success Belle de Jour 40 years later .
Like your favourite jokes , your cherished movie moments reveal something about you and , if shared , they can be the beginning of a beautiful friendship , especially if one of them is the final sequence in Casablanca that features that line .
My own favourites ?
The Odessa Steps sequence from Battleship Potemkin .
The love at first sight between John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara in The Quiet Man , the lust at first sight between Fred McMurray and Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity .
The children running through the woods to see a train in Pather Panchali and finding grandmother dead on the way back .
The cruelly comic soccer match in Loach 's Kes. Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie making love in a Venetian hotel in Do n't Look Now .
The slow - motion mayhem let loose in The Wild Bunch after William Holden says : " If they move , kill 'em ! "
Perhaps my single favourite moment comes in Citizen Kane , where Kane 's now elderly friend Bernstein tells the reporter about an epiphanic memory of seeing a girl in a white dress on the New Jersey ferry in 1896 .
" I 'll bet a month has n't gone by since that I have n't thought of that girl . "
It 's a moment about remembering a moment , and the actor Everett Sloane makes it so vivid we think we 've seen that girl ourselves .
THE FRENCH CONNECTION ( 1971 ) - THE SUBWAY CHASE
Gene Hackman gets behind the wheel for The French Connection 's famous car chase .
Photograph : Ronald Grant Archive
Chosen by Ryan Fleck , the American indie film director , writer , editor and cinematographer , best known for co-writing and co-directing with partner Anna Boden Half Nelson and Sugar correct ( out now on DVD ) .
The villain's on the elevated subway .
You think he 's going to get away because a person on foot can't keep up with the subway …
But Gene Hackman jumps in a car and starts chasing the subway , riding underneath it , going at 80 mph , swerving in and out of traffic .
I first saw this scene on video when I was 18 or 19 , in college .
I loved it .
In action scenes nowadays you can chalk everything up to some kind of computer effect .
Audiences no longer really believe that what they 're seeing exists anymore .
When The French Connection was made that notion did n't really occur to people .
What you saw was usually really happening in front of the lens .
It was raw .
I did a little bit of research about how they shot the scene .
Phenomenal .
Basically they just did it .
There was no security blocking off other traffic , just Hackman in a car with a camera mounted on the front .
They went crazy , lost their minds , and went for it .
It was the kind of thing that you just would never get away with these days .
I 'm editing a movie right now that has a teenager walking on the Brooklyn Bridge , considering suicide .
He steps out on to a ledge , over traffic …
It never even occurred to put the actual kid out on the ledge , on a bridge , over traffic because we knew there was no way authorities would let us do that .
So there 's camera trickery .
Back in the 70s we'd have just thrown a child out over the ledge , seen what happened , and shot it .
JULES ET JIM ( 1962 ) - THE BICYCLE SCENE
Truffaut 's Jules et Jim .
Photograph : BFI
Chosen by Ken Loach , writer / director of the influential docudrama Cathy Come Home , and director of nearly 30 films including Kes , Riff - Raff , My Name is Joe and Looking for Eric .
He won the 2006 Palme d'Or at Cannes for The Wind that Shakes the Barley .
This scene always cheers you up .
Jeanne Moreau and the two guys on their bicycles in the sun in France , the music that goes with it …
Partly it evokes what you imagine to be the perfect French vacation but also it's a very fine bit of film - making .
When you 're in the business and have been in the business a long time , you tend to dismember about 99 % of films as you 're watching .
The time when you used to watch a film just for enjoyment is difficult to recapture .
But just occasionally a film will transcend that .
The sense of enjoyment with this trio on their bicycles is perennial .
It 's completely evocative of that carefree young moment , the age when people are carefree .
And then of course , for these three , it will all be ruined by the war .
The song that was composed for the film – " Le tourbillon " – became very famous .
I 'd sing it for you if I was n't surrounded by colleagues who would take the piss .
I think film music that tells you what to think is cheap – the film should do that without that prompting .
But in Jules et Jim it is music in relation to the images , the music has an independent existence and there 's a relationship between the two .
It is not something subterranean , there to steer you through every second and push you into feelings that the pictures do n't generate themselves .
ALL ABOUT EVE ( 1950 ) - BILL'S BIRTHDAY PARTY
Bette Davis and Gary Merrill in All About Eve. Photograph : British Film Institute
Chosen by Beeban Kidron , who came to international attention directing the BBC 's adaptation of Jeanette Winterson 's novel Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit in 1990 .
She has since directed several feature films including Bridget Jones : The Edge of Reason and To Wong Foo , Thanks for Everything , Julie Newmar .
Every single line in this scene is quotable .
It 's the most beautifully written thing , from an era of cinema very closely knitted to the theatre , when the words were supposed to evoke things rather than just be things for people to say while the pictures were going on .
That 's something that 's very often lost 60 years later .
Margo , played by Bette Davis , is a great Broadway actress at the pinnacle of her power : brilliant , sophisticated , bitchy .
Her assistant Eve , meanwhile , played by Anne Baxter , is simpering , beautiful and very , very ambitious .
Eve is trying to replace Margo , trying to get her next part on Broadway and take her lover , Bill .
This is the scene where Margo finally loses her rag , having waited upstairs for Bill to throw him a party before discovering that he 's been downstairs with Eve for 20 minutes .
The scene sums up the central themes of the film , to do with Margo 's insecurity about age and about the way that Eve is eating into her life .
This is referred to in the dialogue all the time : Margo finds Eve and Bill talking and immediately asks if she can join in – " Or is n't it a story for grown - ups ? "
Bette Davis , despite being so powerful , gives a phenomenal performance of insecurity .
That is very , very rarely drawn in the cinema .
The question of ageing and of being replaced by the younger , more beautiful woman is something we can still understand today .
JASON & THE ARGONAUTS ( 1963 ) - THE SKELETONS SCENE
Ray Harryhausen's Jason & the Argonauts Photograph : Everett Collection / Rex Feature
Chosen by Nick Park , Oscar - winning animator and writer / director of the Wallace and Gromit films .
As a boy I was into monsters , heroes going off on adventures – and stop - motion animation .
I saw trailers for this film and it seemed to be everything I wanted .
I remember being at a school fair , just before Christmas , and being desperate to get home to watch it .
The scene that stood out the most , that I found both horrifying and enthralling , was the skeleton fight at the end .
The heroes are all live action and the monsters are all done with stop - frame animation .
It was a terrific technical feat – I think there were eight animated skeletons or more , cut together quite seamlessly with the live action .
The whole choreography of it was amazing .
But the story , too , really caught my imagination .
These skeletons were planted like seeds , by a wizard chap spreading dragons teeth , and then dead soldiers grow up to fight the Argonauts .
So exciting .
At around the same time I saw Ray Harryhausen , the animator , explain on television how he had done the skeletons .
I immediately went and built my own models with wire and foam – I think I was planning to film something with my friends , live action , cut together with a sea monster made out of a coat hanger and nylon tights .
Disney films did n't make me want to go home and do it myself because it was shrouded in mystery and technique .
But when I saw the skeletons in Harryhausen 's film I wanted immediately to do it myself , because you got a sense of how it might be done .
2001 : A SPACE ODYSSEY ( 1968 ) - THE FINAL SCENE
The Star Child from 2001 : A Space Odyssey .

Chosen by Stephen Poliakoff .
After starting out as a playwright , Poliakoff turned to writing and directing television dramas including Shooting the Past , Perfect Strangers and the award - winning The Lost Prince .
His feature films include Hidden City and most recently Glorious 39 .
Still , after 40 years , people are arguing about the ending of 2001 : A Space Odyssey .
What the ending means to the film .
The computer taking over , the menacing computer howl , the foetus – it has passed into cinema folklore .
Science fiction was not a genre that attracted me much , and it was very unsexy in the 1960s .
But Kubrick 's film was the most original I had ever seen .
It came at me for the first time , completely alone , in a cinema on a summer afternoon in 1968 .
I was 15 , and it made an extraordinary impression on me .
There was a lot more mainstream " auteur cinema " than there is now , Hollywood studios producing personal films .
Nevertheless Kubrick stood alone , a titanic figure that obsessively made films , under great secrecy , and with nobody interfering .
I had never seen such a bold use of cinema , and certainly never such an incredibly obscure ending .
To have spent all that time and money and to have the daring – some would say foolhardy daring , but nevertheless a magnificent daring – to end the film on such an elusive and obscure note , I found it amazing as a 15 - year - old that anybody should have the balls to do that .
It excited me and changed my whole view of what you could do as a writer , whatever medium you were attempting – Kubrick 's aspiration to be original .
Now it 's been much imitated but 2001 was extraordinarily ahead of its time , and has continued to survive and influence generations .
TAXI DRIVER ( 1976 ) - THE MIRROR SCENE

Chosen by Stephen Woolley , the award - winning producer best known for his collaborations with director Neil Jordan including Interview with the Vampire and The Crying Game .
Recent projects include How To Lose Friends and Alienate People and the forthcoming Made in Dagenham .
In 2005 he made his directorial debut with Stoned .
I remember seeing Taxi Driver for the first time in Paris in the 70s .
The taxi gliding across New York 's wet streets , smoke coming out of the subways , it was all incredibly delicious .
It had this thundery Bernard Herrmann score , and when Robert De Niro did his " are you talking to me ? " sequence in front of the mirror you suddenly sensed the degree of anger there .
It was all bottled up until he explodes with this bravura performance .
It 's very clever , very economical , everything concentrated on his eyes .
Sequences like this are not only successful because they are so beautifully created but also because they often come at a point in a film where you begin to realise where it 's going , you think , " oh my god , I know what this is about " .
Here you become aware that not only is Travis Bickle schizophrenic but he 's aware of his own schizophrenia .
He 's like a genie in a bottle and you 're waiting for him to let the genie out – which he does brilliantly in that horrific sequence later on where he shoots Harvey Keitel 's character and saves Jodie Foster's .
The scene was improvised but De Niro had tried out a version of it in an earlier film he made with Brian De Palma , I think it 's called Hi Mom !
I did n't see it until years after watching Taxi Driver and I remember thinking " I can't believe it – the thing he does in Taxi Driver ! "
CARRIE ( 1976 ) - THE BLOOD AT THE PROM SCENE

Photograph : Ronald Grant
Chosen by Edgar Wright , who co-created Channel 4's Spaced , and has collaborated with comedian Simon Pegg on hit films Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz .
His latest directing project , Scott Pilgrim vs the World , is out later this year .
I always describe Carrie as the Grease of horror movies : it resonates with all ages because everybody remembers their awkward teenage phase and can watch it and say – I was the bully or the victim or the person who did nothing .
It explores how apocalyptic your rage can be as a teenager .
Carrie 's not a killer , she 's a girl who has been bullied and through a terrible confluence of events ends up burning the school down .
It 's also unusual for a horror film .
It does n't have someone being killed every 20 minutes and then a climax – it builds to one huge climax at the prom .
School bullies have fixed the prom so that Carrie White will win and they can humiliate her by tipping a bucket of pig 's blood over her in front of the whole school .
The scene and the excruciating build - up to it is one of the greatest set pieces of all time , full of suspense , with a monumental payoff .
A crane shot sets up the sequence so you know where everyone is positioned and that the bucket of blood is above Carrie and Tommy 's heads .
Once the plot is set in motion Pino Donaggio 's score takes over .
The resulting sequence is pure opera .
I first saw Carrie on VHS with my brother 's friend when I was about 12 .
I obsessively read about horror movies and was dying to see it .
I 've watched it so many times since .
De Palma planned the sequence for months and battled the studio over the time spent on filming it .
But it was worth the blood , sweat and tears .
It still leaves audiences speechless .
REAR WINDOW ( 1954 ) - THE OPENING SCENE
James Stewart in Rear Window .

Subsequent films include Good Work and 35 Shots of Rum .
Her latest , White Material , is out in the summer .
We do n't have courtyards in France like they do in New York , where Hitchcock 's film is set , but we have street buildings that are set very close to each other .
From where I stand in my kitchen or my bedroom I can watch neighbours ' windows very easily .
I 'm intrigued by voyeurism , about what is behind windows , and often in my films I stage a scene as if I was peeping in from outside .
The situation Hitchcock establishes in the opening scene of Rear Window is the ultimate voyeuristic situation .
The character played by James Stewart has broken his leg , has nothing to do but linger behind his window and watch .
He is passive but eager to find something – to be a witness of something , or to give his imagination something to chew on .
As a spectator in a cinema theatre , you are a sort of prisoner in a chair , like he is .
Poor farming practices have degraded the world ’s soils causing them to release carbon that should have stayed in the soil .
In the past 150 years soils have released twice as much carbon as fuel burning .
Improved farming methods could quickly rebuild degraded land and store enough carbon to offset the damage already done by fuel burning .
Dr Rattan Lal of Ohio State University , a leading expert on soil carbon , estimates that the potential of economical carbon sequestration in world soils may be .65 billion to 1.1 billion tons per year for the next 50 years .
This is enough to draw down atmospheric CO2 by 50 ppm by 2100 .
This is a one - time opportunity , however .
We must ultimately stop burning fossil fuels .
Man has already degraded about five billion acres of land on the planet by misguided farming practices and overgrazing .
In fact , many of the world ’s deserts were once rich land .
Desertification from overgrazing , plowing and growing annual crops has greatly reduced the carbon retained in the earth ’s soils .
Many of our deserts started as forests that were cut or burned down to clear the land and then ruined by overgrazing .
If we could reclaim these ruined lands we could restore the carbon balance of our planet .
We have only recently begun to understand the destructive effects of plowing and grazing .
The delicate surface crust is an almost invisible biotic network of algae , cyanobacteria and lichens that hold the soil together with tiny filaments .
This thin crust takes in an amazing amount of CO2 by photosynthesis and also fixes the nitrogen in the air to a form usable by plants .
Tilling the soil breaks up and buries the biotic crust , stopping photosynthesis .
The dust bowl in Oklahoma in the 1930s was an example of the bad effects of plowing the land .
Wind and erosion almost turned that once - rich grassland into a desert .
In China and Africa the sand dunes have been advancing southward , turning more and more land into sterile deserts .
Dust storms in the Gobi desert often block the sun in Beijing and many Saharan dust storms ultimately evolve into the hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico .
One very encouraging project in China has restored a desert community and given it a source of revenue growing sand willow for making wood planks .
This experiment was so successful that the restored area is growing rapidly as more individuals plant sand willow as a source of income .
Even more exciting , is the plan to build hybrid solar power plants in the area that will use the sand willow as biomass to feed boilers when the sun does n’t shine .
Esolar will provide heliostats and a solar tower for generating solar power in the daytime .
The same turbines will be driven at night by steam , generated by burning the sand willow .
A total of two gigawatts of these hybrid power plants are planned .
The sand willow matures in only three years and quickly regrows when cut .
Villagers sell sand willow timber to plank companies for $ 30 / ton .
This economic boom has driven more and more plantings which are greening of the desert .
Once a beachhead is established , the local micro climate is changed .
Trees provide shade and shelter from the desert winds .
Ultimately moisture brings clouds and increases in rainfall .
A whole new ecosystem evolves .
Carbon credits could drive this kind of renaissance even faster .
It is very important that we develop inexpensive soil carbon monitoring systems so that such important changes in land use can be rewarded .
Farmers are already receiving millions of dollars for no -till farming in the U.S. but some have challenged their legitimacy as being “ non-additional . ”
Hopefully , projects with multiple benefits will not be deprived of the carbon credits that could drive the fast progress we need .
A “ green wall ” project has been proposed by the UN that will plant trees along a 7000 km strip on the current southern edge of the Sahara desert .
It is floundering now for lack of money but carbon credits for land restoration could restore it to health .
One of the biggest challenges is re-educating people in degraded areas to keep them from turning these areas back into a desert .
Grazing goats and sheep were practical only when population density was much less than it is today .
Under crowded conditions animal hooves quickly trample the soil crust .
Denuded plant life soon leads to erosion and desertification .
Goats and sheep are particularly destructive as they pull up vegetation by the roots .
Too much of our agriculture has been dedicated to feeding animals , which is inefficient at best .
It takes 15 pounds of grain to produce one pound of beefsteak .
Fish , being cold blooded , are much more efficient .
They eat as little as two pounds per pound of meat .
The “ green revolution ” doubled cereal production between 1961 and 1985 .
Unfortunately , much of the increase was based on use of cheap fossil fuels to make fertilizers , pesticides and herbicides and to irrigate and cultivate the land .
The energy content of food has reached frightening levels .
Worse yet , the whole philosophy of this movement treats nature as an enemy to be conquered .
Other plants , insects and microbes are simply poisoned .
Unfortunately , the result of all of this has been degraded soils that need even more chemicals .
Good healthy soil can hold three times more carbon than the plants themselves , mostly in the form of humus , bacteria , algae and other organic matter .
The University of Illinois has maintained corn-growing test plots for over 100 years .
Since 1955 synthetic nitrogen fertilization has been applied , which contained 90 - 124 tons of carbon per acre .
Today , all of that residue has disappeared into the atmosphere adding to global warming and there has been a decrease in soil carbon of 4.9 tons per acre .
Today , there is a healthy revival of permaculture principles that work with nature instead of against it .
Annual crops only do photosynthesis during the growing season , leaving bare dirt the rest of the year .
By growing perennials , the root mass and the biotic community can grow steadily larger year after year instead of starting from scratch .
Roots go deeper and deeper with each season , increasing drought resistance .
Yearlong Green Farming maximizes carbon storage in the soil by keeping soil covered with greenery all year long .
The world ’s soils hold three times as much carbon as the atmosphere and four times as much as all of the plants in the world .
A large part of the carbon storage is in the biotic soil community and humus , which forms only when the community is kept intact .
Restoration experiments in Australia found that conventional cropping practices had reduced soil carbon to half to one third of original levels .
Biomass can be grown from perennial grasses harvested regularly like a lawn that is repeatedly mowed .
This allows undisturbed roots to continue to grow larger every year .
Symbiotic fungi called mycorrhizae form an association with the roots , which can increase their efficiency by a factor of ten .
They are powered by the grasses ’ metabolism but pay back by creating nitrogen and collecting nutrients .
By putting rows or clumps of perennial grasses in fields of other crops , yield can be increased while collecting carbon credits .
In some cases 8 tons of CO2 stored per acre per year have been recorded with virtually no biomass inputs .
The more the soil has been degraded , the easier it is to earn credits with changes that store significant carbon .
A recent study by Stanford University ’s Carnegie Institution identified 1.8 million square miles of abandoned farmland worldwide .
Heavy use of chemical fertilizers is unnecessary if the soil ’s crust is kept intact .
Even in barren deserts specialized cyanobacteria on the very top surface remove CO2 and nitrogen from the air through photosynthesis .
They protect and colaborate with other species in the next layer that fix the nitrogen but cannot stand oxygen .
These species have coevolved to work together to hold the soil together and support the growth of more complex vascular plants .
Almost invisible to the naked eye , this crust ecosystem stabilizes the soil while fixing carbon and nitrogen .
When the delicate crust community is destroyed , plants starve for nitrogen unless they are given massive fertilizer applications .
Chemical fertilizers are an environmental nightmare which release lots of nitrous oxide into the air .
Nitrous oxide is 298 times worse than CO2 as a greenhouse gas .
Fertilizers also pollute streams , consume fossil fuels and emit CO2 in their manufacture .
Bioinoculants can restore degraded soils by adding natural microorganisms that greatly reduce the need for chemical fertilizers and even water in the soil .
Dramatic increases in soil carbon are possible in a single season .
Damaged soil crusts could be healed by aerial spraying of tiny amounts of cyanobacteria mixtures which remain viable through long periods of dryness yet rehydrate and begin growing within minutes of receiving rain or even dew condensation .
Cyanobacteria were responsible for creating the oxygen on our planet from CO2 billions of years ago .
Perhaps they can help us to rescue the planet today .
Another promising approach to greening deserts is seawater farming .
Coastal desert areas lacking fresh water can grow plants like Mangrove and Salicornia along with fish and shrimp that provide the fertilizer .
The first commercial - scale saltwater farm was built by the Seawater Foundation on a barren desert in Eritrea , on the west coast of the Red Sea .
Before the project , ecologists found only 13 species of wild birds in the area .
By the time the farm was completed in 2002 , the count had increased to 200 .
Here is a movie about that farm .
Another massive farm is planned for Abu Dhabi .
Boing and Honeywell are partners in the project , which will grow salt - water biomass to be used for making green fuel for jet aircraft .
There are 25,000 miles of coastal desert in the world that could be developed in this way .
Carbon trading could be the driver for these projects if we can only develop sound verification protocols and measuring instruments .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - A California voter initiative that would legalize possession and sale of marijuana has qualified for the November ballot , state election officials said on Wednesday , in what supporters called a “ watershed moment ” for their cause .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Passage of the measure , by no means certain , would make California the first U.S. state to legalize marijuana .
Backers believe the state could be at the vanguard of a national movement toward decriminalizing the drug .
“ This is a watershed moment in the decades - long struggle to end marijuana prohibition in this country , ” said Stephen Gutwillig , California director of the Drug Policy Alliance , which has spearheaded the ballot initiative .
“ Banning marijuana outright has been a disaster , fueling a massive , increasingly brutal underground economy , wasting billions in scarce law enforcement resources and making criminals out of countless law - abiding citizens , ” he said .
California Secretary of State Debra Bowen said in a written statement that her office had certified the measure for the November 2 general election ballot after backers submitted the required number of signatures on petitions .
Bowen said that proponents , who needed 433,971 valid signatures to qualify for the ballot , had submitted 694,248 that were verified through a random sampling .
POLLS SHOW MANY SUPPORT MEASURE
Legalizing marijuana appears to have broad support in the state , with some 56 percent of Californians surveyed in an April , 2009 Field Poll saying they favored making it legal for social use and taxing the sales proceeds .
In October , Gallup found 44 percent of Americans favored legalization .
Activists have suggested that taxing marijuana sales could help bail out the cash - strapped state , but plenty of Californians still oppose marijuana .
“ With legalization of recreational marijuana use , impaired driving , fatalities , injuries and crashes will go up , and we do n’t want to see that , ” California Mothers Against Drunk Driving spokesman Silas Miers said .
The measure ’s qualification for the ballot was “ the first step toward its defeat , ” said John Lovell , a lobbyist who represents a number of law enforcement groups .
Critics also say the social costs of a free - smoking state far outweigh the money it would bring in .
They say that the already enormous societal damage from alcohol and tobacco use would only increase if people were allowed to legally sell and smoke pot .
Under the initiative , simple possession of an ounce ( 28.5 grams ) or less of marijuana , currently a misdemeanor offense punishable by a $ 100 fine , would be legal for anyone at least 21 .
It also would be lawful to grow limited amounts in one ’s own home for personal use .
While sales would not be legalized outright , cities and counties could pass laws permitting commercial distribution subject to local regulations and taxes .
Retail sales would still be limited to an ounce for adults 21 and older .

Disclaimer : I realise I am an unsociable bastard .
And that it may be " just me " - in which case this makes no sense .
And I guess it offends that kind of " be positive " American sensibility ( which I know is one of your strengths , even if I find it creepy ) .
But damn there are a lot of idiots out there .
I read stuff in various places and I think , " must remember not to bother with them " .
But then I forget .
So I want the inverse of an RSS feed , or a Twitter subscription : I want something that tracks people I do n't want to be bothered with .
And then filters them out .
The result might , for example , grey - out their comments on web sites .
I can see various technical difficulties : detecting persistent identities across multiple sites ; associating content with particular people on multiple sites ; modifying HTML on sites with unknown structure .
But I can also see that we 're getting close to this been possible : single sign on is a big help ; people seem to be getting better at interpreting social relationships and constructing social graphs .
So , is this possible ?
Is anyone going to build it ?

Squeak on Android 13 February , 2010
Andreas Raab has announced a new home for some work he ’s been doing recently to port Squeak to the Android platform :
http://code.google.com/p/squeak-android-vm/
He ’s aware that lots of things are still missing that would be required to support a full port ( including text input and network support ) .
But he ’s still interested to hear if ( and how well ) it works for other Android - based cell phones .
So if you have a Motorola Droid or or a T - Mobile G1 give it a shot and post some benchmark results .
Andreas reports that “ performance on the Nexus One is about what one would expect :
With roughly 1 M sends / sec and 30 M bytecodes / sec it ’s not exactly rocking but it ’s quite usable for most tasks on a mobile device .
( Input is * terrible * though ; Squeak ’s UI is not made for fat - fingered clicks like mine :-) ”
If you ’d like to be added as developer , please send Andreas your Google Account email address so that he can add you to the project .
But , he warns that “ unless you know how to deal with both the Android SDK and NDK , Java , JNI , and the Squeak VM it will be a very steep learning curve ” .
( Of course , for those of us still using iPhones , there also John McIntosh ’s iPhone port of Squeak . )
OMFG LJ HAS NEW ICONS .

Thanks , Mike Huckabee .
And health care reform will NOT GIVE US SOCIALIZED MEDICINE .
Hell , it wo n't even give us universal health care or government run health care .
It 'll just make it easier for people to be covered and will stop things like pre-existing condition exclusions .

The Texas 200 is a “ Raid ” - type event ; that is , it involves a scheduled gathering of small boats traveling more or less in company from Point A to Point B over a period of several days , camping along the way .
The Texas 200 goes through the Laguna Madre and the bays of South Texas for five to six days and about 200 miles .
Shallow draft boats will have options in terms of routes through the bays , while deeper draft vessels will spend more time in the Intracoastal Waterway ( ICW ) .
For any who may be unfamiliar with the ICW , it follows the Atlantic and Gulf coasts from New Jersey to the southern tip of Texas , providing a more or less protected waterway of canals and bays for commercial barge traffic , an alternative to open ocean shipping .
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracoastal_Waterway
The Texas 200 was established by Chuck Leinweber , founder of the Duckworks website https://www.duckworks.com/.
Chuck competed in the Everglades Challenge ( EC ) several years ago , and wanted to do more of that kind of thing .
The Everglades , however , are a long trip from his home in Texas .
Chuck thought he could organize a modified version of the EC , right on the Texas gulf coast .

Kim Apel " Acalifornian Does the Texas 200 "
What the Texas 200 is :
• A “ rolling messabout ” where people bring boats of all shapes and sizes and sail them on the south Texas coast .
• A moving , exhausting , endurance test of boat , captain , and crew .
• A chance to see areas of America rarely visited by man .
• An exercise in planning , preparation , and problem solving .
• A chance to make new friends and legends of the small boat world

On The Daily Show last night host Jon Stewart offered his take on Sen. Jim Bunning ’s ( R - KY ) filibuster of the proposed 30 day extension of unemployment benefits .
Stewart said , “ You hear that unemployed people in the middle of one of the worst recession in history , no 30 day extension of benefits until we balance the entire federal budget to Jim Bunning ’s liking . ”
Here is the video :
Jon Stewart described Bunning ’s reason for the filibuster as , “ You hear that unemployed people in the middle of one of the worst recession in history , no 30 day extension of benefits until we balance the entire federal budget to Jim Bunning ’s liking . ”
He later said , “ All you have to do to pass this thing is get Bunning out of the f**king room !!!
Has anybody heard of this , Jim Bunning to the courtesy phone , Jim Bunning to the courtesy phone ?
Is there a Jim Bunning here ?
You won a boat .
Hey , hey , I got something , try this , there ’s an announcement , free smoothies for crazy people in the lobby . ”
Advertisements
What helps make Bunning ’s stance even more ridiculous is that he sponsored almost $ 70 million in earmarks in 2008 - 2009 .
While his individual earmark total was only $ 18 million which ranked 88th among senators , he sponsored $ 51,639,375 in earmarks with other senators .
Bunning did n’t seem overly concerned about paying for the millions of dollars in earmarks that he co-sponsored .
The way to end this filibuster and get the benefits extension passed is very simple .
The Democrats need to keep the Senate open and make Jim Bunning filibuster .
Sure he can stand up and object during regular business hours and block the bill , but let ’s see how is he is holding up after thirty or forty hours of straight filibustering .
However , Democrats are certain not to take this approach because a ) , they do n’t want to turn Bunning into a right wing martyr , and b ) , they are lazy .
Bunning ’s position is so unpopular outside of right wing circles that the Democrats would be foolish not to make him filibuster .
An old school filibuster would attract mountains of attention and highlight just how right wing and out of touch the Republican Party is with people who are hurting .
Democrats could take back the agenda , simply by calling Bunning ’s bluff .
It is a mystery why they wo n’t do it .
BALTIMORE – Jacob Green , an African American seaman who braved Nazi U- boats while supplying the Soviet Union during World War II , and later served as chairman of the Communist Party of Maryland , died Feb. 19 .
He was 107 .
The Rev. Esther M. Holimon , pastor of Union Memorial United Methodist Church told the crowd at Green ’s funeral , “ He had his sea-legs at sea and in life knew how to endure the storms of life . ”
Born June 28 , 1902 in Charleston , S.C. , Green worked as a fisherman , coal yard worker , and bander in a cotton mill before going to sea in a sailing ship in 1927 , an age when “ seamen were made of iron and ships were made of wood . ”
While unemployed in New York someone handed him a copy of the Daily Worker .
He joined the Communist Party in 1930 .
In 1937 , he helped found the National Maritime Union ( NMU ) , a strong , left - led union that fought the shipowners ’ starvation wages and brutal working conditions winning dramatic improvements for seafarers .
His most prized possession was his NMU union membership book # 414 .
During World War II , Green sailed aboard Liberty ships delivering “ lend - lease ” armaments and food to Great Britain .
He also made several voyages to the Soviet Union on the dreaded “ Murmansk Run . ”
Scores of these ships were torpedoed by the Nazis .
Green suffered permanent deafness from anti-aircraft fire repelling Nazi dive - bombers .
Green rose through union ranks and when he moved to Maryland , was chosen as an NMU patrolman ( business agent ) for the Port of Baltimore , serving from 1944 - 1948 .
Howard Silverberg , a close friend and fellow NMU seaman , wrote in a tribute , that Green “ was known among seamen in every port as a fighter for their union rights and an expert on the union contract .
He stood up to the shipowners , settled the ‘ beefs , ’ and rejected open bribes from shipping agents . ”
Green , known to his many friends and associates as Jake , was a great storyteller .
Among his favorites was the fight against Jim Crow on the Baltimore waterfront in the mid-1940s .
Coffee shops served white seamen coffee in porcelain mugs but Black seamen in paper cups .
A team of NMU seamen , African American and white , went one morning and ordered coffee at a popular café .
“ As soon as the waiter finished serving , the white seamen handed their mugs to us and we handed our paper cups to them , ” Green would say with a chuckle .
It was a sit - in 20 years before the famous lunch counter sit-ins in Greensboro , North Carolina , that galvanized the nation to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 .
A self - educated man , Green counted among his friends the great Paul Robeson , W.E.B. DuBois , the “ Communist Councilman from Harlem ” Benjamin Davis , fellow Marylander George A. Meyers who was president of the Maryland - D.C. Congress of Industrial Organizations ( CIO ) , and Ferdinand Smith , the Jamaican - born NMU secretary - treasurer .
The U.S. Coast Guard “ screened ” Green during the 1950 anti-Communist witch - hunts , stripping him and many other seamen of their seaman ’s papers .
Green was forced to seek work as a low - wage janitor in Baltimore to support himself , his wife Dorothy and their daughter , Cathy .
Green was active in all the struggles for peace and justice in Baltimore and Maryland well into his 90s .
He served as chair of the CP of Maryland from 1964 until 1985 .
He is survived by daughter Cathy Lynn Harden , eight grandchildren , and numerous nieces and nephews .
Dorothy , his wife of 59 years , died in December 2006 .
At his funeral , a U.S. Coast Guard honor guard folded and presented Ms. Harden with an American flag , recognition of Jacob Green ’s heroic service to the nation during the war to defeat fascism .

The case of administrators in the Lower Merion School District ( LMSD ) spying on students through mandatory , school - provided laptops struck a chord with bloggers ( Boing Boing , Gizmodo ) and traditional news outlets ( NPR , Reuters ) .
The most in - depth source on this so far has been Stryde 's investigation .
We have two reactions ( one emotional and one more circumspect ) and a plan to fight this trend , for which we 'll need your help .
Our first reaction -- the emotional one -- is to just marvel at how bad this is .
How in the world did we get here ?
From a former student 's comment on Digg :
" As a recent graduate of Harriton , I thought I could shed some light on the situation .
These laptops were 2.0 ghz 2gb Macbooks issued out to all the students for the entire year to do whatever they wanted and this was the 2nd year of the program .
The webcam could n't be disabled due to tough security settings .
Occasionally we would notice that the green light was on from time to time but we just figured that it was glitching out as some macbooks do sometimes .
* Some few covered it up with tape and post its because they thought the IT guys were watching them .
I always thought they were crazy and that the district , one of the more respectable ones within the state , would never pull some shit like this .
I guess I was wrong * " ( emphasis ours ) .
High school students start covering their webcams with tape because they can't trust their computers .
And then it turns out that what seemed like paranoia to some was completely well - founded .
Our second reaction -- the more circumspect one -- is that the real scandal here is the mandatory imposition of computers that students do n't control .
This may not be as lurid a violation of freedom as a remote - activated webcam in a teenager 's bedroom , but it is the most central .
Once people use computers they do n't completely control , that provides both a technical basis and a social / political slippery slope for sleazy sysadmins leering at your kids -- or any other violation you can imagine .
And to be completely clear , when we say " computers they do n't control " we are n't just talking about computers with DRM , backdoors , and monitoring software .
Any computer running Windows , Mac OS X , Flash , or any proprietary software is a computer that you do n't control .
This includes not just laptops and desktops , but also things like a Kindle , an iPhone , or an iPad .
When the software on your computer is proprietary , then you can't know whether the light is coming on because of a glitch or because the camera is actually running .
You can't tell if your hard drive is spinning because you 're using it , or because someone else is using it .
Only free software gives you the freedom to find the answers to these questions .
So what future will we as a society choose ?
A future based on free software , or one where high school students have to cover their webcams with tape ?
If you 're with us , here 's the plan .
We want to create a listing of all school systems that provide every student with a laptop .
Then we want to know what software the laptops run , if students are prohibited from using their own computers running free software , and if the provided laptops have any additionally nasty characteristics ( beyond simply including proprietary software ) like locked out features or remote monitoring software .
We 'll be organizing around this wiki page .
Once we get enough data ( but we need your help to do this ! ) we 'll start running campaigns to get the different school districts to change their policy to promote ( or at least allow ) software freedom .
Spying laptops remind us of the young adult sci-fi Little Brother by Cory Doctorow , which explores the idea of the panopticon high school ( and how one might fight it ) in an exciting and very readable way .
And Cory Doctorow just ran a great guest editorial from a recent high school student on his blog BoingBoing : Seen Not Heard .
The use of technology to limit and violate students ' freedoms is widespread and growing , partly because what goes on in high schools is extremely opaque to anybody not in them .
Help us reveal where abuses are happening , and work to undo them .

I see where Representative Patrick McHenry , Republican of North Carolina ( very patriotic name , guy : Patrick Henry + Fort McHenry ) , wants to bounce Ulysses S. Grant off the fifty - dollar bill and replace him with Ronald Reagan .
Here ’s a better idea .
The largest bill in circulation now is the C - note , but , for a couple of weeks at the height of the Great Depression ( December 18 , 1934 - January 9 , 1935 ) , the Treasury printed up a bunch of hundred - thousand dollar bills , featuring a portrait of Woodrow Wilson .
They were used for transfers between branches of the Federal Reserve Bank .
Now , seventy - five years later , why not have the Treasury print a $ 1,300,000,000,000 bill with the Great Communicator ’s face on it ?
It could be used to pay off the portion of the national debt run up during the Reagan Administration .
Not only that , but if we printed four more Ronalds , we could cover George W. Bush ’s share of the debt .
In my email today I got an invitation to a conference on Austrian Economics in the 21st century , to be held in Argentina .
Details here for those interested .
What struck me was the list of topics , namely
– Economics
– Epistemology
– Methodoly ( sic )
– Political Philosophy
– Readings on the Austrian School of Economics
That is , 80 per cent of the conference is to be devoted to meta- economic issues of one kind or another , and only 20 per cent to the entire field of economics ( much of which will probably also be taken up with meta - discussion ) .
A focus on meta-issues is a characteristic problem for heterodox schools of all kinds , but Austrian economics takes it to an absurd extreme .
At some point , surely , they need to stop worrying about methodology and history of thought and start actually doing some economics .
Leaving aside the obvious silliness of worrying about epistemology in the context of a massive financial crisis , there ’s the irony of holding the conference in Argentina , something of a poster child for failed free - market policies ( admittedly , before that it was a poster child for failed protectionist policies ) .
Surely the conference could manage a theme on what went wrong in Argentina and how Austrians would do things better next time .
TMZ has learned Justin Bieber 's manager turned himself in to police this morning -- and it's all over unlawful Tweets ... allegedly .
Scott " Scooter " Braun surrendered on two misdemeanor charges -- reckless endangerment and criminal nuisance -- stemming from an incident at a mall in November .
The incident which triggered the matter occurred last November at the Roosevelt Field mall when fans got out of control and at least one girl was hospitalized .
We 're told cops asked Braun to Tweet that the event had been canceled but they say he refused to do so .
Braun faces one year in jail if convicted .
UPDATE : The Bieb himself is finally weighing in -- Justin just posted the following Tweet : " You 've got my total support @scooterbraun Wish you were here in Chicago with us # FreeScooter "
The European Commission ’s decision to allow the cultivation of GM potatoes has not gained union - wide approval
THE EUROPEAN
Commission ’s decision earlier this month to approve a genetically modified ( GM ) potato called Amflora bears all the hallmarks of being the thin end of what could be a very large wedge .
That ’s why it was greeted with such delight by German chemical company BASF , which patented the potato , and by the biotech lobby in general .
This was the first time in 12 years that a GM crop had been approved for cultivation in Europe ; the last one – indeed , the only other one – is an insecticide - emitting maize produced by US multinational Monsanto , which was licensed in 1998 .
Monsanto also had cause to celebrate , as the commission authorised three more of its GM maize varieties .
The commission said it was authorising the cultivation of Amflora potatoes for industrial use – principally in the manufacture of starch – and the use of its starch byproducts for animal feed .
It also decided that Monsanto could place its three GM maize varieties on the market “ for food and feed uses but not for cultivation ” .
According to health and consumer policy commissioner John Dalli , this followed an “ extensive and thorough review ” of the applications from BASF and Monsanto and a series of “ favourable safety assessments ” by the European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) .
“ All scientific issues , particularly those concerning safety , had been fully addressed , ” he said .
However , it emerged that two of the 21 EFSA scientists did not share their colleagues ’ favourable view of Amflora , saying the possibility of its antibiotic - resistant genes being transferred to bacteria in human or animal gastro - intestinal tracts could not be ruled out ; if this happened , it would become more difficult to treat infections such as tuberculosis .
The EFSA ’s scientific panel assessing GM products has been chaired since 2003 by Dr Harry Kuiper , a Dutch biochemist who previously co-ordinated a research programme involving three leading biotech firms – Bayer , Monsanto and Syngenta .
Greenpeace says the panel has too many biochemists and only “ one or two experts on the environment ” .
This lacuna in the EFSA was adverted to by a spokeswoman for the French government , who said : “ We do not recognise their expertise because we consider that their opinions are incomplete .
They are only interested in the sanitary consequences of GMOs [ genetically modified organisms ] , without taking into account their long - term environmental impact ” on soils and species .
So it is not only environmentalists who object to permitting GM crops .
The governments of Austria , Bulgaria , France , Greece , Hungary , Italy , Luxembourg and Poland are all opposed , making it clear in the wake of the commission ’s decision that they would not allow Amflora to be cultivated on their territories .
( Our own Government has yet to express a view on it ) .
The Czech Republic , Germany , the Netherlands , Spain and Sweden take a more tolerant approach .
But it is precisely because there are such divided views that the EU council of agriculture ministers failed to reach agreement on Amflora – and this paved the way for the commission to use its residual powers to make the decision by default .
Dalli has been asked to make proposals “ setting out how an EU authorisation system , based on science , can be combined with freedom for member states to decide whether or not they wish to cultivate GM crops on their territory ” .
In other words , the common market may be abandoned in this area .
The public remains sceptical about the need to go down the GM route , promoted so vigorously by Monsanto .
In the case of Amflora , there is arguably no need for it ; as Friends of the Earth pointed out , two conventional potato varieties already on the market have similar high - starch qualities as the GM alternative produced by BASF .
Writing in The Irish Timeslast month , Dublin City University president Ferdinand von Prondzynski complained that opposition to GMOs “ has often been influenced by various campaigns using scaremongering labels such as ‘ Frankenstein foods ’ ” – before going on , in the next sentence , to indulge in scaremongering himself .
“ Indeed , ” he wrote , “ if we are to take the Government ’s commitment to having Ireland as a GM - free zone seriously , one of the first steps we have to take would be to advise all diabetics to leave the country as we would have to ban insulin ” – a patently ludicrous claim , given the way insulin is manufactured from GM bacteria in secure laboratories .
Concerns about growing GM crops include contamination of organic crops and the environment , potential destruction of biodiversity and local agriculture , excessive use of pesticides and the as - yet - unknown effects of GM food on public health , as well as the way in which a small number of patent - holding companies would control the food chain .
In 1999 , Canadian environmental scientist and long - time campaigner David Suzuki – a professor in the University of British Columbia ’s genetics department for almost 40 years – said of GM crops : “ Any politician or scientist who tells you these products are safe is either very stupid or lying .
The experiments have simply not been done . ”
There have been more experiments carried out over the past decade , particularly in the US , but only 0.12 per cent of agricultural land throughout the EU ( most of it in Spain ) is currently used for GM crops .
This may change if the European Commission was to extend its benign view of Amflora to 17 other GM crops currently awaiting approval .
Yet we still do not know enough to say for sure that such genetically engineered crops are safe .
Until we do , the precautionary principle must surely intervene .

A South Korean couple let their baby starve to death after becoming obsessed with raising a virtual daughter online , police said .
Father Kim Yoo -chul , 41 , and mother Choi Mi-sun , 25 , have been charged with child abuse and neglect following the discovery of their severely dehydrated and malnourished three - month - old daughter , London 's Daily Mail reported .
The couple left their baby at home while they spent 12 - hour stints at internet cafes in the city of Suwon .
Police said the two were addicted to a multi-role playing game called and were raising a virtual daughter there .
The game , similar to , allows players to build a life in an online world , which includes choosing a job , interacting with other users and earning an extra avatar to nurture once they reach a certain level , the Daily Mail said .
If you do n’t think the police in New York City need to be reined in , consider the way the cops and their agents are treating youngsters in the city ’s schools .
In March 2009 , a girl and a boy in the sixth grade at the Hunts Point School in the Bronx were fooling around and each drew a line on the other ’s desk with an erasable marker .
The teacher told them to erase the lines , and the kids went to get tissues .
This blew up into a major offense when school safety officers became involved .
The safety officers , who have been accused in many instances of mistreating children , are peace officers assigned to the schools .
They wear uniforms , work for the New York Police Department and have the power to detain , search , handcuff and arrest students .
They do not carry guns .
In this case , the officers seized the two pupils and handcuffed them .
Before long , an armed police officer showed up to question the youngsters .
The girl asked for her mother and began to cry .
Tears were no defense in the minds of the brave New York City law enforcers surrounding this errant child .
They were determined to keep the city safe from sixth graders armed with Magic Markers .
With the imminent arrival of the Apple iPad , it seems at least one major television network is updating their website to provide video playback support for new tablet device -- without Flash .
CBS.com 's website began displaying a couple of strange " iPad - test " video links , first noted by The Other Mac Blog .
We investigated further and found that clicking on these " iPad " labeled links in your normal desktop browser brings you to the usual Flash versions of these videos .
Of course , these would n't properly play on the Apple iPad due to Apple 's well known decision not to support Flash .
However , if you visit CBS.com using the iPad SDK Simulator or spoofing your browser 's User - Agent to impersonate an iPad , you are sent to a different version of the video :
This new version of the video does not yet work but appears to be based on HTML5 .
The css files reference HTML5 and have a number of " webkit " specific calls .
Webkit is the browser engine used in the iPad 's mobile safari .
While the videos do n't currently play , the " fullscreen mode " reportedly already works in the iPad simulator .
Apple has been a strong proponent of HTML5 and has suggested it as an alternative solution to Flash .
It appears at least one major network will be supporting HTML5 alongside Flash video to deliver their content at iPad launch .

At the start of the year I announced that I was setting myself the challenge of learning 12 new programming languages during 2010 .
That works out at a language a month , so seeing as it's almost the end of March you might expect me to be wrapping up my third language .
Unfortunately that is n't the case .
I 'm just about to move on to my second .
I 'm still optimistic I can achieve the target of 12 new languages this year though , so expect future updates to be more regular .
Getting Starting with Clojure
Getting up and running with Clojure was made easy to to the wealth of documentation .
There 's a great getting started guide , and a guide specifically for Clojure on Ubuntu .
In terms of programming environment there 's a round up of Clojure IDEs .
I stuck to Vim , but I did n't take it as far as this guide , which describes turning Vim into a fairly comprehensive Clojure IDE .
Clojure has a REPL , which I always find makes learning a new language easier .
When you want to find something out just type it in a see what the result is !
The default REPL does n't support arrow navigation or pressing up to run previous commands though , so it can be a little frustrating .
There are guides on enhacing the REPL with this functionality .
One of the first things I did was put together the following shell script which either runs the specified Clojure script , or gives you a REPL if no script was specified .
#!/bin/sh CLOJURE_JAR = " /opt/clojure-1.1.0/clojure.jar " if [ - z " $ 1 " ] ; then java - jar " $ {CLOJURE_JAR} " else java - jar " $ {CLOJURE_JAR} " " $@ " fi
Writing Code
I decided to write a port scanner in Clojure , which would introduce me to command line argument handling , the network API , and parallelization .
One of the great things about Clojure is that despite being such a new language there is so much example code available on the web .
I was able to find a Clojure network scanner by Travis Whitton which detailed all of the network related code I 'd need to my port scanner .
Travis uses Clojure 's agents for parallelization , which is something else I borrowed from his script .
I was amazed at how easy it was to parallelize the lookups .
So much simpler than threading .
If there is only one thing I take away from Clojure it 'll be its interesting approaches to parallelization .
So without further ado here is my Clojure port scanner :
( import ' ( java .io IOException ) ' ( java.net Socket ) ' ( java.net InetSocketAddress ) ' ( java.net SocketTimeoutException ) ' ( java.net UnknownHostException ) ) ( if ( == ( count * command - line - args * ) 1 ) ( def hostname ( first * command - line - args * ) ) ( ( println " Usage : scanner < hostname > " ) ( System / exit 1 ) ) ) ( defn port -open ? [ hostname port timeout ] ( let [ sock - addr ( InetSocketAddress .
hostname port ) ] ( try ( with - open [ sock ( Socket . ) ] ( . sock connect sock - addr timeout ) port ) ( catch IOException e false ) ( catch SocketTimeoutException e false ) ( catch UnknownHostException e false ) ) ) ) < li > ( defn host - port - open ? [ port ] ( port -open ? hostname port 5000 ) ) ( def port - list ( range 1 1024 ) ) ( def agents ( for [ port port - list ] ( agent port ) ) ) ( println ( str " Scanning " hostname " ... " ) ) ( doseq [ agent agents ] ( send - off agent host - port - open ? ) ) ( apply await agents ) ( doseq [ port ( filter deref agents ) ] ( println ( str @ port " is open " ) ) ) ( shutdown - agents )
I 'm sure it is far from an idiomatic solution , so any suggestions for improvement are welcome .
Running the scanner with my bash script gives the following output :
$ ./clj.sh scanner Usage : scanner < hostname > $ ./clj.sh scanner github.com Scanning github.com ... 22 is open 80 is open 443 is open
What 's next ?
I 've barely scratched the surface of Clojure , but I 've certainly become more aware of some of the concepts and idioms used by the language , which is what I was hoping for .
I 'll be looking for more projects in the future where I can make use of it .
For now though I need to move on to another language as part of my challenge .
As I 'm running behind I plan to go with one that I do n't think will be too unfamiliar , either Go or Fantom .
I 'll keep you posted !

He was the white , grammar school boy from Buckinghamshire .
His late father worked as a political agent for the Conservative Party , his mother was a PE teacher and devout Christian .
But in 2006 Donald Stewart - Whyte was accused of plotting murder on the scale of 9/11 .
The plan was to blow up planes from London over the Atlantic , killing hundreds of people .
Four men were found guilty last year for their part but Mr Stewart - Whyte was cleared by the jury .
When he was arrested by anti-terror police in 2006 he was 20 - years - old and had converted to Islam four months earlier .
Speaking to BBC London exclusively , he said : " For three days I did n't know what I was arrested for .
I was just told it was for terrorism .
" I asked my mum over the telephone what had I been arrested for and she said ' for tying to blow up transatlantic airliners ' .
" I was just in shock , baffled .
I just did n't know what to say or do . "
Liquid explosives
The prosecution later argued in court that Mr Stewart - Whyte was a " foot solider " who was willing to kill hundreds of people .
They said he had been groomed by another man from High Wycombe , Umar Islam , who was later found guilty of planning murder .
Witnesses claimed Mr Stewart - Whyte had expressed extremist views and talked in detail about how to get liquid explosives on a plane - something he has always denied .
I was once prejudiced against Islam .
I thought it was just for the terrorists
Donald Stewart - Whyte
He said he only met Umar Islam once and sent him a few text messages asking him how he was .
" It was three years that I spent of my life with people thinking that this man is probably guilty .
" All I can say to these people is go look at the evidence .
The evidence was pitiful . "
Mr Stewart - Whyte said when his father died he went off the rails ; he started drinking and smoking cannabis , then he was thrown out of two grammar schools in High Wycombe .
He said the Islamic faith has helped him get his life back on track .
" I was once prejudiced against it [ Islam ] .
I thought it was just for the terrorists .
Eventually I learnt that looking at people in a religion and looking at a religion are two very different things . "
Mr Stewart - Whyte explained how he felt when he realised he faced the rest of his life behind bars .
" That was a scary , scary thing .
But then I sat back and thought I have n't done anything , just trust in God and he 'll bring me through .
" I 'd been trying to say , this is not what Islam 's about and then I got pulled into it [ the terror arrests ] , at which point I was a bit dumbfounded . "
Guilty with gun
He condemned the men in the dock alongside him who were found guilty .
" I 'm just glad my mother was n't going to America because I would have been very angry .
No - one can kill anybody . "
Mr Stewart - Whyte was cleared of plotting to kill hundreds of people but pleaded guilty to possession of a loaded gun , a silencer and ammunition .
It was not suggested in court that these were related to any terrorist activity .
" I was childish and I made a mistake .
I never intended to hurt anybody , I would n't have hurt any body , I was trying to sort my life out .
" Okay , I made a mistake when I was younger .
I was trying to sort myself out before I got into this whole mess . "
His mother , Dorothea Simmons , said : " Knowing that he was innocent gets you through because you think whatever is thrown at him he can only tell the truth . "
She said she did n't blame the authorities for what happened to her son .
" They have to do their job , there are evil forces around and plots and they need to keep people safe . "
Now 23 - years - old and a free man , Donald Stewart - Whyte , lives with his wife and baby daughter in Buckinghamshire and they are expecting their second child .
It may have been his conversion to Islam which led to his appearance in the dock but he says his faith has carried him through the last four years and is stronger than ever .

Masdar City aims to be powered solely by renewable energy sources
The world 's first zero -carbon city is being built in Abu Dhabi and is designed to be not only free of cars and skyscrapers but also powered by the sun .
The oil - rich United Arab Emirates is the last place you would expect to learn lessons on low - carbon living , but the emerging eco-city of Masdar could teach the world .
FIND OUT MORE Costing The Earth : Eco-City Limits Monday 29 March 2100 BST , BBC Radio 4
Or listen later on the BBC iPlayer
At first glance , the parched landscape of Abu Dhabi looks like the craziest place to build any city , let alone a sustainable one .
The inhospitable terrain suggests that the only way to survive here is with the maximum of technological support , a bit like living on the moon .
The genius of Masdar - if it works - will be combining 21st Century engineering with traditional desert architecture to deliver zero- carbon comfort .
And it is being built now .
Masdar will be home to about 50,000 people , at least 1,000 businesses and a university .
It is being designed by British architects Foster and Partners , but it is the ruler of Abu Dhabi , Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan , who is paying for it .
And it will cost between £ 10 bn ( $ 15 bn ) and £ 20 bn ( $ 30 bn ) .
Renewable energy
The architects are turning the desert 's greatest threat - the sun - into their greatest asset .
The quality of air will be better than any other street in the Gulf and in the world , and that alone will bring you safety , health and happiness
Kaled Awad , director of the Masdar project
They have built the biggest solar farm in the Middle East to power the city and to offset the inevitable burning of diesel and baking of cement in construction .
They are also experimenting .
One project involves a circular field of mirrors on the ground , all reflecting towards a tower in the middle .
That , in turn , bounces the light down in a concentrated beam about a metre ( 3ft ) wide to produce heat and drive generators .
But I was told firmly not to wander over and feel the warmth , as it could fry me in seconds .
The international team of engineers have real pride in their work .
This is more than building to them , it is a lab bench with the freedom to get it wrong , and Masdar 's chief architect Gerard Evenden loves the concentration of expertise : " What Abu Dhabi is beginning to generate is the Silicon Valley of renewable energy . "
Keeping cool
The Emirates have seen one of the world 's most spectacular building booms paid for by oil and made tolerable by air conditioners , which also depend on oil to feed their vast appetite for energy .
Lunar technology has begun to influence our thinking
Gerard Evenden , architect But Masdar will have to be low temperature and low carbon .
Part of the solution is apparent the moment you walk in .
And you do " walk in " because this is a city surrounded by a wall , a defined boundary .
Unlike the upward and outward sprawl of Dubai or Abu Dhabi , Masdar is compact like ancient Arab cities .
Streets are narrow so buildings shade each other , and the walls and roofs of buildings will do their bit to shed heat too .
The vertical faces are dressed with screens which look like a terracotta mesh .
They keep the sun out but let the breeze in .
And as architect Gerard Evenden says : " Lunar technology has begun to influence our thinking . "
One idea being tested is using a thin foil surface covering , a gas or vacuum blanket , to keep the heat out .
It is an idea dreamt up for a moon base .
To encourage a breeze , wind towers are being built , drawing draughts through the streets without using energy .
Masdar will still use electricity for gadgets , some air conditioning and , most crucially , to desalinate sea water but , when it comes to power , the city has a simple mantra : " Only use energy when you have exhausted design . "
Driverless vehicles Conventional cars must be checked in at the city gates and then you can choose between the oldest and newest modes of transport .
At street level , it is all pedestrianised and the planners have done their best to keep the city compact and foot - friendly .
But if fatigue overtakes you , then slip down a level and meet the Personal Rapid Transit or podcars .
These driverless vehicles are guided by magnetic sensors , powered by solar electricity , and they stop automatically if an obstacle appears .
They are programmed to go where you ask .
Kaled Awad , director of the Masdar project claims : " The quality of air will be better than any other street in the Gulf and in the world , and that alone will bring you safety , health and happiness . "
The future success of the project will be clear to see .
On top of the wind tower , there will be a beacon betraying the city 's actual energy use : red for too much , blue for just right .
It will be 45 m ( 147ft ) up and visible for miles around so , when Masdar is finished in five to 10 years ' time , we will all know if it is in the red .
Costing The Earth : Eco-City Limits will be broadcast on Monday 29 March at 2100 BST on BBC Radio 4 and will be available on the BBC iPlayer .

Even if Goldman did nothing in particular wrong , its status as one of only two remaining huge investment banks on Wall Street ( the other is Morgan Stanley ) might make it a legitimate focus , especially given its reputation , even before the crisis , for ruthlessness .
Is it legitimate to think of Goldman as a Jewish firm ?
Messrs .
Goldman and Sachs , who founded the firm in the nineteenth century , were Jewish , as have been most of its partners since then , almost all of its leaders , and its current CEO ( Lloyd Blankfein ) .
It was founded because Jews were excluded from other firms .
At this point Goldman is a publicly traded stock that anybody may own , and probably most of its employees are not Jewish .
( Just as Jews are more than welcome at " gentile " firms like Morgan Stanley ) .
Is it legitimate to talk about Goldman as a Jewish firm ?
That 's a different question .
Many American
Jews think " Jewish " when they hear the words " Goldman " and " Sachs , " but still cringe whenever they hear the connection made in public , especially by non-Jews .
Certainly any explicit suggestion that Goldman 's alleged misbehavior and its Jewishness are related in any way is anti-Semitic .
But what about comments about Goldman Sachs that draw on the classic stereotype about Jews and money , without making any explicit connection to it being a Jewish firm ?
That depends on which stereotype you mean .
There is the stereotype that Jews thrive and tend to predominate on Wall Street and in the financial professions generally .
This is true , but so what ?
There is no mystery or conspiracy involved .
Jews in Europe were excluded from many occupations for centuries .
They could n't own land and be farmers .
Here in the United States they could n't climb the executive ladder at big corporations .
They were not welcome at investment banks run by Protestants .
So they founded their own .
The stereotype that Jews gravitate toward , and often do well in , finance is so innocent that , ironically , bringing it up is suspicious .
What does it have to do with anything ?
Rush Limbaugh brought it up the other day .
He said on his radio show that President Obama may be appealing to anti-Semitism with his recent populist criticism of banks and bankers .
" There are a lot of people , " Limbaugh said , " when you say banker , people think Jewish . "
He did n't mention Goldman Sachs .
Abe Foxman , longtime head of the B'nai Brith Anti-Defamation League , declared that Limbaugh 's remark was " offensive and inappropriate " and " borderline anti-Semitic . "
Limbaugh and his defenders protest that Limbaugh clearly was referring to other people , " people who have -- what 's the best way to say - - a little prejudice about them , " and not endorsing such views himself .
And the transcript bears him out .
By Foxman 's standard , even to mention that many bankers are Jewish is anti-Semitic ( even though it 's true ) , and attributing this view to others ( while professing to be worried about it ) is no excuse
This may be over - the top .
We live in a culture of umbrage , in which everybody seems to be taking offense at something somebody else says .
Foxman is one of the nation 's foremost umbragists .

From what was the Campos Meta team the Hispania Racing team has emerged .
Despite the name and ownership changes the one consistent factor through the winter has been the car .
Designed and built by Dallara and incorporating the Cosworth engine and Xtrac gearbox .
Few pictures have emerged of the car from the low key launch today .
However we can see some basic design details on the car .
Sporting a strong likeness to the Dallara IRL car with its low nose and rounded airbox inlet .
Indeed the car has a resemblance to the Virgin VR01 F1 car , sharing basic features such as the “ V ” nose , tall sidepod fins and undercut roll structure .
Starting at the front the Red Bull - Like “ V ” nose is mated to a low placed nose cone , thus creating the prominent bulges on top of the chassis .
This allows the lower wishbone mounts to meet under the raised nose .
While the steering track rods are inline with the upper wishbone ( most other teams place these lower ) below it the front wing is a straightforward three element affair with wide cascades above the main wing and simple endplates .
It ’s front brake ducts appear unusually large and are mated to a fairing leading towards the front perimeter of the tyre .
Sidepods follow the common fashion being quite wide to accommodate the fuel tank and radiators and undercut at their leading edge .
At the rear the sidepods do not fall away as radically as the McLaren or Virgin and form a neat rounded coke bottle shape with the exhausts exiting at the very rear just before the rear wishbone .
Allied to the sidepods are the tall pod fins , which also mount the mirrors .
Bargeboards are relatively large and adopt a stepped top profile .
Again contemporary design it taken with the roll structures formed by an undercut inlet supported by a pair of pylons , Dallara have adopted a circular inlet that forms a near horizontal tube as it passes back over the fuel tank to the cosworth engine .
No fin has yet been added to the engine cover .
Being one of the first of the new teams to start their 2010 development , Dallara lead the packaging of the Xtrac gearbox , setting the mounting points for the rear suspension with its exposed torsion bars .
Behind the gearbox the crash structure splits the rear beam wing , thus HRT along with Ferrari are one of the few teams not to use a fully exposed beam wing .
We can see a covered up diffuser which appears to exploit a double design , but like the rest of the aerodynamic details appears relatively simple .
The main body of this letter was dictated by then - Vice President of the United States Harry Truman on the morning of April 12th , 1945 .
In it , he tells sister - in - law May Wallace of his ever - increasing workload after just three months in a role for which he did n’t actually campaign .
Just hours after the letter was dictated , President Roosevelt passed away , and when a shocked Harry Truman eventually returned to sign the letter – at which point he also hand - wrote the postscript – he was President of the United States .

Dear May :
Certainly did appreciate your letter of the Ninth and so did the whole family .
I am sending young Perryman the picture which you suggested .
I imagine that Spott is getting fatter and fatter .
I have gained nine pounds myself .
What do you think of that ?
So Spot and I will be in the same class .
Glad you liked the Buffalo speech .
The situation here gets no better fast .
It looks as if I have more to do than ever and less time to do it , but some way we get it done .
If I do n’t get this letter dictated to you , I will never get it written .

Carlsen 's game impressed mostly through the evening , but he also made mistakes .
In the second game , the computers showed a …
Bottled water is a drain on the environment :
The U.S. public goes through about 50 billion water bottles a year , and most of those plastic containers are not recycled , according to Elizabeth Royte 's 2008 book Bottlemania : How Water Went on Sale and Why We Bought It .
Transporting the bottles and keeping them cold also burns fossil fuels , which give off greenhouse gases .
And groundwater pumping by bottled - water companies draws heavily on underground aquifers and harms watersheds , according to the Sierra Club , an environmental nonprofit .
And according to some estimates , it takes up to three liters of water to produce one liter of bottled water .
Yet more than U.S. $ 100 billion is spent every year on bottled water globally .
In many cities in developing countries where there is not a safe source of tap water , bottled water becomes a somewhat trusted option .
But in the U.S. , where tap water is federally regulated and often screened for dangerous pollutants , the public drinks 21 gallons ( 79 liters ) of bottled water per capita per year on average , according to the Columbia Water Center at Columbia University 's Earth Institute in New York .
The bottled - water industry is so successful , it has outpaced milk , coffee , and juice in number of gallons of drinks sold — putting it behind only beer and soda .
Water Bottle Bans
Though the sale and consumption of bottled water is still on the rise , certain policymakers and activists have taken steps to reduce it and encourage people to drink tap .
In September 2009 , the Australian city of Bundanoon became the first city in the world to completely ban bottled water from its stores ' shelves , installing water fountains around the city instead .
Among U.S. cities that have taken action are San Francisco and Seattle , which no longer buy water for city use , and Chicago , which added a five - cent tax on each bottle .
Several restaurants in those cities have also given up bottled for filtered tap .
Other cities are also considering taking action .
The tide toward tap has boosted businesses that make reusable water bottles , especially aluminum and stainless steel varieties .
Many reusable bottles are made of polycarbonate plastic , but those often contain bisphenol A ( BPA ) , a chemical linked to reproductive problems and heart disease .
In response , some polycarbonate - bottle makers have phased out BPA and advertise " BPA - free " products .
Health Costs
Not only does bottled water contribute to excessive waste , but it costs us a thousand times more than water from our faucet at home , and it 's likely no safer or cleaner , experts say .
A 2008 investigation by the nonprofit Environmental Working Group found some bottled water is sullied with untested industrial chemicals and may not necessarily be cleaner than tap water .
Water aside , the plastic used in single - use bottles can pose more of a contamination threat than the water .
A safe plastic if used only once , # 1 polyethylene terephthalate ( PET or PETE ) is the most common resin used in disposable bottles .
However , as # 1 bottles are reused , as they commonly are , they can leach chemicals such as DEHA , a possible human carcinogen , and benzyl butyl phthalate ( BBP ) , a potential hormone disruptor .
And because the plastic is porous you 'll likely get a swill of harmful bacteria with each gulp if you reuse the bottles .
Bottled Tap Water
More than 80 percent of recyclable plastic bottles end up in landfills each year .
They do not break down naturally and release toxic chemicals when they finally do decompose , according to the Columbia Water Center .
Another major problem with bottled water , according to Columbia , is that a traditionally public good has been privatized .
Bottled water companies gain high profits by drawing water from public water sources , putting it in plastic containers , and reselling it at 2,900 times the price of regular tap .
Some experts contend that the profits from bottled water companies could go toward improving public water supplies and infrastructure — making better water for everyone .
( CNET ) --
The imagined inventions of Victorian - era French novelist Albert Robida may be coming closer to reality .
Who , you ask ?
Robida was an illustrator and writer for popular science - fiction magazines , and is sometimes compared to Jules Verne .
In his 1890 novel " Le Vingtieme siecle .
La vie electrique , " he described something called a " telephonoscope . "
Since then , we 've seen telephonoscopes -- basically videophones -- in everything from " The Jetsons " to " Blade Runner . "
What we have n't seen is the videophone in our living rooms .
That may finally be changing .
The common use of videophones could happen through three technologies that separately are n't exactly considered bleeding edge today : high - speed Internet , a television , and Skype .
Samsung says it will put the VoIP calling service Skype as an application on its televisions , allowing phone calls to be made on camera right from a couch , just like Jane Jetson talking into her TV set .
The Samsung Skype - enabled TV follows similar announcements from Panasonic and LG at the Consumer Electronics Show in January .
The models will range from to $ 1,200 to $ 2,000 for Panasonic 's set .
Samsung and LG have not yet announced how much they will charge .
The Skype on TV application should work similarly on all three models , which in turn should closely mimic the version of the application that many people use to make free PC to PC calls , or for a fee , PC to landline .
Skype accounts are free to set up and can be activated using the TV 's remote control right on the screen .
The video calls will also be free , as will voice calls between Skype users .
Using
Skype to call traditional landline and mobile phones is a few cents per minute .
Calls can be answered while watching a program , but it 's not yet possible to both talk and continue to watch uninterrupted .
By the time these models actually hit stores in late spring there should be three TV makers offering Skype on their TVs .
And not just any three TV makers , but the world 's largest overall ( Samsung sells practically one of every five TVs sold ) , the leader in plasmas ( Panasonic ) , and LG , which is close behind Samsung , selling 15 percent of all TVs .
While Robida wrote about the idea , AT&T did the most to advance the idea from the pages of Victorian sci-fi to actuality .
Unfortunately its 1960s videophone system , known as the Picturephone , was a bust .
Few ever signed up for the service because you had to reserve call times and pay a whopping $ 16 per minute .
The idea , however , was at least on the right track : making videophones accessible to normal folk .
Today teleconferencing is a common tool for companies to put employees in different locations virtually , if not physically , in the same conference room .
But the high cost of the fancy systems from companies like Cisco and Hewlett - Packard does n't make them consumer - friendly .
Cisco also announced at CES it would be offering a home version of its telepresence software sometime this year , and did not yet mention a price .
Videophones for the home have never really caught on in the way they have at businesses .
Even versions of the concept built into a corded telephone did n't really generate much excitement .
Usually this was a small screen attached to a phone base station and conversations had to take place wherever the phone was plugged in , which tended to be places like a dresser or a kitchen counter .
Video calls today can be made online .
They 're easy and cheap , and of course do n't require the purchase of an pricey new TV .
A computer with a built - in Webcam and a voice - over - IP service like Skype or a chat application like Yahoo Messenger usually suffice , but it is still an activity that 's attached to a computer , and therefore going to be intimidating to people who either do n't like or have trouble with technology .
TVs are far more accessible though .
Now with major companies like Samsung , Panasonic , and LG pushing the idea of the TV as videophone , the concept does at least have the chance to catch on .
Consumer surveys show that people are beginning to buy Internet - connected TVs , which allow not just Skype calls , but also other activities on the TV that are normally confined to the computer .
That includes accessing Internet radio and video streaming from services like Pandora and Netflix , and social sites like Twitter , Facebook , and Flickr .
A survey of 800 U.S. consumers who bought TVs in January found that 27.5 percent of them have connected their new sets to the Internet , either through the TV itself or via an external device such as a game console or digital video box , according to iSuppli .
And of those , almost 42 percent recently purchased a Web- connected TV .
And Skype likely wo n't be a brand new concept to a lot of those new TV owners .
Skype already has over 521 million registered accounts , so there 's a built - in audience who is already signed up and knows how to use it .
But the quality may not be what some people expect , says DisplaySearch analyst Paul Gagnon .
" Teleconferencing is inherently kind of a low - quality experience , especially in a consumer home .
On a computer it works OK , but blown up to the size of the TV , I was n't terribly impressed with some of the demos at CES , " he said .
And quality aside , even in terms of logistics , there 's a lot to consider .
Even with an Internet - connected TV , you still need a decent Internet connection , and for a two - way video call , you have to have people on the other end with the same set up .
In other words , " it 's really early , " Gagnon said .
Time will tell if videophones are just a fad or about to become an integral part of the modern idea of the " connected living room . "
The tools are there , but it 's entirely possible that people do n't want to use their TVs like that .
Either way , even if the latest incarnation of Robida 's telephonoscope does n't gain widespread acceptance , he still has a decent track record for his prognostications .
Other things he predicted in the same 1890 novel ?
The use of submarines , helicopters , and biological warfare .

Editor 's note : Arsalan Iftikhar is an international human rights lawyer , founder of TheMuslimGuy.com and legal fellow for the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding , a nonprofit research organization in Washington , D.C .
( CNN ) --
Within the last month , our country has witnessed two senseless , high - profile acts of criminal violence that would have been labeled terrorism if brown - skinned Arab Muslim men with foreign - sounding names had committed them .
Because two white men committed these acts of violence , however , our political and media chattering class never used the word " terrorism " in its discussions .
Most recently , John Patrick Bedell , a 36 - year - old man from California , walked up to two security guards outside the Pentagon Metro station in suburban Washington and started shooting .
He was then shot and killed .
According to The Christian Science Monitor , Bedell appeared " to have been a right - wing extremist with virulent anti-government feelings " and also battled mental illness before his shooting rampage .
A few weeks ago , on February 18 , another white anti-government extremist named Joseph Stack flew his small airplane into an Internal Revenue Service building in Austin , Texas , killing two people and injuring 13 others .
According to media reports , Stack had left behind a disjointed suicide letter in which he expressed his hatred of our American government and outlined grievances with the IRS , chillingly stating that " violence not only is the answer ; it is the only answer . "
Both the Pentagon Metro and IRS attacks come at a time of " explosive growth in [ domestic ] extremist - group activism across the United States , " according to the Southern Poverty Law Center .
A recently released law center report showed so - called patriot groups -- steeped in anti-government conspiracy theories -- grew from 149 in 2008 to 512 in 2009 -- a 244 percent increase that the Southern Poverty Law Center report judged to be an " astonishing " rise in the one - year period since President Obama took the oath of office .
The number of these groups that are domestic extremist paramilitary militias grew from 42 in 2008 to 127 in 2009 , the report said .
Even so , for any reasonable observer who is still skeptical about labeling the recent Pentagon area shooting and IRS attack terrorism , keep one thing in mind :
Let us imagine that these Pentagon and IRS attacks had been committed by an olive - skinned Arab Muslim man named Ali Muhammad .
Our national media and political commentators would have wasted little time in calling both of these acts terrorism , and some might have also called for the closings of other IRS and federal government office buildings around the country as a necessary counter - terrorism safety precaution .
Instead , shortly after the IRS plane attack , some prominent media commentators immediately asked why people -- especially conservatives on the right -- were not calling the IRS attacker a terrorist .
" If this had been done by a brownish - looking Muslim guy whose suicide note paralleled Islamist political themes , " wrote media commentator Matthew Yglesias , then right - wingers would " demand that anyone who refused to label the attack ' terrorism ' be put up on treason charges . "
In a recent piece , Robert Wright , of the New America Foundation , wrote : " In common usage , a ' terrorist ' is someone who attacks in the name of a political cause and aims to spread terror -- to foster fear that such attacks will be repeated until grievances are addressed . "
Following suit , the IRS attacker 's suicide manifesto before his aerial kamikaze attack reads in part : " I know there have been countless before me and there are sure to be as many after ...
I can only hope that the numbers quickly get too big to be whitewashed and ignored " -- at which point , God willing , -- " the American zombies wake up and revolt . "
If this same above - mentioned suicide letter had been instead written by an Arab Muslim man named Ali Muhammad right before crashing his airplane into an IRS building , most of the right - wing blogosphere would instantaneously erupt with screaming headlines of another act of Muslim terrorism .
Because Theodore Kaczynski , the Unabomber ; Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh ; Atlanta , Georgia , Olympic bomber Eric Rudolph ; the Pentagon shooter and IRS attacker were all white men motivated by their respective ideologies , surprisingly , the term " terrorism " has never seemed to stick to any of them .
To prove my point even further , the recently indicted American woman Colleen LaRose , who called herself " Jihad Jane , " can rightfully be termed a wanna - be terrorist .
But why does this not apply to other white extremists ?
If our nation is truly conducting a ' ' war on terror ' ' and not a " war on Islam , " it is our duty as Americans of all colors , political persuasions and nationalities to condemn and distance ourselves from all acts of terrorism , regardless of the race or religion of those who commit violent acts in the name of extreme ideology .
Simply put , terrorism is terrorism , whether it is committed by a white , black or brown person anywhere in the world .
If we as a nation fail to adequately condemn all acts of terrorism equally , the only clear message that we will be sending to the rest of the world is that the word " terrorist " applies only to those with olive skin and foreign - sounding last names .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Arsalan Iftikhar .
If you 've spent any significant time following the Open Internet campaign , you 'll see that Rudd 's censorship proposal is n't the only internet issue that gives the community cause to take umbrage .
In the last couple of months we 've also seen strong reactions to the AFACT vs iiNet copyright trial and the electoral comment laws in South Australia and Tasmania .
That latter subject in particular has lead some commentators to accuse the online civil liberties movement of a form of internet exceptionalism , as if they 're claiming normal laws somehow are n't supposed to apply to the internet .
So is the criticism valid , or is there some ideological common thread which draws the three subjects together ?
Let 's start with copyright :
Wind the clock back far enough , and you 'll find a society without copyright .
Early creative works funded either by commission or patronage , and the investment of effort involved in making large - scale copies was impractical to the point that a " copy right " was considered unnecessary .
The 15th century invention of the printing press spawned the democratisation of knowledge and the creation of the commercial book publishing industry , and by 1710 the English parliament was ready to pass what is now considered the world 's first copyright law , the Statute of Anne .
Copyright originally covered books then grew to address other creative works : piano rolls , sound recordings , photographs , architecture , and movies .
Through the centuries one aspect of copyright remained the same : Copyright only regulated people with the outlandish financial resources needed to own the printing presses and recording apparatus needed to duplicate copyrighted works .
As Jessica Litman discusses in her seminal work , Digital Copyright , that all changed in the early 1990's , when the US 9th Circuit observed that running a computer program required loading it from disk into RAM , which , in the absence of a license from the computer program 's publisher , qualified as an actionable RAM - based copy of the disk - based program .
No longer was copyright a rich - man 's game .
Our parents lived their lives without clashing with copyright , but since 1993 everyone with enough resources to own a computer invokes copyright each and every time we use it .
In other words : A change in technology has caused a law to extend into territory it was never designed to cover .
It 's easy to see parallels with the censorship issue citizens are increasingly strident about :
Our classification system has a very similar lineage .
Once again we have a legislative regime designed to affect corporations .
In the 1970's and 1980's , the only people who needed to care about running afoul of censorship laws were film studios and publishers .
Normal people lacked the resources to produce a classifiable mass - market film , or even to publish a book that 'd be read by more than a handful of people .
The edifice started to crack in 1997 , when the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions initiated proceedings for criminal prosecution against the editors of La Trobe University 's student newspaper , Rabelais .
Egged on by the Victorian Retail Traders Association , the DPP pressed charges relating to a Refused Classification satirical political article headed , " The Art of Shoplifting " .
The case thus became the first high - profile instance of Australia 's national classification code being used for political censorship .
The Full Bench of the Federal Court seemed to agree : Justice Heerey seemingly believed that the law was an ass , and indicated his displeasure by reproducing the entire text of the offending article in his written concurrence , thus making it available to all whether the Victorian DPP liked it or not .
Australia 's corporate - focussed classification regime has slowly crumbled ever since .
These days playing certain computer games has become a widespread , mainstream statement of civil disobedience against the Classification ( Films , Publications and Computer Games )
Act 1995 , and we can't inform ourselves about controversial political issues without wondering if we 're consuming content that " promotes , incites or instructs in matters of crime . "
And , of course , our Broadband Prevention Minister desires to extend this creaky edifice over the internet , where it 'll sink its tendrils ever deeper into our daily activities .
As the internet democratises media participation and turns more people into content creators , you can expect classification law to pass dehumanising judgements on more and more people , who will be surprised to find that their acts of personal creative expression are Refused Classification and banned .
And what of electoral comment ?
Same story .
In February 2010 , News Corporation 's Adelaide Now outlet hyperventilated about 2009 South Australian Electoral Act amendments requiring anyone commenting on an " electoral issue " during a campaign to identify themselves with their real name and postcode , and , in certain cases , their actual physical address .
The resulting furore eventually forced state Attorney - General Michael Atkinson to issue an embarrassing backdown , and to commit to overturning the amendments in the event that his party retained Government after the election .
Some commentators appeared to believe that the reaction by the online community was a tad inconsistent .
Stilgherrian accurately pointed out that netizens spend a good deal of their time ridiculing claims that the internet is different from any other aspect of human life , so protesting against online identification requirements which apply to radio , television and newspapers reeks of exceptionalism .
However , the fact that electoral law has always required comment outlets such as newspapers , TV and radio to identify electors during campaigns only highlights the issue : People are n't TV stations , and ought not be regulated as such .
Once again , we have a legal framework designed to regulate corporate and institutional participants in our society .
And once again , the rules are being stretched and distorted to cover the normal conversational activities of normal people carrying out normal online lives .
It is n't just South Australia , either .
Tasmania has an almost identical requirement , debated in parliament at an almost identical time , as if the respective governments of South Australia and Tasmania were in a monkey - see monkey - do race to out - stupid each other .
In the 2008 US Presidential Elections , the Obama campaign actively encouraged American voters to get involved in the campaign by publishing hundreds of thousands of YouTube videos .
A Pew Research study found that " 15 [ per cent ] of internet users have gone online to add to the political discussion by posting comments on a website or blog about a political or social issue , posting pictures or video content [ or other commentary ] online . "
Ordinary citizens talk about politics , and do some of their talking online .
So what would possess our 2009 politicians to make much of that activity impossible without exposing your personal life to stalkers and lawsuit cannons ?
Can a Tasmanian battered wife agitate online for changes to the Family Law Act during an election campaign without revealing her location to her violent husband ?
And if her political speech is restricted due to the TEC 's intimidation and his is n't , is Tasmania 's electoral system actually fair ?
Australia has an increasingly apparent body of law which was written before the internet arrived on our shores , and which , without major revision , will consistently and predictably lead to terrible outcomes for Australian citizens .
When we 're revolted by unjust outcomes caused by misapplication of these laws , our politicians have a choice between viewing our unrest as a problem and regulating ever more onerously to quash dissent , or seeing the law as the problem and amending it to accommodate the needs of Australians .
The South Australian Government has creditably backed down over the electoral comment issue , but the Tasmanian Electoral Commission has outright refused to entertain any discussion about how they 'll choose to exercise their prosecutorial discretion over this matter , allowing confusion over the legality of conversations to persist throughout an entire election campaign .
In contrast , the Federal Government wins applause for considered responses to my emailed enquiries , including published material to help voters distinguish between lawful anonymous discussion and unlawful unattributed paid political advertising .
Thus far the Government may be hedging its bets over the copyright issue , and has refrained from announcing any legislative response to the iiNet lawsuit despite some early off - the - reservation commentary .
Until they take the time to educate themselves about all sides of the issue , that 's perhaps a well - considered position .
That consideration is n't extending to the classification issue .
The 55,000 responses they 've had to the R18 + computer games inquiry should be telling them that the public is watching , with scornful disapproval of the reprehensible bipartisan hash - job that successive Governments have inflicted on our classification system .
So far their filtering policy has only been informed by pro-censorship lobbyists , and they 've either ignored or attacked everybody else .
Will they stretch classification past breaking point across the internet , or will they fix it ?
More broadly , we the people have a problem :
We 've all adapted to technology , integrated it into our lives , and changed our lifestyles accordingly .
But many of our politicians are still living in the 1990's , pretending the internet is another country and refusing to acquire the faintest clue about it .
You 'll see the signs whenever they confuse megabits with megabytes , invent jargon ( such as Rudd 's deplorably hilarious " bandspeed " ) , or blame " hackers " for taking down a website which has crashed because they 've neglected to provision it adequately .
They really have no idea .
Even worse , they appear to believe that we 're just like them , helpless , hapless and ignorant , in need of " protection " from online threats which they 've either misunderstood or just plain made - up .
In reality , their ignorance is far more dangerous to us than anything we 'll ever find on the internet --
And who is to protect us from them ?
Technology issues affect the environment , the NBN , our financial systems , our education systems , energy , heath care , media , and virtually every other aspect of our lives , and while we do n't expect our MPs to be geeky experts we should at least expect them to comprehend the issues as well as we do .
In the 21st century it should be utterly unacceptable to elect representatives who wilfully fail to understand how our country has changed in the presence of technology .
The modern world will not retard its progress to suit the needs of our 19th century institutions , we need the institutions to change to suit us -- and if our current crop of politicians are n't prepared to help , we need to replace them with some who are .
LOL ....
Does n't everyone know how to hold it in ?
You should be able to just tense your muscles ...
But it 's bad to hold in pee ,
so just find a bathroom
and then you wo n't worry about having to
hold it in anymore .
Even if you 're a boy .
or you can just rub your ***** and when you think it is about to slip put your finger right on top of your pee whole .
i do that and it works for me .
it stops the pee from coming out .
whatever you do not remove your finger off until you have a nice firm grip on your muscles in your pelvic area .
if you do release be fore you have a nice firm grip with your muscles it will spill out .
A boy can wrap an elastic band around his private bit to prevent peeing for a long time , to make it less painful , wrap a handcherchief around first and then put the elastic band around that .
Drink as much as you can to fill up your bladder .
After an hour or so , remove the band to allow some blood flow , for a few minutes , you might have to hold on in otherways for a few minutes , then replace the elastic band .
Do this for as long as you can stand , and after a few sessions of doing this , your bladder will have stretched and you will be able to hold on for ages without any of these tricks .
Girls will end up just wetting their knickers if they have a ' who can hold it the longest competition ' with you as it is just not possible for a girl to train their bladder like this .
This method is a bit painful , but as it's impossible to pee , your bladder has no choice but to stretch .
Dont over do it at 1st , build up gradually , you will soon have bladder to outwait any girl

Minister Stephen Conroy says he wo n't push for new laws to tackle illegal file - sharing while the movie and internet industries are unable to work together .
Senator Conroy said it was disappointing that the industries had ended up in court rather than working together to solve the problem .
" It 's always disappointing when situations like this end up in court , " he told ABC website Hungry Beast .
" I think that a mature approach by both the movie industry and the internet industry – sitting down , having a conversation and coming up with a code of practice – is the absolutely preferable outcome . "
Last week internet provider iiNet won a major legal battle over whether it should be held responsible for its customers downloading content illegally .
The case was an attempt by movie studios to force internet providers into policing the downloads of their users .
Senator Conroy said he still hoped the industries would work together to find a solution .
" I 've been trying for two years to encourage the sectors to have a dialogue and they 've got themselves into a court battle , " he said .
" But what I would still hope is that we can bring them together to sit down and settle their differences , create a code of practice that actually protects both parties . "
He said such talks would be better than the Government introducing new laws to curb file - sharing .

Senator Conroy interview on Hungry Beast – http://hungrybeast.abc.net.au/stories/isp-...
Back in October , the Obama Administration Justice Department issued a memorandum that seemed to constrain federal enforcement of laws against marijuana possession in states where medical marijuana is permitted under state law .
I welcomed the memo as a small sign of progress , but pointed out that it does n’t really constrain federal prosecutions in any meaningful way .
Federal prosecutors could still undertake virtually any marijuana prosecution they wanted without violating the memorandum ’s guidelines :
The key sticking point is that the memo only applies to uses of medical marijuana that are in “ clear and unambiguous compliance with state law ” … .
Given these disagreements [ over the interpretation of state law ] at the state and local level , it will usually be difficult to prove that any given medical marijuana user is in “ clear and unambiguous compliance state law , ” as opposed to merely arguable or probable compliance with it .
It ’s also worth noting that the memo does n’t actually tell prosecutors to forego pursuing cases against even those distributors and users who are in “ clear and unambiguous compliance . ”
It merely says that “ as a general matter , ” such prosecutions are “ unlikely to be an efficient use of limited federal resources . ”
A prosecutor who thinks that a given case is an exception to this generalization or believes that his office has some excess or underutilized “ resources ” might still pursue such cases .
The memo also outlines numerous situations where prosecution of medical marijuana distributors and users is still encouraged ….
This recent district court decision upholding the prosecution of a medical marijuana distributor in California ( a state which has legalized medical marijuana under state law ) , reaches much the same conclusions about the meaning of the memo as I did .
Like me , the judge noted the very loose nature of the memo ’s restrictions .
He also made this relevant point :
Even if Defendant ’s prosecution were contrary to the guidance set forth in the Memorandum , dismissal of the Indictment would not be warranted .
Defendant has not pointed to any authority for dismissing an indictment because it is contrary to internal Department of Justice guidelines … .
Indeed , the Memorandum specifies that it is not intended “ to create any privileges , benefits , or rights , substantive or procedural , enforceable by any individual , party or witness in any administrative , civil , or criminal matter ….
Rather , this memorandum is intended solely as a guide to the exercise of investigative and prosecutorial discretion . ”
Despite campaign rhetoric to the contrary , the Obama Administration has yet to make any genuine progress against the infringements on civil liberties and constitutional federalism created by the War on Drugs .
If the president really wanted to stop federal medical marijuana prosecutions in states where medical marijuana is legal under state law , he could have issued a clear and unequivocal executive order forbidding federal prosecutors from doing so , or instructed the attorney general to issue a firm policy guidance to that effect .
Unfortunately , he chose not to do so .
In fairness , the preceding Bush Administration was probably even worse on this front .
That , however , is not much consolation to me or other critics of the War on Drugs .

Hundreds of women who came to the UK from South Asia to marry say they have been treated as domestic slaves by their in - laws , the BBC has learned .
More than 500 who applied for residence in 2008 - 09 after their marriages broke down were deported because they could not prove any abuse had taken place .
Police and charities are concerned the incidents are not reported because of family pressure and fear of reprisals .
The UK Border Agency said measures were in place to try to prevent such abuse .
' Bloodied nose '
The women complaining of being treated as slaves by their families come from India , Pakistan and Bangladesh .
One woman in her 20s says she was imprisoned by her mother - in - law for three years at their house in the north of England .
She does not want to be named .
She has now started to come to terms with her ordeal , a year after her mother - in - law was prosecuted , but she says she still lives with the fear inside her .
" One day my mother - in - law beat me up really badly , " she says .
" There was a lot of blood coming out of my mouth and nose - I could n't tell anyone , call anyone or go anywhere .
" I used to get up at dawn and clean the whole house , scrub the floors , clean the windows , do the washing , cook .
In between I 'd have to sew . "
She tried to kill herself twice .
Eventually she managed to escape after her mother - in - law left her bedroom door unlocked .
" Staying inside all the time , not being allowed to watch TV or go out ...
I thought I 'd rather be dead than live like this . "
Marai Larasi says there is a lack of services for women Research by Imkaan , the national charity for Black and Asian victims of domestic violence , shows how difficult it is for other Asian women to report abuse .
It surveyed 124 women who use Asian refuges across the country .
" A woman may not speak English , may not be aware of what 's available in terms of services , she may be in a situation where everywhere she goes her abuser or a family member - who may be colluding in the abuse - is actually going with her , " says Imkaan director Marai Larasi .
" So her opportunity to disclose the abuse is compromised .
There 's also a real lack of services for women in this position . "
There are concerns that this lack of reporting is leading many abused women from South Asia to eventually be deported when their marriages break down and they apply to stay in the UK .
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LEAVE TO REMAIN APPLICATIONS GRANTED 2008/9 Pakistani : 240 Bangladeshi : 100 Indian : 100 Source : Home Office Home
Office rules state that any foreign national whose marriage breaks up within two years because of domestic violence can apply for indefinite leave to remain , but they must have reported the incident at the time to a person in authority - such as a GP or police officer .
Figures released by the Home Office show that more than half the number of South Asian brides who say they have been victims of domestic abuse in the UK have been deported in the last two years because they could not prove abuse had taken place .
Out of 980 applications for leave to remain in the UK in 2008 and 2009 , only 440 women were allowed to stay .
In a statement , the UK Border Agency said : " We take our role in providing protection to women very seriously .
We already have a number of measures in place to try and provide more directed support such as specific instructions , assessment of the quality of decisions and training for case workers . "
After the highly - publicised case of Naseebah Bibi last year , Lancashire Police say they believe the problem is widespread in some communities .
Bibi was jailed for treating her three daughters - in - law as slaves at their home in Blackburn .
" The women are facing pressure , not only from immediate family but also their extended family abroad who may be relying on the people in this country to finance them to help improve their lives , " says Lancashire Police 's Det Con Dave Souch , who led the Naseebah Bibi inquiry .
His colleague Sgt John Rigby described it as the " Cinderella syndrome " .
He adds : " The problem with slave labour , as it's been tagged , is probably far bigger than what we may expect - we can only go on the cases that are brought to our attention .
Sgt John Rigby says the problem is widespread " But we know from the partner agencies we work alongside - like the Women 's Aid Forums - who can tell you it 's widespread . "
Another woman , also in her 20s , was forced to flee her in - laws with her child .
She was also too scared to reveal her identity .
She explained : " If I made tea , it was for her or someone else .
I did n't have permission to drink tea with them because in the 15 - 20 minutes it would take , housework would not get done .
" She would swear at my family , and accuse me of taking things .
If any money or jewellery had been misplaced I would get the blame . "
She , too , was not allowed to speak to anyone outside of the family and was not allowed to go out by herself .
" Even a servant is allowed to have a break , but I was used like a machine , " she recalls .
" The worst thing about it was that my husband was n't there for me .
I 'd have done everything for him without complaining - but he did n't care about me or his baby . "
She managed to escape after a year - and - a - half .
She was rescued by her midwife , who alerted the authorities .
' Small proportion ' Parveen Javaid , domestic violence co-ordinator at Manchester - based Pakistani Resource Centre , said : " On average we deal with 20 to 30 cases a month where we give advice and support to women who are victims of mothers - in - law .
" The majority of cases I deal with are women who 've been kept as slaves - abuse within the house . "
To put this into context , just over 37,000 women have come to the UK on spousal visas in the last five years and while domestic violence workers say most of these marriages are genuine and successful , a small proportion of those marriages do fail .
What is clear is that this is still a hidden problem within South Asian communities .
It will remain so , unless women are encouraged to come forward and report it to the authorities .

Nowhere in the Bible does Jesus have a sword fight .
While preaching is n't allowed in Australian public schools , it is apparently fine to replace school counsellors with ' Christian Volunteers ' such as Darryl .
A few years back , the government realised that they could hand over school counselling roles to a willing Christian church without having to pay for the privilege .
Now almost half of Australian public schools have a Christian Volunteer as a full time member of the school community , with parents having no direct control of how much indoctrination their children are exposed to .
Although usually an advocate of people being entitled to their opinions , sexual preferences , and beliefs , I seem to have developed some form of mental glitch that makes me want to punch Darryl 's fat head .

David ThorneWednesday 10 March 2010 7.12 pmDarryl RobinsonPermission SlipDear Darryl , I have received your permission slip featuring what I can only assume is a levitating rabbit about to drop an egg on Jesus .
Thank you for pre-ticking the permission box as this has saved me not only from having to make a choice , but also from having to make my own forty five degree downward stroke followed by a twenty percent longer forty five degree upward stroke .
Without your guidance , I may have drawn a picture of a cactus wearing a hat by mistake .
As I trust my offspring 's ability to separate fact from fantasy , I am happy for him to participate in your indoctrination process on the proviso that all references to ' Jesus ' are replaced with the term ' Purportedly Magic Jew .
'
Regards , DavidDarryl RobinsonThursday 11 March 2010 9.18 amDavid ThorneRe : Permission SlipHello DavidThe tick in the box already was a mistake I noticed after printing them all .
I 've seen the play and it's not indoctrinating anyone .
It 's a fun play performed by a great bunch of kids .
You do n't have to be religious to enjoy it .
You 're welcome to attend if you have any concerns .
Darryl Robinson , School ChaplainDavid ThorneThursday 11 March 2010 11.02 amDarryl RobinsonRe : Re : Permission SlipDear Darryl , Thank you for the kind offer , being unable to think of anything more exciting than attending your entertaining and fun filled afternoon , I tried harder and thought of about four hundred things .
I was actually in a Bible based play once and played the role of ' Annoyed about having to do this . '
My scene involved offering a potted plant , as nobody knew what Myrrh was , to a plastic baby Jesus , then standing between ' I forgot my costume so am wearing the teacher 's poncho ' and ' I do n't feel very well ' .
Highlights of the play included a nervous donkey with diarrhoea causing ' I do n't feel very well ' to vomit onto the back of Mary 's head , and the lighting system , designed to provide a halo effect around the manger , overheating and setting it alight .
The teacher , later criticised for dousing an electrical fire with a bucket of water and endangering the lives of children , left the building in tears and the audience in silence .
We only saw her again briefly when she came to the school to collect her poncho .
Also , your inference that I am without religion is incorrect and I 'm actually torn between two faiths ; while your god 's promise of eternal life is very persuasive , the Papua New Guinean mud god , Pikkiwoki , is promising a pig and as many coconuts as you can carry .
Regards , DavidDarryl RobinsonThursday 11 March 2010 2.52 pmDavid ThorneRe : Re : Re : Permission SlipHello DavidWhile it would be a pity for Seb to miss out on the important message of hope that the story of the resurrection gives , if you do n't want him to attend the presentation on Monday then just tick the box that says I do not give my child permission to attend .
Darryl Robinson , School ChaplainDavid ThorneThursday 11 March 2010 5.09 pmDarryl RobinsonRe : Re : Re : Re : Permission SlipDear Darryl , I understand the importance the resurrection story holds in your particular religion .
If I too knew some guy that had been killed and placed inside a cave with a rock in front of it and I visited the cave to find the rock moved and his body gone , the only logical assumption would be that he had risen from the dead and is the son of God .
Once , my friend Simon was rushed to hospital to have his appendix removed and I visited him the next day to find his bed empty .
I immediately sacrificed a goat and burnt a witch in his name but it turned out that he had not had appendicitis , just needed a good poo , and was at home playing Playstation .
Someone probably should have asked " So the rock has been moved and he 's gone ... has anyone checked his house ? "
I realise Playstation was not around in those days but they probably had the equivalent .
A muddy stick or something .
I would have said " Can someone please check if Jesus is at home playing with his muddy stick , if not , then and only then should we all assume , logically , that he has risen from the dead and is the son of God .
"
If we accept though , that Jesus was the son of an Infinite Being capable of anything , he probably did have a Playstation .
Probably a Playstation 7 .
I know I have to get my offspring all the latest gadgets .
God would probably have said to him , " I was going to wait another two thousand years to give you this but seeing as you have been good ... just do n't tell your mother about Grand Theft Auto .
" Also , is it true that Jesus can be stabbed during a sword fight and be ok due to the fact that he can only die if he gets his head chopped off ?

Learning the teachings of the Bible is not just about religion .
It teaches a set of ethics that are sadly not taught by parents nowadays .
Darryl Robinson , School ChaplainDavid ThorneFriday 12 March 2010 2.23 pmDarryl RobinsonRe : Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : Permission SlipDear Darryl , You raise a valid point and I appreciate you pointing out my failings as a parent .
Practising a system of ethics based on the promise of a reward , in your case an afterlife , is certainly preferable to practising a system of ethics based on it simply being the right thing to do .
Many years ago , I lived next door to a Christian named Mr Stevens .
You could tell he was a Christian because he had a fish sticker on his Datsun .
He used to wave at us kids from his bathroom window on hot summer days as we played in the sprinkler .
I learnt a lot from Mr Stevens .
Mainly about wrestling holds .
The trick is to oil up really well making it hard for the other person to hold you down .
I would often lie on his living room rug looking up at the pictures of sunsets behind quotes from Psalms while waiting for him to unwrap his legs from around my torso .
Your job would be made much easier if , after making the school children sit through an hour of church youth group teens dancing , singing and re-enacting Jewish magic tricks , you simply told them that it was just a small taste of what hell is like and if they did n't believe in Jesus they would have to sit through it again .
When I was at school , we were forced to attend a similar presentation .
Herded into the gym under the pretence of free chips , we were assaulted with an hour of hippies playing guitars and a dance routine featuring some kind of colourful coat and a lot of looking upwards .
Due to the air - conditioning in the packed gym not working and it being a hot day , the hippie wearing the colourful coat blacked out mid performance and struck his head against the front edge of the stage spraying the first row of cross - legged children with blood .
Unconscious , he also urinated .
There was a bit of screaming and an ambulance involved and everyone agreed it was the best play they had ever seen .

It 's important for children to have balance in their life and spirituality is as important in a childs life as everything else .
There 's an old saying that life without religion is life without beauty .
Darryl Robinson , School ChaplainDavid ThorneFriday 12 March 2010 3.36 pmDarryl RobinsonRe : Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : Permission SlipDear Darryl , I agree completely that balance is an important component of a child 's education .
I will assume then that you will also be organising a class excursion to a play depicting the fifteen billion year expansion of the universe from its initial particle soup moments following the big bang through to molecule coalescion , galaxy and planetary formation and eventually life ?
Perhaps your church youth group could put together an interpretive dance routine representing the behaviour of Saturn 's moon Hyperion , shattered by an ancient collision and falling randomly back together , tugged to and fro by the gravitational pull of Titan , sixteen sister moons , the multi-billionfold moonlets of Saturn ’s rings , Saturn ’s gravitational field , companion planets , the variability ’s of Sol , stars , galaxy , neighbouring galaxies ...... or possibly not , according to an old saying , there 's no beauty in this .
Also , while I understand that the play is to be held off school grounds - due to the fact that it is illegal to present medieval metaphysic propaganda in public schools - it is also my understanding that you are now required by law , as of last year , to go by the title Christian Volunteer rather than School Chaplain .
A memo you may have missed or filed in your overflowing ' facts that cease to exist when they are ignored ' tray .

Specially constructed molecules could potentially block the expression of genes critical to the reproduction of viruses and the spread of cancer .
But until now , doctors had been unable to direct those molecules to the right cellular nuclei .
Scientists from the California Institute of Technology solved this problem by placing the RNA molecules in a specialized polymer robot with a chemical sensor .
When the environment of a cancerous cell triggered the chemical sensor , the robot releases the RNA .
Weekly Column
It is generally understood that today ’ youth are more supportive of equality for gay and lesbian people .
Faced with losing the next generation , fundamentalists are ferociously scrambling to capture the minds of youth through homeschooling and the subversion of public education .
By sequestering students at home or creating public schools where the only drink served in the cafeteria is Kool - Aid , they hope to reprogram tomorrow ’ leaders .
It appears America ’ religious fanatics are modeling their efforts on the success of radical Islamists in the Middle East , who reversed the trend of secularization in the region by hijacking education .
New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman recently wrote about this phenomenon :
Beginning in the 1970s , the trend in Yemen , Morocco , Egypt and the Persian Gulf “ was to Islamicize education as a way to fight the left … ”
… Then , in 1979 , after the Saudi ruling family was shaken by an attack in Mecca from its own Wahabi fundamentalists , the Saudi regime , to fend off the anger of its Wahabis , gave them free rein to Islamicize education and social life in Saudi Arabia and neighboring states .
The rest is a very sad and tragic history .
In America , according to the Aug. 7 , 2009 edition of The Economist magazine , the number of children who are home - schooled ‚Äî1.5 million ‚Äîhas doubled in the past decade , and 83 percent of home - schooling families do so for religious or moral reasons .
It is important to realize that the goal of many in the homeschooling movement is to create an army of zealot zombies who are committed to transforming America into a fundamentalist “ Christian Nation . ”
“ We are not home - schooling our kids just so they can read , ” said Michael Farris , the founder of the Home School Legal Defense .
“ The most common thing I hear is parents telling me they want their kids to be on the Supreme Court .
And if we put enough kids in the farm system , some may get to the major leagues . ”
Many of the cult - kiddies are coming of age and have already infiltrated Washington .
Homeschoolers are well represented on Capitol Hill , and they played a disproportionate role in George W. Bush ’ administration .
While many of these students are educated in terms of test scores , they may lack critical thinking skills .
In a sense , they are like computers with large hard drives that have been programmed with faulty software .
No matter how fast they compute they always arrive at same flawed conclusions based on the Biblical bugs planted early in their memory chips .
For example , Children ’ Conferences International hosts events across the nation for homeschoolers .
Their “ 2010 theme ” is science fiction , except to keep the minds of the children pure there will be no extraterrestrials allowed .
“ Parents wo n’t have to worry about their children learning about aliens or some mysterious force in this fun filled futuristic space age theme , ” according to their website .
“ Children WILL learn important life lessons about trusting God , faith over atheism , and the dangers of being enamored by the world . ”
Instead of E.T. and space , these poor children have to endure crazy , spaced out adults determined to strip - mine their minds and corrupt their imaginations .
In my view , this is a form of child abuse and deprives these students of real childhood experiences , while making them closed - minded .
Of course , funneling children into homeschooling is not enough for these predators .
In order to succeed , the extreme right must hijack the curriculum of public schools .
They are already making serious inroads in Texas , with zealots on the state school board rewriting history textbooks .
This is vitally important because Texas is such a large consumer of textbooks , that they essentially have the ability to set the standards for much of the nation .
So , if history is rewritten in Austin , the revisions will likely appear in your state as well .
One leader of the public school putsch , according to a recent cover story in The New York Times Magazine , is Cynthia Dunbar , a member of the Texas Board of Education .
In 2008 , she published a book called , “ One Nation Under God ” where she wrote : “ Hence , the only accurate method of ascertaining the intent of the Founding Fathers is from a biblical worldview . ”
She also stated , “ this battle for our nation ’ children and who will control their education and training is crucial to our success for reclaiming our nation . ”
For all of her passion , Dunbar is opposed to public education , writing of , “ The inappropriateness of a state - created taxpayer - supported school system , ” and says that sending children to public schools is akin to , “ throwing them into the enemy ’ flames , even as the children of Israel threw their children to Molech . ”
Clearly , Dunbar ’ real agenda is infiltrating the school system in order to destroy it .
When it comes to support , the next generation was supposed to be a wash .
However , this successful trajectory is threatened if we allow today ’ youth to be brainwashed .
While paying attention to school boards is boring , it must become a priority for all Americans who want schools to be about education instead of indoctrination .
Chris Avellone came into the games industry writing pen-and - pencil role - playing games .
An opportunity in the late '90s brought him to Interplay , where he went on to be lead designer on Planescape : Torment — one of the eeriest , most innovative computer role - playing games — and also worked on Fallout 2 .
In the '00s , he moved to Obsidian , where he has worked on such titles as Neverwinter Nights 2 and Star Wars : Knights of the Old Republic II , the second in a series that for many , rescued the Star Wars franchise from George Lucas .
His next game , Alpha Protocol , is an espionage role - playing game slated to ship later this year .
He is also working on the upcoming Fallout : New Vegas .

We caught up with Avellone at the Game Developers Conference to talk about his Dungeons & Dragons past , how he broke into the industry , his design philosophy , character relationships , morality , questions we ’ve always wanted to ask about Planescape : Torment , evil and destruction on an epic scale , and how he would translate a television show like The Wire into a game .
The A.V. Club :
You ’ve said that you got started in gaming by playing Dungeons & Dragons in high school .
Advertisement
Chris Avellone : I used to run a weekly tabletop game with three or four friends .
It originally started out with Dungeons & Dragons , and then we moved on to superhero games like Champions , and I think we may have tried GURPS Supers for a brief period of time .
And then a pen-and - paper game called Superworld .
I kept doing the gamemastering thing , and once you actually do all the writing and the map drawing for the adventures , you ’re like , “ I wish I could do something else with this . ”
So I kept sending my dungeon designs off to Dungeon magazine , and I amassed so many rejections .
Advertisement
AVC : What kind of gamemaster were you ?
CA : I think I erred on the side of planning too much .
Like , I would actually write out the cutscenes and narrate the cutscenes to people to get the session started .
So they knew where they were , what the context of the situation was .
Sometimes I would describe a cutscene that would just throw them right in the middle of combat , without warning .
Advertisement
The map layouts tended to be pretty detailed .
I ’d actually keep those battle mats off to the side and covered with a blanket .
I had drawn out all the locations of the enemies and everything , and then I would pull that out once the battle started .
They ’d be like , “ Oh shit !
Everyone power up ! ”
We used miniatures and tactics a lot .
And then I think I had way too many tables and charts behind the gamemaster ’s screen .
With each of the players in the campaign , I would talk with them about where they wanted their characters to do , the challenges they were looking forward to , and certain disadvantages they had built into their character .
Like , “ Why do you have this alcohol problem ?
Why do you have this issue with guns ? ”
And once I had that skeleton for how they wanted the character to develop , I ’d try to make sure I included those in each campaign , to give them a moment to shine both from the character flaw aspect , like , “ Here ’s an instance where you actually have to deal with alcoholism in the middle of a fight . ”
Or , do things like , “ Here ’s a chance for the super - strong character to shine in this one situation .
He ’s the only one who can be there hero in this one situation . ”
Just to make them feel special .
It keeps them coming back for more .

AVC : Were you ever into computer games ?
CA : I absolutely knew that I wanted to play role - playing games when I saw a friend of mine playing Bard ’s Tale 2 on his Commodore 64 .
And I ’m like , “ What ’s that ? ”
And he goes , “ Well , it ’s Bard ’s Tale .
You make up your whole party , the dungeon ’s already made for you , it acts as the gamemaster and you just go and accumulate experience and get loot . ”
“ So you can play D & D without having to get three or four guys together and write your own adventures ?
Wow , I really want to play that ! ”
So I got a Commodore 64 , started tearing through all the Bard ’s Tale series , and Wasteland , all those RPGs like Might & Magic — and I ’m like , “ This is fantastic ! ”
And of course , I would stay up way too late , forsake homework , and my mom was like , “ You know what , if you do n’t apply yourself you ’re never going to get a career doing anything like this . ”
Advertisement
AVC : How did you break into the gaming industry ?
CA : I actually was n’t sure I ’d be able to .
I spent a year after college just writing pen and paper games .
Midway through college , I got my break with Champions .
Because they needed to fill a character book for the Dark Champions line — which was sort of like their Batman line — and they ’re like , “ Hey , you know what , you ’ve been applying for about the last five years .
We have to do a book ; why do n’t you go ahead and give it a shot ? ”
Advertisement
So I wrote a book for that called Underworld Enemies .
And then I got more work , just writing more modules and more adventures .
Some of them I had already used in campaigns that I had run .
The pay was terrible .
It was $ 50 every two months .
And you ca n’t live on that .
( Laughs )
So finally I talked to my editor and said , “ If you ever hear of a real job in the game industry , or even in the computer game industry , I ’d be curious to hear it . ”
At that time as luck would have it , Interplay was forming their D & D division .
It was called Dragonplay , and they were looking for junior designers .
Advertisement
I [ interviewed with ] Mark O’Green , who was the division director at that time .
He said , “ Hey , if you wanted to do a Planescape game , how would you start it ? ”
They had the Planescape license , and they actually had n’t done anything with it yet .
And I ’m like , “ Oh , I ’d have it start with a character who wakes up from the dead , maybe right after the death screen he gets right back up and suddenly he finds himself in the mortuary , and he has to figure out what ’s going on . ”
And he said , “ All right .
That could work . ” ( Laughs )
And then I went back , and he offered me a job for like $ 22,000 or something .
I was like , “ Oh man , this is fantastic ! ”
Advertisement
AVC : You mentioned that you were looking first for a job in pen-and - paper games .
Was getting into computer games a second choice , and was it an odd adjustment ?
CA : To be honest , it was a second choice .
I did n’t have as much exposure to computer games , so I was n’t sure exactly how they were developed .
But mostly because I had already been doing the pen-and - paper modules for so long , it just felt more natural to me that , “ Oh , if I actually get in with a pen-and - paper company , and write source books and modules ” — I was already familiar with that , so that seemed more comfortable to me .
I was actually kind of surprised that the computer game option became a reality , and that I was able to keep going with it .
Advertisement
AVC : When you started doing junior design work on computer games , was it hard to make an adjustment ?
CA : The two problems that popped up , the very first one was , as much detail as I put into the pen-and - paper campaigns back home , I discovered that was n’t enough .
I have to know every single inventory item that this character is carrying , I have to know their specific appearance , I need to know their hair color , I needed to know all these things about the character model that I would never have had to describe before .
Advertisement
The other thing was , a lot of pen-and - paper ideas would n’t work for computer games .
If you want to have this big epic - scale war , in a pen-and - paper game you could just describe that , isolate a section of the battle — doing that on a computer game is obviously a much , much different matter .
AVC : Planescape : Torment did some interesting things with the player - character .
While the game revolves around the character , he does n’t have to save the world — this is just his story , and the world around him really does n’t care .
Advertisement
CA : On my long list of hates about RPGs , one of them was , I always felt it was an unnecessary chore to make you care about a world when in fact what most players care about is their own personal experience .
So in Planescape , we [ decided ] , “ We ’re just going to make everything about you .
This is your journey , the planes are n’t going to explode — it ’s all about your personal journey , and about everything that took place that you did beforehand that ’s caused this situation . ”
And that ’s how we wanted to keep it .
You want to have a totally selfish adventure ?
I ’m right there with you .
That ’s fantastic .
I do n’t want you to save a nation or go rescue the princess or kill the evil wizard , I want you to save yourself , and you figure out how to do it .
It ’s all about you , so enjoy it .
Because that ’s the kind of game that I want to play .
AVC : I read that you do n’t like romances in games .
Over the '00s , the romances with companions have gotten more and more elaborate .
And BioWare ’s Dragon Age : Origins has even been compared to a “ love sim ” : some players focus all their attention on the romance options and barely notice the main plot .
Advertisement
CA : I ’ve got to be honest , I absolutely do n’t like designing romances .
I think that you get a lot more drama and impact from failed romances , or unrequited relationships that occur in games .
I think that creates more player tension .
I ’ve had debates with forum members where , I guess I would agree that romances can still work , as long as the consummation happens near the end .
I just follow the soap opera methodology , that once a relationship is consummated , you are now in danger of boring the player .
Because it ’s consummated , that problem is solved , and in a dramatic situation that ’s not necessarily what you want to happen .
It just seemed like more tension could be had when there ’s something flawed there , or there ’s a disconnect , and you might be able to get more of an emotional impact when those things are n’t consummated , but you know why .
So that ’s kind of like the approach that I take .
Now , that said , I ’m kind of hypocritical in that when I ’m playing Mass Effect , Mass Effect 2 , I do want that consummation .
I want to figure out what makes Jack [ in Mass Effect 2 ] go this way or that away .
So I guess I have two sides warring there .
But from a design perspective , I feel like keeping the drama going is more important .
Advertisement
AVC : Since the late '90s , we ’ve seen role - playing games experiment with this morality mechanic , where your actions are judged as “ good ” or “ evil . ”
But recently , role - playing games have started to move away from this .
BioWare ’s Dragon Age : Origins does n’t have any moral scale — it ’s all about politics and the practical choices you make .
And in Alpha Protocol , you can use suave tactics or brutal , expedient ones , depending on how you want to play , but it seems like you ’re framing the choices in pragmatic terms , rather than as “ good ” or “ evil . ”
Do you feel role - playing games are moving away from that simple moral scale , to something more pragmatic ?
CA : I think it depends a lot on the genre .
For example , in Star Wars , the good and evil mechanic obviously makes a lot of sense .
It ’s mandatory .
Depending on the other genres , like , in Dragon Age like you ’re saying , it ’s the political machinations that you ’re trying to do .
And Alpha Protocol , I think we recognize that because you ’re in such a moral gray area , and that ’s part of the genre as well , we decided that it ’s not [ about ] having some sort of morality scale .
You do n’t have one .
It ’s all what other people think of the actions that you ’ve done , and then they have perception values based on how they see you , based on their own worldviews .
The more goody two - shoes character over here may find what you ’ve done reprehensible .
The more pragmatic ex-spy over here , however , understands exactly why you need to get this done .
And the reputation scales will vary accordingly .
That felt more true for us in that genre .
Advertisement
When you ’re presented with choices in RPGs , more and more , I definitely think the solely good , solely evil path — those decisions being obvious — that ’s starting to become old - generation .
The next generation is going to be more like The Witcher , where you ’re given a situation , you ’re not exactly sure which [ choice ] is absolutely right because both of them are right in different ways , or they ’re evil in two different ways .
You ’ve got to make the least evil choice .
And then you see the consequences that spawn out of that .
When you do n’t clearly identify it as good or evil , that liberates the player to make the choice that just feels right .
And I ’m totally in support of that .
Advertisement
AVC : Do you think the shift is also caused because games are finding more ways to show you those consequences , and to carry the results of your action all the way through the game — as opposed to giving you a choice and then letting you get your “ evil ” points , move on and forget about it .
CA : In Alpha Protocol , right from the outset , the parameters of the game explain to you that the mission needs to get done .
How you approach that is your decision .
The rewards and penalties for either path , those are going to balance out into different consequences .
We wanted to make sure the player absolutely avoided the perception that , if reputation goes down with somebody , or if it seems like you ’re getting penalized for something , there ’s another consequence based on your actions that ends up being positive .

The best examples we ’ve talked about is , if you encounter this one weapons dealer , you have the choice to let him go , or to bring him in for questioning .
And clearly bringing him in for questioning and cutting off all arms traffic in the region and the resulting destruction , is a good thing .
But then it ’s quite clear that if you do that , you ’re going to lose your connection to the guy who ’s a much bigger target .
So then you say , “ well crap , if I let this guy free , there ’s a greater chance I ’m going to find the big guy .
But at the same time , if I let that guy go free , he ’s going to cause a certain amount of damage . ”
AVC : Do you think a good system is one that rewards you for sticking to one path — for being the ultimate Jack Bauer — or do you think it ’s feasible to let someone be a Bauer sometimes , and a Bond others ?

CA : Yeah , I think actually any morality system that rewards only the extremes is a flawed system .
Players do n’t approach life that way , they do n’t approach games that way , and they should n’t be trained to approach games that way .
They should n’t be in the Star Wars mode where , “ I ’ve got to choose every good option . ”
They should just play the game .
And they should get equal consequences or rewards for that , that are different from the extremes .
AVC : In Alpha Protocol , I also understand you can torture people .
Was that difficult to handle ?

CA : When we have the option to use physical force , that does get you information quickly .
And at the same time , we ’re very quick to show you all the negative results that occur because of that .
Also , [ in ] the pacifist options where you go through levels without killing anybody , or you stealth through the entire thing , a lot of your enemies have a lot more respect for the fact that you do n’t do a lot of collateral damage or kill people on missions .
Because no spy really wants a fucking murderer running around blowing everyone ’s head off .
No one in the intelligence community respects somebody like that .
They just want them dead .
AVC : A lot of characters in your games have that kind of epic capacity for destruction .
Planescape : Torment was very dark , Neverwinter Nights 2 : Mask of the Betrayer had some pretty dire endings , and in Knights of The Old Republic II , the character Darth Nihilus is just consumed by the Dark Side of the Force , and he ’s a voracious energy - eater .
You ’re talking about something so destructive it ’s beyond evil .
Advertisement
CA : With Nihilus , it was more of the sense that he ’d given himself over to the Dark Side so completely he had no personality left .
He was just a feeling of hunger .
There was n’t even evil behind it .
It always seems more heroic for the player to triumph over something that ’s even larger than an emotion , or even the universe itself .
The bigger you can make that threat , and the more nebulous you can make that threat — there are certain things we did with Darth Nihilus for example , so that you could n’t identify with him as a human being .
He was more of a force of nature .
Because fighting a force of nature is far more epic than fighting one particular person .

We even found in the Aliens game that we were doing , there was a temptation to give more information about the Aliens .
But that would make them less scary .
Why would I ever want to know an Alien ’s vulnerability ?
Their whole goal in an Aliens movie is to terrify the shit out of you , and the more you know about them , they become more terrifying .
They ’re more like a force of nature .
And that ’s totally my philosophy with things like that .
AVC : Something I always wanted to know from Planescape : Torment .
One of the companions , Fall - from - Grace , carries a diary in her inventory .
Is there any way to open it ?
Advertisement
CA : No .
AVC : What do you call a thing like that ?
It breaks the rule of inventory , and it ’s this little mystery that ’s always in front of you .
Advertisement
CA : I think the expression is “ flaunting the gaps . ”
Basically , you include something that ’s appropriate for the character , and it ’s also appropriate that you ca n’t use it .
You should n’t be able to access her diary at all .
It seemed important to me that there are certain things characters would wear and would n’t wear , or they would keep around them for their own personal reasons that do n’t make a shred of combat sense .
These are things that are comforting to them .
And it makes sense why it ’s in their inventory .
And you see the negative game mechanic effect of it — yes , it takes one inventory slot , that sucks — but at the same time that ’s appropriate for her .
It feels more real [ as a way to ] tie the story into the game mechanics .
Advertisement
AVC : You once said that a property you ’d love to turn into a game is The Wire .
And that ’s a very pragmatic show .
The decisions people make are rarely about doing the right thing .
It ’s more about risk , and cowardice .
CA : Do you put your ass on the line ?
And if you put your ass on the line , they show you the consequences of what happens , and they ’re horrible .
You understand exactly why the system is the way it is , and it just makes you sad .
Advertisement
AVC : It would be an interesting premise for a game .
CA : Well , you ’d have a certain level of influence points , to trade for favors … I guess what fascinated me about The Wire was the slow , steady accumulation of police work to achieve a desired goal .
And even once you achieve the goal , the amount of effort it takes to make that goal stick , if you can make that happen .
But the way they did it was paced so well that I think you could actually do a game , just doing that slow , steady process of evidence accumulation , whether through the social - networking aspect , putting the leads out , having the surveillance teams positioned in certain areas .
You only have x number of resources , and what will you do to get more resources to cover other areas ?
Advertisement
AVC : Yeah .
You lost the camera .
What do you do now ?
CA : Yeah , that ’s some serious shit !
And then the psychology of the guys comes into play .
You do n’t want McNulty anywhere near a bar during certain surveillance scenes , because you know what ’s going to happen .
They each have their own specific game mechanic disadvantages .
You do n’t want the druggie guy constantly picking up drugs or having loose cash available , because if he has that stuff , he ’s bailing after the mission to buy more drugs .
Juggling stuff like that seemed really interesting .
Inquiring minds are reading about student riots at the University of California .
Students at the University of California ’s flagship Berkeley campus took to the streets on Friday night , vandalizing university buildings , burning trash cans and clashing with police in the latest expression of frustration over cuts to the educational budget in California .
In November , the University of California Board of Regents voted to raise tuition by 32 percent .
At the same time , professors were asked to take pay cuts or be furloughed , classes were eliminated and class size increased .
Protests erupted across the University of California system , particularly at UC Davis and UCLA .
Student Loan Defaults Soar
Every year , tens of thousands of college students and graduates stop making payments on their student loans .
For more than a decade , that loan - default rate was in decline because the federal government toughened penalties for schools with high shares of defaults .
Now , the rate is increasing again and not just because of the economy .
The problem is particularly acute in Arizona , which has the nation 's highest overall default rate on federal student loans : 9.8 percent in fiscal year 2007 , the latest figures available .
But more than default rates , it is the high levels of debt that are provoking alarm among consumer advocates .
That has heightened scrutiny of for - profit schools .
Tuition at for - profit schools can easily top $ 10,000 a year .
The average loans for a student who earned a bachelor 's degree totaled $ 32,650 in the 2007 - 08 school year , compared with $ 17,700 at public universities .
At community colleges , the average for two - year degrees was $ 7,125 .
In Arizona , for - profit schools are booming .
They have more than doubled the number of students they serve in the past five years , and more students are at for - profit schools than all three of the state 's public universities combined .
Last school year , for - profit schools enrolled nearly 468,000 students , according to the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education , a state agency that licenses and regulates most for - profit schools .
About 55 percent were from Arizona , and the rest lived elsewhere and attended school online .
In December , the University of Phoenix settled a whistleblower lawsuit in federal court for $ 78.5 million over recruiter - pay practices .
Two former enrollment counselors sued in 2004 , alleging the school defrauded the government of billions of dollars in financial aid and violated federal law by paying recruiters based on enrollment .
The company said the pay practices were legal because enrollment was not the sole determinant .
The university did not admit any wrongdoing .
Nationally , for - profit schools had the highest share of defaults in the United States in 2007 : 11 percent .
Community colleges had a nearly 10 percent rate , and private , non-profit universities had the lowest rates , at 3.7 percent , according to the U.S. Department of Education .
Student Loan Scam
Millennials had better learn quickly that they face coming of age through middle age and end of life in a world in which they will be forced to consume one - third to half as much in per capita energy terms and associated material production and consumption .
Thus , they should be rioting to cut taxes and to cut government including cutting funding for places like " Berzerkley " and the many worthless programs and costly administrative and pension payouts .
What " Berzerkley " or a state or private university confers on the vast majority of students is a " credential " and " legitimacy " within the existing division of labor and state tax farm .
Their " education " is mostly in terms of being conditioned to conform to the costly state superstructure , including submitting to tax , wage , and debt servitude for life .
What they will " learn " in terms of actual occupational skills , self - reliance , and productive wealth creation they could learn at a much lower cost ( and higher return to them ) than 4 + years of university " education " by actually doing something productive , paid or not , as a youth .
Rioting for more government largess extracted eventually from their meager paychecks in the future is suicide and merely sustains for a while longer the system they perceive themselves to be opposing or attempting to reform .
They are wasting their valuable time and youthful vitality rioting against the intractable state when they could be using their time and efforts to form productive private associations in parallel or outside the existing division of labor and social and political superstructure .
Expect More Riots
There will be more riots , and over more issues .
Students are traditionally always the first to riot , since most of them are young and rebellious , and therefore it 's easier to get them to engage in street protest and vent their anger .
The only groups that may even be more riot prone are French farmers and Greek public workers .
How Good Is That Education ?
Education System Benefits Recruiters , Administrators , Teachers , Staff
By Fidel Castro Ruz
January 14 , 2010 --
Two days ago [ January 12 ] , at almost six o’clock in the evening Cuban time and when , given its geographical location , night had already fallen in Haiti , television stations began to broadcast the news that a violent earthquake - – measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale -– had severely struck Port - au - Prince .
The seismic phenomenon originated from a tectonic fault located in the sea just 15 kilometres from the Haitian capital , a city where 80 % of the population inhabit fragile homes built of adobe and mud .
The news continued almost without interruption for hours .
There was no footage , but it was confirmed that many public buildings , hospitals , schools and more solidly constructed facilities were reported collapsed .
I have read that an earthquake of the magnitude of 7.3 is equivalent to the energy released by an explosion of 400,000 tons of TNT .
Tragic descriptions were transmitted .
Wounded people in the streets were crying out for medical help , surrounded by ruins under which their relatives were buried .
No one , however , was able to broadcast a single image for several hours .
The news took all of us by surprise .
Many of us have frequently heard about hurricanes and severe flooding in Haiti , but were not aware of the fact that this neighbouring country ran the risk of a massive earthquake .
It has come to light on this occasion that 200 years ago , a massive earthquake similarly affected this city , which would have been the home of just a few thousand inhabitants at that time .
At midnight , there was still no mention of an approximate figure in terms of victims .
High - ranking United Nations officials and several heads of government discussed the moving events and announced that they would send emergency brigades to help .
Given that MINUSTAH ( United Stabilization Mission in Haiti ) troops are deployed there -– UN forces from various countries –- some defence ministers were talking about possible casualties among their personnel .
It was only yesterday morning when the sad news began to arrive of enormous human losses among the population , and even institutions such as the United Nations mentioned that some of their buildings in that country had collapsed , a word that does not say anything in itself but could mean a lot .
For hours , increasingly more traumatic news continued to arrive about the situation in this sister nation .
Figures related to the number of fatal victims were discussed , which fluctuated , according to various versions , between 30,000 and 100,000 .
The images are devastating ; it is evident that the catastrophic event has been given widespread coverage around the world , and many governments , sincerely moved by the disaster , are making efforts to cooperate according to their resources .
Why is Haiti so poor ?
The tragedy has genuinely moved a significant number of people , particularly those in which that quality is innate .
But perhaps very few of them have stopped to consider why Haiti is such a poor country .
Why does almost 50 % of its population depend on family remittances sent from abroad ?
Why not analyse the realities that led Haiti to its current situation and this enormous suffering as well ?
The most curious aspect of this story is that no one has said a single word to recall the fact that Haiti was the first country in which 400,000 Africans , enslaved and trafficked by Europeans , rose up against 30,000 white slave masters on the sugar and coffee plantations , thus undertaking the first great social revolution in our hemisphere .
Pages of insurmountable glory were written there .
Napoleon 's most eminent general was defeated there .
Haiti is the net product of colonialism and imperialism , of more than one century of the employment of its human resources in the toughest forms of work , of military interventions and the extraction of its natural resources .
This historic oversight would not be so serious if it were not for the real fact that Haiti constitutes the disgrace of our era , in a world where the exploitation and pillage of the vast majority of the planet 's inhabitants prevails .
Billions of people in Latin American , Africa and Asia are suffering similar shortages although perhaps not to such a degree as in the case of Haiti .
Situations like that of that country should not exist in any part of the planet , where tens of thousands of cities and towns abound in similar or worse conditions , by virtue of an unjust international economic and political order imposed on the world .
The world population is not only threatened by natural disasters such as that of Haiti , which is a just a pallid shadow of what could take place in the planet as a result of climate change , which really was the object of ridicule , derision and deception in Copenhagen .
Real and lasting solutions needed
It is only just to say to all the countries and institutions that have lost citizens or personnel because of the natural disaster in Haiti : we do not doubt that in this case , the greatest effort will be made to save human lives and alleviate the pain of this long - suffering people .
We cannot blame them for the natural phenomenon that has taken place there , even if we do not agree with the policy adopted with Haiti .
But I have to express the opinion that it is now time to look for real and lasting solutions for that sister nation .
In the field of healthcare and other areas , Cuba –- despite being a poor and blockaded country -– has been cooperating with the Haitian people for many years .
Around 400 doctors and healthcare experts are offering their services free of charge to the Haitian people .
Our doctors are working every day in 227 of the country ’s 337 communes .
On the other hand , at least 400 young Haitians have trained as doctors in our homeland .
They will now work with the reinforcement brigade which traveled there yesterday to save lives in this critical situation .
Thus , without any special effort being made , up to 1000 doctors and healthcare experts can be mobilised , almost all of whom are already there willing to cooperate with any other state that wishes to save the lives of the Haitian people and rehabilitate the injured .
Another significant number of young Haitians are currently studying medicine in Cuba .
We are also cooperating with the Haitian people in other areas within our reach .
However , there can be no other form of cooperation worthy of being described as such than fighting in the field of ideas and political action in order to put an end to the limitless tragedy suffered by a large number of nations such as Haiti .
The head of our medical brigade reported : " The situation is difficult , but we have already started saving lives . "
He made that statement in a succinct message hours after his arrival yesterday in Port - au - Prince with additional medical reinforcements .
Later that night , he reported that Cuban doctors and ELAM ’s Haitian graduates were being deployed throughout the country .
They had already seen more than 1000 patients in Port - au - Prince , immediately establishing and putting into operation a hospital that had not collapsed and using field hospitals where necessary .
They were preparing to swiftly set up other centers for emergency care .
We feel a wholesome pride for the cooperation that , in these tragic instances , Cuba doctors and young Haitian doctors who trained in Cuba are offering our brothers and sisters in Haiti !

Men may deal with infection differently
Men may have a weaker immune system and could be more vulnerable to so - called ' man flu ' , scientists propose .
Evolutionary factors and hormonal differences may make males more susceptible to infection than females , says a Cambridge University team .
Their theory , outlined in a scientific journal , suggests there is a trade - off between a strong immune system and reproductive success .
But a leading flu expert says there is no difference in men's immunity .
Previous experiments have found differences in the ability of females and males to deal with infection .
Across a range of animal species , males tend to be the ' weaker sex ' in terms of immune defences , says the Cambridge team .
This is usually explained by the difference in hormones .
High testosterone levels , they say , lead to more coughs and colds .
Let 's mate
The study , published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B journal , investigated the reason for these differences .
HAVE YOUR SAY Children get colds , men get flu , women get on with it JohnH
Dr Olivier Restif , one of the authors , said : " If you assume that males are more exposed to infection , then can natural selection influence that process ? "
To find out , scientists developed a mathematical model that highlighted the role of other factors , like ecology and epidemiology , in shaping the immune systems of men and women .
" If males are more exposed to infection than females ( for behavioural reasons for example ) , it is possible to see them evolve lower immuno - competence than females , " the authors wrote .
Risk taking
In particular , they found that men with a predilection to risky , dangerous behaviour who have to compete for access to females would be more open to infections .
But John Oxford , Professor of virology at the University of London , disagrees .
He says his team at the University of London deliberately infected men and women with the flu virus .
He says there was no noticeable difference between their recovery times or their immunity .
" But the women did complain more , " he added .
Every day the European Commission receives alerts from national authorities concerning dangerous products found on their markets .
These alerts are sent through the rapid alert system for dangerous non-food products - " Safety Gate " .
They include information about the type of products found , the risks posed and the measures taken at national level to prevent or restrict their marketing .
Weekly reports of the alerts are available below .
Defense attorneys say an alleged plot to bomb New York synagogues was hatched and directed by a federal informant .
Lawyers for four men from Newburgh have filed a motion to dismiss the terror indictment against them .
They said the informant badgered the defendants until they got involved in the plot .
They said the informant chose the targets , supplied fake bombs for the synagogues and a fake missile to shoot down planes .
The motion said he also offered to pay the defendants , who attorneys alleged were n't inclined toward any crime until the informant began recruiting them .
" The government well knew that their case had been a government - inspired creation from day one and that the defendants had not been independently seeking weapons or targets , " the motion said .
Ffederal court spokesman Herb Hadad said the government would file its response next month .
The four men , who were arrested last May , face up to life in prison if convicted .
They have been previously identified as James Cromitie , 55 , David Williams , 28 , Onta Williams , 32 , and Laguerre Payen , 27 , all of Newburgh in upstate New York , where authorities were conducting raids at their homes , sources said .
Authorities have said they had the plotters under surveillance since June of 2008 and there was " no chance " the alleged scheme could succeed .
They credited the work of a long time informant with keeping tabs on the group .
The FBI has said the Muslim suspects were angry and full of hate for America .
Read the full complaint
According to the criminal complaint , Cromitie said " I hate those f-ing Jewish bastards . "
He bragged that it would be a " piece of cake " to bomb a Jewish Center in Riverdale , according to the complaint .
He said his father lives in Afghanistan and he was upset about U.S. military presence there .
" The fact that this type of hatred exists means that we all have to be vigilant all of the time , " city councilman Jeffrey Dinowitz said Thursday .
Cromitie was the first to approach the informant , authorities said .
He told the informant he has ties to the terrorist group Jaish - e - Mohammad .
Authorities said Cromitie had 27 past arrests and had recently been working at a nation - wide discount retailer , authorities said .
Several of the suspects have previously been arrested on drug charges and may have converted to Islam in prison , authorities said .
The four men allegedly would meet in a safe house in Newburgh , which authorities said they had bugged with audio and video equipment .
The suspects said they wanted to get their hands on stinger missiles to shoot down planes at the nearby Air National Guard Base at Stewart Airport , according to a criminal complaint unsealed late Wednesday .
The suspects also received what they believed were two stinger missiles which they intended to use to shoot down military planes , the complaint said .
They also bought cell phones to allegedly use in the plot .
Officials said they moved in when they did so the alleged plot could not progress any further .
In a separate motion , defense attorneys demanded more information on inducements that the informant may have offered the defendants .
The dismissal motion identified the government 's agent as Shaheed Hussain , a " professional informant " for the FBI .
The defense claimed he was directed to visit suburban mosques , find members with anti-American leanings and recruit them to join a fake terror plot supposedly funded by a Pakistan - based group .
He suggested there could be as much as $ 250,000 available and the government provided him with a BMW , a Hummer and other cars to make him appear well - funded , the defense filings said .
The defense alleged that Hussain tried to incite the defendants by blaming Jews for the world 's evil and telling them that attacks against non-Muslims were endorsed by Islam .
Nevertheless , they said , he failed to motivate the defendants to any action on their own .
Months went by between meetings , and the filings quote Cromitie as saying , " I 'm not gonna hurt anybody " and " The plane thing ... is out of the question . "
Hussain suggested the targets , paid for the defendants ' groceries , bought a gun , provided the fake bombs and missile , assembled the explosive devices and acted as chauffeur , the defense said .
Since the 9/11 attacks , authorities have arrested suspects in a number of alleged plots against area targets , including the Fort Dix New Jersey military base , John F. Kennedy Airport , the Herald Square subway station in Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge .
Some of the more than 83,000 contracts let by the military in that period , obtained from the Department of Finance and Deregulation ’s records , go beyond what members of the public might find acceptable .
Stuff
They include : More than $ 1.4 billion on travel that includes the use of private Learjets , first - class airfares and accommodation in five - star hotels and resorts all over the world .
Original oil paintings and hand - made office furniture , including $ 40,000 on a series of custom - designed Chesterfield leather couches .
Taxpayer - funded membership of exclusive clubs , the use of personal trainers , and subsidised overseas sporting trips .
Almost $ 200 million on marketing - related expenses , which largely focused on trying to recruit and retain more soldiers .
This includes a $ 1.7 million bill over four years to accommodate trainee recruits in hotel rooms in Sydney and Melbourne , and a separate $ 160,000 to fly school - age army cadets to overseas camps including in the United States , Germany and the Cayman Islands .
The Herald has also discovered a number of phantom contracts that have mystified the companies to which they were meant to have been awarded , raising questions about the accounting rigour within the $ 26 - billion - a - year agency .
Taxpayers have funded games of skirmish , horse - riding adventure trips and sailing voyages , and $ 20 million for leadership - oriented consultancies that include executive coaching and team - building workshops .
More than $ 18,000 was paid just to cover what official documents term " incidentals " on a Defence employee rugby trip to Europe , and another $ 25,000 was spent on memberships to exclusive golf clubs in Canberra and Singapore .
The examination reflects the sheer scale of the department 's budget and the extent to which Defence has successfully quarantined its funding from the typical budget pressures applied to other Commonwealth agencies .
This is despite review after review warning that the department 's spending was out of control .
Thirteen years ago , a top - level report recommended urgent reform of the department , identifying up to $ 1 billion a year that could be saved .
The Pappas review , in 2008 , found the agency was wasting $ 1.8 billion a year .
As much as $ 518 million a year could be cut from the Defence budget , it said , in building maintenance , professional services , training , advertising , health and travel .
Last year , the federal government said Defence had to find $ 20 billion worth of efficiencies and savings by 2019 to afford the new technologies needed to defend against threats .
The government 's strategic outlook document warned : " The Defence organisation needs fundamental reform . "
But the Herald 's examination raises new questions about the accountability of a department that has become the single biggest spender of taxpayer dollars .
Over the four years examined , the two biggest beneficiaries of the Defence budget were the US government 's foreign military sales program and Australian Aerospace , a subsidiary of the European Aeronautic , Defence and Space Company .

Combined , these two foreign government contractors received more than $ 5.2 billion , or more than 10 per cent of all contracts published by the department .
A newly discovered ability for people to taste fat could hold the key to reducing obesity , Deakin University health researchers believe .
Deakin researchers Dr Russell Keast and PhD student Jessica Stewart , working with colleagues at the University of Adelaide , CSIRO , and Massey University ( New Zealand ) , have found that humans can detect a sixth taste -- fat .
They also found that people with a high sensitivity to the taste of fat tended to eat less fatty foods and were less likely to be overweight .
The results of their research are published in the latest issue of the British Journal of Nutrition .
" Our findings build on previous research in the United States that used animal models to discover fat taste , " Dr Keast said .
" We know that the human tongue can detect five tastes -- sweet , salt , sour , bitter and umami ( a taste for identifying protein rich foods ) .
Through our study we can conclude that humans have a sixth taste -- fat . "
The research team developed a screening procedure to test the ability of people to taste a range of fatty acids commonly found in foods .
They found that people have a taste threshold for fat and that these thresholds vary from person to person ; some people have a high sensitivity to the taste while others do not .
" Interestingly , we also found that those with a high sensitivity to the taste of fat consumed less fatty foods and had lower BMIs than those with lower sensitivity , " Dr Keast said .
" With fats being easily accessible and commonly consumed in diets today , this suggests that our taste system may become desensitised to the taste of fat over time , leaving some people more susceptible to overeating fatty foods .
" We are now interested in understanding why some people are sensitive and others are not , which we believe will lead to ways of helping people lower their fat intakes and aide development of new low fat foods and diets . "
Let me begin with a plea to tone down this debate on feed - in tariffs .
Jeremy Leggett and I have addressed each other politely and stuck to the facts .
I have no ill feelings towards him ; I simply believe that he is wrong about solar power .
But the level of viciousness displayed on the comment threads , by email and on other sites has to be seen to be believed .
Where does fury of this kind come from ?
In my experience it 's often associated with denial .
People who do n't like the outcomes dismiss the facts and lash out at the bearers of bad news .
Could we , just for once , please try to get past this reaction , and judge the case on its merits ?
My own instincts press me to support solar power .
Like most environmentalists I believe that small is beautiful .
I hate pylon lines and I do n't care for the sight of big power plants of any description , wind farms included .
I detest the big energy firms which provide our electricity .
I am deeply attracted to the idea of being able to produce my own power , just as I love producing my own fruit and vegetables .
But my attempts to find the best means of tackling climate change , which I explain at greater length in my book , Heat , have forced me to put my gut feelings to one side .
Our choices must be based on the best possible information .
Otherwise we waste our lives chasing chimeras .
Against my instincts I have come to oppose solar photovoltaic power ( PV ) in the UK , and the feed - in tariffs designed to encourage it , because the facts show unequivocally that this is a terrible investment .
There are much better ways of spending the rare and precious revenue that the tariffs will extract from our pockets .
If we are to prevent runaway climate change , we have to ensure that we get the biggest available bang for our buck : in other words the greatest cut in greenhouse gas production from the money we spend .
Money spent on ineffective solutions is not just a waste : it 's also a lost opportunity .
Environmentalists have no trouble understanding this argument when lobbying against nuclear power .
Those who maintain that it's more expensive than renewable electricity argue that we should n't waste our money investing in it .
But now I hear the same people telling us that we should support every form of renewable generation , regardless of the cost .
I 'm delighted that Jeremy has accepted my bet that solar PV wo n't reach grid parity in 2013 .
I am also happy for the winnings to go to SolarAid .
I agree with Jeremy that solar PV is an appropriate technology in Africa , where most people are off - grid and there 's much more sunlight .
It 's in this country that it makes no sense .
And I accept Jeremy 's challenge to write a column admitting I 'm wrong if he wins the bet ( but I wo n't accept his subtle slippage , substituting " near " for " at " ) .
If I am wrong , it wo n't be the first time .
In 2005 , before I had crunched the numbers , I called on green NGOs to switch from supporting windfarms to promoting " decentralised microgeneration projects " , which I considered a more attractive option .
After I discovered just how badly this would set back efforts to decarbonise our power supplies , I changed my views .
What would it take to change his ?
Jeremy and I can speculate about how useful solar electricity will be in the UK until we 've worn our keyboards out .
Until our bet closes in 2013 , by which time billions of pounds will have been committed , no one will know which of us is right .
But you do n't have to rely on speculation to see how this is likely to pan out .
As the old cookery programes used to say : " Here 's one we prepared earlier . "
The German experiment , almost identical to the UK's , has now been running for ten years .
An analysis published in November by the Ruhr University ( pdf ) shows just what it has achieved .
When the German programme began in 2000 , it offered index - linked payments of 51 euro cents for every KWh of electricity produced by solar PV .
These were guaranteed for 20 years .
This is similar to the UK 's initial subsidy , of 41 p .
As in the UK , the solar subsidy was , and remains , massively greater than the payments for other forms of renewable technology .
The real net cost of the solar PV installed in Germany between 2000 and 2008 was € 35bn .
The paper estimates a further real cost of € 18bn in 2009 and 2010 : a total of € 53bn in ten years .
These investments make wonderful sense for the lucky householders who could afford to install the panels , as lucrative returns are guaranteed by taxing the rest of Germany 's electricity users .
But what has this astonishing spending achieved ?
By 2008 solar PV was producing a grand total of 0.6 % of Germany 's electricity .
0.6 % for € 35bn .
Hands up all those who think this is a good investment .
After years of these incredible payments , and the innovation and cost reductions they were supposed to stimulate , the paper estimates that saving one tonne of carbon dioxide through solar PV in Germany still costs € 716 .
The International Energy Agency has produced an even higher estimate : € 1000 per tonne .
There are dozens of ways in which you can save carbon for 100th of the cost of solar PV at high latitudes .
The Ruhr University paper comes out against using feed - in tariffs to stimulate wind power as well , but in this case it shows that large - scale wind power in Germany is likely to become cheaper than conventional power by 2022 , at which point subsidies will become redundant .
It makes no such prediction for solar PV .
It reinforces the point I made in my first sally : while Germany , like the UK , belongs to the European emissions trading scheme , any carbon savings made by feed - in tariffs merely allow polluting industries to raise their emissions .
The net saving is zero .
The paper suggests that a far more cost - effective mechanism would be to crank down the emissions cap under the trading scheme – then let renewable technologies fight it out to offer the biggest carbon saving per euro .
As for stimulating innovation , which is the main argument Jeremy makes in their favour , the report shows that Germany 's feed - in tariffs have done just the opposite .
Like the UK's scheme , Germany 's is degressive – it goes down in steps over time .
What this means is that the earlier you adopt the technology , the higher the tariff you receive .
If you waited until 2009 to install your solar panel , you 'll be paid 43c / kWh ( or its inflation - proofed equivalent ) for 20 years , rather than the 51 c you get if you installed in 2000 .
This encourages people to buy existing technology and deploy it right away , rather than to hold out for something better .
In fact , the paper shows the scheme has stimulated massive demand for old , clunky solar cells at the expense of better models beginning to come onto the market .
It argues that a far swifter means of stimulating innovation is for governments to invest in research and development .
But the money has gone in the wrong direction : while Germany has spent some € 53bn on deploying old technologies over ten years , in 2007 the government spent only € 211 m on renewables R&D .
In principle , tens of thousands of jobs have been created in the German PV industry , but this is gross jobs , not net jobs : had the money been used for other purposes , it could have employed far more people .
The paper estimates that the subsidy for every solar PV job in Germany is € 175,000 : in other words the subsidy is far higher than the money the workers are likely to earn .
This is a wildly perverse outcome .
Moreover , most of these people are medium or highly skilled workers , who are in short supply there .
They have simply been drawn out of other industries .
The researchers say that :
" Any result other than a negative net employment balance of the German PV promotion would be surprising .
In contrast , we would expect massive employment effects in export countries such as China . "
Germany 's solar exports ( €0.2bn in 2006 ) have been greatly outweighed by its imports ( €1.44bn in the same year ) .
And it 's not getting any better :
" Recent newspaper articles report that the situation remains dire , with the German solar industry facing unprecedented competition from cheaper Asian imports . "
The UK 's prospects of building the major export industry Jeremy dreams of are even slighter , as it will now have to take on Germany as well as China and Japan .
We 've missed the boat by years .
While I 've been taking plenty of flak for arguing this case , I 've also received a lot of support from green energy experts .
Chris Goodall and David Thorpe , for example , have both come to similar conclusions , by working the case out from first principles .
If you doubt what I say , I urge you to read their analyses , and the astonishing figures they have produced .
I have no horses in this race : I have no products to sell .
I hope that some of you might be able to see that this is an honest attempt to get to the truth of the matter , and to find the most effective means of preventing runaway climate change .

Alex Lifeson reveals
Rush tour , album details in new interview
[ Rush 's Alex Lifeson on doing what he loves ]
UPDATE - 3/27@12:38 AM : ... and there 's this JAM !
Music interview with Neil Peart ( thanks katskahnne ) where he confirms that Nick Raskulinecz has been helping the band on the production side of things once again :
... Rush drummer Neil Peart says the group�s Canadian Songwriting Hall of Fame induction Sunday night in Toronto comes as he is in the midst of writing lyrics for the next Rush studio album .
He says the band is about five songs into the record with co-producer Nick Raskulinecz , from 2007�s Snakes and Arrows , but won�t talk about the sound or how or when the tunes will be released or subsequent tour plans .
� I stopped in Toronto a couple of weeks back and went over to Geddy�s house and listened to what they�ve been working on from my lyrics and it�s very exciting , we�ve got probably five very good songs there , � Peart told QMI Agency .
� So we were saying , � Well , I kind of just want to keep working on this and finish the record . �
But on the other hand we were thinking , � Well , something we haven�t done since the �80s is write new songs and go out and play them . �
It �s interesting to be so deeply involved in songwriting right now with this honour coming up .
It kind of puts a fresh observation on it for me . �
----- snip -----
This coming Sunday , March 28th Rush will be inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame at the Hall 's 6th annual Gala at the George Weston Recital Hall , Toronto Centre for the Arts .
On Tuesday the CBC posted a nearly hour - long video interview with Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson where they discuss the upcoming induction with Laurie Brown .
The two divulged that the band has been writing new material and have 6 new songs written already .
Then yesterday the Canadian Press published an article / interview with Neil Peart regarding his thoughts on the induction and revealed even more information regarding the band 's new material .
Unfortunately neither of these interviews said much regarding the band 's next tour , but a more recent interview with Alex Lifeson published in today 's Toronto Globe and Mail most certainly does .
When asked about the band 's next album Lerxst reiterated his bandmates ' statements and also revealed several details regarding not only the tour , but the next Rush album as well :
...
We were off for a year and a half , and now it 's just pouring .
Everything is totally crazy and there 's not a minute left in the day .
We 've got these half - dozen songs , and we 'll probably go in the studio and work on a couple of them and see how it goes , perhaps release something � and I say perhaps � and then we plan on being on the road in the middle of June .
Ideally , we 'd like to showcase a couple of these songs on the tour , come off tour in mid-October , go back in the studio and continue writing , then record through late this year and early next year , and then release the album in the spring of 2011 on a slightly more substantial tour .
This [ year 's ] tour will probably be about 45 dates .
Most likely summer , 2011 , would be more like 70 .
...
Wow !
There 's a lot to digest here so we 'll take one thing at a time .
His statement that they plan on being on the road in the middle of June confirms all the rumors we 've been hearing that the tour would start in mid-late June .
But Alex adds to that saying it will end mid-October and include around 45 dates which would be similar in scope to the 2008 tour .
But that 's not all folks !
He goes on to say that they'd then probably hit the studio late this year and record a full album to be released in the Spring of 2011 ... then embark on a major , 70 - date tour in 2011 !
My guess is that the 2011 tour would include Europe and possibly South America .
I think this is the almost confirmation we 've been waiting for .
Now all we need are the official dates .
For the sake of completeness , here 's my current list of tentative / rumored tour dates :

The State Department has refused to answer basic questions about an accident that took place in Washington on Wednesday night , in which a U.S. Diplomatic Security Service vehicle struck Daily Caller employee Sean Medlock as he was crossing the street .
An agent in the vehicle , Mike McGuinn , did not identify himself to Medlock at the scene , or apologize for running him down .
Indeed , Washington , D.C. , police drove to a local emergency room to serve Medlock with a jaywalking citation as he lay prostrate in a hospital bed , while a man who identified himself as “ special agent ” stood by watching and taking notes .
Reached on his cell phone the following day by the Daily Caller , McGuinn refused to answer questions about the incident .
“ I ’m a federal agent and I ’m not allowed to talk to the media , ” McGuinn said , citing “ liability . ”
McGuinn initially declined even to reveal which agency he works for .
“ You can refer to the [ DC ] police department report , ” he said before hanging up abruptly .
( According the police department , no report will be publicly available for at least three days . )
According to Medlock , who writes under the name Jim Treacher , he was struck at about 7:15 p.m. on Wednesday , while crossing M Street in downtown Washington .
Medlock says he was walking within the bounds of the crosswalk , toward a blinking white signal , when a government SUV suddenly turned left and plowed into him , knocking him to the ground .
Bystanders tended to Medlock , collected his crushed glasses and called an ambulance .
McGuinn , meanwhile , called The Daily Caller ’s offices from the scene to tell Medlock ’s colleagues about the incident .
But he did not identify himself to them or to Medlock .
Medlock was taken to Georgetown University Hospital with a broken left knee , lacerations and bruises .
He will undergo surgery later this week .
At the hospital , DC police officer John Muniz arrived to issue Medlock a $ 20 jaywalking ticket .
Medlock was lying sedated on a gurney , so Muniz delivered the ticket to a Daily Caller colleague , who was at the hospital with Medlock .
He looked embarrassed as he did so .
Behind him stood a man dressed in a dark suit who identified himself as a “ special agent . ”
He said nothing but wrote in a notebook .
Curiously , the ticket says that Medlock was struck at an intersection four blocks from where the accident actually took place .
And it claims that Medlock was walking diagonally across the intersection at the time .
In one of his strikingly short conversations with the Daily Caller , agent Mike McGuinn acknowledged that Medlock was not jaywalking at all , but walking “ outside the crosswalk when the incident occurred . ”
The question is : Did the federal agent driving the SUV , faced with potential liabilities from the accident , encourage local police to issue some sort – any sort – of citation to Medlock , to establish his culpability ?
If not , what exactly did happen ?
Calls to the State Department were met with evasion and indifference .
Spokeswoman Grace
Moe first asked a Daily Caller reporter where the publication ’s offices were located before taking a message .
A second DSS spokeswoman , Sarah Rosetti , requested that questions be submitted in writing .
When she responded in an e-mail , Rosetti claimed that “ a jogger collided with one of the U.S. Department of State , Diplomatic Security Service ’s official vehicles ” – as if Medlock , who does not jog , had somehow attacked the SUV .
“ At all times , Diplomatic Security acted responsibly and appropriately and displayed due diligence in caring for the injured , ” Rosetti continued .
Rosetti ignored a series of questions about whether McGuinn was on or off duty , who he might have been escorting or protecting , whether McGuinn identified himself to police at the scene of the accident , and whether McGuinn had anything to do with the jaywalking citation .
She said MPD had “ conducted an investigation ” of the incident and referred questions about the investigation to MPD .
MPD provided several answers about the level of detail they would be able to provide .
MPD public affairs said a police report would not be available until early next week at the soonest .
A Daily Caller reporter who visited the Second District station , where Officer Muniz posts , was told there will be no incident report at all filed for a traffic incident .
The Daily Caller will continue to press for answers .
In the meantime here are the questions sent by The Daily Caller to the Diplomatic Security Services public affairs office , followed by the responses .
QUESTIONS :
Was Mr. McGuinn protecting any member of the diplomatic corps when his SUV struck our Mr. Medlock ?
If so , who was he protecting ?
If he was not protecting or escorting anyone , was he on duty or off duty ?
Was Mr. McGuinn driving a state department vehicle ?
Did Mr. McGuinn at any time identify himself to Mr. Medlock or to Metropolitan Police ?
Did he accompany Mr. Medlock to the hospital ?
Did Mr. McGuinn contact MPD to have them write Mr. Medlock a jaywalking ticket that was delivered to Mr. Medlock while he was in the hospital being treated for a broken knee ( which will require surgery ) , lacerations and bruises ?
If so , do you consider that ethical or proper behavior ?
Did a diplomatic security service special agent accompany the MPD officer into the hospital room while Mr. Medlock was being questioned , observe and take notes ?
Was that officer Mr. McGuinn ?
Does Mr. McGuinn contend that Mr. Medlock was jaywalking ?
Did Mr. McGuinn apologize to Mr. Medlock after the incident ?
Does the State Department plan on issuing an apology to Mr. Medlock ?
Will any disciplinary action be taken against Mr. McGuinn ?
Is this the first time he has been involved in a vehicular accident ?
ANSWERS :
At approximately 7:10 PM last night , a jogger collided with one of the U.S. Department of State , Diplomatic Security Service ’s official vehicles .
The jogger was transported by ambulance to Georgetown University Hospital .
Metropolitan Police Department ( MPD ) responded to the scene and conducted an investigation .
Diplomatic Security has since learned that the jogger was cited for Jaywalking .
For further details regarding the investigation , we would refer you to MPD .
At all times , Diplomatic Security acted responsibly and appropriately and displayed due diligence in caring for the injured .
Mike Riggs and Gautham Nagesh contributed to this report .

Several months after a European Union memo discussing the ACTA Internet chapter leaked , the actual chapter itself has now leaked .
First covered by PC World , the new leak fully confirms the earlier reports and mirrors the language found in the EU memo .
This is the chapter that required non-disclosure agreements last fall .
The contents are not particulary surprising given the earlier leaks , but there are three crucial elements : notice - and - takedown , anti-circumvention rules , and ISP liability / three strikes .
Notice - and - Takedown
The notice - and - takedown provision , which is a pre-requisite for intermediary safe harbour from liability , requires :
an online service provider expeditiously removing or disabling access to material or activity , upon receipt of legally sufficient notice of alleged infringement , and in the absence of a legally sufficient response from the relevant subscriber of the online service provider indicating that the notice was the result of a mistake or misidentification .
except that the provisions of ( II ) shall not be applied to the extent that the online service provider is acting solely as a conduit for transmissions through its system or network .
This would represent a change in Canadian law .
Both prior copyright reform bills ( C - 60 and C - 61 ) established notice - and - notice systems , rather than notice - and - takedown .
There is currently an informal agreement to use notice - and - notice , which has proven effective ( the Entertainment Software Association of Canada told the Liberal copyright roundtable earlier this month that 71 % of subscribers who receive a notice do not repost the content within a week ) .
ACTA would trump domestic law and the current Canadian business practice .
Anti-Circumvention
The anti-circumvention provisions are even more problematic as they effectively represent a renegotiation of the WIPO Internet treaties .
The proposed ACTA provision states :
In implementing Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and Article 18 of the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty regarding adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures that are used by authors , performers or producers of phonograms in connection with the exercise of their rights and that restrict unauthorized acts in respect of their works , performances , and phonograms , each Party shall provide civil remedies , as well as criminal penalties in appropriate cases of willful conduct that apply to :
( a ) the unauthorized circumvention of an effective technological measure that controls access to a protected work , performance , or phonogram ; and
( b ) the manufacture , importation , or circulation of a technology , service , device , product , component , or part thereof , that is : marketed or primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing an effective technological measure ; or that has only a limited commercially significant purpose or use other than circumventing an effective technological measure .
Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty ( the anti-circumvention provision ) was intentionally left broad in scope to allow for various implementations .
The treaty merely requires " adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures . "
It does not require access controls nor prohibitions on the manufacture or distribution of devices that can be used to circumvent .
Indeed , when the DMCA was being discussed in the United States , Bruce Lehman , the Under - Secretary of State , acknowledged that the treaties could be implemented without a devices provision .
Moreover , he stated that the DMCA would be used to pressure other countries into following the U.S. example :
When that legislation is in effect , then we will have a template that we can use , that the Trade Representative can use , that we in the Commerce Department can use , the State Department can use , when we are in negotiations with other governments to advise them as to what they need to do to implement their responsibilities in these treaties to provide effective remedies .
ACTA is therefore viewed as a mechanism to win the policy battle lost in Geneva in 1996 .
It would force countries like Canada to adopt the U.S. approach , even though the treaty explicitly envisioned other possibilities .
Three Strikes / Graduated Response
The draft chapter finally puts to rest the question of whether ACTA in its current form would establish a three strikes and you 're out model .
The USTR has recently emphatically stated that it does not establish a mandatory three strikes system .
The draft reveals that this is correct , but the crucial word is mandatory .
The draft U.S. chapter does require intermediaries to play a more aggressive role in policing their networks and the specific model cited is the three - strikes approach .
In other words , the treaty may not specifically require three - strikes , but it clearly encourages it as the model to qualify as a safe harbour from liability .
The specific provision , which is another pre-requisite for intermediary safe harbour from liability , states :
an online service provider adopting and reasonably implementing a policy to address the unauthorized storage or transmission of materials protected by copyright or related rights except that no Party may condition the limitations in subparagraph ( a ) on the online service provider 's monitoring its services or affirmatively seeking facts indicating that infringing activity is occurring ;
And what is an example of a policy provided in ACTA ?
The treaty states :
An example of such a policy is providing for the termination in appropriate circumstances of subscriptions and accounts in the service provider 's system or network of repeat infringers .
This leak shows how deceptive the USTR has been on this issue – on the one hand seeking to assure the public that there is no three - strikes and on the other specifically citing three strikes as its proposed policy model .
Given the past U.S. history with anti-circumvention – which started with general language and now graduates to very specific requirements – there is little doubt that the same dynamic is at play with respect to three strikes .
From a process perspective , leaks coming out of the Mexico ACTA talks revealed that the ISP provisions were discussed , but the anti-circumvention provisions were not .
This suggests that the anti-circumvention provisions from the U.S. are the only proposal currently on the table .
According to a New Zealand official , there may be alternate proposals for the three - strikes model , all of which will presumably be discussed during the next round of negotiations in April in New Zealand .

In this tutorial , we ’ll create inset type , a popular text treatment , using CSS .
If you follow Six Revisions closely , you ’re probably thinking : " Jacob already wrote a Photoshop tutorial on how to do that . "
That is correct , but this time we are going to do it using only CSS .
I set out to recreate the How to Create Inset Typography in Photoshop tutorial , and after experimenting with some fresh and new CSS3 properties , I was able to make a similar type treatment .
We ’ll do all of this in less than ten lines of CSS .
Step 1 : The HTML markup
Let ’s first set up the HTML , which is super simple .
The typography will be an h1 element , wrapped around a div for its background .
< div id =" insetBgd " > < h1 class= " insetType " >
Inset Typography </ h1 > </div >
Step 2 : The background
The first bit of CSS we want to do is the background .
We are going to create it similar to the background in the Photoshop tutorial mentioned above .
We ’ll set the width to 550px and height to 100 px .
Next , we are going to use CSS3 gradients .
If you ’ve never used the required browser extensions for CSS3 , hop on over to my previous article called CSS3 techniques you should know first , to catch up .
We want the background to have a gradient going top to bottom , from # 003471 to # 448CCB .
The code to do this is :
#insetBgd { width : 550 px ; height : 100 px ; background : - moz-linear - gradient ( - 90deg , #003471 , # 448CCB ) ; background : - webkit - gradient ( linear , left top , left bottom , from ( #003471 ) , to (#448CCB ) ) ; }
Step 3 : Define the font stack and styles
Next , we want to define our preferred font .
The Photoshop tutorial used Rockwell STD , but we are going to just use the normal Rockwell .
Neither are considered acceptable web - safe fonts , but more users will have the plain , old Rockwell than the Rockwell STD variant .
However , in case the user does n’t have Rockwell , we ’ll define a few web - safe fonts to render in its place .
In the example , I set the font - size to 50px , and the font color to # 0D4383 .
Here ’s what we have :
h1.insetType { font - family : Rockwell , Georgia , " Times New Roman " , Times , serif ; font - size : 50 px ; color : # 0D4383 ; }
Step 4 : The inset styles
The next and final step is the most important part .
We ’ll style the font and give it the “ inset ” look we ’re trying to achieve .
We ’ll do this by using the text - shadow style .
You ’ll notice Jacob used “ inner shadow ” in Photoshop to get this effect .
Unfortunately for us , text - shadow does n’t have an “ inset ” value .
So what we ’ll have to do is create multiple instances of RGBA black and white 1 px shadows , some being negative pixels , as well as adding different levels of opacity to each .
I messed around with a bunch of different variations , and settled on this :
text - shadow : rgba( 0,0,0,0.5 ) - 1px 0 , rgba( 0,0,0,0.3 ) 0 - 1 px , rgba( 255,255,255,0.5 ) 0 1 px , rgba( 0,0,0,0.3 ) - 1 px - 2 p x ;
Add the text - shadow style to the h1.insetType class above , and our final CSS code looks like the following :
#insetBgd { width : 550 px ; height : 100 px ; background : - moz-linear - gradient ( - 90deg ,#003471,#448CCB ) ; background : - webkit - gradient ( linear , left top , left bottom , from ( #003471 ) , to (#448CCB ) ) ; } h1.insetType { padding - left : 50 px ; /*
The padding is just there to move the h1 element to the center of the div */ padding - top : 17 px ; font - family : Rockwell , Georgia , " Times New Roman " , Times , serif ; font - size : 50 px ; color : # 0D4383 ; text - shadow : rgba( 0,0,0,0.5 ) - 1px 0 , rgba( 0,0,0,0.3 ) 0 - 1 px , rgba( 255,255,255,0.5 ) 0 1 px , rgba( 0,0,0,0.3 ) - 1 px - 2 px ; }
CSS3 Inset Typography Demo :
Below , you ’ll see the final result .
Note that you ’ll only be able to see it if your browser supports current CSS3 specs for the attributes that we used in this tutorial .
Your browser does not support iframes , you will not be able to view this demo .
What It Looks like in Firefox 3.6 ( without Rockwell )
Below is a screen shot of what this effect should look like , taken through a Windows OS machine , Firefox 3.6 and without Rockwell installed .
Conclusion
So there you have it .
Pretty simple , right ?
It may not look quite as good as it would in Photoshop , but it will take up less load time , it ’s more flexible than a static image , and it ’s all done without any special software .
I want to give credit to StylizedWeb for giving me an idea of how to go about doing this .
Thanks for reading !

( CNN ) -- President Obama signed legislation into law Thursday to create the United States ' first national travel promotion program .
" By signing the Travel Promotion Act , President Obama has acted to support the power of travel to serve as an economic stimulant , job generator and diplomatic tool , " said Roger Dow , president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .
The act will create a nonprofit Corporation for Travel Promotion that will promote the United States as a travel destination and explain travel and security policies to international visitors .
The bill received final passage in the Senate last week .
A $ 10 fee charged to visitors from countries included in the Visa Waiver Program will partially fund the public - private organization .
These visitors will pay the fee every two years when they register online using the Department of Homeland Security 's Electronic System for Travel Authorization .
The rest of the funding will come through a matching program of up to $ 100 million in private sector contributions .
If the corporation is able to raise the projected $ 200 million annually , the organization would be the largest national tourism communications program in the world , Dow said .
National tourism organizations in countries including Greece , Australia and Mexico each spent more than $ 100 million on tourism marketing in 2005 , according to the U.N. World Tourism Organization .
The United States spent about $ 6 million the same year -- the last year for which figures are available .
Despite strong global growth in long - haul international travel between 2000 and 2008 , the U.S. welcomed 633,000 fewer overseas visitors in 2008 than it did in 2000 , according to figures from the U.S. Department of Commerce .
Oxford Economics , an economic consulting and forecasting company , estimates a well - executed promotional program would draw 1.6 million new international visitors annually and generate $ 4 billion in new visitor spending .
Some opponents of the legislation said that charging overseas visitors a fee to promote the United States will deter them from visiting .
" We do n't want foreigners to have to jump through so many hoops that they just give up and do n't bother coming to the U.S. , " Steven Lott , a spokesman for the International Air Transport Association , told CNN before final passage of the bill .
The IATA represents airlines around the world .
Lott said improving entry and exit procedures would help U.S. tourism more than a promotional organization .
Dow acknowledged the legislation is not a magic bullet for the industry .
" Let 's not be naive here .
Travel promotion is not a panacea for our international travel issues .
There 's many things we have to continue to work on such as ... continuing to improve our visa process and all the entry processes . "
Dow said he does not think the $ 10 fee will have a negative effect on visitation , particularly when compared with entry and exit fees for other countries that are rolled into airline ticket prices .
The Department of Commerce will soon begin to fill the 11 positions on the corporation 's board with representatives from all corners of the travel industry .
That process is expected to take two to six months , according to the U.S. Travel Association .
At the same time , the Department of Homeland Security will be tasked with establishing the mechanism for collecting the $ 10 fee from visitors who do not have to pay for visas -- a process that could take five to 12 months , the association said .

Say u2018 Yes ’ to Capitalism
by Walter Block by Walter Block Recently by Walter Block : The Economist on Ron Paul and the Fed , aCritique
There are some new kids on the libertarian block .
Their group is called Libertarians Against Capitalism ; see here or here .
They describe themselves as follows :
" We are a group of libertarians who understand that historically the word u2018 capitalism ’ has meant , not the free market , but crony capitalism — that is , collusion between business and State at the expense of consumers / workers .
Thus we refuse to use the word u2018 capitalism ’ to describe what we favor : individual liberty in all respects and free , competitive markets .
We believe that what we have today IS capitalism — and we oppose it . "
Sheldon Richman is listed as the founder , creator and administrator of this group .
Ordinarily , I am a great fan of this libertarian author and leader .
He has inspired me with his eloquence , wit , learning and enthusiasm for liberty on many more than one occasion .
But , in this one instance , I must respectfully part company from him .
I can readily appreciate where Sheldon is coming from in this case .
If U.S. Presidents such as George Bush ( 41st or 43rd ) , Dwight D. Eisenhower , Gerald Ford , Herbert Hoover , Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan are widely considered capitalist supporters , and they are , then I , along with Libertarians Against Capitalism , want no part of this moniker .
( Ronald Reagan magnificently utilized free market rhetoric ; but budgets and regulations increased when he was governor of California and President of the U.S. )
And the same goes for the likes of Vice Presidents Spiro Agnew , Dick Cheney , Dan Quayle and Nelson Rockefeller , along with talk show hosts Glenn Beck , Sean Hannity , Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’Reilly .
I will not say that there is a 180 divergence between what they mean by " capitalism " and how I use this word , but the differences are very stark .
This includes other politicians of the following ilk : John Boehner , Mitt Romney , Newt Gingrich , Rudy Giuliani , Mike Huckabee , John McCain , Mitch McConnell , Tim Pawlenty , Michael Steele , and Fred Thompson .
Their " capitalism " and mine are very , very different .
Nor can we afford to ignore a large group of neoconservatives , who are also linked with " capitalism " in the public mind , for example : Elliott Abrams , John R. Bolton , Dick Cheney , Douglas Feith , Carl Gershman , Christopher Hitchens , David Horowitz , Robert Kagan , Charles Krauthammer , Bill Kristol , Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , Richard Perle , Daniel Pipes , Norman Podhoretz , Condoleezza Rice , Donald Rumsfeld , Stephen Schwartz , Leo Strauss , Ben Wattenberg , Paul Wolfowitz and James Woolsey .
Irving Kristol , the father of neo-conservatism , wrote a book called " Two cheers for capitalism . "
As for me , I want no part of this sort of " capitalism . "
It is three cheers for me , all the way .
And the same goes for conservatives such as Roger Ailes , David Brooks , William F. Buckley , John Derbyshire , David Frum , Robert Gates , Jim Geraghty , Jonah Goldberg , Lawrence Kudlow , Rich Lowry , Jay Nordlinger , Ramesh Ponnuru , Karl Rove , Mark Steyn , John Yoo and Byron York .
If they support capitalism , and they are widely seen to do so , then I , too , along with Libertarians Against Capitalism , oppose it .
For the " capitalism " of these people includes as a central tenet war , militarism and imperialism .
They may call it " American Greatness , " but what it amounts to is the U.S. tossing its military weight all around the world , in a totally unjustified manner .
Also , there are foreign dictators who have been , willy nilly , linked with capitalism , and I would n’t want to be linked , politically , with them either .
For example , Pinochet , Franco , and even , help us please , Hitler .
Reading the above , one might infer that I am as good a candidate as any other libertarian to join Libertarians Against Capitalism .
Not so , not so .
My main reason is not etymological but rather linguistic .
I readily admit that " capitalism " has a bad press , and its historical use is none too salutary either .
But , the enemies of libertarianism are always trying to take words away from us .
They have already long ago stolen “ liberal . ”
We must now call ourselves " classical liberals " if we want to use that appellation at all .
Some have recently had the audacity to try to take away the word “ libertarian . ”
I refer , here , to Noam Chomsky , who has the temerity to characterize himself as a libertarian .
On this attempted theft , see here , here , here , here , here , and here .
( Also see this and this essay on Chomsky , written by real libertarians ; and here is Chomsky on Rothbardian libertarianism ; and here he is on Ron Paul libertarians . )
True , Chomsky does not try to pass as a plain old libertarian .
Rather , he describes himself as a " libertarian socialist . "
But , this creates more problems than it solves .
For most people use the word socialist to depict a nation where the means of production , that is , capital goods , pretty much all of them , are owned by the government .
A situation more removed from the world favored by libertarianism would be hard to imagine .
Every word we use to describe ourselves is precious .
We must keep them all , jettison none of them .
And this includes ( classical ) liberals , free enterprisers , libertarians , Austro - libertarians , anarchists , anarcho - capitalists , laissez faire capitalists , and , yes , plain old unadorned " capitalists . "
Ayn Rand , bless her heart , never failed to rally to the banner of capitalism .
I do not of course agree with everything she ever wrote , but on this matter I am very grateful to her .
There were few wordsmiths in our movement better acquainted with the importance of language .
I say , let us hang on to all the words we can , up to and certainly including “ capitalism . ”
I have written quite a bit about the importance of language in our quest to promote liberty , free enterprise and private property rights ; see here , here , here , here , here , here , here , and here .
I am now happy to add the present column to this list .
So , I beseech Sheldon Richman and the other members of Libertarians Against Capitalism to disband their group , and , instead , work with the rest of us to save as many words as we can for our own use .
At this rate of word loss , we will not be able to articulate our own views , for we can only do so with the use of words , and if they are all taken away from us , we must perforce remain silent in the face on injustice .
( A prime example of this is the use of " Ms. " and " he or she " instead of the traditional " he . "
If we are compelled to use the language of our intellectual enemies , we are to that extent handicapped in verbally promoting liberty . )
I readily understand the group ’s purpose .
It is to distinguish us from ideologues who hold very different philosophies than we do .
Yes , product differentiation is important , if we are to avoid fraud .
However , we need not give up on this valuable characterization .
Instead , let us renounce “ corporate capitalism , ” or “ state capitalism ” or “ monopoly capitalism ” but certainly not “ capitalism ” itself .
Yes , " capitalism " was originally used as a slur against those of us who favor private property rights , free trade and economic liberty .
But , instead of abjuring this word , we should adopt borrow a leaf from homosexuals and blacks .
" Faggot " and " queer " were initially used to deprecate the former .
Instead of running from these words , they proudly adopted them as their own .
A similar situation has taken place with regard to the " N " word , within the black community .
There , it is often used not as an insult , but as a badge of honor .
Should we libertarians be less " in your face " than these groups of people ?
No , say I .
They have thumbed their noses at their detractors , and so should we .
One final point .
If we libertarians " refuse to use the word u2018 capitalism ’ to describe what we favor , " what , then , can we make of the phrase “ laissez faire capitalism ” ?
Based on the interpretation of the Libertarians Against Capitalism , this phrase would have to be considered a logical contradiction , like “ square circle . ”
For , in their view , " capitalism " is a synonym for " crony capitalism . "
But , surely , “ laissez faire capitalism " and " crony capitalism " are polar opposites .
Yes , indeed , what we have nowadays " IS capitalism " ; that is , crony capitalism , not laissez faire capitalism .
In order to progress from the former to the latter , we need all the verbal tools we can lay our hands on .
And , one of them is certainly " capitalism . "

About your class : as a Muslim student , you can consider this an opportunity to learn thoroughly about what evolution teaches so that you can defeat it when you know more about Islamic sciences .
As your teacher instructs you or gives you homework , research what Islam teaches about the same subject .
What a great way to prepare for dawah using this subject , alhamdulillah !
If your teacher is open to a five minute conversation with you , offer another perspective sincerely and politely .
Remember that there is a difference between what Christian fundamentalism teaches about creationism and what we know to be true .
Be confident in the truth but do not waste this chance to understand another side that you can use to your benefit when calling people to Islam , in shaa Allah .

Apple has lawyered up and is out for blood -- or at least , blood money .
Its patent suit against Taiwanese handset maker HTC is further proof that the cold war between Cupertino and Mountain View is quickly escalating into a shooting match with live ammo .
Apple could easily have chosen to sue Palm , whose WebOS functionality closely mimics the iPhone's .
But it 's not worried about Palm -- it 's worried about Google .
And HTC makes most of the cool Android phones , from the G1 to the Nexus One .
[ Apple better watch its back ; InfoWorld Test Center makes the case that Android can beat the iPhone among developers and the businesses that depend on them | Stay up to date on all Robert X. Cringely 's observations with InfoWorld 's Notes from the Underground newsletter . ]
( Several HTC Windows Mobile phones are also implicated in the suit , but really , who cares ?
That 's like Mercedes suing over the Yugo . )
Among the 20 claims submitted to the Federal Court and the International Trade Commission are patents for the seemingly straightforward " Object Oriented Graphic System , " the widely used " Unlocking a Device By Performing Gestures on an Unlock Image " and the brain - twisting " Method for providing automatic and dynamic translation of object oriented programming language - based message passing into operation system message passing using proxy objects . "
Whew .
Interestingly , two of those ( Nos. 1 and 3 ) predate the iPhone by more than a decade .
Apple 's really reaching deep into its patent toy chest here .
I 'm not a trademark attorney ( thank god ) , and I truly believe people who invent groundbreaking technologies should reap the rewards -- but not at the expense of stifling innovation elsewhere .
Even if you created the first device that lets you make things happen when you smear your finger across a touch screen does n't mean that you should be able to prevent other folks from making a better way to smear .
That is the beauty of open source , which Google embraced with Android .
Imagine how the automobile industry would have evolved if , say , Henry Ford managed to patent the steering wheel and the accelerator pedal , while Walter P. Chrysler owned the rights to the stick shift and the rearview mirror .
Every time we climbed behind the wheel -- er , inside the driver seat -- of an unfamiliar car , we'd be starting from scratch .
Of course , there are companies who simply buy up patents on the open market and wait for an opportunity to pounce on somebody with deep pockets .
The fact that the U.S. patent system still keeps trolls alive and well fed ( especially those who line up at the trough in the Eastern District of Texas ) is an ongoing disgrace .
Apple is not a patent troll by any stretch .
It actually makes products people buy , and it filed suit in Delaware , not Texas .
Still , it sends a chill through the air at precisely the time that mobile computing is getting really exciting -- in large part because Apple finally has some serious competition .
And you get the feeling Apple 's lawyers are just getting warmed up .
( Who will Apple sue next ?
Those snarky geeks at eSarcasm have some ideas . )
These suits might serve Apple well in the short term -- and cause angina for HTC , Google , Palm , and anyone else who gets locked into the Cupertino cross -hairs .
But it wo n't serve consumers well .
Litigation is expensive ( guess who 'll be paying for it ? ) and handset makers may grow timid about pushing the envelope on new features .
Imagine buying your next phone in two years , only it does less than the one you have now .
Who wins then ?
If these moves ultimately slow down the adoption of smartphones , even Apple will feel the pain .
Should Apple sue to protect its patents ( even though we all know they 're just doing it to get back at Google ) ?

There are bonkers theories about a new American Civil War : there are predictions of it , even computer games based on it - and then there is reality .
But reality in America is looking a little bit different than it did before the passage of the Obama healthcare bill .
Public discourse has reached " mad as hell and not going to take it anymore " levels and , watching it all from the outside , I am wondering where it all ends up .
There has been an outbreak of vandalism - bricks through politicians ' windows ; there have been threats of violence and a lot of violent language .
Democrats , in response have begun to accuse mainstream Republican commentators of stoking up the violence , and in turn they have accused the Democrats of trying to provoke a violent reaction .
All this has made me consider in a new light something said by an oil - man who consults for one of the biggest companies in the world .
Last summer he told me :
" We run a mainframe computer simulation of the global political and economic situation , modelling various outcomes of the resource crunch that begins in the back half of the 2010s .
And no matter which way we tweak it , it always comes out with the same result : civil war in America in 25 years 's time . "
For obvious reasons , given that the said company is a global player , they were not very interested in publicising the scenario .
In this oil company scenario the driver is not ideology but simply resources .
As explained to me , the question becomes whether the world 's biggest consumer of petroleum based products can move away from oil dependency fast enough ; and in the scenario the answer is no because its political institutions are too consensual .
That is , even where you get politicians who are prepared to act decisively , there are so many checks and balances - state - level opt-outs , Supreme Court , Congressional filibuster , corporate - controlled media etc - that they can never implement the most painful decisions .
And as a result the political system fragments once the oil gets scarce .
I am always wary of " ACW 2.0 " scenarios because they are a recurrent fantasy for people who do n't like the USA .
Russian professor Igor Panarin , for example , predicted two years ago that the USA would begin to fall apart this year and that the dollar 's role as a world currency would end last year .
As summarised by the Wall Street Journal Panarin predicts :
" Economic , financial and demographic trends will provoke a political and social crisis in the U.S.
When the going gets tough .. wealthier states will withhold funds from the federal government and effectively secede from the union .
Social unrest up to and including a civil war will follow .
The U.S. will then split along ethnic lines , and foreign powers will move in . "
( Panarin is a Dean at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Diplomatic Academy . )
Now let 's look at current reality .
In the aftermath of President Obama 's healthcare bill there are three separate strands of conservative opposition brewing .
The most important is the revived Palin / McCain bandwagon that has hit Nevada this week and will move countrywide until mid-April .
This is an attempt to ride the wave of the Tax Teaparty movment and turn it into an electoral rout for the Democrats in November 's midterm elections .
What liberal commentators have taken offense to is the use of gun language and symbolism , with Sarah Palin 's website indicating " target " Democrats using rifle sights superimposed on a map of America .
The next strand is the Teaparty movement itself .
Though the movement is massive , peaceful and encompassing large numbers of grassroots Republicans , some demonstrators in Washington hurled racial and homophobic abuse and threats at Democratic Congressmen ; and some placards carried the implicit threat of violence .
This was then condoned and stoked up by some right wing radio show hosts .
Then there is the actual violence .
Democrat Party office windows were broken in several states .
Ten Democrat lawmakers have been offered police protection .
This op - ed from the Washington Post contains a summary of the vandalism and the liberal response .
In this context Glenn Beck 's on - screen post - mortem for the anti-healthcare bill campaign is worth watching .
The tone is more in sorrow than in anger but contains the following commentary on the liberal media 's response to the verbal abuse on Capitol Hill :
" Why are the Tea Parties always being labeled as terrorist ?
Why is it ?
" They 're extremists , they 're terrorists , they 're hatemongers , they 're dangerous ! "
What is it that these evolutionaries want ?
You 'd pick up a gun ?
You ever thought of that ?
These people have .
Because possibly , maybe the question should be asked : Maybe they 're tired of evolution , and they are waiting for revolution . "
At the end of the broadcast Beck calls for a return to rational discourse .
But those like former Bush aide David Frum who have urged the movement to moderate its language in order to give elected representatives room for manouver have themselves been given short shrift .
What seems to me problematic is that the whole 24 - hour furyfest is being conducted with almost no overt reference to America 's history of political breakdown in the 1850s .
Here 's why it 's worth bearing in mind .
James McPherson's The Battle Cry of Freedom , Allan Nevins ' 8 - volume Ordeal of the Union and Shelby Foote 's trilogy The Civil War : A Narrative all remind us that the actual American Civil war was preceded by a long and complex political breakdown process accompanied by demographic change and economic modernisation .
It was not just " about slavery " .
It was about the emergence of a new political model of industrial capitalism in the northeast and Midwest and the rise of a political party that represented the new system , and had no support whatseoever in the slave - owning south .
That , at the time , was the Republican Party .
As matters degenerated you saw the habitually rowdy electoral process give rise to more systematic violent acts , from the outbreak of political violence in Kansas , to John Brown 's guerilla raid on Harper 's Ferry , to the maiming of anti-slavery Senator Charles Sumner by pro-slavery Representative Preston Brooks on the floor of the Senate .
Allan Nevins argued that by the late 1850s America contained " two peoples " : culturally , socially and ethnically different ( black slavery in the south plus 9/10ths of European immigrants headed for the North ) .
McPherson explained that , to the white slave - ocracy and its plebeian supporters , the rise of industrial capitalism and its liberal values did look like a revolution :
" When secessionists protested in 1861 that they were acting to preserve traditional rights and values , they were correct .
They fought to preserve their constitutional liberties against the perceived Northern threat to overthrow them .
The South 's concept of republicanism had not changed in three - quarters of a century ; the North 's had ....
The ascension to power of the Republican Party , with its ideology of competitive , egalitarian free - labor capitalism , was a signal to the South that the Northern majority had turned irrevocably towards this frightening , revolutionary future . "
I want to make clear : it would be totally wrong to extrapolate from all this any direct parallel with today 's situation in the USA .
But in the light of my oil - man 's scenario there are pertinent questions worth asking .
The Obama presidency seems determined to confront a number of strategic challenges to the USA : having 32 million people with no access to healthcare was the first .
Having 11 million undocumented migrants could be the next .
But Obama 's project for America seems to have frightened large demographic slice of the population which did not vote for it .
In that sense alone there is a parallel with the economic modernization context of the 1850s .
If America is faced with huge , painful choices contingent on the outbreak of global resource rivalry in the next 20 years you would not ideally want to go into such a period with politics so polarized along ethnic , demographic , social and cultural lines .
Yet , in less than a generation US politics have become polarized in a way the mainstream media and academia are still struggling to understand .
It is worth remembering two things facilitated the run-up to civil war in 1861 .
First , the breakdown of the party system .
The Democrats split along pro-and anti-slavery lines and a plethora of small parties emerged .
Second the emergence of mass political engagement , with huge rallies , a viscerally agitated press on both sides .
Again , without over - egging the parallels , you have mass engagement bigtime now , with high - turnout elections ever since the ideological divide opened up , and a raging blogosphere .
And you have the possibility of a strategic split in the Republican Party along social and cultural lines , though at present the Palin strategy seems to be to conquer the GOP for the Teaparty movement rather than to split from it .
Where does it all end ?
The answer will be determined by whether America 's constitution and two - party system can contain the new viscerality of its political life .
There is a strong chance that it can .
Above all because America is the global superpower and has a very strong Federal state machine .
If it does , the outcome may be a long pattern of ideological presidencies , Clinton , Bush , Obama and then maybe Palin ; swings to the left and right contained by the ability of states to opt out of stuff they do n't like and by Supreme Court rulings , impeachments , lame - duck Presidencies etc .
It 's not hard to imagine because it's what has characterized the period since the mid 1990s .
Liberal metropolitian types would go on living their lifestyle and suburban religious fundamentalists likewise , without coming to any more blows than verbal .
But the fact remains the USA is a country with an unsustainable budget deficit , a role in the world that is being challenged by China ; and it is addicted , economically , to a substance that is going to be in contested supply within our lifetimes .
Its political institutions are going to come under strain as a result and the 1850s are a reminder that once politics slides into viciousness , over fundamental strategic questions , it 's hard to pull back .
DETROIT -- Brian Rafalski and Ryan Miller were teammates two weeks ago , leading the U.S. to the silver medal at the Olympics , one named the tournament ’s best defenseman , the other selected the event ’s best player overall .
They were on opposing sides Saturday night , and Rafalski got the best of Miller , scoring 31 seconds into overtime , on the power play , to lead the Detroit Red Wings to a 3 - 2 victory against the Buffalo Sabres at Joe Louis Arena .
Rafalski , on a pass from Nicklas Lidstrom , blasted a one - timer from the top of the faceoff circle past Miller , enabling the Red Wings to move one point ahead of the idle Calgary Flames into the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference .
“ We were able to move it around and they were leaving me open , ” Rafalski said .
“ The first time they stepped up on me and the next time I saw the defenseman go right to ( Dan ) Cleary as he was going to the front of the net , so I knew I ’d have a good chance to get a shot through . ”
The Red Wings got a huge break with 1:13 remaining in the third period when defenseman Tyler Myers , perhaps the leading candidate to win the Calder Trophy as the NHL ’s top rookie , made a rookie mistake by flipping the puck over the glass from his own zone .
He was penalized for delay of game and the power play carried over into overtime .
Detroit has scored at least one power - play goal in nine consecutive games , 12 in a row at home .
Pavel Datsyuk and Patrick Eaves scored goals 1:13 apart early in the first period .
But Jochen Hecht scored twice for Buffalo to force the OT .
In addition to facing his Olympic teammate , Miller also played against his brother , Drew , for just the third time in the NHL careers .
Drew finished with four shots but was kept off the score sheet .
Ryan finished with 34 saves .
“ He played well , made some good saves for them , ” Drew Miller said .
“ The first two games I
played against him I really did n’t have too many good chances .
Tonight I have a couple of chances . ”
The Red Wings scored on their second and third shots of the game .
Datsyuk notched his 21st goal at 2:02 , firing the puck past Miller from a sharp angle after corralling a rebound off the back boards .
Eaves scored his 10th goal at 3:15 .
He made a move around defenseman Craig Rivet and floated a soft backhand shot over Miller ’s right shoulder .
Miller got burned trying to make a poke - check .
Drew Miller knew his brother would bounce back strong .
“ I ’ve seen him do it before , ” Drew Miller said .
“ On Pav ’s goal , he ’s not used to the boards or maybe forgot how ( lively ) the boards are here .
It ’s tough .
Patty ’s goal just goes stick - to - stick and goes over him .
Great effort by Patty .
“ Two goals quick on him .
I knew he ’d regroup and come back strong and make some big saves for his team .
He played well , but our guys kept going and going , put shots on him and got in front of him .
That was our game plan and we came through . ”
Hecht scored his second goal of the game at 5:30 of the second period to tie it 2 - 2 .
Jason Pominville corralled the rebound of a shot by Tim Connolly and left the puck for Hecht , who fired in a wrist shot while the Red Wings were scrambling around in their own zone .
The Sabres had cut the deficit to 2 - 1 on Hecht ’s first goal at 7:02 .
He slipped behind the defense and knocked in the rebound of a shot by Pominville past Jimmy Howard .
Aside from the first five minutes of the second period , Red Wings coach Mike Babcock was pleased with his team ’s performance .
“ We ’ve won five of seven now and done a pretty good job , ” Babcock said .
“ We just got to continue to find a way to get better .
We had good tempo in our game early , we had all our lines going .
It was a good night for us . ”
The Red Wings start a three - game Western Canada road trip Monday in Calgary .
“ It ’s good we ’ve played back - to - back 60 - mintue games , but it means nothing if we do n’t do it on Monday , ” Rafalski said .
“ Our focus is our next game .
We ca n’t standings watch .
We have to go out and play the best we can every night . ”
Opposition deepens to austerity programme in Greece
By Robert Stevens
11 March 2010
Opposition to the austerity measures being imposed by the Greek government has hardened in the run-up to today ’s general strike .
In the last week refuse workers , tax officials , school , hospital and transport workers have taken strike action .
Demonstrations have been held on a daily basis , with a number of government buildings occupied or blockaded by angry protesters .
The strikes and protests are in response to the latest austerity programme passed March 5 by the government headed by Prime Minister George Papandreou of the social democratic PASOK .
It has pledged to slash Greece ’s budget deficit from the current 12.7 percent of GDP to 8.7 percent in 2010 , under a European Union - endorsed plan .
The new austerity programme includes tax increases and spending cuts totalling € 4.8 billion ( $ 6.5 billion ) .
The cuts are the equivalent of 2 percent of Greece ’s GDP .
Its provisions include a sales tax increase from 19 percent to 21 percent ; higher excise taxes on petrol , cigarettes and alcohol ; a 10 percent cut in public sector pay ; a 30 percent cut in “ 13th and 14th month ” public sector salary schemes ; and a freeze on public sector pensions .
The latest cuts , the third in as many months , are far deeper than those announced previously .
They will have a devastating impact on millions of working people , the unemployed and pensioners in a country where a quarter of the population are already subsisting at minimum wage levels .
Cuts will have a severe impact on the wages and conditions of hundreds of thousands of workers employed in the public sector .
About half a million workers are in the civil service and a further 300,000 are employed elsewhere in the public sector .
As the measures were passed in an emergency bill , 7,000 protested in Athens with riot police attacking demonstrators in front of the parliament .
The police used tear gas and brutally beat protesters , with 12 people arrested .
Among those attacked was Manolis Glezos , an 87 - year - old former Greek parliament member who is now a member of the Coalition of the Radical Left ( Syriza ) .
Glezos , who was active in the Greek resistance movement against Nazi occupation , was manhandled and had teargas sprayed in his face .
He was taken to hospital with respiratory problems .
Riot police were also mobilised to quell protests in the northern city of Thessaloniki , the second largest in Greece .
In a sign of the developing social tensions , Yiannis Panagopoulos , the president of the General Confederation of Workers of Greece ( GSEE ) , the private sector workers trade union federation , was heckled , booed and then physically attacked by a number of protesters as he began to address the Athens demonstration .
The GSEE is widely hated because it is the closest trade union body to the PASOK government and has previously refused to support strikes by public sector workers .
The largest political faction in the GSEE is PASK , the trade union wing of PASOK .
The GSEE is not opposed to the austerity measures in principle and at the last general strike on February 24 Panagopoulos called for “ a fair distribution of the burden ” of deficit reduction policies .
Workers in a number of sectors also staged wildcat strikes in the capital that closed schools and hospitals on March 5 .
Much of the nation ’s public transport network was brought to a halt by a 24 - hour strike .
Refuse workers in Athens have extended their strike by two days so that it coincides with today ’s general strike , resulting in a build - up of piles of rubbish in the capital and the closure of landfills there and in other cities .
On Monday tax collectors began a two - day strike , while court employees are holding a series of two - hour strikes each day this week .
Local government officials held a four - hour strike on Wednesday .
Since March 1 , demonstrators , including unemployed workers , have attempted to block access to the Labour Ministry and the General Accounting Office in Athens .
On March 1 several hundred protesters attempted to disrupt a meeting between European Union Economy Commissioner Olli Rehn and Labour Minister Andreas Loverdos .
The agenda of the meeting was to discuss the necessity for immediate further austerity measures .
Another protest has taken place at the government printing office .
Last Friday several dozen interior ministry workers began a sit - in at the office .
After taking over the building the workers unfurled a banner in front of the building reading , “ Occupation ” and “ Enough is Enough . ”
The actions are indicative of a deepening hostility among the Greek population to the intolerable attacks being carried out by PASOK , at the behest of the European Union and the financial institutions .
Several opinion polls show a significant and sharp increase in the numbers opposing the austerity measures .
A poll conducted for the Proto Thema newspaper found that 86.2 percent of Greek people viewed the austerity measures as “ unfair . ”
A poll by Public Issue for Skai Television found that 62 percent of respondents believed that social unrest was “ highly likely in the next 12 months . ”
Previous polls , reflecting a barrage of media coverage hailing the cuts as necessary and unavoidable , had indicated that between 60 and 70 percent of those questions supported drastic economic measures that would revive the economy .
Yanis Varoufakis , professor of economics at the University of Athens , said , “ Now people respond to announcements .
When they become measures , and they feel them in their pocket ... you will have far more serious demonstrations .
They will not be as civilized as they are now . ”
Both the trade unions federations who have called today ’s general strike are acutely aware of the dangers posed by a mass movement against PASOK , uniting all sections of the working class and young people .
Prior to today ’s strike Ilias Iliopoulos , the general secretary of the ADEDY public sector federation , said bluntly , “ I am afraid there will be a social explosion .
People will start going hungry soon . ”
The trade unions federations have called the general strike on the basis of seeking to contain this growing working class resistance and to buy time to ensure that a deal can be made with the government , enabling the attacks to be implemented .
To this end the unions are portraying PASOK as the victim of international finance and the EU bureaucracy , rather than the representative of Greek capital , and are attempting to channel popular opposition in a nationalist direction .
Speaking ahead of the latest general strike , Yannis Grivas , president of the tax collectors ’ union , summed up the attitude of the trade union bureaucracy when he said , “ It is just a symbolic protest .
We understand that the austerity measures are necessary .
One of the few iconic tales of Canadian politics revolves around how Paul Martin , as Liberal finance minister in the 1990s , wrestled the deficit to the ground with his bare hands .
While there 's some truth to it , the legend sidesteps an important question : was Martin 's ruthless " hell - or - high - water " deficit - slashing really the only thing that would have worked ?
Could a defter touch have solved the deficit problem without laying waste to much of our social infrastructure in the process ?
All this is worth raising now that we 've entered into another era of deficit hysteria , with governments and the business community making deficit elimination their top priority and shunting aside almost every other goal .
In that spirit , Finance Minister Jim Flaherty brought down an austerity budget last week that slashed $ 17.6 billion in planned government spending , and he promised to cut more deeply if necessary .
But while balanced books are an important goal , blindly worshipping them is awfully short - sighted .
A family that celebrates having its finances balanced , while several of its children lie unfed on the living room floor and the roof is about to collapse , is clearly suffering from a warped sense of priorities .
Back in the 1990s , leading economists Pierre Fortin and Lars Osberg , both past presidents of the Canadian Economics Association , argued that the long - term consequences of Martin 's spending cuts would be devastating , and that the economy could have grown its way out of the deficit problem instead , with a little more time .
But Martin , with the enthusiastic backing of the business community , insisted on plowing ahead aggressively with deep spending cuts .
Just like today , tax increases were ruled out , even though they would have been more equitable , requiring the well - to - do to share in the pain .
In the U.S. , for instance , the Clinton administration dealt with its deficit problems in part by raising taxes significantly on those at the upper end .
While the rich squawked , they ended up paying the higher taxes , and Clinton left office boasting of surpluses .
Martin 's decision to rely almost exclusively on spending cuts put the burden of Canada 's deficit reduction squarely on those with lower incomes , notes Andrew Jackson , an economist with the Canadian Labour Congress .
" This was a significant factor behind the pronounced increase in Canadian income inequality over the 1990s . "
Of course , a deficit - reduction scenario like Martin 's fits nicely with the aims of Harper 's Conservatives , who are committed to reducing the size of government , and have no hesitation about favouring those at the upper end .
For the past several years , burdened by large surpluses , it 's been hard for the Harperites to justify spending cuts .
All that surplus cash made it awkward to take food away from the hungry kids on the living room floor .
Now that mayhem on Wall Street has plunged our economy into deep recession and left us mired in deficits , the coast is clear .
But a further assault on our social infrastructure is n't necessary .
As Clinton showed , there 's lots of room for tax increases at the top -- and even more room today than in the 1990s , with the significant rise in the incomes of the elite over the past decade .
In January , a statewide plebiscite in Oregon gave voters a choice between reducing the state deficit through spending cuts or through a tax increase on those earning more than $ 250,000 a year and higher corporate taxes .
They chose the tax increases -- just as the Canadian public might , if it were ever given the chance .

He ’s set to give the demand and end the scene .
The following QT movie represents the entire scene from Pinocchio .
Fresh evidence implicating the Church of Scientology in the mistreatment and exploitation of some of its most loyal adherents will be aired on Four Corners tonight .
The allegations come just days before an expected Senate vote on whether to launch a Parliamentary inquiry into the church .
Tonight 's program , Scientology : The Ex - Files , focuses on the stories of Australians and Americans who have left the church and are now speaking out .
Some are taking legal action against the church .
The men and women featured in the program belonged to Scientology 's elite unit of full - time staffers , the Sea Organisation - or Sea Org .
The allegations in tonight 's program include first hand accounts that some women have been coerced into having abortions because the Sea Org does not allow its members to have children while they work in the organisation ; that children as young as 15 are interrogated about their sex lives , asked to work excessive hours , and punished severely if they fail to meet targets for recruiting members of the public ; and that ' public ' Scientologists - Scientologists who live and work in the broader community - are pressured over long periods of time into donating their life savings to the church .
The church itself denies the allegations , and is vigorously defending the legal actions which are underway in the United States .
As a religion , the Church of Scientology is tax - exempt in Australia and the United States .
In other countries - for example , the United Kingdom - it does not have charitable status .
The UK Charity Commission has determined that the Church of Scientology was not established for the public benefit .
Over the past year , the Church has opened a number of new churches around the world , largely it is believed , funded by tax - free donations from ordinary parishioners .
Tonight 's program features an exclusive interview with a former rugby league player , Joe Reaiche , who played for Eastern Suburbs and Canterbury Bankstown in the 1970's .
Mr Reaiche , who now lives in America , was declared a " suppressive person " and expelled from the church in 2005 .
He has not seen his children - who work in Hollywood and who remain public Scientologists - since then , and says he believes that they were warned not to contact him after he was declared a " suppressive person " .
Mr Reaiche told reporter Quentin McDermott : " You do n't do that to a parent . "
Church of Scientology spokesman , Tommy Davis , denies that the church has a policy of disconnection .
He says that members of the Church are free to maintain contact with relatives who have been expelled , but acknowledges that they would not then be welcome in the Church .
Mr Davis told Four Corners : " If somebody is expelled from the church , anybody who insists on continuing to be connected to somebody who 's been expelled from the church would be told that as long as they maintain that connection they 're not welcome in the church . "
Tonight 's program features interviews with three members of the Anderson family from Canberra .
Liz Anderson , who left the church last year , has not seen her eldest daughter Fiona since 2005 , when Fiona was posted overseas by the Sea Org in Sydney to join the Sea Org at its base in Clearwater , Florida .
Mr and Mrs Anderson arranged for their youngest daughter Jordan to leave the church last year .
Both Jordan and her older sister Fiona joined the Sea Organisation aged 14 .
Jordan tells Four Corners that she was asked to work excessive hours for minimal pay - and once worked 72 hours straight without sleep .
The church 's senior spokesman , Tommy Davis tells Four Corners that if that were the case , it would be " utterly and completely unacceptable " .
Tonight 's program also highlights the issue of alleged " coerced " abortions within the church .
Two former members of the church in America describe in detail how they were pressured to have abortions when they fell pregnant to their husbands within the Sea Organisation .
Both women say that they wanted to give birth to the children , but were told not to do so .
Mr Davis tells Four Corners : " Sea Org members do not have children .
If someone is a member of the Sea Organisation and they wish to have a child , they would need to do so outside of the Sea Org , " but he denies that the church has any policy of coercing women into having abortions .
However , one of the women reporter Quentin McDermott interviewed has composed a list of 40 other women who - she says - say that they too were " coerced " into having abortions in America .
Tonight 's Four Corners presents evidence that women inside the Sea Org in Australia have also been put under pressure to have abortions when they fall pregnant .
This week Independent Senator Nick Xenophon is expected to move that an inquiry take place into " the abuses against Australians that have taken place within the organisation of Scientology " .
Senator Xenophon told the Senate last November : " Scientology is not a religious organisation .
It is a criminal organisation that hides behind its so - called religious beliefs . "
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd commented at the time : " Many people in Australia have real concerns about Scientology .
I share some of those concerns . "
It ’s official .
I love Netflix all over again .
I finally decided ( again ) that instant gratification when it comes to movies and Blockbuster is way overrated and closed my Blockbuster account .
Again .
But I was n’t too pleased when I saw the following alert as soon as I logged back into my Netflix account .
So of course I called them and was connected to a live rep within seconds .
To make a short story shorter – there were no unneccessary questions , account was activated within minutes , I was given 25 % off on next month ’s charges as a ( I ’m guessing ) reward for returning and the following single - question customer service survey was in my Inbox right away .
In my book , Netflix gets 5 stars for customer service for the following reasons :
Placing the account alert where no one ( not even I ) could miss it .
No long queues when I called them .
Rewarding the return of the prodigal daughter with a 25 % discount .
Sending me a simple customer service survey that literally took a second to complete .
Although , I am curious to see what their next step would be if I ’d clicked the “ I am unsatisfied … ” link .
Maybe next time .
And I have n’t even talked about the convenience of streaming Netflix movies from your Netflix ready device such as a TiVo , Wii or PS3 !

An edition of Kenneth Grahame 's The Wind in the Willows , dedicated to the daughter of Sir Arthur Quiller - Couch , who was thought to have been the model for the character of Ratty , sold for 10 times more than expected
A first edition of Kenneth Grahame 's children 's classic , The Wind in the Willows , belonging to the daughter of the man thought to have inspired the character of Ratty , has been sold for £ 32,400 — a sum 10 times higher than anticipated .
The book , which was sold by Bonhams at auction in London yesterday , is inscribed " To Foy Felicia Quiller Couch from her affectionate friend Kenneth Grahame , Oct. 1908 " .
Quiller - Couch was the daughter of the Cornish author Sir Arthur Quiller - Couch , a friend of Grahame 's who often had the author to stay at his house , The Haven at Fowey .
Like Ratty , Quiller - Couch enjoyed boating , and is thought to have been Grahame 's model for the character of the talkative Water Rat , who tells his friend the Mole that " there is nothing — absolutely nothing — half so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats " .
Grahame began
The Wind in the Willows as a bedtime story for his son Alistair , continuing it in letters written to him while staying at Fowey .
The arrogant but lovable character of Mr Toad is said to have been partially inspired by Alistair , an adventurous boy who would escape from home when young and lie in the road waiting to be run over by a car .
" We can see in this possibly the source of Toad 's fascination with motor cars , " writes David Stuart Davies in an afterword to the Collector 's Library edition of the novel .
" ' The real way to travel ! ' " cries Toad .
" ' Here today — in next week tomorrow !
Villages skipped , towns and cities jumped — always somebody else 's horizon !
Oh bliss !
Oh poop - poop !
Oh my !
Oh my ! ' "
By Christmas 1907 the book was finished , and Grahame sent it to publishers in the UK and the US who both turned it down .
Methuen eventually agreed to publish the book but paid Grahame ( who worked in banking ) no advance , and the book was met initially with critical disdain .
One very literal review , in TP's Weekly , said it would " win no credence from the best authorities on biology " ; writing for The Bookman , Arthur Ransome called it " a failure , like a speech to Hottentots made in Chinese " .
Its staunchest advocate was , however , an important one .
Theodore Roosevelt , then US president , wrote to Grahame in 1909 to tell him that he had " read it and reread it , and have come to accept the characters as old friends " .
Roosevelt eventually persuaded US publisher Scribner to take it on .
Another fan was AA Milne , who adapted it into the play Toad of Toad Hall , and wrote in an introduction to an edition of the novel that " one does not argue about The Wind in the Willows " .
" The young man gives it to the girl with whom he is in love , and if she does not like it , asks her to return his letters .
The older man tries it on his nephew , and alters his will accordingly , " said Milne .
" The book is a test of character . "
• This article was amended on 25 March 2010 .
In the original it said that The Wind in the Willows was finished in 2007 .
This has been corrected .
" To oppose expanded coverage in the name of restricting abortion gets things exactly backward , " writes T.R. Reid .
" It 's like saying you wo n't fix the broken furnace in a schoolhouse because you 're against pneumonia . "
Here 's his argument :
The latest United Nations comparative statistics , available at http://data.un.org, demonstrate the point clearly .
The U.N. data measure the number of abortions for women ages 15 to 44 .
They show that Canada , for example , has 15.2 abortions per 1,000 women ; Denmark , 14.3 ; Germany , 7.8 ; Japan , 12.3 ; Britain , 17.0 ; and the United States , 20.8 .
When it comes to abortion rates in the developed world , we 're No. 1 .
No one could argue that Germans , Japanese , Brits or Canadians have more respect for life or deeper religious convictions than Americans do .
So why do they have fewer abortions ?
One key reason seems to be that all those countries provide health care for everybody at a reasonable cost .
That has a profound effect on women contemplating what to do about an unwanted pregnancy .
The connection was explained to me by a wise and holy man , Cardinal Basil Hume .
He was the senior Roman Catholic prelate of England and Wales when I lived in London ; as a reporter and a Catholic , I got to know him .
In Britain , only 8 percent of the population is Catholic ( compared with 25 percent in the United States ) .
Abortion there is legal .
Abortion is free .
And yet British women have fewer abortions than Americans do .
I asked Cardinal Hume why that is .
The cardinal said that there were several reasons but that one important explanation was Britain 's universal health - care system .
" If that frightened , unemployed 19 - year - old knows that she and her child will have access to medical care whenever it 's needed , " Hume explained , " she 's more likely to carry the baby to term .
Is n't it obvious ? "
A young woman I knew in Britain added another explanation .
" If you 're [ sexually ] active , " she said , " the way to avoid abortion is to avoid pregnancy .
Most of us do that with an IUD or a diaphragm .
It means going to the doctor .
But that 's easy here , because anybody can go to the doctor free . "
One day , we knew , biotech would become so easy and so cheap that two guys in a garage could hack life in the way kids hack code .
That day is now here .
Exhibit A is this biohacking lab in a garage in Silicon Valley .
Assembled from used equipment the kit includes two clean cell - culture hoods , an incubator , two robot sequencers , and lots of software packed into a suburban garage .
The guys are screening antic - cancer compounds .
Not that everyone thought a do - it - yourself biotech lab was inevitable .
Many folks in the biotech industry have repeatedly explained why biotech is different , how it is far more complex than digital stuff , requiring far more education to master , how the subject is far more delicate requiring far more precision in experiments , and the equipment thus far more expensive than anything computers use , meaning overall that garage biotech hackers were very unlikely .
“ You need a PhD and a clean room ” they would say .
Maybe you do , but Rob Carlson , who has been tracking biotech for decades , recently photographed the above pictures of the DIY biotech .
He also pointed to the example of maker - types constructing DIY clean rooms , such as this one made from industrial shelving and off - the - shelf filters .
As Carlson explains :
I continue to get push back from people who assert that “ it is really too hard ” to hack biology in a garage , or too expensive , or that garage labs just ca n’t be up to snuff .
This sort of dissent usually comes out of National Labs , Ivy League professors , or denizens of the beltway .
All I can say to this is — Doodz , you need to get out more .
The people who built the lab pictured above are pursuing a project that is technically well beyond anything discussed on the DIYBio list , and while they may be watching the DIYBio conversation they do n’t advertise what they are up to .
It would be better for all of us if we could rest assured that conversations about this sort of work could proceed in the open without guys showing up in biohazard suits with weapons drawn — Youtube , at the 00:00:48 mark .
There continues to be a prominent thread of conversation in Washington DC that “ biohacking ” is somehow aberrant and strange .
But apparently DIYBio , you ’ll be happy to hear , is a group composed of the Good Guys .
Everyone should feel happy and safe , I guess .
Or maybe not so much , but not for the reasons you might think .
The creation of a false dichotomy between “ DIY Biotech ” ( good guys ) and “ Biohacking ” ( bad guys ) lends unfortunate credence to the notion that there is an easily identifiable group of well - meaning souls who embrace openness and who are eager to work with the government .
On the contrary , in my experience there are a number of people who are actively hacking biology in their garages who intentionally keep a low profile ( I am not certain how many and know of no existing measure , but see discussion above ) .
This tally included me until a little over a year ago , though now my garage houses a boat under restoration .
These people often consider themselves “ hackers ” , in the same vein as people who hack computers , boats (! ) , cars , and their own houses .
Yes , it is all hacking , or Making , or whatever you want to call it , and not only is it generally
There ’s a lot more in Carlson ’s post which is worth reading .
Indeed he has a new book out about the coming impact of cheap biotechnology , entitled : Biology is Technology
.
As he says in Chapter One :
VPN software lets you join private networks as though you 're sitting at a local computer on that network , giving you access to shared folders and tons more handy stuff .
Here 's a look at five of the most popular VPN tools .

VPN software brings the security of a private network to an insecure network , and allows you to access private local networks from anywhere .
As we 've explained in the past , you can do things between computers on your local network you can't from out on the internet : like listen to a shared iTunes library or access files in shared folders .
Virtual private network applications give you access to your computer from anywhere on the internet as if you were home on your local network .
Earlier this week we asked you to share your favorite software for establishing and maintaining virtual private networks .
We rounded up the votes , and now we 're back with the five most popular VPN applications .

If you 're new to the idea of virtual private networks , you can read up on the technical nitty - gritty at the Wikipedia entry for VPNs .
Note : This Hive Five contains both VPN server applications ( the apps that create virtual private networks on your local network so it 's accessible from the outside world ) and VPN client applications ( the apps that connect to virtual private networks from the outside world ) .
In many instances companies produce VPN servers , VPN clients , VPN servers with accompanying clients , or VPN clients that are designed to work with a variety of servers .

OpenVPN is an open source VPN server that 's easy to set up for use with open source VPN clients .
You can easily export configuration files from OpenVPN to import into a variety of open source and commercial clients .
OpenVPN is also integrated into several router firmware packages including popular DD - WRT , OpenWRT , and Tomato .
The OpenVPN system is n't compatible with popular commercial VPN providers , but it provides an open source and free alternative for setting up VPNs to expensive and closed commercial models .

Cisco has a high market saturation in corporate and educational environments , and for many of you , any experience you 've had with virtual private networks is through such exposure .
The price to run a Cisco VPN is highly variable — and you can't even get a concrete number without a quote from the company — but you can , as an end user , download the free Cisco VPN client for Windows and Mac — though many readers complained about the lack of 64 - bit support in the free Cisco client .

Hamachi's strongest attribute is its ease of use .
If you 've read some of the other entries in the Hive Five and realized that you do n't want a contract for a corporate VPN or the hassle of configuring a bunch of routers with open - source firmware packages , and you just want to set up a simple virtual network between you and your friend , your phone , or your office , Hamachi offers nearly instant deployment .
Install the Hamachi client on all the machines and devices you want to connect into your network and add them to your Hamachi VPN and you 're done .
It 's dead simple .
The downside , if you 're concerned about it , is that your VPN is n't locally managed — it 's centrally managed by Hamachi through their servers .

Shrew Soft offers a VPN that , while popular in its own right , received quite a boost when people started adopting Windows 7 64 - bit in droves and found that Cisco was n't in any hurry to release a 64 - bit client to accommodate them .
Shrew Soft works with a variety of VPN server protocols including IPsec , OpenSWAN , freeSWAN , and strongSWAN .
Windows Built - In VPN ( Windows , Free )

Windows has a built - in VPN client .
Surprised ?
Many people are .
It 's not a heavily advertised feature , but it covers many people 's needs .
Before exploring other client solutions , it 's worth pulling up the quick launch box in the Windows start menu and typing " VPN " to start the configuration process .
In Windows versions prior to Windows Vista , the built - in VPN client received a fair amount of criticism for lacking features and supported protocols .
Since Vista and especially in the Windows 7 implementation , it 's grown significantly and unless you need a feature or standard that is n't implemented you may not need to install anything at all .
Now that you 've had a chance to look at the five most popular VPN solutions , it 's time to cast your vote in the poll below :

An honorable mention goes out to the Mac OS X built - in VPN client .
Have a VPN tip , trick , or application to share ?
Let 's hear about it in the comments .
Years ago , if you wanted to take a picture , you needed a dedicated camera .
You needed to buy batteries for it , keep it charged , learn its controls , and lug it around .
Today , chances are your cell phone is called a “ smartphone ” and came with a three - to - five megapixel lens built - in — not to mention an MP3 player , GPS , or even a bar code scanner .
This Swiss Army knife trend represents the natural progression of technology — as chips become smaller and more advanced , cell phones continue to absorb new functions .
Yet , in the future , these new functions may not only make our lives easier , they could also protect us — and maybe even save our lives .
The Cell - All initiative may be one such savior .
Spearheaded by the Department of Homeland Security ’s ( DHS ) Science and Technology Directorate ( S&T ) , Cell - All aims to equip your cell phone with a sensor capable of detecting deadly chemicals at minimal cost — to the manufacturer ( a buck a sensor ) and to your phone ’s battery life .
“ Our goal is to create a lightweight , cost - effective , power - efficient solution , ” says Stephen Dennis , Cell - All ’s program manager .
How would this wizardry work ?
Just as antivirus software bides its time in the background and springs to life when it spies suspicious activity , so Cell - All regularly sniffs the surrounding air for certain volatile chemical compounds .
When a threat is sensed , a virtual ah - choo ! ensues in one of two ways .
For personal safety issues such as a chlorine gas leak , a warning is sounded ; the user can choose a vibration , noise , text message , or phone call .
For catastrophes such as a sarin gas attack , details — including time , location , and the compound — are phoned home to an emergency operations center .
While the first warning is beamed to individuals — a grandmother taking a siesta or a teenager hiking through the woods — the second warning works best with crowds .
And that ’s where the genius of Cell - All lies — in crowdsourcing human safety .
Currently , if a person suspects that something is amiss , he might dial 9 - 1 - 1 , though behavioral science tells us that it ’s easier to do nothing .
If he does do something , it may be at a risk to his own life .
And as is often the case when someone phones in an emergency , the caller may be frantic and difficult to understand , diminishing the quality of information that ’s relayed to first responders .
An even worse scenario : the person may not even be aware of the danger , like the South Carolina woman who last year drove into a colorless , odorless , and poisonous ammonia cloud .
In contrast , anywhere a chemical threat breaks out — a mall , a bus , subway , or office — Cell - All will alert the authorities automatically .
Detection , identification , and notification all take place in less than 60 seconds .
Because the data are delivered digitally , Cell - All reduces the chance of human error .
And by activating alerts from many people at once , Cell - All cleverly avoids the longstanding problem of false positives .
The end result : emergency responders can get to the scene sooner and cover a larger area— essentially anywhere people are — casting a wider net than stationary sensors can .
But what about your privacy ?
Does this always - on surveillance mean that the government can track your precise whereabouts whenever it wants ?
To the contrary , Cell - All will operate only on an opt - in basis and will transmit data anonymously .
“ Privacy is as important as technology , ” avers Dennis .
“ After all , for Cell - All to succeed , people must be comfortable enough to turn it on in the first place . ”
For years , the idea of a handheld weapons of mass destruction detector has engaged engineers .
In 2007 , S&T called upon the private sector to develop concepts of operations .
Today , thanks to increasingly successful prototype demonstrations , the Directorate is actively funding the next step in R&D — a proof of principle — to see if the concept is workable .
To this end , three teams from Qualcomm , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) , and Rhevision Technology are perfecting their specific area of expertise .
Qualcomm engineers specialize in miniaturization and know how to shepherd a product to market .
Scientists from the Center for Nanotechnology at NASA ’s Ames Research Center have experience with chemical sensing on low - powered platforms , such as the International Space Station .
And technologists from Rhevision have developed an artificial nose — a piece of porous silicon that changes colors in the presence of certain molecules , which can be read spectrographically .
Similarly , S&T is pursuing what ’s known as cooperative research and development agreements with four cell phone manufacturers : Qualcomm , LG , Apple , and Samsung .
These written agreements , which bring together a private company and a government agency for a specific project , often accelerate the commercialization of technology developed for government purposes .
As a result , Dennis hopes to have 40 prototypes in about a year , the first of which will sniff out carbon monoxide and fire .
To be sure , Cell - All ’s commercialization may take several years .
Yet the goal seems imminently achievable : Just as Bill Gates once envisioned a computer on every desk in every home , so Stephen Dennis envisions a chemical sensor in every cell phone in every pocket , purse , or belt holster .
If it ’s not already the case , our smartphones may soon be smarter than we are .

Joe Biden went to Israel not for the sake of peace or even to admonish the country for its plan to build 1,600 illegal settlement homes in East Jerusalem .
Biden went there to talk about bombing Iran back to the Stone Age .
Israeli UN ambassador Gabriela Shalev .
Gabriela Shalev , Israel ’s U.N. ambassador , told the Associated Press earlier in the week that Biden ’s visit to Israel and Israeli officials meeting in Washington are about agreeing on what to do about Iran .
“ Shalev said high - ranking Israeli and U.S. government and military leaders both in Washington and Jerusalem are currently discussing whether a military strike could stop Iran ’s nuclear program . ”
Ms. Shalev said she “ was encouraged that Biden said Iran poses a threat to the United States . ”
Sort of like the same way Iraq posed a threat to the United States before the U.S. invaded , wrecked the country ’s already enfeebled civilian infrastructure , and killed over a million Iraqis .
Iraq posed absolutely zero threat to the United States — it could hardly threaten its nearest neighbors — but that did n’t stop the Arab - hating neocons from inventing preposterous lies they fed to the New York Times and the rest of the corporate media in order to set the stage for invasion and mass murder .
Shalev broadened Iran ’s supposed threat .
“ I say even more — Iran is a threat to the whole world . ”
Translation : Iran is a threat to Israel ’s hegemonic dominance of the Middle East .
Israel has invaded and occupied Lebanon , bombed a nuclear reactor in Iraq , stolen land from Syria , and engaged in numerous border provocations , all of it either tacitly or directly supported by the United States .
“ Israel clearly prepares itself to seek overtly a hegemony over the entire Middle East , ” Israeli Israel Shahak wrote in 1997 , “ without hesitating to use for the purpose all means available , including nuclear ones . ”
Israel has around 400 nuclear weapons while Iran has zero .
Israel has used its “ Samson option ” to threaten and intimidate its Arab and Muslim neighbors .
Israeli leaders created the term in the mid-1960s , inspired by the Biblical figure Samson , who destroyed a Philistine temple , killing himself and thousands of Philistine enemies .
Israel admits it has used the threat of nuclear annihilation for “ compellent purposes , ” that is to say to force others to accept its political demands .
Biden ’s cover story :
No peace talks under current conditions .
Unlike Israel , Iran has accepted supervision of its nuclear program under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty .
“ Israel opposes any challenge to its nuclear hegemony since not only would it be less able to use its nuclear threat to keep confiscated lands , but fear of Iran actually might cause citizens to leave Israel and investment to dry up , ” writes Carol Moore .
According to Shalev , Israel no longer has patience for the diplomatic game and believes sanctions are useless .
Israel would like the Security Council to approve “ crippling ” sanctions — making the people of Iran hurt like the people of Iraq were seriously hurt under sanctions ( ultimately to the tune of more than 500,000 dead children ) — but Shalev conceded “ the chances now seem grim . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
So confident is Israel on the futility of sanctions , it plans to distribute gas masks to the public in preparation for an Iranian retaliatory attack .
Meanwhile , Bush era retread , Robert Gates , the Secretary of Defense , has engaged in war council talks with Saudi Arabia ’s King Abdullah and plans to talk with Abu Dhabi ’s Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al - Nahayan about “ U.S. efforts to push for U.N. sanctions against Iran , ” according to Reuters .
“ Speaking earlier in the day at a U.S. military base in southwest Asia , Gates said Iran was seeking to undermine U.S. efforts in Afghanistan and ‘ make our lives harder ’ by supporting the Taliban , ” the austere religious fanatics installed by the United States .
In his memoirs , From the Shadows , Gates stated that the CIA began to aid the Mujahedeen in Afghanistan 6 months before the Soviet intervention .
A large number of the Mujahedeen would eventually form the Taliban with ample support and funding from the U.S. , Britain , and the Saudis .
It certainly appears the U.S. is preparing to work with Israel and will eventually attack Iran or actively support an Israeli attack on the country .
However , if a war game conducted at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy , part of the Washington - based Brookings Institution in Washington , is any indication the affair will go bad in a big way .
“ With diplomacy failing and precious intelligence just received about two new secret Iranian nuclear facilities , Israel launches a pre-emptive strike against Teheran ’s nuclear complex .
The strike is successful , wiping out six of Iran ’s key sites and setting back its suspected quest for a bomb by years , ” McClatchy reported in February .
“ But what happens next is n’t pretty …
Iran attacks Israel , both directly and through its proxies in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip .
It misinterprets U.S. actions as weakness and mines the Straits of Hormuz , the world ’s chief oil artery .
That sparks a clash and a massive U.S. military reinforcement in the Persian Gulf . ”
American political analyst George Friedman told Press TV in 2008 “ that a war against Iran would likely result in Tehran retaliating with attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz , a strategic passage for oil transfer from the Persian Gulf states … .
Crude oil prices may subsequently rise to ‘ more than $ 300 a barrel ’ , which will be ‘ cataclysmic to the global economy and stock markets ’ even over a short period . ”
In other words , if you think the economy is bad now it will be far worse after the United States helps its “ friend ” Israel attack Iran .
Addendum
Iran is not taking the latest round of pre-war talks in Israel , the United States , and the Gulf states lightly .
From the Middle East Newsline on March 9 : “ Iran was said to have been deploying a range of naval assets for a massive strike on its Gulf neighbors .
A report asserted that Iran has been acquiring and deploying a range of missiles and naval platforms to strike at shipping and energy facilities of its Gulf Arab neighbors .
The report by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments said Iran wants to intimidate the United States from operating in the Gulf . ”
More like they are preparing to defend themselves .
Any chance at averting a major war is looking more bleak with every passing day .

Here 's a great chart from Doug Short ( dshort.com ) that should really drive home the fact that higher taxes are in your future .
Basically , with the federal deficit going parabolic , the idea that tax rates would n't at least return to some historical norm , is patently absurd .
They are two companies which appear to have a lot in common .
Both see themselves as having a mission beyond the purely commercial , both have won the loyalty of armies of users who see themselves as fans rather than customers .
Apple and Google used to be bosom buddies - but suddenly they 're feuding like cats in a sack .
It 's not surprising that two companies which have moved onto each other 's territory are at odds .
What 's interesting is that the argument is about the very nature of technology and how we use it .
And the focus of the battle is Apple 's iPhone - is it the perfect technology tool liberating the masses to roam free across the internet , or a symbol of an increasingly closed web , controlled by powerful corporations which want to restrict our web freedom ?
Now a technology veteran who has just joined Google has weighed in with a strong attack on Apple and what he sees as the dangerous philosophy of the iPhone .
Tim Bray , who in the 1990s was involved in developing web technologies and then spent years with Sun Microsystems , will now be helping to develop Google 's Android platform .
Here 's what he said on his blog about Apple 's rival vision of the mobile web :
" The iPhone vision of the mobile Internet 's future omits controversy , sex , and freedom , but includes strict limits on who can know what and who can say what .
It 's a sterile Disney - fied walled garden surrounded by sharp - toothed lawyers .
The people who create the apps serve at the landlord 's pleasure and fear his anger .
I hate it .
I hate it even though the iPhone hardware and software are great , because freedom's not just another word for anything , nor is it an optional ingredient . "
And Mr Bray is not alone .
Jonathan Zittrain , the Harvard law professor and electronic freedom campaigner believes Apple has betrayed its early mission .
He contrasts what he calls the " generative " technology of early Apple computers which allowed anyone to to play around with their innards , with the closed nature of the iPhone where Apple is the gatekeeper .
Others feel that the likes of Zittrain and Bray are becoming just a little hysterical in their warning about the iPhone 's threat to our cherished freedoms .
After all , they argue , most people just want a device that does fun things and works , rather than being desperate to hack it , unlock it , or use it as a tool to combat global oppression .
Here 's Adam Thierer , from a technology think tank , arguing that claims that Apple 's app store is part of some Orwellian nightmare are ridiculous :
" These things are neither good nor evil ; they are just choices .
They represent different ways of promoting innovation . "
And there are now plenty of choices for people looking to buy an innovative smartphone - for every " closed " iPhone , there are dozens of " open " Android mobile devices .
So we 'll soon find out just how interested consumers are in the ideological merits of their mobiles .

On Friday , journalist John Fleck made a great point , comparing coverage of two new pieces in Science .
One is about the latest potential climate disaster : methane venting from the seafloor in the Arctic .
The second is about a promising new climate solution : using behavioral science to influence energy use .
Not surprisingly , the disaster got tons of coverage .
The solution got none .
This is entirely typical .
As Fleck says , “ The problem space gets more attention than the solution space . ”
So let ’s do something about that !
Let ’s take a look at this under - covered solutions piece .
Help Grist raise $ 20,000 by 9/30 .
Just click the image above ☝️
I ’ve been saying over and over lately that changing behavior is as important as changing technology .
Yet behavioral science is neglected relative to technology R&D. Everyone understands the importance of scaling up wind , solar , and geothermal power , but when was the last time you heard a policymaker or pundit talk about scaling up the practical application of knowledge about how human beings think , interact , and make decisions ?
In their paper , “ Behavior and Energy Policy , ” Hunt Allcott of MIT and Sendhil Mullainathan of Harvard argue for taking such knowledge seriously :
Just as we use R&D to develop “ hard science ” into useful technological solutions , a similar process can be used to develop basic behavioral science into large - scale business and policy innovations . …
What has been missing is a concerted effort by researchers , policy - makers , and businesses to do the “ engineering ” work of translating behavioral science insights into scaled interventions , moving continuously from the laboratory to the field to practice .
It appears that such an effort would have high economic returns .
That last sentence is a bit modest given the numbers Allcott and Mullainathan marshal .
They ’ve taken a close look at the results so far from behavioral programs in the field and the results are fairly astonishing .
Start with the most basic test : how much does it cost for a given climate solution to eliminate ( abate ) a metric ton of CO2 emissions ?
With plug - in hybrid vehicles , that ton costs around $ 12 .
With wind power , it ’s $ 20 .
With carbon capture and storage at coal - fired power plants , it ’s $ 44 .
How much does that same ton of CO2 abatement cost using these behavioral programs ?
-$ 165 .
No , that ’s not a typo .
It ’s a negative sign .
As in : $ 165 worth of profit per ton of carbon pollution reduced .
If similar programs were expanded nationwide , Allcott and Mullainathan estimate a net value — savings minus costs — of $ 2,220,000,000 a year .
Of course much research and testing remains to be done before it ’s clear whether these programs perform equally well at scale , but as a first approximation , that ’s not too shabby .
Incidentally , some of the data comes from programs run by Opower , a Virginia - based company that works with utilities to apply behavioral science in a way that delivers energy efficiency .
I ’ve mentioned them before , and as it happens , President Obama visited them on Friday .
“ You can see the future in this company , ” he said .
( Why is n’t that a bigger story ? )
Here ’s Opower ’s solution to reducing energy use :
High - tech , huh ?
Put a chart like that on utility bills and you get about a 2 percent average drop in energy use .
And it hardly costs the utilities anything !
They already have the data .
It ’s just a different way of presenting information , informed by good social science .
As social psychologist ( and Opower adviser ) Robert Cialdini said when I talked with him , there ’s more than 50 years of scientific research on this stuff .
It just has n’t been communicated broadly or translated into policy .
Time to start translating !
Allcott and Mullainathan offer three policy recommendations .
First , governments can provide funding for potentially high - impact behavioral programs as part of their broader support for energy innovation .
A bill under consideration in the U.S. House of Representatives , HR 3247 , would establish a program at the Department of Energy to understand behavioral factors that influence energy conservation and speed the adoption of promising initiatives .
Side note : that bill , HR 3247 , was sponsored by Washington ’s own Rep. Brian Baird ( D ) .
He got it passed out of House Science and Technology Committee but right - wingers , led by Glenn Beck , pitched a fit , saying it was government mind control .
The teabaggers created such a distraction that the bill was subsequently withdrawn .
I ’m going to chat with Baird about the episode later this week .
Moving on :
Second , through market incentives , policy - makers can encourage — or fail to encourage — private - sector firms to generate and utilize behavioral innovations that “ nudge ” consumers to make better choices .
Historically , economists and policy - makers have focused on how regulation affects relative prices …
In practice , however , firms interact with consumers in many ways in addition to pricing .
And finally :
Third , government agencies often provide independent information disclosure , such as vehicle and appliance energy - efficiency ratings .
This helps catalyze private - sector innovation by allowing firms to credibly convey the financial value of energy efficiency to consumers .
The effect of information on choices , however , depends critically on how the information is conveyed , and government agencies should carefully consider behavioral factors in the disclosures they control .
For example : the EPA rates fuel efficiency according to miles per gallon ( MPG ) , which turns out to be misleading in all sorts of ways .
( See : “ The MPG Illusion . ” )
If it instead reported based on gallons per mile ( GPM ) , it would better inform consumers about the real value of efficiency and thereby lead to better choices .
Most importantly , it would cost EPA virtually nothing .
It ’s just a matter of applying knowledge about how people tick .
Nerdy addendum
When considering interventions , policy - makers usually focus on price , or information about prices .
As Allcott and Mullainathan note , this focus derives from the the rational choice theory of traditional economics .
( I ’ve harped on that lately too — here , here , here , and here . )
Problem is , behavioral psychology and neuroscience have demonstrated that the rational - choice ideal no longer holds water .
John M. Gowdy of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , in “ Behavioral Economics and Climate Change Policy , ” puts it this way :
The axioms of consumer choice — the starting point of traditional economic theory — have been re-cast as testable hypotheses and these assumptions have come up short as defendable scientific characterizations of human behavior .
It is no longer tenable for economists to claim that the self - regarding , rational actor model offers a satisfactory description of human decision making .
Nor do humans consistently act “ as if ” they obey the laws of rational choice theory … …
Ironically , the rational actor model seems to be most appropriate for animals with limited cognitive ability and perhaps humans making the simplest kinds of choices .
For the most important decisions humans make , culture , institutions , and give - and - take interactions are critical and should be central to any behavioral model .
Much of behavioral economics has been devoted to debunking rational choice theory , but a positive alternative is just beginning to emerge , a kind of unified theory of human behavior that harmonizes research from economics , sociology , anthropology , and psychology .
Read Gowdy ’s fascinating paper for more on that .
Some previous posts that touch on all this stuff :
Pope Benedict XVI has again been drawn into the sex abuse crisis rocking the Catholic Church .
Already accused of assisting the cover - up of abuses in his native Germany , Benedict is facing new charges that — as long ago as the 1960s — he failed to defrock a culpable Milwaukee priest .
Here 's a timeline of how accusations of negligence have shadowed Benedict 's papacy since he was named Pope :
April 2005 : When the erstwhile Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger is selected to be Pope , he has been heading up the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , the office that decides whether priests accused of child abuse should be given canonical trials and defrocked .
September 2005 : As the Vatican 's head of state , the new Pope enjoys immunity against charges of negligence .
A Texas civil lawsuit accusing Ratzinger of covering up the abuse of three Houston area boys in the mid-1990s is dropped .
July 2007 : Under Pope Benedict 's watch , the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles pays out $ 660 million to hundreds of plaintiffs accusing up to 126 priests of clergy sex abuse .
April 2008 : During his first papal visit to the U.S. , Pope Benedict says he is " deeply ashamed " of the sexual abuse scandal .
He pledges not to allow pedophiles to become priests .
November 2009 : A " damning " report in Ireland accuses four archbishops of turning a blind eye on abuse , and five bishops of actively covering up clergy sex abuse .
February 3 , 2010 : Evidence of " systematic " sexual abuse in the Catholic Church in Germany begins to emerge .
German magazine Der Spiegel reports that " close to 100 priests and members of the laity " are suspected .
February 14 : The Pope meets with 24 Irish Bishops to discuss the claims in that country .
Pope Benedict reportedly " lambasted " the bishops for failing to deal with sexual abuse in a transparent or effective manner .
March 8 : Pope Benedict 's brother , Georg Ratzinger , is linked with abuse cases in Germany .
Der Spiegel reports sexual abuse at two boarding schools where Ratzinger worked , though the choirmaster is not accused of perpetrating abuses .
March 12 : The Pope is dragged into the clergy scandal in his native Germany .
As Archbishop of Munich and Freising in 1980 , Benedict reportedly approved the transfer of Peter Hullerman , a priest accused of molesting boys , to therapy .
After being treated , Hullerman returned to pastoral duties and abused more children .
He was finally convicted of sexual abuse in 1986 .
March 13 : The Vatican says the Hullerman allegations are an " aggressive " attempt to smear the Pope 's name , and insists Benedict had nothing to do with the decision to transfer the priest to therapy .
March 15 : It emerges that Hullerman is still practising as a priest in Germany .
He is immediately suspended from his duties .
March 20 : Facing calls for his resignation , Pope Benedict writes an open letter apologizing to victims of sexual abuse by the Catholic priesthood .
" You have suffered grievously and I am truly sorry , " he writes in the " most comprehensive statement yet " on the crisis .
March 24 : The Pope is accused of failing to defrock Lawrence Murphy , a priest who allegedly molested as many as 200 deaf boys in Wisconsin during the 1960s and 70s .
A canonical trial to dismiss the priest in 1996 was halted after Murphy personally wrote to Ratzinger to protest the trial because he was in poor health and had " already repented . "

BILDERBERG FOUND !
By James P. Tucker , Jr. The Bilderberg group will conduct its annual meeting June 3 - 6 in Sitges , Spain ( a small , exclusive resort town about 20 miles from Barcelona ) behind a wall of armed guards who will seal off the resort in a futile attempt to keep the event secret .
Bilderberg ’s meeting will follow that of its brother group , the Trilateral Commission , which will gather at the Four Seasons Resort in Dublin , Ireland May 6 - 10 .
Leaders of Bilderberg also attend the Trilateralists ’ meeting to map their common agenda .
About 300 attend Trilateral Commission meetings , which are conducted behind sealed - off , guarded floors of their hotel .
About 100 will attend Bilderberg , which seals off the entire resort behind platoons of uniformed police and private security .
Bilderberg hopes to keep the global recession going for at least a year , according to an international financial consultant who deals personally with many of them .
This is because , among several reasons , Bilderberg still hopes to create a global “ treasury department ” under the United Nations .
Bilderberg first undertook this mission at its meeting last spring in Greece , but the effort was blocked by nationalists in Europe and the United States .
“ Nationalists ” ( a dirty word in Bilderberg ) objected to surrendering sovereignty to the UN .
AFP ’s source pointed to the words of French President Nicolas Sarkozy in a March 29 speech at notoriously left - wing Columbia University , where he said , “ We should invent a new global monetary order . ”
He was clearly referring to the recently proposed world “ treasury department . ”
Bilderberg ’s ultimate goal remains unchanged :
Turn the UN into a world government with “ nation - states ” becoming merely geographic references .
The European Union is to become a single political entity , followed by the “ American Union ” and , finally , the “ Asian - Pacific Union . ”
The “ American Union ” is to include the entire Western Hemisphere , including Cuba and other offshore islands .
Like the EU , the “ AU ” will have a legislature , executive commission and head of state which can impose laws on member nations .
There is to be an EU - like common currency , removing each member state ’s symbol of sovereignty .
The “ Asian - Pacific Union , ” or “ APU , ” is to follow a similar path .
But growing public awareness of the evil agenda of Bilderberg and the Trilateralists has emerged as a significant barrier .
For decades , until 1975 when The Spotlight emerged , the blackout was 100 percent complete worldwide .
( The Spotlight is AFP ’s lineal ancestor . )
Today , in Europe , major metropolitan newspapers and broadcast outlets give both groups heavy , front - page attention .
In the United States , independent newspapers and broadcast stations give Bilderberg extensive coverage .
But the major newspapers and network broadcasters maintain a complete blackout in the United States .
That ’s because their executives have attended these meetings on lifetime promises of secrecy .
The hypocritical owners of The Washington Post have attended since 1954 .
The Post ’s chairman , Donald Graham , and associate editor , Jimmy Lee Hoagland , have attended each meeting for years .
But as public awareness grows , so does patriotic resistance .
There is strong resistance throughout Europe to increasing the powers of the EU at the cost of national sovereignty .
In the United States , there is growing resistance to the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement , which would eliminate borders between the United States , Mexico and Canada .
NAFTA is to expand , under Bilderberg - Trilateral plans , to include the entire hemisphere and evolve into the “ American Union . ”
In the 1990s , Bilderberg was confident that the “ American Union ” would be established by the year 2000 .
A decade later , they are still fighting — and losing — the battle .
AFP correspondent James P. Tucker Jr. is a veteran journalist who spent many years as a member of the “ elite ” media in Washington .
Since 1975 he has won widespread recognition , here and abroad , for his pursuit of on - the - scene stories reporting the intrigues of global power blocs such as the Bilderberg Group .

How to Respond when a Girl does n’t Remember You
Guest post by Rob Judge
It ’s Monday afternoon .
You scroll through your phone about to “ play the numbers , ” meaning you ’re about to text all the girls you met over the weekend .
Some girls were hot , others were … well …nice .
Regardless , you send them all a personalized text : her name , a flirty greeting , and a little joke the two of you shared .
Then you sit back …and wait .
Almost immediately , your phone lights up with a response .
You read the sender ’s name and get excited !
It ’s a gorgeous little hotty — a girl you thought would be a TOTAL flake !
Amazed at how fast she hit you back , you do a little dance to the gods of game and then flip open your phone .
Your heart ’s pounding , your hands are shaking , you hold your breath , and read …
“ Who is this ? ”
The ultimate buzz - kill .
You ca n ’t BELIEVE it .
You ’d called her phone on the spot , precisely to PREVENT this situation !
Now it ’s as if you ’re back at SQUARE ONE .
You wonder if it ’s EVEN worth responding AT ALL …
Well , for those who ’ve experienced such ( un ) forgettable disappointments , I certainly feel your pain .
Any guy who ’s been out collecting his fair share of numbers is bound to hit a few amnesiac babes .
But I ’ve found the situation to be salvageable if you make a few crucial moves .
Make sure she knows you ’re not offended or angry —
One of THE most important things to remember about cold approaching is that it ’s NO BIG DEAL .
If you ask an attractive girl , most will tell you that meeting new guys is a fun and ( somewhat ) meaningless activity .
Hot women simply do n’t invest too much of themselves into an interaction , so it always just stays “ fun ” for them .
And you should have the same attitude .
If you can demonstrate you do n’t care , then she ’ll relax and know you ’re “ fun . ”
Women do n’t view giving their numbers out as signing a social contract to see you again .
Until it seems “ fun ” for her , she ’s simply not going to meet you again .
Here ’s a text I usually send after a “ who is this ” bomb :
Rob : lol player play3r how many hot guys named Rob did u mack it 2 this wkend ?
Everything about that text — down to the typos — is carefully crafted .
Essentially , you want to give the impression you really do n’t it seriously — you actually find it amusing ( “ lol ” ) .
I like using words like “ player ” and “ mack it ” because they ’re humorous and they help to reverse the roles a bit , making it seem like she “ picked me up . ”
Give her a “ hint ” — After sending my “ player play3r ” text , I usually wait 10 or 15 minutes .
Sometimes women remember you , other times they do n’t .
Often though , they just do n’t respond .
The unfortunate reality is that you ’re now just a “ random guy ” texting her .
But , again , do n’t sweat it — you can still get her out , but you have to work a little text magic .
As such , I usually send a “ funny ” text that ’ll get her laughing .
In my upcoming book , The Four Elements of Game , I ’ve written all the do ’s and don’ts of proper text game .
One of my major texting caveats is that humor is often lost in textlation .
Whenever guys try to be “ funny ” on text , it often backfires and either comes off creepy or downright offensive .
Learning the difference between “ funny ” and “ weird ” took me quite a few botched attempts ( and angry responses that read “ Delete my number ! ” ) , but I think I ’ve cracked the “ humorous text code . ”
As such , here ’s the follow up text I usually send next :
Rob : btw after I met you @ ( venue or place you met ) I got molested by a grabby cougar w arm fat .
She may or may not have been rocking a fanny pack .
Sympathy pls , it was traumatic :-0
This ( somewhat ) edgy text is a “ lol ” and not a “ wtf ” because of one key word : “ COUGAR . ”
Generally , young , hot women have a natural disdain for “ cougars . ”
By making a joke of a “ grabby cougar ” with “ arm fat ” and a “ fanny pack , ” you can get her laughing while also developing some “ text rapport ” with her .
Most likely , she was also “ molested ” by a few unsavory characters , as well .
I ’ve even had girls write back with stories of their own , describing creep - masters gone wild .
So it becomes not only a joke , but an instant rapport builder .
Retard disclaimer :
This text is NOT supposed to be a “ DHV ” nor am I sending it to show I ’m “ preselected . ”
It ’s only function is getting her to see I ’m a normal , cool guy .
Oh , and if the girl you picked up WAS a cougar , you might want to substitute “ cougar ” for “ crazy college chick . ”
( Remember : young babes and cougars are natural enemies . )
The Perfect Response to “ What do you look like ” — Now that you ’ve got her giggling and intrigued , like clockwork , her next text will often be , “ What do you look like ? ”
Most guys think they ’re home free at this point since the girl now seems interested … but it ’s a TRAP .
If you answer with anything that even resembles a real response — or worse , actually send a picture of yourself — I can almost guarantee you wo n’t EVER see her again .
I know some of you are thinking , “ But I ’m good looking ! ”
I ’ll bet you are , but by trying to “ prove it ” over text , you ’re only shooting yourself in the foot .
On text , only two things matter : 1. ) getting her emotional , and 2 . ) getting a meet up .
Volunteering a serious description of yourself or sending a picture is a LOGICAL response — the antithesis of what you want do on text .
The absolute best way to respond is :
Rob : well .
I lost a little weight since we met , so I ’m down to 467 pounds and I ’m only missing 5 teeth now .
You gotta check me out ;-)
By answering her question in a completely illogical ( and totally playful ) way , she again sees you do n’t take the interaction too seriously .
She ’ll feel MUCH more comfortable meeting up with you since she knows that even if she does n’t like you at least you wo n’t get all weird and offended .
Plus , you got her laughing on text ( which is no small feat ) , so she ’ll think you ’re probably even funnier in person .
Closing for the Date — After hitting her with a rapid - fire succession of comedic gold , you do n’t want to pussyfoot around and keep trying to be “ cute ” and “ funny . ”
Once a girl is “ playing ball , ” you setup the date .
Period .
Often a girl will write back some indication she found the text funny ( e.g. , “ lololol omg ! ur crazy ! ! ” ) .
When that happens , you ’ve successfully transitioned yourself from “ random guy ” to “ funny , interesting guy . ”
And that ’s PRECISELY when you push for the date .
If you hesitate and keep sending texts , you ’re going to transition from “ funny , interesting guy ” to “ text goofball guy . ”
( Do n’t be that guy , he ’s celibate . )
Again , I ca n’t stress enough how tenuous texting a girl who does n’t remember you can be .
You ’re literally doing a tightrope walk between keeping her intrigued and not going completely overboard .
So practice a healthy minimalist approach and save your comedy routine for the meet up .
Successfully transition into setting up a date :
Rob : Alright , meet me for a drink .
No pressure .
It ’ll be like a blind date of sorts , but you know to look out for a 467 - pound sexbomb .
Let ’s meet at 8:03 in front of ( Date location ) .
And ka-boom , there it is : either she ’ll say yes or no , but your chances are MUCH higher considering she did n’t even REMEMBER you initially .
In my experience , I ’ve found most girls will agree initially , but then try to flake at the last second .
But if you just keep pummel her with a few more witty texts she ’ll almost always meet up .
And once she does , GAME ON .
As some people have noticed , Apple has eliminated the blue lego icon that indicates a missing plugin on the iPad .
I believe that this is a not so subtle way of shifting users from believing that the iPad browser is lacking something , to believing that the site they are viewing is broken .
In response to this , I ’ve created the blueLego edition of SWFObject 2.2 .
It works exactly the same as regular SWFObject , except it will display the blue lego icon , with a link to Adobe ’s get Flash Player page on iPhone , iPod , and iPad .
As of April 13 , this page correctly displays content explaining to iPad users why Flash is unavailable on their device .
This is the same content shown on the iPhone , which is described here .
You ’re obviously free to modify the iDevice alternate content or the code itself to suit your own needs .
It is released under the MIT license , and you can download it by clicking here .
Whether it is useful for production or not , I leave to you .
It was created more as a statement than anything .
The blueLego art was created from scratch and I ’ve included the source FLA so you can modify it as you like .
It looks like this in use :
You can test it by pointing your iDevice browser to this url :
http://gskinner.com/playpen/bluelego/
Thanks to Rob Hall and others for helping spark the idea .
Edit : Copying my comment from below here , to clarify the purpose of this post :
This post was * not* a Flash pro/con , or Flash vs HTML5 statement .
Apple made a conscious decision to move from fairly and correctly showing users that they were unable to display a certain type of content ( whether you like that content / technology or not ) , to making it look like the site itself is broken .
It places the apparent blame not on Adobe or Apple , but on content providers .
Regardless of your position on Flash or plugins , this is wrong , and it ’s a dirty play by Apple .
This post , and the blueLego SWFObject library were intended as a light way to point out the issue and to help rectify it for site owners by letting them accurately convey why their content does not work on an iPad .
It was not intended as some weak form of “ revenge ” at Apple .
The soldiers came under Taliban surveillance as soon as they set out .
Intercepted radio chatter among insurgents left no doubt that Charlie Company was walking into an ambush as it closed on a Taliban stronghold deep in southern Afghanistan ’s Kandahar Province .
The sudden clatter and whine of small - arms and machine - gun fire sent everyone scrambling for cover .
Bullets spat up dust from the berms of a grape field .
The shots hit far more accurately than those of local fighters – one of many signs that committed militants had returned early from their winter break in Pakistan .
" They were close .
That was good stuff , " said Spc. Justin Jun , of Lake Tahoe , Calif .
" I do n't think I 'll need to shave in a while . "
Since being deployed here six months ago , the United States Army company ( 1st Battalion , 12th Infantry Regiment ) has been pushing due west of the provincial capital , Kandahar , into what foreign forces call the “ heart of darkness . ”
Zhari district – a patchwork of irrigation ditches , grape fields , and tightly packed mud compounds – is not only ideal guerrilla territory but also an area of enormous symbolic importance .
Four miles west of Charlie Company ’s patrol route lies the village mosque where one - eyed cleric - turned - Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar preached in the 1990s .
Like other infantry battalions fanned out from Kandahar , home to 800,000 people , these soldiers are carrying out Gen. Stanley McChrystal ’s strategy of blocking Taliban fighters from civilians whom they hide among and intimidate .
Similar operations are underway across southern Afghanistan as more US troops arrive , with the largest coalition operation of the nine - year war now gearing up in Marjah District in neighboring Helmand Province .
‘ Heart of darkness ’
In many places , as in Zhari , the battle is just beginning .
Until the deployment of 1st Battalion , 12th Infantry Regiment here , US - led coalition forces in Afghanistan lacked the troops to even challenge the insurgents in the “ heart of darkness . ”
A single Canadian rifle company had tried to cover the district , while a contingent of 2,500 troops had responsibility for the 20,000 square mile province Kandahar and its million - plus residents .
Relative to their number , the Canadians took heavier casualties than any major troop contributor in Afghanistan , accounting to nine percent of the coalition ’s 1,626 fatalities despite providing two percent of its current forces .
In Charlie Company 's operations area , villagers who can afford to have fled to more peaceful parts of the district , leaving behind the desperately poor and the militants .
Commanders and foreign fighters who left at the start of winter have streamed back , including Kaka Abdul Khaliq , a former mujahideen fighter whom the US military holds responsible for the deaths of several servicemen .
" Before he left for Pakistan last year they were conducting all kinds of attacks , " says Noel Engels , an American law enforcement official who works with coalition and Afghan units across the district .
" It 's a big year for [ the Taliban ] .
They need to hold Kandahar as much as possible . "
A sharp enemy
The Taliban are sophisticated fighters .
Using children as spotters , they have developed an effective early warning system allowing them to plan ambushes and thwart coalition missions targeting their leaders .
They exploit the US tendency to counterattack aggressively by drawing the foreign soldiers into traps by planting improvised explosive devices .
They have an unsurpassed knowledge of the terrain .
They use a command structure under which members of different units – whether IED - making cells or assassination squads – must seek permission before carrying out attacks , allowing greater coordination and instilling a sense of discipline .
Meanwhile the Taliban ’s shadow government , led by “ district governor ” Jebar Agha , organizes gatherings , bans schools , and metes out the brutal but impartial justice that helped raise the original Taliban to power .
There is talk among US officers about the bringing in an entire brigade , but nothing is definite .
For the soldiers already in Zhari their work is cut out .
Protracted fight
As the initial confusion of the Jan. 27 attack subsided , Charlie Company began returning fire .
Kiowa attack helicopters launched salvoes of missiles , A - 10 gunships came in on strafing runs , and F - 16 fighter jets growled overhead .
In the three - hour attack , only one Afghan man was wounded , shot in the back with a Taliban bullet .
Knowing that the coalition can eavesdrop on their conversations , the Taliban radio operators vowed that reinforcements were on their way .
But the insurgents , masters of hit and run , were already slipping away , blending back into the population until the next patrol to come their way .
The NAHB Housing Market Index for February , and Housing Starts for January will both be released this week , see : Weekly Summary and a Look Ahead .
As a review , here is a graph showing the relationship between the two series :
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
This graph compares the NAHB HMI ( left scale ) with single family housing starts ( right scale ) .
This includes the January release for the HMI and the December data for single family starts .
This shows that the HMI and single family starts mostly move in the same direction - although there is plenty of noise month - to - month .
Since the NAHB index declined in January ( it is released a month ahead of starts ) , we usually would n't expect much of an increase in January single family housing starts .
However there might be an increase in starts ( single family ) in January since many builders started a few extra homes in anticipation of the expiration of the first time home buyer tax credit .
It takes about six months to build an average home , so the builders can't wait until the expected buying rush in April to start building a home - they have to close by the end of June .
Here are some comments from the Feb 2nd D.R. Horton conference call :
In [ Q2 2010 ] , we expect strong closings since homes must close by June 30th for the extended tax credit .
...
We expect [ Q3 ] will be the most challenging as the tax credit for home sales will have expired .
As we move past the selling season , we 'll be able to get a better read on core demand and we 'll adjust our business accordingly . ”
...
We are prepared for the spring selling season and for current demand created by the Federal home buyer tax credit with our current spec level .
We will continue to manage our spec levels very closely as we move closer to the April 30th sales contract deadline for the home buyer tax credit .
Note 1 : The largest components of residential investment are new home construction , and home improvement .
This also includes brokers ' commissions and some minor categories .
Residential investmentis one of the best leading indicators for the economy , and the best indicators for RI are the NAHB HMI , housing starts , and new home sales .
Usually housing starts lead changes in unemployment too - see Housing Starts , Vacant Units and the Unemployment Rate - so the sideways movement in the NAHB HMI and housing starts suggest unemployment will stay elevated for some time .
The great illustrator Ronald Searle turned 90 yesterday .
He was interviewed on the BBC's Channel 4 Channel 4 News .
He 's still working , and smart as a whip and very funny .
It is interesting to see his desk and drawing tools .
I was surprised to learn that he is more highly regarded in France , Germany , and the US than his native country of England .
A blog about Searle posted a recent profile from the Times Online :
For years he and [ wife ] Monica travelled the globe .
She , too , is a survivor : she was treated for breast cancer in 1970 [ Searle was a POW in WWII and almost died of malaria and beriberi ] .
They remain as interdependent as newlyweds , their 50 - year togetherness reflected in their symbiotic duologue , finishing each other 's sentences .
" If our relationship had n't worked so beautifully , " he says , " you could n't spend 24 hours a day here .
We both respect our own corners . "
They meet at 6.30 pm to watch a " ghastly " TV quiz , Questions Pour Un Champion .
Monica cooks .
" An ideal life , because I am a solitary person , and Monica lets me concentrate on my work . "
" The phone has n't rung in this house for 20 years , " Monica says .
" He chose that it should never ring again , and had the bell switched off . "
Yet they are clearly gregarious ; they send Christmas cards , and welcome friends .
That 's a good idea about the phone .

Last supper ' has been super - sized ' , say obesity experts
Da Vinci's Last Supper was painted in the 15th Century
The food portions depicted in paintings of the Last Supper have grown larger - in line with our own super - sizing of meals , say obesity experts .
The Cornell University team studied 52 of the most famous paintings of the Biblical scene over the millennium and scrutinised the size of the feast .
They found the main courses , bread and plates put before Jesus and his disciples have progressively grown by up to two - thirds .
This , they say , is art imitating life .
Professor Brian Wansink , who , with his brother Craig , led the research , published in the International Journal of Obesity , said : " The last thousand years have witnessed dramatic increases in the production , availability , safety , abundance and affordability of food .
I 'm really not surprised by these findings because the size of our plates and food portions has increased
Dietician Charlene Shoneye
" We think that as art imitates life , these changes have been reflected in paintings of history 's most famous dinner . "
He says the finding suggests that the phenomenon of serving bigger portions on larger plates has occurred gradually over the millennium .
His team used computer - aided design technology to scan and calculate the relative measurements of items in the paintings , regardless of their orientation .
These included works by El Greco , Leonardo Da Vinci , Lucas Cranach the Elder and Rubens .
Based on the assumption that the width of an average loaf of bread from the time should be twice that of the average disciple 's head , the researchers plotted the size of the Passover evening dishes .
Super - sized
The main meals grew 69 % and plate size 66 % between the oldest ( carried out in 1000AD ) and most recent ( 1700s ) paintings .
Bread size grew by about 23 % .
The sharpest increases were seen in paintings completed after 1500 and up to 1900 AD .
Craig Wansink , who is a professor of religious studies , says the changes in portion sizes is probably a reflection of culture rather than theology .
" There is no religious reason why the meals got bigger .
It may be that meals really did grow , or that people just became more interested in food . "
Charlene Shoneye , an obesity dietician for the charity Weight Concern , said : " I 'm really not surprised by these findings because the size of our plates and food portions has increased .
" Twenty years ago , for example , most crisps used to come in packs that were 20g .
Now they are 30g , 50g or even 60g , and we are still eating the whole pack .
" This super - sizing has changed our perception of normal . "
But she said it was not too late to reverse the trend and that individuals , society and the food industry should look to smaller portions .
" Part of the problem is the type of food that has increased in size .
Portions of fruit , veg and salad have not grown .
They should make up about a third of your plate , with the remaining two - thirds left for protein and starchy foods . "

ANAHEIM , Calif . --
Detroit Red Wings defenseman Brad Stuart said a recent stretch that has seen his plus - minus rating dip does not indicate he is getting worn down or has hit a wall .
Stuart , by most accounts , was the team 's best and most consistent defenseman the first half of the season .
It might seem like the extra ice time and added responsibilities ( power play ) because of injuries have taken a toll , since he has posted a minus - 10 rating over the past 13 games .
But Stuart noted that plus- minus can be a misleading statistic , good or bad .
" I do n't like to get too involved in that stat , '' Stuart said .
" Some of it is back luck .
When you look at some of the goals , what are you going to do ?
I think if you start worrying about it that 's when it can affect your game . ''
Stuart is averaging 3 1/2 minutes more per game than last season ( 23:43 , compared to 20:13 ) .
He leads the team with 90 blocked shots .
He also leads the club 's active players with 144 hits , second to Justin Abdelakder 's 152 .
Despite Stuart 's physical play , he has only 14 penalty minutes .
In the Cleveland region and throughout Ohio , the legacy of the Lancione family stands tall and strong .
Over three generations and nearly 80 years , our attorneys have dedicated their lives to helping people who have been hurt due to the carelessness of doctors and other health care providers and hospitals .
No matter how challenging your medical negligence case may seem , you can be confident with our lawyers on your side .
What I 'm finding on the floor is very interesting .
I 'm witnessing the impact of People Power .
Walking around with a bill is how we sign up new supporters .
I have a few advantages when I do this .
One , I can hand out copies of our legislation , because it 's short .
Two , I can explain our legislation clearly , because it 's so simple .
Three , members want to talk to me .
Because they have heard from you .
So what you and I are doing , together , is working .
Simplicity .
People power .
Principles .
A movement .
It may feel small now , up against the lobbyists and the crooks .
But Members of Congress are noticing .
Insurance companies are noticing .
The Federal Reserve and the big banks are noticing .
And the media is noticing .
And we 're growing .
Here is something else that we 've done together .
We 've put together a campaign that is not funded by favor - seeking lobbyists and big shots .
It 's funded by you and people like you .
Last quarter , we raised $ 500,000 dollars in one day , an average of $ 50 at a time .
We topped every other House campaign .
But since then , the Supreme Court has ruled that corporations can spend unlimited sums of money to buy elections .
In Massachusetts , the US Chamber of Commerce spent more than $ 1 million to wipe out the Democrats ' filibuster - proof majority in the Senate .
We need to stand together against this corporate onslaught .
On March 27 , we 're going to drop another moneybomb on the special interests .
I need you to make a pledge to give to my campaign on that date , at http://www.congressmanwithguts.com.
A moneybomb will work because we 're a movement .
You might only have $ 5 to give , or $ 100 , but on March 27th , your $ 100 can become $ 100,000 .
So come to our site , and help keep me on the floor of the House , working for you , instead of calling lobbyists , and begging from them .

Cryosat 's orbit will be modified slightly to get the best out of the instrument
The radar instrument on Europe 's Cryosat - 2 spacecraft has been switched on and is reported to be working well .
The satellite , which was launched last Thursday from Kazakhstan , will use the equipment to map the thickness and shape of the Earth 's polar ice cover .
Controllers must now check all of Cryosat 's systems while a calibration team fine - tunes the radar .
The science phase of the mission is expected to start in a few months ' time and continue through to at least 2013 .
Cryosat is the latest Earth observation venture to be flown by the European Space Agency ( Esa ) .
A command was sent from its operation 's centre in Darmstadt , Germany , on Sunday to activate the satellite 's SAR / Interferometric Radar Altimeter ( Siral ) .
The instrument then acquired sample data over the Antarctic and Arctic for relay back to Earth .
" We 've tried the instrument out in all its modes , " said Esa project manager Dr Richard Francis .
" The very first time we switched it on , it worked brilliantly , " he told BBC News .
Siral advances the technology flown on previous European radar missions , such as ERS and Envisat .
It has an along - track ( straight ahead ) resolution of about 250 m , which will allow it to see the gaps of open water between the protruding sea-ice floes of the Arctic .
With centimetre - scale accuracy , the altimeter will measure the difference in height between the two surfaces so scientists can work out the overall volume of the marine cover .
HOW TO MEASURE ICE THICKNESS FROM ORBIT Cryosat 's radar has the resolution to see the Arctic 's floes and leads Some 7/8ths of the ice tends to sit below the waterline - the draft
The aim is to measure the freeboard - the ice part above the waterline Knowing this 1/8th figure allows Cryosat to work out sea ice thickness
A second antenna on Siral offset from the first by about a metre will enable the instrument to sense the shape of the ice below , returning more reliable information on slopes and ridges .
This interferometric observing mode will be used to assess the edges of Greenland and Antarctica where some rapid thinning has been detected in recent years .
Cryosat 's Dnepr rocket gave the mission a perfect start by injecting the spacecraft about 100 m above the requested 720 km - high mean orbit .
Controllers will now modify this orbit slightly to enable the radar instrument to perform at its best .

In the years after the the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the subsequent failure to find WMD , the American media flagellated itself publicly over its lack of skepticism of Bush administration cassus belli claims .
We endured reams of essays about the supine nature of the corporate - owned media , the supposed disinformation campaign of the White House , the “ lies ” on WMD claims ( that had also been made by Democrats in Congress from 1998 until the invasion ) , and so on .
To this day , the American media still considers their self - described blind acceptance of claims about intelligence without sufficient investigation as an indictment on their industry — and a consequence of the Internet - driven changes to the media market .
After wearing sackcloth and ashes for so long , one might believe that the American national media would leap at the chance to show its newfound mission of skepticism and challenge to authority .
Unfortunately , US journalists have missed a grand opportunity to demonstrate that it learned a lesson about swallowing a story from the government without question , if indeed that is what happened in 2002 on Iraq .
We know this because their colleagues across the pond in the United Kingdom have not missed the chance to speak a little truth to power , both in their own government and to multilateral organizations that issued faulty analyses , false data , bad research , and hysterical demands for action .
Do I refer to our military efforts in Afghanistan ?
In Pakistan ?
Fiscal policy among the G - 20 ?
No .
The Australian and British press have eaten the American media ’s lunch on the collapse of credibility at the IPCC and in the anthropogenic global - warming ( AGW ) movement .
In the past four months , media outlets like the Times of London , the Telegraph , the Australian Herald - Sun , and even the Left - leaning paper The Guardian have broken important stories ( along with bloggers ) exposing the fraud , mismanagement , and unscientific behavior of the core group of AGW advocates , such as :
None of these — none — were exposed by a major American media outlet .
The efforts of the American press , with a couple of rare exceptions such as the Washington Times and the Wall Street Journal , have mainly been to play down the significance of every revelation and to emphasize their view of scientific AGW “ consensus . ”
When the Washington Post finally got around to reporting on the East Anglia scandal , it provided only a straightforward but superficial recounting of the journalism done in the UK and Australia .
The New York Times did n’t even bother to do that much , saying that the collapse of the basis of Obama administration policy did n’t amount to a “ three - alarm story . ”
To this day , the American media has had almost nothing to add to the growing list of exposés accomplished by their Anglospheric cousins .
Bear in mind that our current government plans an unprecedented intrusion into the energy sector , entirely on the basis of the IPCC report that has been systematically dismantled by bastions of journalistic accomplishment like the Times of London , who got many of the above scoops .
Such a policy would give the federal government vast power over the economy and allow it to accrue massive amounts of fees and taxes , while dictating the rationing of both retail energy use and the means of producing it .
With all of that at stake , should n’t the American media have deployed its storied skepticism to some use on the AGW movement and the IPCC ?
After all , it was only a few years ago — after the invasion over which the media wailed and self - criticized its credulousness — that we discovered that the UN had conducted the largest fraud in human history , the Oil - for - Food program that put billions of dollars into the pockets of Saddam Hussein while impoverishing the Iraqis the program was designed to protect .
Should n’t the American media have been even more skeptical , given the track record of accountability at Turtle Bay over the last decade ?
Indeed it should — and indeed it did n’t , and still has n’t .
Curiously , the American media has been almost entirely AWOL on the collapse of the IPCC and anthropogenic global - warming hysteria as its intelligence has been proven not just wrong , as the WMD intel from multiple Western nations was in Iraq , but blatantly fraudulent .
It has been exposed as mainly comprised of bad anecdotal recording , biased manipulations of data , and collations of hysterical claims by environmental extremists .
Forget learning “ the lessons of Iraq . ”
When will the American media take a cue from its colleagues in Britain and Australia and start learning the lessons of the IPCC and of Oil - for - Food ?
The Petraeus briefing : Biden ’s embarrassment is not the whole story
On Jan. 16 , two days after a killer earthquake hit Haiti , a team of senior military officers from the U.S. Central Command ( responsible for overseeing American security interests in the Middle East ) , arrived at the Pentagon to brief Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm.
Michael Mullen on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
The team had been dispatched by CENTCOM commander Gen.
David Petraeus to underline his growing worries at the lack of progress in resolving the issue .
The 33 - slide , 45 - minute PowerPoint briefing stunned Mullen .
The briefers reported that there was a growing perception among Arab leaders that the U.S. was incapable of standing up to Israel , that CENTCOM ’s mostly Arab constituency was losing faith in American promises , that Israeli intransigence on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict was jeopardizing U.S. standing in the region , and that Mitchell himself was ( as a senior Pentagon officer later bluntly described it ) “ too old , too slow … and too late . ”
The January Mullen briefing was unprecedented .
No previous CENTCOM commander had ever expressed himself on what is essentially a political issue ; which is why the briefers were careful to tell Mullen that their conclusions followed from a December 2009 tour of the region where , on Petraeus ’s instructions , they spoke to senior Arab leaders .
“ Everywhere they went , the message was pretty humbling , ” a Pentagon officer familiar with the briefing says .
“ America was not only viewed as weak , but its military posture in the region was eroding . ”
But Petraeus was n’t finished : two days after the Mullen briefing , Petraeus sent a paper to the White House requesting that the West Bank and Gaza ( which , with Israel , is a part of the European Command — or EUCOM ) , be made a part of his area of operations .
Petraeus ’s reason was straightforward : with U.S. troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan , the U.S. military had to be perceived by Arab leaders as engaged in the region ’s most troublesome conflict .
[ UPDATE : A senior military officer denied Sunday that Petraeus sent a paper to the White House .
“ CENTCOM did have a team brief the CJCS on concerns revolving around the Palestinian issue , and CENTCOM did propose a UCP change , but to CJCS , not to the WH , ” the officer said via email .
“ GEN Petraeus was not certain what might have been conveyed to the WH ( if anything ) from that brief to CJCS . ”
( UCP means “ unified combatant command , ” like CENTCOM ; CJCS refers to Mullen ; and WH is the White House . ) ]
The Mullen briefing and Petraeus ’s request hit the White House like a bombshell .
While Petraeus ’s request that CENTCOM be expanded to include the Palestinians was denied ( “ it was dead on arrival , ” a Pentagon officer confirms ) , the Obama administration decided it would redouble its efforts — pressing Israel once again on the settlements issue , sending Mitchell on a visit to a number of Arab capitals and dispatching Mullen for a carefully arranged meeting with the chief of the Israeli General Staff , Lt. General Gabi Ashkenazi .
While the American press speculated that Mullen ’s trip focused on Iran , the JCS Chairman actually carried a blunt , and tough , message on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict : that Israel had to see its conflict with the Palestinians “ in a larger , regional , context ” — as having a direct impact on America ’s status in the region .
Certainly , it was thought , Israel would get the message .
Israel did n’t .
When Vice President Joe Biden was embarrassed by an Israeli announcement that the Netanyahu government was building 1,600 new homes in East Jerusalem , the administration reacted .
But no one was more outraged than Biden who , according to the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth , engaged in a private , and angry , exchange with the Israeli Prime Minister .
Not surprisingly , what Biden told Netanyahu reflected the importance the administration attached to Petraeus ’s Mullen briefing : “ This is starting to get dangerous for us , ” Biden reportedly told Netanyahu .
“ What you ’re doing here undermines the security of our troops who are fighting in Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan .
That endangers us and it endangers regional peace . ”
Yedioth Ahronoth went on to report :
“ The vice president told his Israeli hosts that since many people in the Muslim world perceived a connection between Israel ’s actions and US policy , any decision about construction that undermines Palestinian rights in East Jerusalem could have an impact on the personal safety of American troops fighting against Islamic terrorism . ”
The message could n’t be plainer : Israel ’s intransigence could cost American lives .
There are important and powerful lobbies in America : the NRA , the American Medical Association , the lawyers — and the Israeli lobby .
But no lobby is as important , or as powerful , as the U.S. military .
While commentators and pundits might reflect that Joe Biden ’s trip to Israel has forever shifted America ’s relationship with its erstwhile ally in the region , the real break came in January , when David Petraeus sent a briefing team to the Pentagon with a stark warning : America ’s relationship with Israel is important , but not as important as the lives of America ’s soldiers .
Maybe Israel gets the message now .

New Chile quake as Pinera sworn in as president
Please turn on JavaScript .

Advertisement Sebastian Pinera has been sworn in as president of Chile , minutes after it was hit by the largest aftershock since last month 's devastating earthquake .
The 6.9 - magnitude tremor was centred in O'Higgins Region , some 140 km ( 90 miles ) south of the city of Valparaiso , where the inauguration ceremony took place .
The congress building was evacuated soon after .
On taking office , Mr Pinera said : " It 's time to get to work . "
His presidency ends two decades of left - wing rule in Chile .
The tycoon not only faces the challenge of reconstruction , but takes over from the highly popular Michelle Bachelet , who was the country 's first woman president .
Ms Bachelet left office with an 84 % popularity rating despite criticism of her government 's response to February 's 8.8 - magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami , which left close to 500 people dead .
I 'm leaving office with sadness for the suffering of our people , but also with my head held high
Michelle Bachelet
Outgoing president Earlier , Chile 's disaster management chief resigned , six days after the head of the navy 's oceanography service was dismissed for failing to provide a clear warning of the tsunami .
A BBC correspondent in the capital , Santiago , says buildings there shook and people rushed out onto the streets after Thursday 's tremor , but no damage was reported .
A tsunami alert was issued for a long stretch of Chile 's coast but was later lifted , except for Easter Island , where it remained in effect .
The US Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the aftershocks were too small to cause " a destructive widespread tsunami " .
Mr Pinera said there had been " significant damage " in Rancagua , a city almost 100 km ( 62 miles ) south of the capital , which was close to the main tremor 's epicentre , but there were no immediate reports of injuries .
The US Geological Survey initially estimated the largest aftershock 's magnitude at 7.2 , but later revised it down to 6.9 .
It was followed by more tremors , the biggest of which had a magnitude of 6.7 .
' Massive challenge '
The inauguration ceremony in the port city of Valparaiso , which houses the National Congress , was intended to be an austere affair .
The planned dinner was cancelled and the whole event scaled back out of respect for victims of the quake .
Ms Bachelet , who was constitutionally barred from seeking re-election , handed the red , white and blue presidential sash to Mr Pinera .
" I 'm leaving office with sadness for the suffering of our people , but also with my head held high , satisfied with what we have accomplished , " she said in her farewell address .
The leaders of Peru , Colombia , Argentina and Bolivia were among the dignitaries to attend the inauguration .

Many people have been made homeless by the quake , with about half a million homes destroyed .
BBC reader Ian Hutcheon , from San Vicente , 45 km south of Rancagua , described Thursday 's aftershock as " very severe " .
" I was in a bank when it hit and there was mayhem , panic and chaos , " he said .
Billionaire businessman
" We wo n't be the government of the earthquake , we 'll be the government of reconstruction , " Mr Pinera said recently .
Last month , Mr Pinera named his cabinet , leaving out any figures linked with the former military ruler , Augusto Pinochet .
In his election campaign , the 60 - year - old the conservative leader said he would focus on boosting economic growth and producing jobs while continuing with the outgoing president 's social policies .
Mr Pinera is one of the country 's richest men .
He made his fortune introducing credit cards to Chile , then went on to buy a television channel , a stake in Chile 's most successful football club , and put millions of dollars into other investments .

SAN DIEGO -- Phil Mickelson hinted at legal action Saturday for being accused of " cheating , " saying that if the PGA Tour did not do something about him being " publicly slandered , " then he would let others handle it .
Mickelson did n't mention Scott McCarron by name in a series of interviews after his third round at Torrey Pines .
McCarron singled out Mickelson 's use of the Ping - Eye 2 wedge , telling The San Francisco Chronicle , " It 's cheating , and I 'm appalled Phil has put it in play . "
PGA
Tour commissioner Tim Finchem will meet with players Tuesday in Los Angeles to discuss the controversial issue of players using golf clubs that are only deemed legal due to an old court ruling .
The tour announced Saturday that the subject will be part of a previously scheduled meeting at the Northern Trust Open .
The USGA has a new rule this year that irons have V - shaped grooves .
However , the Ping - Eye 2 wedges that were made before April 1 , 1990 , remain approved for play through a Ping lawsuit that was settled 20 years ago and takes precedence over new regulations .
Mickelson is using one of those wedges this week after reading about John Daly and Dean Wilson using them in Hawaii .
When asked Friday about McCarron 's quote about him cheating , Mickelson declined to get into what he referred to as " name - calling . "
Instead , he suggested that McCarron was upset with the new rule on grooves .
But after a 70 in the third round put Mickelson within four shots of the lead , he made it clear he would not go quietly .
" We all have our opinions on the matter , but a line was crossed and I just was publicly slandered , " Mickelson said .
" And because of that , I 'll have to let other people handle that . "
Asked he was contemplating a lawsuit , Mickelson said , " I 'm not going into specifics what that meant . "
Still , it was clear that his message reached PGA Tour headquarters .
The tour released a statement during the third round explaining why the Ping - Eye 2 wedges with square grooves were approved for play .
" Public comments or criticisms characterizing their use as a violation ... are inappropriate at best , " the statement said .
The tour again made clear that any player using the irons is not in violation of the rules of golf .
Still , there is some question as to whether the PGA Tour can implement a local rule at its tournaments to ban the Ping clubs due to the lawsuit settlement .
Told about the tour 's statement , Mickelson paused before saying it was " cool if they put that out there . "
" Again , everybody has their opinions and so forth , and it's healthy to talk about it , " he said .
" But when you cross that line and slander someone publicly , that 's when the tour needs to step in -- or someone else . "
McCarron , who missed the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open , could not be reached for comment .
He did not back off his criticism Friday of Mickelson using the wedges , although he used " bending the rules " instead of " cheating " in his comments .
He maintains that Mickelson , and others using the Ping wedges , are violating the spirit of the new rule .
Mickelson has been feuding with the USGA , in particular senior technical director Dick Rugge , since last summer when it became clear the new grooves would be effective this year .
He said he was not even certain that 20 - year - old wedges spun the ball more than his new wedges , yet offered no apologies because the clubs are approved for play .
" I understand black and white , " Mickelson said Friday .
" And I think that myself or any other player is allowed to play those clubs because they 're approved -- end of story . "
Instead , the story might just now be starting .
McCarron , who is on the 16 - man Players Advisory Council , said the wedges would be discussed Tuesday at a PAC meeting in Los Angeles with PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem .
ESPN.com 's Bob Harig and the Associated Press contributed to this story .
Same old problem .
Just when you need a Labour party there is none in sight – and clearly not one in the coming election .
On Monday evening the parties ' three economic spokesmen went head to head and stroked each other to a draw .
They nattered away like cleaning ladies over how to clear up after the great bankers ' ball .
There were smashed derivatives , defaulted swaps and toxic turds strewn everywhere – and who , they said , was going to pick up the £ 170 bn bill ?
None of them discussed whether the party should have been allowed in the first place .
I suddenly craved some good old Labour blood and guts , an Arthur Scargill , a Tony Benn , a Michael Foot , a Nye Bevan , someone to shout in their faces : " You blew it !
When those petrified , knock - kneed smoothies from the City came pleading for help , you caved in and gave them the people 's money .
You panicked , you bunch of creeps . "
That is what a real Labour party would have said : " When , back in October 2008 , the bankers told you they were too big to fail , you believed them .
You were conned .
Your economics was too rusty to call their bluff .
Now you have wrecked everything we stand for , everything you and your government have done in a decade .
You , Darling , are a banker 's stooge , another Ramsay MacDonald . "
A Labour spokesman on Monday night would have pointed out that taxes would now rise , hospitals would close , workers be sacked , students lose grants , child poverty increase , all because Darling lacked the guts to stand up to the City .
He had done more damage to the British economy in one year than Scargill 's miners or Jack Dash 's dockers ever did .
Look at the mess we are in .
Labour would not have moped over whose " efficiency savings " were the more meaningless but pointed out that the three spokesmen were peas from the same pod .
The Tories ' George Osborne never questioned the bank bail - out because his friends were bankers .
Indeed , he thought the Treasury should have panicked sooner .
Vince Cable , whose path to political sanctity is endlessly to curse sin and bless virtue , was equally bamboozled by the City ramp .
He bought " too big to fail " in his book , The Storm , and his only response was a Liberal Democrat miasma of on - the - one - hand - on - the - other .
Of course we shall never know what the world would be like today had Darling reacted differently in 2008 .
It could hardly have been worse .
I gather some smart business schools are starting to play the relevant " war games " .
Some scenarios , such as just letting the banks fail , are undeniably hairy , though the global market in finance is astonishingly resilient and would , by now , probably be picking up the pieces and getting back to normal .
America still eats and breathes , despite the failure of Lehman Brothers .
More plausible , a Labour party would argue that Darling should have properly nationalised the ailing banks , in a version of what he did to Northern Rock the year before .
He could then have secured ordinary deposits , up to any limit , ringfenced business lending ( as the Treasury did when it nationalised banks during the war ) , and put the casino divisions into bankruptcy administration , dumping their worst debts on the vulture fund market .
He could then have rebuilt good and bad banks , and eventually resold them .
The impact would have been traumatic , and much of the money now being extorted from present and future taxpayers would have been lost to them in some other way .
Insurance and pension funds would have taken a pounding as defaults cascaded through the financial system .
But much of the burden would have fallen on those who had benefited from the bubble in the first place , and the racketeers would have been hung out to dry .
The " quantitative easing " money that simply disappeared , much of it overseas – and which has fuelled the past year 's stockmarket boom – should have been used to boost demand in the high street by raising pensions and social security payments and instituting mass scrappage schemes .
Public policy would have been directed at restructuring the supply of credit rather than , as now , doing absolutely nothing to stop it all happening again – bonuses , derivatives and all .
Such an intervention would have been both properly Keynesian and properly monetarist .
There would have been no need for the savage deflation permitted by Darling from late 2008 which emptied shops , collapsed lending and threw thousands out of work .
It is reportedly now threatening , according to a Treasury estimate , one third of all spending on the health service by the end of the decade .
This deflation is harsher than anything abroad .
It is harsher than Margaret Thatcher 's medicine of 1980 - 1 . Darling 's policy was not a bailout on a par with British Leyland or Upper Clyde .
It was a gigantic , unprecedented , overnight evaporation of the nation 's cash .
We are told on the grapevine that in October 2008 , as Downing Street stared " into the abyss " ( as bankers love to put it ) , the chief horror was not the prospect of dismantling 10 years of government and mortgaging the future .
The horror was of Darling and Gordon Brown being accused of " old- style nationalisation " by precisely the banks who were now pleading for the new - style version : public subsidy with no strings attached .
Darling pretends that the only alternative to his capitulation was " cash machines seizing up and bank doors closing " .
That is bankers ' blackmail .
A gambler 's family does not have to starve if you ringfence his income and give it to the grocer while denying him access to the casino .
Darling merely let the gamblers return to their ways .
He won all the disadvantages of bank nationalisation with none of the advantages .
He spent the money but failed to use the power .
This is the treason against the left of which a Labour party would have accused him on Monday night .
Without a Labour party , this argument is dead .
The Tories are intellectual lightweights .
Nobody dares mention the awful truth that , whatever rescue might have been appropriate when the bubble burst , it cannot conceivably justify the devastation about to be inflicted on Britain 's infrastructure and social services .
Money on the scale disbursed by Darling a year ago should have gone , if at all , to the public benefit , not to correcting imbalances in bank indebtedness .
That is what a real Labour party would have said on Monday night .
For once , it would have been right .
Curry house owner foils burglary ... and then HE'S thrown in cell when yobs complain
When a restaurant owner found two teenage yobs raiding his beer cellar , he chased them and held them while his staff dialled 999 .
Sal Miah assumed police would commend him for catching the young criminals .
But when officers arrived , they arrested 35 - year - old Mr Miah on suspicion of assault and battery .
Held : Sal Miah spent five hours in a police cell after he chased down two youths who had broken into his cellar
The married father - of - five spent five hours in a police cell and had his DNA , fingerprints and police mugshot taken .
Mr Miah , who has run the Raj Poot restaurant in Crowborough , East Sussex , for 14 years , was finally released at 4 am after receiving a caution for assault and battery , which will stay on his record for five years .
He said : ' The system is a joke .
How can a man who tries to prevent a crime in progress end up being the criminal ?
' People are living in fear of these kind of yobs but when you do take a stand and try and defend your home or your business you end up in trouble .
' It 's the wrong way round .
These boys told the police I had punched them and they believed them .
' This country is getting worse .
You see these gangs tormenting people and they are just getting away with it .
But who was looking out for my interests ?
' This has been an unbelievable stress and strain on my family .
The uncle of one of the boys even came to the restaurant making threats that he was going to smash it up and burn it down .
' But when I reported that the police said they could n't find him . '
Mr Miah 's ordeal began a fortnight ago when he heard the teenagers trying to smash their way into the beer cellar .
They fled , but Mr Miah pursued them and managed to grab them and bring them back to the restaurant , where he sat them down by the bar .
He told his diners not to worry and instructed staff to call the police .
But as he did so a large group of the teenagers ' friends assembled outside and started to kick the door in .
Fearing for the safety of his customers , Mr Miah locked the door to prevent the ' intimidating ' youths getting in , he said .
He also went outside to stop them from breaking his windows and pushed several of them away .
But when the police arrived the youths accused Mr Miah of punching them and he was arrested .
As officers put him in the back of a patrol car , he said the laughing yobs hurled abuse and mocked him with shouts of ' You 're nicked ' .
Mr Miah , who has no previous convictions , said : ' I could not believe it .
' I had stopped a crime from happening and even delivered the suspects to police on a plate . '
Sussex police said Mr Miah should have ' observed from a safe distance ' before dialling 999 .
The spokesman said : ' On no account should any attempt at aggression be made as this could easily escalate into violence . '
A boy of 13 was later arrested and charged with burglary with intent .
MEDIBANK
Private has slashed benefits available to hundreds of thousands of its members , leaving them uninsured for a range of common operations unless they agree to pay up to 50 per cent more in premiums .
In a controversial move to which the Rudd government has made no objection , Australia 's biggest health fund has told 340,000 members on its basic '' First Choice Savers ' ' package they will lose even restricted cover for several common but costly procedures - such as heart operations and hip replacements - which people seek cover for to avoid long delays in the public system .
Other procedures totally withdrawn are : assisted reproductive services , knee joint replacement surgery , obstetrics , plastic and reconstructive surgery and renal dialysis .
Services that will still be covered under First Choice Savers , which is no longer open to new members , include palliative care , wisdom teeth extraction , and knee and shoulder reconstruction surgery .
To reinstate coverage taken away from them , members will have to upgrade to a higher level of insurance than they had before , after Medibank scrapped the restricted cover , which it said had left many patients with significant out - of - pocket expenses .
MEXICO CITY — Responding to a growing sense that Mexico ’s military - led fight against drug traffickers is not gaining ground , the United States and Mexico set their counternarcotics strategy on a new course on Tuesday by refocusing their efforts on strengthening civilian law enforcement institutions and rebuilding communities crippled by poverty and crime .
The $ 331 million plan was at the center of a visit to Mexico by several senior Obama administration officials , including Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton ; Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates ; Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano ; Adm. Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ; and Dennis C. Blair , the director of national intelligence .
The revised strategy has many elements meant to expand on and improve programs already under way as part of the so - called Mérida Initiative that was started by the Bush administration three years ago , including cooperation among American and Mexican intelligence agencies and American support for training Mexican police officers , judges , prosecutors and public defenders .
Under the new strategy , officials said , American and Mexican agencies would work together to refocus border enforcement efforts away from building a better wall to creating systems that would allow goods and people to be screened before they reach the crossing points .
The plan would also provide support for Mexican programs intended to strengthen communities where socioeconomic hardships force many young people into crime .

Tens of thousands of Italians have been taking part in a protest in Rome 's main square against the government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi .
The demonstrators , called out by the opposition and unions , accused him of changing laws for his own benefit .
The protest organisers also called for employment , education and health to be at the centre of campaigning for this month 's regional elections .
One recent poll showed support for his government nearing its lowest levels .
Mr Berlusconi's People of Freedom party has seen its preparations for the regional elections on 28 and 29 March marred by problems over electoral lists .
Italy 's top administrative court , the State Council , refused on Saturday to reinstate the ruling coalition 's candidates for the Lazio region , which includes Rome .
The government had passed an emergency decree to ensure its list was included , despite a People of Freedom official missing a deadline to submit the required documents to local electoral officials .
Mr Berlusconi has said the list was excluded as an attempt to damage his party , and that he only acts in the interests of Italian democracy .
Italy 's political atmosphere has rarely been more intense since he came to office two years ago , says the BBC's Duncan Kennedy in Rome .

01:40 pm - Snapback
" The enemy assault is starting and we 're likely to be breached very shortly , so we do n't have time for real preparation .
You 're going to have to improvise along the way . "
In a flagrant violation of normal procedure , Brief .ING is with me in the greenroom , as my techs plant the body sensors on two at a time : wrists , elbows , arms , shoulders .
" Your objective is the top of the hill labeled CC30 - AA02 .
We believe the entrance to the rebel biochem lab known as ' Widow Seven ' is there , cloaked from remote view . "
The armor goes on piece by piece as well .
No way could I put this all on myself .
Too many interlocking pieces .
Too complicated .
Ca n't even reach all the connectors .
" Despite our incomplete visual intelligence , we have been able to drop two dozen spawn points in the immediate area , so your overall access should be good . "
The terminology was stolen from archaic game lingo , apparently .
My HUD can show me the drops on the map but really , until I 'm on the ground , there 's not enough context .
" You are to make your way by foot to the top of the hill , locate the lab entrance , gain access , and unpack this cluster munition into the lab interior .
It will do the rest . "
The bomb pack tucks neatly under my arm like a football , locks into place on the armor .
We 're running with red and white as our colors lately , it looks like .
" We only have the one smart - cluster in present inventory .
Once it's on the field , that 's it .
If you drop it , pick it back up .
We can not re-equip you here on swing - thru . "
His voice goes all muted as they set the helmet on and lock it in .
The HUD comes up .
Sure enough : two dozen meaningless little glows on a topographical map .
" We have death response down to twenty microseconds , so we should be able to snap you back in time to minimize risk from just about anything but beam weapons . "
Of course , we do n't know what sort of defenses the rebels have .
Could be beam weapons .
Could be I 'm fucked .
Could be I 'm a dead man already and just do n't know it .
" Okay .
Seals in place ?
All locked in ?
Good , good .
Let 's clear the room , everyone .
Sound the alert .
Power to full .
Deploy in three .
Two .
One . Activating . "
Bright weightless light .
Cyclone of static .
Sudden weight on my feet again .
I 'm outside .
Above ground .
In the target zone .
There 's fire , shrapnel , death everywhere .
A firefight is already well underway , apparently .
Radio is full of chatter .
" Where is at ?
I do n't see it . " - " Get down !
Get down ! " - " Another round incoming ! " - " You three fall back .
I 'll cover . " -
" They 're breaking through on the right ! "
Lots of familiar red-and - white armor , of course , but facing a significant number of foes in what looks like blue and gold .
Heavier armor , not a design I recognize .
" New - spawn !
About time you got here .
Break left fifty meters , wait about ten seconds , then charge forward to a cluster of burning tree stumps you 'll see straight up hill . "
Dunno know who he is - we all sound the same on the mic - but encryption checks out so he 's one of us .
No thinking ; I break left , just as a shell impacts my spawn point .
" We 're pulling diversionary fire on the far side of the hill so you 'll make pretty good progress before they nail you .
Wait for it .
Wait for it .
Okay , charge now ! "
I see the burning stumps .
The hillside is clear .
Straight shot to the top .
I start to run , run , run .
Halfway up , there 's an impact on the side of my head and a bright flash and -
Helmet coming off .
Greenroom .
Medical team .
" Good news .
Snapback seems solid and judging from your cam footage , they 're limited to material munitions , same as us .
You should be able to get through this just fine . "
Brief.ING talks as the Meds go over my body and gear item by item , taking hasty notes :
No concussion .
No spinal injury .
No significant penetration .
I 'll live to fight again .
" As you get more visibility of the field , we 'll be able to improve intelligence .
Maybe plant a closer insertion point .
So if you can't make progress , make observation . "
With the relative calm of the moment , I try to reconcile my topographical HUD with my brief first - person view of the terrain .
What will the next spawn look like when I arrive ?
Light .
Whirlwind .
Mass .
I 'm on the far side of the hill from my previous spawn .
I look up the slope and see a blue - and - gold enemy spawn in himself .
I drill him with my rifle before he even moves .
" Where is at ?
I do n't see it . " - " Get down !
Get down ! " - " Another round incoming ! " - " You three fall back .
I 'll cover . " -
" They 're breaking through on the right ! "
They 're still yelling about the same things on the radio .
Movement on my right .
I aim , then draw back :
It 's one of ours , carrying a munition of his own under an arm .
" When he goes down , do not try to retrieve his munition .
Proceed forward with your own .
We 'll pick the dropped one ourselves .
You just do what you need to do . "
I still do n't know who 's addressing me ; I can't even tell which of these other red-and - whites fighting all around the hill are my commander , or even if I have a commander .
" What are you standing around like a target for ?
They 're dialing in on you right now !
If you do n't get your ass moving in about half a second you 'll be … "
The radio voice is cut off by a huge blast .
I look to my right , see that other red-and - white fallen , looking shredded before he blips out - leaving his munition behind !
" You !
Keep going ! " - " I 'll get it !
I 'll get it ! " - " Give him cover ! " - " I 'm hit !
Why did n't I blip ? " -
" Oh shit , here comes a couple more of them ! " -
" You two , swing left to help me here ! "
I fight back my instinct to run to the dropped munition .
Seconds later , a different soldier stumbles over to it and grabs it .
He looks my way .
I wave .
He points up the hill .
" You 're supposed to be running that way , dumbass .
Just like I 'm going to !
Why are you gawking ?
You 're only supposed to observe if you can't make progress , idiot ! "
I realize he 's right .
We both turn at the same time and begin charging up the hill , each with a bomb .
It 's almost like a race as we stumble over wreckage and -
Greenroom .
Surgeons .
Something being done to my arm .
" They got you pretty good that time , but you 're doing fine .
Everything looks nominal .
We have a nice , tight dispersal pattern , temporally , so the window is very good . "
I do n't understand any of what Brief.ING is saying this time around .
This seems like stuff I might not be cleared for .
I just run where they point and shoot stuff on the way .
" Bad news is , enemy has a pretty tight lock on us here as well so our turnaround has to be immediate here .
It 's a zoo out there .
Still got your bomb ?
Good .
Keep it up . "
Flash .
Spin .
Thunk .
Starting to get a bearing .
Over there , that 's where I first came in .
Behind me over here , that 's where I came in next .
Okay .
The map is coming together in my head .
" When he goes down , do not try to retrieve his munition .
Proceed forward with your own .
We 'll pick the dropped one ourselves .
You just do what you need to do . "
Wait a second .
I 've heard that before .
I mean , I 've heard exactly that before .
I look to my left and see a fellow red - and - white out in the open , gawking .
I shout at him :
" What are you standing around like a target for ?
They 're dialing in on you right now !
If you do n't get your ass moving in about half a second you 'll be … "
Ringing ringing ringing .
Technicians .
Hard to think .
" You dropped the munition so you 'll need to pick it back up on some later pass .
We have the spawn window down to less than twenty seconds now . "
It 's me .
All those guys out there .
They 're all me .
I just told myself to get my own ass in gear , and then I just got plastered by the bomb that I saw go off on the previous drop .
" Finally starting to get it , soldier .
Crazy , huh ?
None of the temporal tech - training ever sticks until you hit a zone for real .
Now make sure you grab that munition . "
Glow .
Whirl .
Solid .
I quickly spot my two nearest alternates and signal them to pull in close .
Where are we ?
There : I see where my prior selves are just now spawning in .
I say over the mic :
" When he goes down , do not try to retrieve his munition .
Proceed forward with your own .
We 'll pick the dropped one ourselves .
You just do what you need to do . "
The first one looks around , still bewildered .
Me , mere minutes ago .
The second one shouts at him about standing around like a target , then gets pulverized and blinks out .
" You : Swing left .
You : Keep going !
Find one of us near the fallen munition .
There , he 'll do .
You : Grab the munition and go .
And get that other dumbass moving . "
The orders start flowing naturally and my fellow selves hop to it .
They 're all going to be later spawns , so they already know the drill .
They 're even more practiced than I am .
" You 're supposed to be running that way , dumbass .
Just like I 'm going to !
Why are you gawking ?
You 're only supposed to observe if you can't make progress , idiot ! "
That 's me , standing over the munition , telling the comparatively rookie me to get moving .
Good .
They both charge uphill and rookie gets shot .
Blinks out .
" Clear on this side ! " - " Hit ! " - " Enemy has two spawn points here .
One on each side of the creek bed . " -
" Got cover here .
Camping their spawn by the granite outcropping . "
I pull three more of me around to cover the east side of the hill .
Then I recognize this particular clump of terrain .
Just then , I see a copy of me spawn right in .
" New - spawn !
About time you got here .
Break left fifty meters , wait about ten seconds , then charge forward to a cluster of burning tree stumps you 'll see straight up hill . "
Newbie - me is too stupefied with shock to do anything but hustle .
A shell barely misses him .
He looks back at me , as if he can barely believe this is happening .
" We 're pulling diversionary fire on the far side of the hill so you 'll make pretty good progress before they nail you .
Wait for it .
Wait for it .
Okay , charge now ! "
He goes , gets shot in the head , and experiences my very first snap - back .
I 'm looking around , trying to see where the munition went .
Is that it up …
Breathing .
Bright lights .
Pain .
" Close , but no cigar .
You need to iterate a bit and shore up your overall position before you 'll be able to finish that sprint with the recovered munition .
Understand ? "
I try to nod but can't .
A tech tells me not to move so much with a broken spine .
I tell Brief.ING that I understand .
They bolt the armor back .
I have to iterate for a bit .
Lights .
Weight .
Pain .
Noise .
Words .
Speed .
Agony .
Techs .
Hills .
Orders .
Armor .
Selves .
Round after round of spawning , figuring out which moment of the fight I 'm in , where on the field , who 's around , giving or taking orders as necessary , getting more wounded .
" Where is at ?
I do n't see it . " - " Get down !
Get down ! " - " Another round incoming ! " - " You three fall back .
I 'll cover . " -
" They 're breaking through on the right ! "
We all sound the same on the mic because we 're all me .
I know what to say because I 've heard it said .
My confusion is gone , burned away by the necessity of the moment .
" You !
Keep going ! " - " I 'll get it !
I 'll get it ! " - " Give him cover ! " - " I 'm hit !
Why did n't I blip ? " -
" Oh shit , here comes a couple more of them ! " -
" You two , swing left to help me here ! "
Spawn and snapback .
Spawn and snapback .
The whole fight can't be more than two minutes in length , but I only ever see twenty seconds here , five seconds there .
Over and
Over and
Over .
" Good news .
I think we have a lock on just the right spawn .
This one should be it .
Get that munition up the hill and drop it in so we can bug out .
They 're right on top of us . "
I only have sensation in about half of each limb .
I can't move anything on my face anymore except my eyes .
I can't even speak .
I just blink in acknowledgment .
" Suit 's still at fifty percent , even .
Better than we expected .
Okay , show time .
Sound the alert .
Power to full .
Deploy in three .
Two .
One. ActivaAAAAAAAAAA …! "
Brief .ING 's calm voice turns to shriek as everything around the jump field fills with swarms of tiny flechettes .
Enemy munition .
Direct hit .
That 's it for us .
Then I fade .
Bright weightless light .
Cyclone of static .
Sudden weight on my feet again .
" When he goes down , do not try to retrieve his munition .
Proceed forward with your own .
We 'll pick the dropped one ourselves .
You just do what you need to do . "
Bingo .
In about eight seconds , my empty hands will be full again .
I spot my landmarks :
This tree stump , that sandy patch , those craters .
I take my position .
" What are you standing around like a target for ?
They 're dialing in on you right now !
If you do n't get your ass moving in about half a second you 'll be … "
Boom .
I 'm moving in before the debris stops falling , stumbling through the rubble .
Grab the bomb .
See my own self standing there , with a bomb , waving .
I point up the hill .
" You 're supposed to be running that way , dumbass .
Just like I 'm going to !
Why are you gawking ?
You 're only supposed to observe if you can't make progress , idiot ! "
We both start running .
He goes down .
I know the next sixty seconds like my own hands ( which I can't feel anymore ) .
It 's the clearest piece of my whole life .
I run .
" Clear on this side ! " - " Hit ! " - " Enemy has two spawn points here .
One on each side of the creek bed . " -
" Got cover here .
Camping their spawn by the granite outcropping . "
I know where every shell lands , where every incoming bullet flies .
I duck and dodge and play dead and crawl and hide and make my way up , up , up the hill .
" Where is at ?
I do n't see it . " - " Get down !
Get down ! " - " Another round incoming ! " - " You three fall back .
I 'll cover . " -
" They 're breaking through on the right ! "
Every word , every sound , every movement .
Every order , every mistake .
Every spawn , both sides .
Every blue and gold goon .
The battle 's second minute is winding down .
" He 's almost there ! " - " Spawn point four is gone . " - " Spawn nine and ten as well ! " - " They still have one on the south side . " - " Camping now .
Okay , it 's clear . "
And then suddenly : silence .
Every other spawn has snapped back .
Everything has been countered on each side .
Nothing left but me at the top of the hill .
There 's a hatch .
I open it , then detach the munition , activate it , and drop it in .
Goodbye , Widow Seven .
A shadow falls over me .
I can barely find the energy to roll over .
There , standing over me , is one last enemy in his heavy blue - and - gold .
Below us , I hear the munition unpacking , filling Widow Seven with a million glass flechettes .
Shrieking .
The enemy goon gestures weakly , as though he wants to say something , but he remains silent .
Finally , he raises his gun and points it at my head .
I have no strength to point back , and nowhere to snapback to .
My battle is done .
Thank God .
Impact .
Void .
Lights .
And then I 'm in a greenroom .
Familiar , but different from the one I used .
Technicians , but not the ones I know .
Injecting me .
Binding me up .
A briefing officer leans in .
" There 's been a terrible intelligence failure , soldier .
Widow Seven was n't the name they used for their biowar lab .
It was their code - name for * our* temporal lab . "
Our temporal lab .
I was attacking us the whole time .
I dropped the munition into our own lab .
That was me , at the end .
My flechettes , shredding Brief.ING and my techs .
" Fortunately , the math guys thinks we can introduce enough paradox to unwind the scenario .
Sorry to do this to you , buddy , but it has to be you , if we have any chance . "
I can barely move my eyes but my peripheral vision is just wide enough to see the heavy armor that they 're wheeling into the room .
There 's not enough left of me to even weep as the techs start bolting on blue and gold .

For consideration : I have seen the enemy and he is , well , you know
Dubai police said Tuesday they are seeking the arrest of Israel ’s prime minister and the head of its spy agency over the murder of a top Hamas militant in a hotel room of the Gulf city - state .
Police chief Dahi Khalfan said he had issued the demand for the arrest warrants as he was now certain they ordered the Cold War - style hit on Mahmud al - Mabhuh .
“ I have presented the ( Dubai ) prosecutor with a request for the arrest of ( Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin ) Netanyahu and the head of Mossad , ” Meir Dagan , said Khalfan .

“ I am now completely sure that it was Mossad , ” said the police lieutenant general .
Mabhuh , a founder of the Palestinian Islamist Hamas organisation ’s military wing , was found dead in a room of the luxurious Al Bustan Rotana hotel near Dubai ’s airport on January 20 .
Dubai police have identified 26 suspects from the hit squad murder they say bore the hallmarks of the Mossad .
The Hamas man had been drugged and then suffocated .
Khalfan said last month that Dubai would issue an arrest warrant for Netanyahu if Israel was found to be implicated in the murder of the Palestinian militant .
Netanyahu “ will be the first to be wanted for justice as he would have been the one who signed the decision to kill al - Mabhuh in Dubai , ” he was quoted as saying in The National newspaper on February 5 .

“ We will issue an arrest warrant against him , ” said the English - language newspaper published in Abu Dhabi .
Police say the suspects entered Dubai on fake passports using the identities of 12 people from Britain , six from Ireland , four from France , three Australians and a German , before fleeing the Gulf emirate .
Two members of the hit squad which killed Mabhuh had “ returned to the United States after passing through a European country , ” said Dhalfan , who on Monday said the suspects were hiding out in Israel where they could avoid arrest .

Israeli officials have refused to confirm or deny the reports .
But Israel ’s media sees the killing as Mossad ’s work , and the probe has caused a diplomatic headache for the Jewish state with the countries whose passports were used summoning its envoys to hear angry protests .

On Tuesday , Ireland ’s Sinn Fein defended a town council ’s decision to remove a page in its guestbook signed by the Israeli ambassador over the alleged use of Irish passports in the Dubai murder .
The Israeli embassy in Dublin described the incident as “ a rare exception ” initiated by “ publicity seeking ” by Sinn Fein .
In Lebanon , an MP representing the Shiite militant group Hezbollah said security must be stepped up for all foreigners entering the country as they could be secret agents like the assassins in Dubai .

Australia meanwhile said that it was sending police to Israel to investigate how its passports were used in the elaborate plot
Khalfan told AFP Western passports would be closely inspected following the Mabhuh ’s murder but that Jews would not be singled out .
“ We respect all people and all religions , whether they are Muslims , Jews , Christians or others , ” Dahi Khalfan told AFP , asked about remarks attributed to him that “ all Jews ” would be prevented from entering Dubai .
He said immigration services would be on their guard “ after Israel ’s abuse of passports from Western countries , ” although there was no way of knowing if a Westerner entering the United Arab Emirates was an Israeli with dual citizenship .

“ The officers of the immigration service will now look twice if they have any doubt about the documents or photos , and will scan them , ” he said .
This guy has TOTALLY figured this out .
He left this series of photos on his camera in case he lost it .
So smart .
And so funny .
I love his facial expressions .
I think we'd be friends if we ever met .
In my last post , I asked for some help with my swim kick .
Many of you gave me some great thoughts / tips .
So check out the comments in my last post for some good ideas , or even leave your own ideas / drills / thoughts .
I tweeted SwimMD regarding my predicament , and he sent me 3 videos that give pointers on kicking : the first is on flutter kick basics , the second is a 6 - kick switch drill , and the third is about 10 - kick flutter variations .
I learned a LOT in the first video .
Check them out .
Thanks SwimMD !!
Happy Friday !!
Is someone keeping track of all the repressed anti-gay Republican politicians in the country who get caught in the midst of all sorts of flaming gayness ?
Sources tell CBS13 a state senator from Southern California was arrested for allegedly driving drunk after leaving Faces , a gay nightclub in midtown Sacramento , early Wednesday morning . [… ]
The Sacramento County district attorney says Republican state Sen. Roy Ashburn ’s blood - alcohol level was .14 percent when he was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving near the Capitol .
Ashburn , a father of four , is a Republican Senator representing parts of Kern , Tulare and San Bernardino Counties with a history of opposing gay rights . [… ]
A male passenger , who was not identified as a lawmaker , was also in the car but was not detained . [… ]
Ashburn served six years as a state Assemblyman before being elected to the State Senate .
According to Project Vote Smart , Ashburn ’s voting record shows he has voted against every gay rights measure in the State Senate since taking office including Recognizing Out - Of - State Same - Sex Marriages ” , Harvey Milk Day and Expanding Anti-Discrimination Laws .
A Russian security researcher on Thursday said he has released attack code that exploits a critical vulnerability in the latest version of Mozilla 's Firefox browser .
The exploit - which allows attackers to remotely execute malicious code on end user PCs - triggers a heap corruption vulnerability in the popular open - source browser , said Evgeny Legerov , founder of Moscow - based Intevydis .
He recently added it as a module to Vulndisco , an add - on to the Immunity Canvas automated exploitation system sold to security professionals .
" We 've played a lot with it in our labs - it was very reliable , " Legerov wrote in an email to The Reg .
" Works against the default install of Firefox 3.6 .
We 've tested it on XP and Vista . "
The report comes as Mozilla pushed out a Firefox update that tackles three critical vulnerabilities in version 3.5.7 .
One of those bugs is also described as a heap corruption vulnerability , but Legerov said the flaw is different from the one his code exploits .
Mozilla issued a statement that read in part : " Mozilla takes all security vulnerabilities seriously , and have as yet been unable to confirm the claim of an exploit .
We value the contributions of all security researchers and encourage them to work within our security process , responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities to ensure the highest level of security and best outcome for users . "
Legerov said his firm does not provide advanced notification to software makers under an arrangement often referred to as responsible disclosure .
If Legerov 's claim pans out , it would be one of the few times in recent memory that a zero - day vulnerability for Firefox has circulated in the wild .
While the exploit is currently available only to those who pay a hefty licensing fee , wider circulation can't be far behind .
This story will be updated as more is learned .
More about the bug is here and here . ®
This story was updated to correct an inaccuracy about the availability of Immunity Canvas .
" Because real boxers do n't hit like this [ flails arms exasperatingly ] "

" C'mon , who wants to pretend their hand is a gun .

Sony's VP of Realistic Movements Kevin Butler ( boy , does that guy have a large business card ) is at it again , this time in a video ad for the PlayStation Move .
He 's back from the future to thank us all for the success of the motion control device , and make a few jabs towards Nintendo and Microsoft for their efforts .
Here 's a few choice quotes .
Check out the futuristic -- or now - eristic , rather -- commercial after the break .
And if you ask , sorry , we still would n't bet on Kansas City in six .
The magnitude 8.8 quake that struck near Maule , Chile , Feb. 27 moved the entire city of Concepcion 10 feet to the west .
Precise GPS measurements from before and after the earthquake , the fifth largest ever recorded by seismographs , show that the country 's capital , Santiago , moved 11 inches west .
Even Buenos Aires , nearly 800 miles from the epicenter , shifted an inch .
The image above uses red arrows to represent the relative direction and magnitude of the ground movement in the vicinity of the quake .
The analysis comes from a project led by Ohio State earth scientist Mike Bevis that has been using GPS to record movements of the crust on Chile since 1993 .
The area is of particular interest to geoscientists because it is an active subduction zone , where an oceanic plate is colliding with a continental plate and being pushed into the Earth 's molten mantle below .
The world 's largest recorded earthquakes since 1900 have all occurred in subduction zones , including the largest quake ever recorded , which was a magnitude 9.5 in 1960 in Chile not too far from February 's earthquake .
The second largest was a 9.2 in Alaska in 1964 , and the third was the magnitude 9.1 Sumatra quake of 2004 that created the tsunami that killed more than 200,000 people .
The fourth largest quake was a magnitude 9 on Russia 's Kamchatka peninsula .
Bevis ' team hopes to add 50 more GPS stations to its current 25 to better measure the movement and deformation of the crust that will continue for years .
" The Maule earthquake will arguably become one of the , if not the most important great earthquake yet studied , " said project scientist Ben Brooks of the University of Hawaii in a press release .
" We now have modern , precise instruments to evaluate this event , and because the site abuts a continent , we will be able to obtain dense spatial sampling of the changes it caused . "
" As such the event represents an unprecedented opportunity for the earth science community if certain observations are made with quickly and comprehensively , " Brooks said .

The debate about staying at home or working continues A new study suggests the children of mothers who work part - time are healthier than those of their full - time or stay - at - home counterparts .
Where does this take the debate on the effects of working mothers on the health and happiness of their offspring ?
The study of 4,500 Australian pre-schoolers found those whose mothers worked some of the week were less likely to eat junk food , watch TV and over the course of the two - year research period were less likely to become overweight .
The authors suggested that mothers who worked part - time went to " considerable lengths " to ensure the time they did spend with their children was high quality .
" When mothers work part - time , there 's obviously something about the way the house is run , and the way parents are looking after their children that is protective , " said Jan Nicholson of Melbourne 's Murdoch Children 's Research Institute .
Mothers ' messages
Her study -
Do working mothers raise couch potatoes ?
- concluded that apparently they do if they work more than 34 hours a week , struggling to find the time for family cooking and activities .
The reasons why mothers who do not work have children with less healthy habits are not fully understood , the study says , and requires a closer analysis of " household dynamics " .
The findings are the latest in the steady flow of contradictory information on the effects on child wellbeing of the mass movement of mothers into the labour market over recent decades - in the UK some 60 % of women with children under five work .
It is a shame these studies always forget the father - if there is n't a healthy meal on the table , why is that always the fault of the working mum ? "
Dr Martina Klett - Davies ,
Family and Parenting Institute Within the course of just one month at the end of last year , two major studies were published with different , if not necessarily conflicting , messages for working mothers .
One suggested they were damaging their children 's health - with children of both full and part - time mothers less likely to eat an apple and get out and walk to school than those of stay - at - home mothers , the second that they were not harming their emotional and intellectual development in the slightest .
Meanwhile various studies have also thrown up differing perspectives on the potential pitfalls of the childcare they choose .
Nurseries have been accused of fostering anti-social behaviour and increasing stress levels in toddlers , but have also been found to improve educational outcomes and even to lower the risk of a child developing leukaemia because their immune system is stimulated through early contact with others .
Meanwhile grandparents , an increasingly attractive childcare choice for many parents as they tend to be both reliable and free , are now said to increase the chances of a child being overweight - although only in the wealthiest socio-economic groups .
" A lot of the time when you look at the actual statistical differences in these studies , they are really quite small .
We see associations , but not necessarily causes , " says Prof Heather Joshi , head of the Centre for Longitudinal Studies at the Institute of Education .
" All parents should perhaps derive comfort from the fact that what these studies really demonstrate is that there are no clear relationships and conclusive answers - that there is not a one - size - fits - all policy .
" Everybody needs to think carefully about what is right for them and their children , and be prepared to change if it is not working out .
You play it by ear . "
Forgotten fathers
And some may not have the luxury of choosing whether to stay at home or work , be it part - or full - time .
Limited and expensive childcare mean some who may want to work cannot afford to do so , while others need to work to financially provide for their child .
" Flexible working and better childcare is key , " says Dr Martina Klett - Davies of the Family and Parenting Institute .
" It is also a shame these studies always forget the father - if there is n't a healthy meal on the table why is that always the fault of the working mum ?
" But we also need to be wary of turning parenting into a science .
We like the idea that we can provide definitive proof of what is best for children , but a lot of the time all it does is make parents feel even more insecure about the way they do things and the choices they make .
" That , frankly , is not good for anyone . "

Christian teacher ' forced out ' after complaining Muslim pupils praised 9/11 hijackers 'as heroes '
Racism claim : Nicholas Kafouris arriving at the tribunal hearing
A Christian teacher yesterday claimed he was forced out of his job after complaining that Muslim pupils as young as eight hailed the September 11 hijackers as heroes .
Nicholas Kafouris , 52 , is suing his former school for racial discrimination .
He told a tribunal that he had to leave his £ 30,000 - a- year post because he would not tolerate the ' racist ' and ' anti- Semitic ' behaviour of Year 4 pupils .
The predominantly Muslim youngsters openly praised Islamic extremists in class and described the September 11 terrorists as ' heroes and martyrs ' .
One pupil said : ' Do n't touch me , you 're a Christian ' when he brushed against him .
Others said : ' We want to be Islamic bombers when we grow up ' , and ' The Christians and Jews are our enemies - you too because you 're a Christian ' .
Mr Kafouris , a Greek Cypriot , taught for 12 years at Bigland Green Primary School in Tower Hamlets , East London .
According to Ofsted ' almost all ' its 465 pupils are from ethnic minorities and a vast proportion do not speak English as a first language .
The teacher claims racial discrimination by the school , its headmistress and her assistant head after they failed to take action about the comments made by pupils to him .
He said there was a change in attitude of the pupils after the atrocities of September 11 , 2001 .
They told him : ' We hate the Christians ' and ' We hate the Jews ' , despite his attempts to stop them .
He said he filled out a Racist Incident Reporting Sheet but claimed headmistress Jill Hankey dismissed his concerns .
In a statement submitted to the Central London Employment Tribunal he said : ' Miss Hankey proceeded to excuse and justify the pupil 's behaviour , conduct and remarks to me as if I had no right to be offended by the child 's remarks and conduct .
' Amongst Miss Hankey 's justifications for the child 's remarks , she said , " If the child was older , say 15 , I might take it more seriously .
He 's only nine - he 's only doing it to wind you up " . '
He added : ' I felt the head 's behaviour and conduct towards me amounted to direct religious discrimination .
I was intimidated in the way she spoke to me which indicated " Do n't come back with such issues again " . '
Mr Kafouris , a bachelor , said the comments became more frequent after the head did nothing about the initial incidents .
' In late November and December 2006 , a number of unacceptable and blunt racist , anti-Semitic and anti-Christian remarks were being made by various children in Year 4 where I taught , such as , " The Twin Tower bombers are heroes and martyrs " .
' Some children were expressing delight at the death and killing of people of other cultures and religions .
' In the last week of November 2006 a child was talking about stabbing another child and I told him this was dangerous talk and that a lawyer had recently been stabbed by teenagers .
His reply was , " I 'm glad that man died " .
" Why ? " I asked .
" Because he 's a Christian and English and we 're Muslim " . '
He claimed that during a religious education lesson about Jonah and the whale , one of the pupils asked if Jonah was a Jew , before shouting : ' I hate the Jews , they 're our enemies . '
Mr Kafouris said he again tried to speak to Miss Hankey about it .
' The head 's response was hostile and offensive again .
The very first thing she said to me was , " Oh , you again !
You 're the only teacher that reports these things !
Nobody else does ! "
' Four times she repeated , " It 's because of your lack of discipline that they 're saying these things " . '
Mr Kafouris was signed off with stress by his GP at the end of February 2007 after assistant head Margaret Coleman warned him not to challenge the pupils in class about their remarks .
He says the lack of support from the school has made him clinically depressed and unable to work .
He was sacked in April last year .
The case continues .
Absurdity reigns , OK ?
The saying « We have been put on earth to make Kafka come true » has been well known since Soviet times .
We have been so steeped in absurdity since childhood that we have n't even learnt to distinguish any of the rules that regulate it .
We are on the other side of the looking glass but somehow manage to function , work out what moves to make and make careers for ourselves .
When Europeans first come to Russia they apply their boring rationalism to the situation , attempting to discover in it the logic to which they are accustomed .
I remember English people from MAPS ( Moscow Architecture Preservation Society ) , itself a kind of absurdity , talking about an 18th century mansion that was being knocked down in order to put up a pseudo - baroque restaurant « Turandot » in its place .
They kept on exclaiming « It 's absurd !
Absurd ! »
Most of them eventually get used to things here and some even start obeying the rules of through the looking glass etiquette , where pies are handed out first and then cut up .
In this context events at the Russian branch of « IKEA » are revealing .
From the start the company announced that even in Russia it would be adhering to its clearly - formulated Swedish rules , based on the Protestant work ethic and unanswerable logic .
As a result , Khimki officials turned off the electricity just before the first Moscow shop opened .
There was no practical reason for this .
They just wanted to « give them a hard time » for their excessively strict principles .
By the time they opened in Petersburg , the Swedes already knew that they had to have their own generator in each of their Russian stores – just in case .
A wise decision , as subsequently emerged .
From that moment the Swedes did all they could to minimise their dependence on local authority whims , when building their stores in Russia .
« We are pleased with our solution to the problem .
Better hire a generator than stick our head into a noose , » said Krister Tordson , a company board member .
The victorious Swedish advance came to grief in Samara .
You could say it was another Poltava [ 1709 defeat of Swedes by Peter the Great ed. ] .
Their store there was built three years ago , but its opening was postponed nine times .
The company has opened 230 stores all over the world , but was unable to overcome the implacable cupidity of the Samara officials .
Their last complaint was that the building was insufficiently hurricane - proofed .
The Swedes were unable to obtain any information about destructive tornados wreaking havoc on the left bank of the Volga and took umbrage .
IKEA 's legendary founder Ingvar Kamprad announced that investment in Russia would be scaled down .
But local officials were unlikely to be fazed by such trifles .
Their actions are , after all , not dictated by narrow personal interest .
They are supporting the normal functioning of an irrational system .
A further blow was in store for Ingvar Kamprad ( 5th in Forbes Magazine Rich List ) a couple of months later .
It emerged that the company had overpaid 200 million USD for the use of their generators – IKEA 's prize - winning idea – which virtually wiped out the profit from all their Eastern European stores for the last few years .
The Swedes had seen themselves as Sir Lancelots cutting the head off the dragon of corruption .
What they forgot was that through the looking glass the rules dictate that another head immediately grows in its place .
Forensic investigation revealed that the Russian employee responsible for the hire of the generators was receiving kickbacks from the leasing company , so had been considerably inflating the service costs .
The company tore up the contract with that firm and was fined 5 million euros by a Russian court for breach of contract .
« We had come up against something way outside what we usually encounter , » said a puzzled Krister Tordson .
But this was not the final blow to the convictions of 83 year - old Kamprad .
A couple of weeks ago the Swedish tabloids revealed that the company director for Russia and Eastern Europe Per Kaufman , who was well known for his public criticism of Russian corruption , had been turning a blind eye to his contractors bribing local officials .
When Kamprad was told about this he was devastated .
Eyewitnesses said he was crying like a child .
Kamprad remained true to his principles , of course , and ordered that Kaufman , who had been his very close assistant for 20 years , should be sacked forthwith .
Essentially this granite - hard old man was signing his own defeat .
Probably for the first time in his life .
The Swedes had repeated the mistake of the surveyor K in Kafka 's « The Castle » , who tried to use the powers of reason to overcome the absurd .
A fruitless attempt .
Reason has limited possibilities , whereas the absurd knows no limits .
I made the same mistake and was overly optimistic last summer when I wrote in a column dedicated to the 300th anniversary of the Battle of Poltava that IKEA had triumphed .
The victor was actually Kafka .
The operating system
Corruption is irrational : its very existence is fatal for a state .
This makes it an ideal accompaniment to the realm of the absurd , its operating system .
You do n't have to understand how it works , but it is has a very convenient function which any idiot can grasp .
Press the button and you get a result .
Survival in such a state depends on not looking for sense .
If you do , then any acquaintance with the news bulletins in the Russian internet soon turns into a psychedelic bad trip .
You experience a veritable avalanche of negative emotions : fear , horror , shock , outrage but , try as you will , you cannot find a cause - effect link :
« Managers at the State Bank VTB have run a scam which has robbed the country and the shareholders of hundreds of millions of dollars .
One person has been dismissed . »
« Telman Ismailov , the disgraced ' king of pirated goods ' has returned to Russia .
He ' got in ' via President Kadyrov of Chechnya .
A new ' Cherkizon ' [ Cherkizovsky market , site of a recent scandal ed. ] is already under construction on the outskirts of Moscow » .
« In the absence of a legally defined crime General Vladimir Shamanov , commander of the elite Russian Airborne Troops ( VDV ) , will not be prosecuted .
The general attempted to interfere with the work of the officer investigating the case against his son in law , a criminal boss with the nickname Boulder who is on the international wanted list .
The general brought in two detachments of his VDV special purpose forces to deal with the police officer .
The case has been closed , as Shamanov explained , because he himself subsequently cancelled the order for the arrest of the investigating officer . »
There are thousands of such reports .
It could be that they are all edited by one person – some aged writer from the „ Oberiuty ” , Russian Absurdist school of the 1920s .
The trance - like feeling engendered by the streams of such information is reinforced by the Orwellian oxymorons in the speeches of the higher echelons : « conservative modernisation » , « sovereign democracy » , « Parliament is not the place for discussions » .
These oxymorons regularly force their way into our consciousness , increasing the feeling of disorientation and existential weightlessness enabling one to accept without question the most fantastic and contradictory information from on high .
Which is why no one is surprised to hear that « United Russia » received 102 % of the votes ?
How can anyone be surprised when the title of chief liberal democrat has been held for the last 20 years by Vladimir Zhirinovsky [ leader of the Lib Dem Party of Russia ed. ] ?
Another typical absurdist politician is the environmentalist Oleg Mitvol whose activities are a succession of paradoxes in the spirit of Lewis Carroll .
The most sinister oxymoron of all is the term « law enforcement agencies » .
They are organised crime .
« This could be a Kafka story » is how the American businessman William ( Bill ) Browder begins his video message on YouTube .
Some years ago 3 investigating officers from the Central Directorate of Internal Affairs embezzled 200 million USD from the State Budget .
They were assisted in this by several firms which had been illegally « seized » from the American , who was then denied entry into Russia .
He hired the lawyer Sergei Magnitsky to state the case for fraud in the courts .
« New Times » recounts how another pair of investigating officers used a bribe of 6 million USD to get Magnitsky put in prison .
He was held there illegally for a year and died in agony in solitary confinement .
There was an international outcry .
Prison bosses were sacked .
Browder , who is well known in the West , said on the BBC World programme Hard Talk : « I do n't recommend anyone to invest in Russia » and many people with money probably heeded his words .
The two investigating officers who arrested Magnitsky are still working for the good of their country .
The journalist Olga Romanova told « New Times » that it was these same two who had been « contracted » to institute proceedings against her husband Alexei Kozlov .
The client had , according to Romanova , spent 8 million dollars on it .
One of the officers , a woman , personally demanded 1500 ( USD naturally ) from the journalist to ensure that her husband was not put away .
He was sent down for 8 years , actually on the very day that the President called for a halt to the « terrorising » of businesses .
The man behind the contract should also be mentioned , though indirectly : he 's a senator , whose name is better not said aloud .
People who have done this too often are now six foot under or behind bars .
But , to return to the officers who stole 200 million USD from the budget i.e. from you and me and are assumed to have been the paymasters in the Magnitsky case .
They are big time tough guys , Russian style – it's not for nothing that these men , like Russian folk heroes , come in threes .
The magazine « Ogonyok » reminded us that four years ago all three ( one for all and all for one ) were named in an extortion case .
The sum was 20 million dollars , a businessman was kidnapped and his wife and children threatened .
A classic of the genre .
The businessman was freed in a special operation .
He said that the criminal guarding him described his bosses as « the scourge of the Presidential Administration with the right to accept bribes of any size » .
The case was soon hushed up and the liberated businessman was sent to prison , indirectly confirming the truth of the guard 's words .
Last week « Vedomosti » published the news that this inseparable threesome had been promoted to the central management structure of the Ministry of the Interior .
I should n't be at all surprised if they were awarded something like the « Scourges of Russia » there .
It 's no longer just « absurd » , but more like a really tough Dostoevsky trip .
However , strange as it may seem , it 's the limits of moral degeneration in the police that could save this country ( not so sure about the state ) .
At some point the absurd ( something contradicting common sense ) reaches a critical point and becomes arrant nonsense i.e. madness .
The state versus the people
The slaughter carried out by Major Denis Yevsyukov was one such turning point .
Shooting harmless shoppers in a supermarket is not just a contradiction of common sense , but a complete abnegation of it .
It was 100 % schizophrenia , which is why it seemed so particularly horrific .
As if in response to the command « Fire ! » , the passive stage of degeneration has moved to the active and a real war has been unleashed on the Russian people .
Now we hear every day that people in uniform have killed someone , robbed them , run them down in a car or raped them .
For me personally the apotheosis was the statement from a court : « There followed the interrogation of Roman Potemkin , former CID officer of the Local Police Dept , who took part in the arrest of Denis Yevsyukov .
The witness was brought to the court in handcuffs , as he himself has been under investigation for extortion since October . »
This is effectively the collapse of the law enforcement system .
As often happens , the individual madness of one man , Yevsyukov , contains the iron logic of a social process .
The system should have gone ballistic .
The uniformed services in a healthy state , as Lenin wrote all that time ago , are machines of oppression unquestioningly carrying out orders from above .
As machines do n't ( and should n't ) have a brain and the commands do n't come in every day , their daily life is strictly regulated by instructions and rules .
In any country these resemble the human robot technology rules of Isaac Asimov : « Law 1 : a robot cannot harm a person or through his inaction permit harm to be caused to a person .
Law 2 : a robot must obey all orders from its master , except in cases when these orders contravene Law 1 » .
The machine starts breaking down when the master 's orders go dramatically against the laws of robot technology .
There 's a short blip , after which more than two million malfunctioning robocops embark on a reign of terror against the population of the country .
Those very few who saw « Space Odyssey 2001 » to the end will remember how sadly this duality ended for the commander of HAL - 9000 .
The machine started killing people and had to be destroyed .
It 's strange , but did the ruling elite really think the law could be broken selectively ?
That while some representatives of the state are breaking things up , corporate raiding , racketeering and wrecking , others ( like complete idiots ) will be honestly fulfilling their part of the social contract ?
Falsehood gone mad has infiltrated the machine of state from top to bottom , poisoning the minds of the junior and middle ranks .
Our police today is a huge army of bad lieutenants , capable at any moment of turning into mad majors .
Incidentally , Yevgeni Chichvarkin's [ founder of the largest Russian mobile phone retailer Yevroset ed. ] blog carried a very convincing account of how Major Yevsyukov finally went completely mad .
On the eve of the massacre the local police department « Tsaritsyno » , of which Yevsyukov was in charge , was literally besieged by investigating officers from the « K » Directorate .
That would be the same people that once confiscated a huge delivery of mobile phones and then tried to sell them on illegally .
They got caught and now it was pay - back time .
These officers arrived at the police department to collect compromising documents relating to the case of Andrei Vlaskin , a Yevroset employee .
They tried to force members of the local police department to confess that the Vlaskin case , which they were running , had been ordered by Chichvarkin .
Yevsyukov was put under pressure .
Then , on that unfortunate evening there was a ring at the door .
The major went green and started staring into space .
Then he talked to his flowers , put on his coat , took his pistol and left .
A short blip .
We all know what followed .
The people versus the state
When the absurd transmogrified into the lunatic , the system activated the command to self - destruct .
The Castle , impregnable from outside , starts collapsing from inside .
Two eagle heads tear into each other , only feathers fly .
But , strangely enough , the stronger the entropy in the state , the faster everything disintegrates and the easier it becomes to breathe .
As if there 's more air .
I think that society has lost its fear : the people perceive the government 's inability to keep control of itself as a sign of weakness .
Such a state cannot have enough strength for repression .
The animal nips of the enraged system have woken people from their hypnosis .
Fear and apathy have been replaced by rage .
The 19th century anarchist Mikhail Bakunin wrote : « There is nothing more dangerous for personal morality than the habit of giving orders » .
When power degenerates one wants to be above it and to oppose cynicism with dignity , moral degeneration with composure and humanity .
The libertarian philosopher Murray Bookchin called this the « organic renewal of society » .
The beginnings of the process are already in evidence .
Before people only went to demonstrations when the bulldozer was getting near their house .
Now it 's almost become quite fashionable to express one 's protest and people have started intervening on each other 's behalf .
Two weeks ago a drunken policeman in a Merc knocked down a woman at a bus stop .
Just one of the regular brainstorms among the uniformed services who have taken leave of their senses .
How did these representatives of authority behave ?
The policeman at the wheel could n't say a word and the uniformed man sitting next to him jumped out of the car and ran away .
Then colleagues from the Basmanny district police station were called in .
They and the traffic police tried to hush the whole matter up .
How did people behave ?
Three senior bank managers , who had by chance witnessed the accident , gave the woman first aid and summoned an ambulance .
When they noticed the police taking the number plates off their car , they rang the press .
It was only because of the fuss made by the journalists that the Prosecutor 's Office knew anything about the accident .
A major row developed .
Heads rolled again , as if new ones wo n't grow again just like the old ones .
It was a small victory over the system .
Now the internet is full of cross-postings about a car accident in Lenin Prospect .
People are looking for witnesses so as to prove that the oil magnates are in cahoots with the traffic police , trying to offload the blame on to the victims of the horrific accident .
The very next day the rapper Noize MC wrote an angry composition « Mercedes S666 » in support of the protest .
And it worked : witnesses came forward .
Just like last May when the computer programmer Alexei Shumm went on LiveJournal to find witnesses to his wife 's death .
She too was knocked down – on a pedestrian crossing by a police sergeant in a Subaru .
She was six months pregnant .
It was a hit and run .
The police never stop .
About a month ago a drunken police investigator knocked down and killed a woman on a zebra crossing .
He tried to run away .
The other day he was given a suspended ( !!!) sentence .
State madness can only be opposed when the critical faculties of its citizens have been awakened .
Then , like Macmurphy in One Flew over the Cuckoo 's Nest , one can say with a clear conscience « Well , I tried . »
That a people gets the government it deserves is an odious lie .
At times of great difficulty simple people , who are not damaged by the « habit of giving orders » do n't react in a dog eats dog way , they extend a helping hand .
The further a person is away from power , the better he is .
I have seen this for myself in far away Ural villages built by lumberjacks before the Revolution .
These villages ' link with civilisation was the only one - track railway in the country .
Five years ago the authorities decided to tear down the villages and pull up the one - track railway .
People who had been born and grown up in the forests were offered a flat in a high - rise block on the outskirts of the regional centre .
First the trains stopped going there , so food and pensions were not able to get through .
There were people in the villages who had n't seen money for several years .
They baked their bread , fed their cattle , shot game in the hunting season and wanted only one thing : for the state to leave them in peace .
When their electricity was turned off , they used locally improvised materials to build their own hydroelectric station on the river .
I have travelled a fair amount around these villages .
As a rule the spectacle of total degradation is depressing , but the people who lived in these autonomous forest villages were completely different .
The men were strong – their children had grown up and they were determined to die in the place where they were born .
In spite of the hard living conditions , their wives had somehow managed to remain neat and womanly .
Doors were not locked here , as there had been no thieving in these forests for many years .
People moved from one village to another in railcars , a cross between « Minsk » motorcyles and wagons , on a narrow gauge railway , a construction that was as exotic as it was dangerous .
I was told confidentially that one of the men was on probation .
Representatives of the regional administration had come to take up the railway and he had fired a warning shot and then one at their feet .
When we were getting ready to leave , this man said , as he stroked his double - barrelled shotgun , « Just let them try to poke their noses in here .
We 're hunters .
We all have guns .
And licences for them .
We 'll chase them into the taiga , like rabbits . »
These people were full of dignity .
You do n't often see people like that in the cities .
Once the « repression machine » no longer inspires fear , the age old antipathy between the Russian and his government resurfaces .
The philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev wrote that « Russia is the least governable country in the world .
Anarchy is a manifestation of the Russian spirit and has been an essential part of the make up of our extremists , both left - and right - wing .
The Slavophiles and Dostoevsky are essentially anarchists like Bakunin , Kropotkin or Tolstoy » .
History has proved that all imperialists and supporters of Russian autocracy are the enemies of simple people .
We have interests which are diametrically opposed : « the state becomes stronger , the people grow feeble » .
It was Vasily Klyuchevsky who established this reverse dependency and nothing has changed since then .
The group Lumen , which is extremely popular among teenagers , sings « I love my country so much , but I hate the state . »
« Times a hundred » , as lovers of this song would say .
And you can't express it better than that .
What is most interesting is that people working in the public sector are also anti-state in their hearts .
If you talk to any policeman or civil servant off the record , you will find levels of resentment , disillusionment and Jacobinism that the classical anarchists could only have dreamed of .
The ruling elite , the masters of life , also think about the prosperity of the state , but it 's not a high priority for them , as they hide behind patriotic rhetoric for the sake of carrying out the daily ritual of the absurd .
When the time is right , they will scarper to their Antibes or Marbella .
Apparently the prime minister 's daughters live in Germany or Switzerland – wherever they are , they 're certainly not in Russia .
He is not , after all , the enemy of his own children .

VideoCast Maintenance
VideoCast will be undergoing scheduled maintenance on Saturday , Oct 3 , starting at 9 AM EDT UTC - 04:00 .
During this time , Past Events will be unavailable .
The maintenance is expected to last several hours .
We apologize for the inconvenience .
GREENPEACE has accused the world 's leading food and drinks company , Nestlé , of having an ad featuring an office worker eating orang - utan fingers removed from YouTube .
The video , which was launched overnight , parodies Nestle 's KitKat ads and shows an unwitting office worker taking a break to enjoy a KitKat but instead bites into an orang - utan ’s finger , causing blood to stream down his face .
The video can be viewed at www.greenpeace.org/kitkat.
“ Nestlé today admitted that they have been using palm oil from the destroyed rainforest homes of the last orang - utans in some of their products , but having our video removed proves they are still trying to hide that fact , " Greenpeace Head of Campaigns , Steve Campbell , said .
" This is an apparent attempt to silence the truth that some of its most popular brands use palm oil from destroyed rainforests and peatlands .
“ We ’ll continue to put the video up on other websites until Nestlé removes all rainforest destroying palm oil from its supply chain . "
Protests took place overnight across Europe at Nestlé ’s headquarters and factories in the UK , Germany and the Netherlands after the company 's admission to using palm oil .
They called on Nestlé staff to urge the company to stop using palm oil from the world ’s worst suppliers in Indonesia .
Globally , Nestlé is a major consumer of palm oil .
In the last three years , its annual use has almost doubled , with 320,000 tonnes of palm oil going into a range of products , including KitKat , according to Greenpeace .

The current number one non-fiction best seller , Michael Lewis ’ The Big Short : Inside the Doomsday Machine , addresses the question “ Who got it right ?
Who saw the real estate market for the black hole it would become , and eventually made billions from that perception ? ”
It is hailed as meeting the usual Lewis high standards of engaging story - telling and character depiction in combination with making a complex arena accessible to lay readers .
Lewis ’ tale is neat , plausible to a mass market audience fed a steady diet of subprime markets stupidity and greed , and incomplete in critical ways that render his account fundamentally misleading .
It ’s almost too bad the book ’s so readable , because a lot of people will mistake readability for accuracy , and it ’s a pity that Lewis , being a brand name author , has been given a free pass by big - name media like 60 Minutes ( old people ) and The Daily Show ( young people ) to sell to an audience of tens of millions a version of the financial crisis that just wo n’t stand up – not if we ’re really trying to get to the heart of the matter , rather than simply wishing to be entertained by breezy well - told stories that provide a bit of easy - to - digest instruction without challenging conventional wisdom .
The shortcomings of Lewis ’ superficially pleasing work bear out the concerns of traditional reporters who were discomforted by the success of Truman Capote ’s In Cold Blood : that turning a news report into a work of literature ran the risk of fitting facts to the Procrustean bed of a tidy , satisfying narrative .
The Big Short focuses on four clusters of subprime short sellers , all early to figure out this “ greatest trade ever ” and thus supposedly deserving of star treatment , bypassing the best known figure in this arena , John Paulson .
The anchor is Steve Eisman , a blunt , unintentionally abrasive curmudgeon and money manager , who in his former life as an analyst put sell ratings on all the Gen One subprime lenders of the 1990s .
Not only does most of the description of market chicanery and cluelessness come through him , but Eisman also serves as the main vehicle for depicting the shorts as noble opponents to a feckless industry .
Eisman ’s realization that the industry he once covered , consumer finance , was out to “ fuck the poor ” , led a boyhood Republican to become , per Lewis , “ Wall Street ’s first socialist . ”
Eisman , plus his fellow colorful shorts , evoke comforting cultural cliches : Horatio Alger , Robin Hood , David v. Goliath ( or as Eisman , would prefer to see it , Spiderman v. Carnage ) , Polonius ’
“ To thine own self be true ” in modern garb , and of course , the classic Campbellian hero ’s journey : a quest in the wilderness producing superior insight .
To make Lewis’ Manichean perspective stick , he has to omit vital facts that would lead to a more accurate , but complicated , less crowd - pleasing tale .
Lewis repeatedly and incorrectly charges that no one on Wall Street , save his merry band of shorts , understood what was happening , because everyone blindly relied on ratings and failed to make their own assessment .
By implication , the entire mortgage industry ignored the housing bubble and the frothiness of the subprime market .
This is simply false ( although with Bernanke and the persistently cheerleading US business media largely missing this story at the time , the “ whocouldanode ” defense is treated more seriously than it should be ) .
Many people in the credit markets were aware that the risks were increasing in the subprime and residential real estate markets .
Every mortgage industry conference during this period had panels on this topic , every credit committee considered it throughout 2005 - 07 .
Lewis completely ignores the most vital player , the one who was on the other side of the subprime short bets .
The notion that “ it ’s a CDO ” is daunting enough to stop the non-financial reader in his tracks .
The author is remarkably uncurious about who the end investors were for CDOs .
Listen up .
Who really was on the other side of the shorts ’ trades is the important question .
And the section in which Lewis finally gets around to that ( more than halfway thought the book , reader sympathies to his key actors now firmly established ) hides the fundamental flaw in his narrative in plain sight :
… whenever Eisman sets out to explain the origins of the subprime crisis , he ’d start with his dinner with Wing Chau [ a CDO manager ] .
Only now did he fully appreciate the central importance of the so - called mezzanine CDO – the CDO composed mainly of BBB rated subprime mortgage bonds – and its synthetic component , the CDO composed entirely of credit default swaps on triple - B rated subprime mortgage bonds .
“ You have to understand this , ” he says .
“ This was the engine of doom . ” …
All by himself , Chau generated vast demand for the riskiest slices of subprime mortgage bonds .
This demand had led inevitably to the supply of new home loans , as material for the bonds .
Yves here .
It was n’t all by himself , as we will see soon :
…. the sorts of investors who handed money to Wing Chau , and thus bought the triple A rated traches of CDOs – German banks , Taiwanese insurance companies , Japanese farmer ’s unions , European pension funds , and in general , entities more or less required to invest in AAA rated bonds - did precisely so because they were supposed to be foolproof , impervious to losses , and unnecessary to monitor of think about very much .
Yves again .
Note that these are the international equivalent of widows and orphans , but because they are exotic , presumably elicit less sympathy .
But as we will discuss soon , by this point in the tale , January 2007 , that list of prototypical chumps was out of date , which has further implications for the real significance of this trade .
Starting in mid-2005 , when the creation of a standardized credit default swap on mortgages made it feasible to take large subprime short positions , a system quickly developed that overrode the normal checks and balances of the market and allowed the unscrupulous to 1 .
Profit from making bad loans , and 2 .
Force the creation of more bad loans , which would both increase their profits and make it more likely that their bet would be successful .
Most mortgage industry participants assumed there was a degree of rationality that would constrain reckless behavior .
And this belief was not as naïve as it seems now .
Past lending excesses , such as the late 1980s LBO craze , even the savings and loan crisis , had died under their own weight .
The 1990s subprime boom ended precisely because investors started to shun the risky slices of CDOs , which made selling subprime bonds unattractive ( CDOs had been a necessary outlet for selling less desired tranches of subprime bonds ) , which choked off demand for subprime loans .
A critical element of how this new system operated was by sending false signals to market participants .
Imagine you are a doctor .
You have a well established patient with a known heart problem and high cholesterol .
He comes to his regular checkup looking simply wretched , with bad color , low energy , and complains of not feeling well .
You immediately run all of your regular ( thorough ) tests , plus some additional ones related to his new symptoms .
Yet all the results come back within normal bounds , save his known problems , and there you see no meaningful change from his previous history .
You ask him to come in quarterly , rather than annually .
He continues to look even worse , yet his test results continue to show nothing more amiss than before he started to look so awful .
He drops dead of massive coronary blockage .
Now in our little fable , what happened was that someone saw the patient on the street and recognized he was a prime candidate for heart failure .
He takes out ten life insurance policies on the patient and finds a way to alter the test results so everything looked normal .
The doctor , conditioned to trust the tests , believes them rather than his lyin ’ eyes , and fails to take action .
Tom Adams , who has spent his career in the mortgage business , and was an executive at one of the major monoline insurers during the subprime mania , explains :
Starting in 2005 , following the introduction of credit defaults swaps on mortgages , the spread for lending to risky borrowers fell .
Normally , when risk becomes mispriced like this , the right approach is to step back and wait for sanity to return .
And many cash investors did just that .
The problem this time was the market did n’t correct .
By 2006 , many companies in the risk business received pressure , in one form or another ( investors , rating agencies , etc. ) , about how they were missing out on revenue opportunities .
The market was booming , yet they were on the sidelines .
No one I encountered wanted to take subprime mortgage risk ( or Alt A mortgage ) risk directly because the risks were considered too high and the premiums were way too low .
In a normal environment , this should have led to the mortgage market grinding to a halt – since no one wanted the BBB portions of any subprime or Alt A deal .
Hundreds of people at conferences , in meetings and over the phone lines argued that the market for subprime was acting irrationally .
Refusing to participate in the market at all would , in retrospect , have been the only solution , but this is easier said than done .
A lot of people were told : “ You ’re the expert in this area , find a way to make money in it – everyone else is . ”
How did this happen ?
By 2005 , “ cash ” or traditional investors , were leery of subprime risk .
Yet the interaction of increasingly synthetic CDO issuance , credit default swap spreads , and the resulting artificially low yields on BBB subprime bonds sent a powerful signal that the subprime patient was somehow still healthy .
Presumably , a lot of someones were highly confident they could find gold within what looked to most like certain subprime dreck .
Back to Lewis :
The whole point of the CDO was to launder a lot of subprime mortgage market risk that the firms had been unable to place straightforwardly …..
“ He ‘ managed ’ the CDOs , ” said Eisman , “ but he managed what ? ….
I thought , ‘ You prick , you do n’t give a fuck about the investors in this thing . …
“ Then he said something that blew my mind , ” Eisman tells me .
“ He says , ‘ I love guys like you who short my market .
Without you , I do n’t have anything to buy . ’ ” Say that again .
“ He says to me , ‘ The more excited that you get that you are right , the more trades you ’ll do , and the more trades you do , the more product for me . ” …
That is when Steve Eisman finally understood the madness of the machine …
There were n’t enough Americans with shitty credit taking out loans to satisfy investors ’ appetite for the end product .
Wall Street needed his bets to synthesize more of them …
“ They were creating them out of whole cloth .
One hundred times over !
That ’s why the losses in the financial system are so much greater than the just the subprime loans .
That ’s when I realized they needed us to keep the machine running . ”
Yves again .
So what does Eisman do , our hero , vocal advocate of the poor and exploited , who now ( along with Lewis ) indisputably knows that he is an integral part of the problem ?
“ Whatever that guy is buying , I want to short it . ”
Lippman took it as a joke , but Eisman was completely serious .
“ Greg , I want to short his paper .
Sight unseen . ”
Eisman recognizes that the subprime market is a disaster waiting to happen , a monstrous fire hazard that , once lit , will engulf the housing market and financial firms .
Yet he continues to throw Molotov cocktails at it .
Eisman is no noble outsider .
He is a willing , knowing co-conspirator .
Even worse , he and the other shorts Lewis lionizes did n’t simply set off the global debt conflagration , they made the severity of the crisis vastly worse .
So it was n’t just that these speculators were harmful , and Lewis gave them a free pass .
He failed to clue in his readers that the actions of his chosen heroes drove the demand for the worst sort of mortgages and turned what would otherwise have been a “ contained ” problem into a systemic crisis .
The subprime market would have died a much earlier , much less costly death absent the actions of the men Lewis celebrates .
They did n’t simply keep the market going well past its sell - by date , they were the moving force behind otherwise inexplicable , superheated demand for the very worst sort of mortgages .
His “ heroes ” were aggressively trying to find toxic waste to wager against .
But unlike short positions in heavily - regulated equity markets , these wagers , the credit default swaps , had real economy effects .
The use of CDOs masked the nature of their wagers and brought unwitting BBB protection sellers to the table , which lowered CDS spreads ( and as in corporate bond markets , CDS dictate , via arbitrage , interest rates for bond issues ) and pushed down the interest rates on the cash bonds backed by those same loans , which in turn made it perversely attractive for lenders to generate mortgages with the worst characteristics .
And it is n’t surprising that weak - credit borrowers were enticed by this once in a lifetime “ opportunity ” .
Lewis misses an even more stunning part of this picture .
His colorful band , although engaged in damaging conduct , were comparatively small fry , beneficiaries of the strategies of even more clever and lethal actors .
Chapter 9 of ECONNED : How Unenlightened Self Interest Undermined Democracy and Corrupted Capitalism discusses how a single hedge fund , Magnetar , which has heretofore been missed in every major account of the subprime crisis , was arguably the biggest player in driving toxic subprime demand through its program of creating hybrid CDOs ( largely consisting of credit default swaps , but also including cash bonds by design ) .
Magnetar constructed a strategy that was a trader ’s wet dream , enabling it to show a thin profit even as it amassed ever larger short bets ( the cost of maintaining the position was a vexing problem for all the other shorts , from John Paulson on down ) and profit impressively when the market finally imploded .
Both market participant estimates and repeated , conservative analyses indicate that Magnetar ’s CDO program drove the demand for between 35 % and 60 % of toxic subprime bond demand .
And this trade was lauded and copied by proprietary trading desks in 2006 .
Apparently unbeknowst to Lewis , his shorts were riding the slipstream of Magnetar ’s trade , with a significant percentage of their credit default swaps coming from its and its imitators ’
CDOs .
And who stepped in on the other side of these short bets ?
Who were the investors in the CDOs ?
For the riskier slices of the CDO , it was a bizarre combination : chumps , almost entirely foreign , and supposedly sophisticated correlation traders , ( Lewis discusses one at length , Howie Hubler of Morgan Stanley ) .
Across the board , they suffered spectacular losses .
But as Lewis stresses , the ruse at the heart of this great trade was that the shorts were betting against BBB subprime trash , which when packaged into CDOs , had roughly 80 % rated AAA .
So who were the fools taking toxic BBB risk for mere AAA returns ?
For the most part , the dealers themselves .
Without going into mind - numbing detail , the apparent risklessness of an AAA instrument hedged by an AAA counterparty ( in this case , a monoline ) substantially reduced the capital a dealer needed to support a position .
As a result , holding AAA CDOs hedged by AAA guarantors was treated , on a profit and loss basis on the relevant dealing desks , as vastly more attractive than finding investors to take the other side of the trade .
In other words , this was massive gaming of the banks ’ own bonus systems .
So what was the dealers ’ big mistake ?
When the subprime market started hemorrhaging losses , the Magnetars and the smaller subprime shorts wanted to be paid on their successful bets .
For the AAA investors , that meant ponying up cash .
They went to the monolines , only to be rebuffed .
Even though the insurers would likely have to pay out on their subprime guarantees , the provisions of their contracts assured would be a VERY long time , often decades , before their check would be in the mail .
So the dealers themselves , due to their own poor incentives and inattention , were faced with unexpected losses and caught in a liquidity crisis .
They suddenly had to cough up lots of money to Lewis ’ supposed heroes .
Wall Street took multiple hits : writedowns , downgrades , and a cash drain when funding was increasingly scarce .
So who was ultimately on the other side of these lionized trades ?
When Wall Street could no longer pay the Magnetars , the biggest chump of all , taxpayers in the US and abroad stepped into the breach .
We are the ones bearing the enormous cost of state sponsored bailouts and real economy damage , the wreckage this “ greatest trade ever ” hath wrought .
Lewis ’ need to anchor his tale in personalities results in a skewed misreading of the subprime crisis and why and how it got as bad as it did .
The group of short sellers he celebrates were minor - leaguers compared to the likes of Goldman Sachs , Deutsche Bank and John Paulson .
But no one on the short side of these trades , large or small , should be seen as any kind of a stalwart hero and defender of capitalism .
Circumstances converged to create a perfect storm of folly on the buy side , beginning with essentially fraudulent mortgage originations at ground level , which the short - sellers – whether trading at the multimillion or multibillion dollars level – took advantage of .
That they walked away with large profits may be enviable , but there was nothing valiant about it .
In the end , Main Street , having been desolated by a mortgage - driven housing bust , now found itself the buyer of last resort of Wall Street ’s garbage .
Lewis ’ desire to satisfy his fan base ’s craving for good guys led him to miss the most important story of our age : how a small number of operators used a nexus of astonishing leverage and camouflaged risk to bring the world financial system to its knees and miraculously walked away with their winnings .
These players are not the ugly ducklings of Lewis ’ fairy tale ; they are merely ugly .
Whether for his own profit or by accident , Lewis has denied the public the truth .

Where there is an open mind , there will always be a frontier .
– Charles F. Kettering
If you are a die - hard Glenn Beck fan ( like I was ) , please keep a very open mind as you read this .
Our freedom depends on it .
I know too many “ ex - Glenn Beck fans ” who are using the wrong approach in attempting to show you why Glenn is more of a threat to the American people than he is a truth - teller or savior .
I do n’t entirely fault them because I understand their frustration as well as their “ sense of urgency ” .
The simple fact of the matter is that if “ We The People ” do not begin to think for ourselves , and stop the conformity , we will continue to be misled , and we will get nowhere in our fight to regain our freedom and liberties .
In my quest to understand how our country has gotten to where it is , I found Glenn Beck .
Not only did he seem to have the answers , he was also providing me with excellent information about people and groups ( the czars , ACORN , SEIU , Andy Stern , Anita Dunn , etc. ) who surround and influence our president and our policies .
I was sure Glenn had stumbled on some pretty beefy information which offered a great explanation as to why our country was going to hell in a hand basket .
For months , I never missed a Glenn Beck show .
At the same time , I continued my relentless research on the internet for as much “ truth ” as I could get my hands on and I ’m convinced this allowed me to keep a healthy perspective on “ truth ” .
One day while watching Glenn – a warning signal sounded in my head .
In realizing just how massive of a following that Glenn was gaining , I cautioned myself to be careful and to keep an open mind .
As indicated by history as well as the bible , I understood that anyone who has the ability to gain such a mass following of people also has the ability to lead that mass astray .
IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY DECEIVE – YOU MUST USE TRUTH
You cannot gain a mass following by telling lies .
In order to deceive , You MUST use the truth … or at the very least , what might be acknowledged as truth by the masses ( more on this later ) .
The majority who align themselves with Glenn Beck consider themselves to be “ conservatives . ”
If you fall into this category , you do not follow CNN or MSNBC because “ you are able to see the lies . ”
You ca n’t conform to their viewpoint because there is n’t enough truth in their message to keep your attention .
CNN or MSNBC cannot deceive you because you see no truth in their message .
Deception can only deceive if it looks somewhat like the real thing .
Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive
BEFORE YOU UNDERSTAND “ HOW ” – YOU MUST UNDERSTAND “ WHY ”
Many of you will refuse to believe that you are being deceived by Glenn Beck because you cannot fathom any reason why he would do this .
Without considering the big picture , this is understandable .
Because of this , you have rationalized that the “ Beck Bashers ” must either be jealous of his fame and fortune or they are just “ idiot liberals . ”
Before we can begin to explore “ how we are being deceived ” , we must first ask the question , “ Why ? ” The short answer is controlled opposition , and this is where it is crucial for many of you to gain and keep an open mind !
Some of you reading this already know that the truth ( whole , entire truth ) will never be televised .
But , as I temporarily did , you are holding on to the hope that somehow , Beck / FOX managed to break free of this rule .
You may even think that FOX has discovered that there is more money in telling the truth – so they are going to continue to do it – until the Obama Administration decides to silence them .
If you believe there is any threat of FOX being shut down or of Beck being taken off the air – let me guarantee – this will never happen .
Why ?
Because Glenn Beck is the most valuable player on Team Obama than anyone else .
Why ?
Because the elites behind the New World Order who own “ Team Obama ” also own all of mainstream media .
If you have questions about the New World Order , the elite bankers , the Federal Reserve – you can find more information on this “ Grand Delusion ” Blog .
If you know anything about “ reverse psychology ” – you would know that the fake little war between the Obama Administration and FOX News did nothing more than to drive more people to FOX News to see what all the fuss was about .
Borderline liberals flocked to FOX News because they believed that “ if Obama was trying to silence FOX , they must be telling the truth . ”
Oh – how easily fooled we are !
OUR OUTRAGE = A MASSIVE , PEACEFUL UPRISING / REVOLUTION ?
UMM .
NO .
How many of us are opposed to the way our government is running our country ?
How many are opposed to the war ?
How many are opposed to the Federal Reserve ?
How many of us are frustrated , fed - up , sick and tired or afraid of what our future holds ?
How many of us now view our government as the enemy ?
How many of us understand that in order to defeat any enemy , we need to think like the enemy ?
What are they thinking ?
The best way to control the opposition is to lead it ourselves – Vladimir Lenin
Do n’t underestimate the powers that be .
Do n’t underestimate those in control .
They full well know that the only way they can reach their goal for the New World Order and One World Government is by controlling the opposition and making sure that the truth is kept from us .
In fact , their biggest fear is that we will learn the truth because the truth WILL set us free !
What chance would they have if we all rose up tomorrow against tyranny , against them ?
They would n’t have a chance !
There are way too many of us .
So do n’t you think they have the foresight , the power , the money , the influence needed in order to carry out controlling the opposition by leading it ?
Yes !
Of course they do !
NOW THAT YOU UNDERSTAND “ WHY ” – LET ’S TALK ABOUT “ HOW ”
One good way to determine if someone is “ controlled opposition ” is to not just look at what they are saying – but , more importantly , look at what they are not saying !
TACTIC #1 – CONTROLLED TRUTH
You will get just enough truth , but you will never get all of it , for if you did , you would surely rise up .
Look at the “ Federal Reserve . ”
We know just enough about it to know we do n’t like it .
Many of us want it audited and / or abolished .
What did Henry Ford say about the Federal Reserve ?
It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system , for if they did , I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning .
– Henry Ford
Glenn
Beck recently put together a very nice documentary called , “ Live Free or Die . ”
While much truth was exhibited in his documentary , he stopped short at revealing the whole truth .
Do n’t you think it would have been important to know that Prescott Bush ( George W. Bush ’s grand - father ) played a major role in funding Hitler ’s rise to power ?
If Beck wanted to arm you with the whole truth , he would not have left this information out .
Especially if it is “ his calling ” to warn you about our government and what they are capable of !
TACTIC # 2 & 3 – MIND BENDING and DISINFORMATION
Beck instructs you to “ Question Boldly ” – but only those questions that he approves .
Do n’t you dare question 9/11 !
How many times has Beck said that the 9/11 Truther ’s only account for 5 % of the population ?
The truth is that the majority of the population question 9/11 and one third of the population believe that our government was involved .
Even if you are as dead set against the 9/11 Truth Movement as Beck claims to be – do n’t you deserve the truth about the number of people who question 9/11 ?
Should n’t you be told about the 50 Senior Military , Intelligence and Government Officials who question the 9/11 Commission Report ?
Should n’t we discuss Senator Max Cleland – Former member of the 9/11 Commission , who resigned in December 2003 saying “ I , as a member of the [ 9/11 ]
Commission , cannot look any American in the eye …
It is a national scandal … this White House wants to cover [ 9/11 ] up . ”
Are you asking yourself why you did n’t know these things ?
The reason is because “ they do n’t want you to know . ”
You will not find the truth on mainstream news , not even FOX .
If you are led to believe that only a small , kooky minority question 9/11 , or anything else for that matter – you probably wo n’t research it for yourself , but if you knew that the majority question it , you would either stand with the majority or spend more of your own time looking at the data and form your own opinions .
So , if the majority of the population question 9/11 – why did Glenn Beck attempt to ruin Debra Medina for not disavowing any group questioning 9/11 ?
Seems pretty irrational once you know the truth about the numbers , does n’t it ?
In fact , Debra Medina should have responded , “ Senator Max Cleland , former member of the 9/11 commissioner resigned over a possible cover - up and the majority of the American people have questions about 9/11 – so , in my desire to represent the people , I fully support questioning the 9/11 Commission Report . ”
How many of you , without looking into any data or doing any of your own research are using terms such as “ Truthers ” , “ Birthers ” and “ Tenthers ” and attaching negative connotations to these terms against the groups and experts who have done their research ?
Are you beginning to understand how you are being influenced through mind - bending and disinformation ?

WOLF IN SHEEPS CLOTHING
If someone is placed into a position of amassing a great following for the purpose of controlling and deceiving – they are not going to appear as a wolf .
Glenn
Beck has sparkly blue eyes , a great smile and a wonderful personality .
It is very hard not to like him – even when you understand that he is choosing monetary wealth over the well - being of his fellow man .
Many people believed that Josef Stalin was a good man , handsome with great personality .
Franklin Delano Roosevelt said , “ The world has never seen greater devotion , determination , and self sacrifice , that have been displayed by the Russian people and their armies under the leadership of Marshall Josef Stalin . ”
In total , the estimated number of people killed under Stalin ranges between 10 million to 60 million .
Even Hitler was once loved by the people .
Do n’t think for one second that a charismatic leader cannot lead you astray .
WHAT IS A JUDAS SHEEP ?
Many people are referring to Beck as a “ judas sheep . ”
Here is the meaning :
Sheep are innate followers and very easily led astray .
In New Zealand about 40 million sheep are led to slaughter each year .
A specially selected castrated male sheep aptly called the “ Judas ” sheep leads the unwitting sheep to the killing floor .
Unaware of what is about to happen , the sheep blindly fall in behind the Judas sheep and follow him to their deaths .
IN CLOSING
As I continued to watch Glenn Beck with an open mind , I began to see signs of deception .
I began to see signs of neo-conservatism .
I had n’t even finished my “ Arguing with Idiots ” book .
Issues and actions that were extreme violations of the Constitution and our freedoms and liberties that were discussed all over the internet went for days unmentioned on his program .
If and when they were mentioned , they were not given the attention they deserve .
Some were blown off entirely .
As I dug more and more into the 9/11 Truth Movement and I saw the legitimate questions coming from patriots , our war veterans , our military leaders , 9/11 commission members , aerospace engineers , experts , historians , pilots , architects and engineers , families of those killed , economists , I realized these people were not the “ kooks ” that Beck described .
They were also not “ dangerous ” as Beck described .
I had to ask myself why he would mislead his followers .
Beck even went so far as to say that he “ began hating the families of those who died on 9/11 . ”
Someone who told us to “ Question Boldly ” suddenly had a zero tolerance level for questioning even from families who had more reason than anyone else to question .
I had no choice , in the face of all the evidence , to conclude that Beck is the ultimate deception because he makes the choice to deceive – as opposed to deceiving out of plain old ignorance .
I attribute much of my initial awakening to Glenn Beck – but because I knew better than to give him my complete trust ( I reserve that for God ) – and I knew the importance of continuing to find truth on my own ( as everyone needs to do , especially now ) , I knew when to part ways with him .
That ultimately led to me turning off the TV .
I do not get my news from the TV – because the truth is n’t televised and because you should never be bullied into asking or NOT asking any question .
If Beck were truly “ bucking the system ” – he would have gone the way of Lou Dobbs .
If you want to control the dissent , lead the dissent .

There 've been quite a few horror movie trackers featured on this blog – this includes smaller sites such as the now defunct ScareThe .
Net to leaders in the niche such as The Horror Charnel ( THC ) - if memory serves correct , we even did several invite giveaways for THC sometime back .
If the previously mentioned trackers were not enough to fill your thirst for horror movies , here ’s another one - the site we ’re going to talk about today , Henteles , is another private tracker specializing in horror movies , TV shows and even games with violent content ( yay ! ) .
It ’s a relatively new entrant to this niche but is well worth trying out if you are into Horror , cult and sleaze genres .
With its roots in Hungary , Henteles tracks both Hungarian and English content .
Launched not too long ago , this site has already attracted a reasonable number of registered users – currently there are close to 3500 members which is a pretty good statistic for a niche tracker .
Their torrent index too has grown during the first few weeks since launch and currently Henteles tracks close to 1000 active torrents .
As mentioned above , all indexed torrents on Henteles relate to the Horror genre .
This includes TV shows , movies and horror themed games .
Note that some of the available releases are dubbed in Hungarian – however , you can easily identify English and Hungarian torrents separately by filtering using the categories ( press the ‘ Kategoriak ’ button on browse page to view list of categories ) .
A screenshot of some of the English releases found on Henteles is given below :
Henteles is based on the TBDEV tracker script but it ’s customized to give the site a darker look and feel .
Some of you might find the customizations fitting to a horror tracker but some might find the interface to be cluttered and less organized .
Additionally , interface language defaults to Hungarian and there is no way to change is to English – while non Hungarian users will still manage to navigate the site just fine , it ’d have been nice to have an English language option as well .
Henteles is currently open for registrations .
Assuming they are to remain open till the current max user limit is reached , there are around 4000 free slots remaining .
If you are looking for a new Horror tracker , check this site out .

When its customers claim their Toyota or Lexus vehicles suddenly accelerate , the company is at the ready with teams of technicians that it can deploy rapidly to examine the reports -- and in some cases discredit them .
The teams , dubbed SMART for “ swift market analysis and research team , ” were publicly unveiled by Toyota on Thursday , but have been deployed at least seven times in the last month .
They scored big successes when they helped undermine a recent claim by a San Diego motorist who said his Prius took him on a 20 - minute high - speed ride down the freeway and another by a New York housekeeper who said her Prius flew into a wall even though her foot was on the brake .
Toyota ’s critics say it has every right to dispute inaccurate claims , and its legions of devoted customers have cheered the rigorous response on Internet forums .
The SMART teams are part of a much broader public relations and legal strategy Toyota is using to confront critics , an approach that has toughened in recent weeks .
Toyota is now staking out its position before major scientific investigations into sudden acceleration have gotten started , and before federal officials have completed regulatory reviews .
Last week , federal safety regulators enlisted the government ’s top technical experts to examine the problem .
Critics say the company is acting prematurely and in some cases spreading misinformation .
“ It is a very aggressive and misleading campaign , ” said Clarence Ditlow , executive director of the Center for Auto Safety .
“ Toyota ca n’t win this battle by slinging mud , but they are trying . ”
In at least one case , a SMART inspection backfired , adding ammunition to a lawsuit against the company .
The team discovered that a repair under the recall campaign for sticking accelerator pedals had not been properly completed .
Toyota ’s strategy represents a big change in the last six weeks .
In February , Toyota Chief Executive Akio Toyoda told Congress , “ As the CEO of the company , I will make sure that we will never ever blame the customers going forward . ”
Exactly what that meant is not quite clear , because the company said it now intends to dispute the reports of its customers when it sees something questionable .
“ When we see something that needs addressing , we ’re going to respond , ” company spokesman Mike Michels said .
In some cases , customers have claimed sudden acceleration for mechanical behavior that involves “ normal functions of a vehicle , ” Michels said .
He added , “ We ’re getting a lot of stuff coming out of the woodwork . ”
Auto safety experts said Toyota has every right to defend itself against phony claims , but its approach has led to countercharges that the company is spreading outright falsehoods .
Ditlow is furious over an e-mail Toyota sent to some reporters , a copy of which he provided to The Times , alleging that he was on the payroll of plaintiff attorneys .
Ditlow said that neither he nor his organization takes money from lawyers .
Ditlow said his funding comes from nonprofit foundations , auto insurers , consumers and its publications .
Congressional investigators , meanwhile , complain that Toyota has sent multiple teams of lobbyists after them to sow discord among committee staffers .
Toyota lobbyists are trying to disrupt the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee ’s investigation , a staffer on the committee said .
Toyota has also taken on several congressional witnesses .
David Gilbert , a professor of automotive technology at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale , testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in February that his experiments showed potential flaws in Toyota ’s electronic engine control system .
Two Toyota employees resigned from a board of advisors for Gilbert ’s academic department .
Toyota then hired testing firm Exponent Inc. , which helped the automaker put together a demonstration for the media at Toyota ’s U.S. sales headquarters in Torrance countering Gilbert ’s results point by point .
“ It is unfortunate they felt the need to do that , ” Gilbert said .
“ I did n’t expect Toyota would like what I found , but I was surprised by the magnitude of the response .
What were they trying to prove , that they could squash me like a bug ?
Well , I suppose they could . ”
The attack on Gilbert has worried other academic experts that they could be the next target if they are critical of the company .
“ Most of the academics completely support Gilbert , ” said Michael Pecht , director of an electronics reliability lab at the University of Maryland who has studied sudden acceleration for 10 years .
“ I think that there is a fear in the Toyota Exponent tactics . ”
Sean Kane , president of the consulting firm Safety Research and Strategies , has been another Toyota critic who the company has characterized as an operative of law firms .
Kane claims Toyota backed an online consumer poll that attempted to discredit him .
The poll , a copy of which was provided by Kane , asks a series of questions about Kane , Gilbert and allegedly inaccurate reporting by ABC News .
Embedded in one question , for example , was the statement , “ The American people deserve the truth about the safety of their cars , not biased studies by trial lawyer consultants who stand to make millions suing Toyota . ”
“ We do opinion surveys all the time , ” Toyota spokesman Mike Michels said .
“ We were researching the potential for getting messages out , in particular for our advertising . ”
Meanwhile , the SMART inspections have yielded mixed results .
On March 15 , the company drew dozens of reporters to an event at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego where it was able to cast doubt on claims by James Sikes that his 2008 Prius had suddenly accelerated a week earlier .
The company asserted that the accelerator pedal was working properly and the brake pedal had been repeatedly depressed , implying Sikes did it intentionally to mimic a sudden acceleration event .
Released several days later , the California Highway Patrol report about the incident said nothing about suspected fraud and noted simply that the brakes were burned out .
It said Sikes was examined afterward by emergency medical personnel and found to have a “ very high ” blood pressure and heart rate .
SMART did another inspection last month in Harrison , N.Y. , after a woman reported that the Prius she was driving suddenly accelerated into a wall .
An inspection of the vehicle electronics by Toyota found that the driver never had her foot on the brake in the moments before impact .
But the SMART team may have helped Toyota ’s adversaries on March 12 , when it inspected a 2007 Camry after an alleged sudden acceleration event .
Linda Tang , an Orange County resident who is suing Toyota over alleged defects in the Camry electronics , said her vehicle suddenly accelerated after she had taken it to a dealership for repairs under recall .
Toyota initially did not inspect the vehicle .
It was only after Tang ’s attorney enlisted congressional investigators to contact the Department of Transportation that the inspection was scheduled .
At a sophisticated Toyota facility in Orange County , a large team of company technicians spent nearly seven hours going over the vehicle .
Two federal safety investigators flew in from Washington to oversee the inspection .
They were joined by an automotive electronics expert hired by Tang ’s attorney .
Near the near the end of the day , the Toyota technicians acknowledged a major error .
A shim that was supposed to have been installed in the gas pedal assembly under the recall to prevent sticking was missing , according to federal officials and allegations in Tang ’s suit .
“ It was shocking , ” said William Rosenbluth , the automotive electronics expert who works for Tang ’s attorney , Michael Lewis Kelly .
“ It was n’t there and the paperwork says it was put in . ”
Toyota officials declined to discuss the inspection .

A New Brunswick dentist says his research indicates mouthguards can improve the performance of athletes , and take away their aches and pains .
Dr. Patrick Girouard , of Cap - Pelé , has been testing the theory that the way teeth fit together can affect a person 's posture and centre of gravity , helping better performance and minimize the risk of injury .
Girouard , who is conducting the research as part of his master 's degree at Tufts University in Boston , recalls hearing about the theory during a lecture by one of his mentors about four years ago .
He did n't believe it .
So Girouard , a marathon runner , decided to test it on himself .
He got a mouthguard , anxious to see if it would cure a pain in his right knee .
" I basically took his challenge and went out running , and to my surprise , my knee did n't bother me at all during that run , " he said .
" It was just mind - boggling for me .
It was a revelation at this point . "
That run inspired the research project , said Girouard , who is specializing in craniomandibular pain — discomfort affecting the head and neck .
Moncton test results favourable
" I decided to test this theory after seeing how many athletes have to use pain medication on a regular basis .
I want to find out how to maximize pain - free performance by an athlete 's body using the guards . "
Girouard fit 80 members of the men's and women 's soccer and hockey teams at the University of Moncton with two types of customized mouthguards and used electrodes to track their muscular activity .
" The athletes are quite favourable .
They 're saying that they see a change , they feel a change … .
I 'd say 90 per cent of them have seen a positive change in their posture and their muscular strength , " he said .
" There 's a certain hockey player who had a lot of lower back pain .
Once we fitted him with the mouthguard , his back pain went away . "
Girouard said he has finished collecting his data on the dental appliances and is working on the statistical analysis for his thesis , hoping to develop the perfect mouthguard .
Meanwhile , he continues to use a mouthguard every time he runs and will be wearing one during the Boston Marathon on April 19 , he said .
Mouthguards , which provide a cushion between the upper and lower teeth , are typically worn by athletes to prevent dental injuries during impact - risk sports such as hockey .
They help absorb and dissipate force when the upper and lower jaws bang together .
Although it 's widely believed the devices also protect against concussion , Toronto neurosurgeon Dr. Charles Tator , founder of the injury - prevention organization ThinkFirst Canada , has said there 's no definitive scientific evidence to support that idea .
He said there 's a good chance they do , particularly during hits to the front of the head , in the jaw area .
But he does n't believe they would have much effect on limiting force generated by blows to the side or top of the head .
To make a custom mouthguard , a dentist takes moulds of the upper and lower teeth , and does a bite registration test to ensure a snug , comfortable fit .
Over - the - counter stock models are sold at most sporting - goods stores .
The police training contract is supposed to be decided next month , and the company has not been officially notified that it ’s getting it .

Blackwater likely to receive contract
Former officials familiar with the deal say that Blackwater is likely to get a Defense Department - issued contract worth hundreds of millions of dollars to train and mentor Afghan police .
The police training contract is supposed to be decided next month , and the company has not been officially notified that it ’s getting it .
But the only competing bid for the contract , submitted by Northrop with MPRI , has been disqualified , a former official knowledgeable about the contract said .

“ We have no knowledge that the contract will be awarded to us , ” Mark Corallo , a spokesman for Blackwater , now known as Xe , told POLITICO Thursday .
Lockheed , meanwhile , is quite likely to be awarded an associated logistics contract to support the Afghanistan police training effort ( a contract known as TORP 166 ) , for which Blackwater also bid , the former officials said .
While a Blackwater subsidiary ’s activities in Afghanistan were the subject of a scathing hearing by the Senate Armed Services Committee Wednesday , the U.S. Central Command and the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , are said to be very happy with the company ’s work in Afghanistan , the former official familiar with the contracting deal told POLITICO .
Blackwater has contracts to do intelligence support , counternarcotics support ( with the Drug Enforcement Administration ) and work on the Afghan - Pakistani border , the former official said .
The DoD has five “ primes ” — companies eligible to bid on contracts in Afghanistan : Raytheon , Lockheed , Northrop , Arinc ( owned by Carlyle ) and Blackwater .
Of those , only Blackwater bid for both parts of the Afghan police training contract — involving training / mentoring and logistics .
Its only competitor for the logistics contract was Lockheed .
The former official said the Army had Lockheed resubmit its proposal to make it more suitable for the logistics contract .

Sidney Crosby ’s overtime winner to claim Olympic gold for Canada over the United States in 2010 was a huge moment for Canadian Hockey .
The country whose spirit rises and falls on the fate of its National Sport was hosting the tournament and its biggest star scored the game winner in the biggest event against their biggest rival .
In honor of Canada Day , we ’ve taken a look at where that important goal fits into Canadian hockey history .
Here is our take on the Top Five Canadian Hockey Goals of All - Time .
5 ) 2003 World Championship
Anson Carter ’s Controversial Clincher
Anson Carter scored one of the most controversial goals in the history of International hockey when he tucked this puck past the goalie in overtime .
Despite some dimwit titling this clip “ Anson Carter ’s No Goal ” , you can clearly see it was in fact a goal .
Before the NHL unofficially opened its doors to players from all over the world it was largely a North American ’s game , a white North American ’s game to be more specific .
Carter ’s goal expanded hockey fans ’ collective minds as to what a hero could look like .
4 ) 2007 World Junior Championship
Jonathan Toews Owns America In Shootout
Jonathan
Toews may have been Canada ’s best player during the Vancouver 2010 Olympics , but he was a stud on the International stage before .
Toews and his Canadian junior teammates were locked in dramatic shootout with the U.S. in the semi-final of the 2007 World Junior Championship , Toews beat the Americans three times to secure a birth in the final .
Canada defeated Russia 4 - 2 to win the tournament .
Toews may have been a little bit excited when he let this one slip :
3 ) 1987 Canada Cup
Gretzky and Lemieux Combine To Finish Russia
Many refer to the 1987 Canada Cup as the greatest tournament ever played .
Canada would win the now defunct Canada Cup with a victory over Russia when Wayne Gretzky fed Mario Lemieux for his now legendary snipe .
Watch for the missed call on Dale Hawerchuk .
2 ) Vancouver 2010 Olympics
Crosby Wins It For Canada
Sidney Crosby certainly is n’t making things simple for his detractors .
Although he went scoreless in the tournament ’s previous three games , he saved his best for last by sneaking a quick snap by Ryan Miller in overtime .
“ The Kid ” added “ National Hero ” to his resume , even with the IOC ’s valiant effort to prevent us from showing you this goal .
1 ) 1972 Summit Series
Paul Henderson Sinks Soviets
Despite beating the living shit out of the Russians physically , Canada was still in tough during the ’ 72 Summit Series .
With pride and a fear of communism on the line , Paul Henderson floated one by the Russian goaltender to score the biggest goal in Canadian hockey history .

Many people passed under the sign to their deaths
A court in Stockholm has ruled that a Swedish man can be extradited to Poland to face trial over the theft of a sign from the Auschwitz death camp .
Investigators accuse Anders Hogstrom , 34 , of instigating the theft of the infamous Arbeit Macht Frei sign from the camp gates last December .
The sign was recovered shortly afterwards , cut into three pieces .
Mr Hogstrom , a former neo -Nazi leader , denies the claims and is likely to appeal , his lawyer said .
He has three weeks to appeal , and if unsuccessful " the authorities have to come and get him and they have 10 days to do so " , Swedish prosecutor Agneta Hilding Qvarnstrom said .
The Stockholm district court said Mr Hogstrom could be extradited , on the condition that , if convicted , he would serve any prison sentence in Sweden , a demand Polish prosecutors have agreed to .
Mr Hogstrom , who was arrested in February , said he was only acting as an intermediary who had been contacted to sell the sign , and that he got in touch with the Polish authorities when he realised it had been stolen .
" I have [ in ] no way committed a crime .
On the contrary .
I have made sure that this sign could be returned , " he is quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency .
Mr Hogstrom helped found the far - right National Socialist Front in 1994 , but later left the organisation .
Outrage Five Polish men have already been arrested over the theft .
The sign , weighing 40kg ( 90 lb ) , was half - unscrewed , half - torn from above the death camp 's gate .
The 5 m ( 16ft ) wrought iron sign - the words on which translate as " Work sets you free " - symbolises for many the atrocities of Nazi Germany .
A replica of the sign , which is being repaired , now sits on top of the entrance gate at Auschwitz and might remain there permanently as the original could be too fragile to withstand weather conditions , officials told the Reuters news agency .
The theft caused outrage in Israel , Poland and around the world .
More than a million people - 90 % of them Jews - were murdered by the Nazis at Auschwitz in occupied Poland during World War II .

MOSCOW —
The two powerful explosions that tore through Moscow ’s subway on Monday revived a peculiar fear in the Russian capital , one that goes beyond the usual terrorism worries of a metropolis : the female bomber .
On Monday , the Russian authorities said that the bombings had been carried out by two women , and that they were searching for two suspected female accomplices , the Russian news media reported .
Few details of the bombers were released .
Earlier this decade , Moscow ’s fear of female suicide bombers was so strong it became a lurid obsession .
Women , sometimes casually clad in jeans and blending in to the swirl of Moscow , committed at least 16 bombings , including two on board planes .
The attacks came early — as when a widow killed herself and the Russian commander who had killed her husband in one of the first such attacks in the Chechen war — and sometimes in the most unlikely places , like mingling in line at a music festival , which only multiplied the horror .
Women joined in some of the most well - known terrorist attacks in recent Russian history , at a theater in Moscow and a school in Beslan , Russia .
Fresh off attacking health care and Democrats in her first primary ad , Lincoln is now trashing labor unions :
[ D.C. unions ] are right -- I 'm not working for them ; I work for you .
Those outsider unions sure do give Lincoln heart palpitations !
Well , at least now they do , because she used to love them .
Although she ’s attacking working families and their unions today , Lincoln sang quite a different tune in 2004 when she was grateful for the backing of the Arkansas AFL - CIO , along with more than $ 260,000 in working families ’ PAC donations .
Said Lincoln at the time : I ’m honored to receive the endorsement today from the Arkansas AFL - CIO for my work in the Senate to improve the lives of Arkansas working families .
Her strong support for Wal - Mart , headquartered in Fayetteville , and her silence about the company ’s virulent anti-unionism and labor law violations , has earned her the nickname “ the senator from Wal - Mart . ”
Lincoln was also just one of two Democrats who voted to block President Obama ’s nomination of respected attorney Craig Becker to the National Labor Relations Board .
Says [ Arkansas AFL - CIO President Alan ]
Hughes :
Only someone who has become a career politician in Washington , D.C. , could spend 10 years asking for our support , take hundreds of thousands of dollars from blue - collar workers , then turn around and attack us as outsiders because we would n’t help her this time around .
Those are not the values people in Arkansas believe in .
Lincoln panicked and decided that the best way to get reelected in this tough Democratic year would be to mimic Republicans on health care , the environment , and labor .
She decided that saying " NO ! " to the entire Democratic agenda would appeal to her constituents , that blocking reform would somehow earn respects and votes .
In reality , she lost the left , the right laughed at her , and independents became disgusted at her pointless grandstanding .
She lost everyone , and is now a guaranteed loser , whether during the primary in May or in the general in November .

But , is n't the opposite what some anti-gay religious pastors would be preaching if this happened in San Francisco ?
" Landslides caused by heavy rain in Uganda 's mountainous coffee - growing district of Mbale killed at least 50 people , police and local officials said Tuesday .
Hundreds more are still missing after dozens of homes were washed away in Bududa County overnight , according to local authorities …
The search for survivors is continuing , Judith Nabakoba , the Ugandan police spokeswoman , said .
' Our rescue team is on the ground , we hope to find some survivors , ' she added .
Police officials said that at least 50 bodies were recovered Tuesday morning .
People close to the situation say that the death toll is expected to rise as at least 300 people are missing . "
Loss of life in any natural disaster is a terrible thing .
Hopefully the Ugandan parliament can take its focus off the " kill the gays " bill momentarily to give aid to its people .
MEXICO CITY — Dominican authorities announced Friday that they arrested Jorge Torres Puello , who acted as a legal adviser for a group of American church members detained in Haiti on child abduction charges even though he himself was wanted on trafficking charges in the United States and El Salvador .
Working together with the United States Marshals Service and other United States law enforcement agencies , the Dominican authorities detained Mr. Torres Thursday night without incident in the parking lot of a McDonald ’s restaurant in Santo Domingo , the officials said .
Mr. Torres , who used a variety of aliases and falsely described himself as a lawyer , dropped out of sight in February after The New York Times asked him about trafficking charges against someone with a similar name and likeness in El Salvador .
In El Salvador , Mr. Torres is wanted on accusations of human trafficking and exploitation of minors for pornography and prostitution .
In the United States , he faces accusations of alien smuggling in Vermont and of probation violations for fraud in Pennsylvania .
He is also wanted in Canada , American officials said .

Rep. Patrick Kennedy ripped the media for chasing sex scandals while ignoring the war in Afghanistan .
Kennedy :
If anybody wants to know where the cynicism is , cynicism is there 's one , two press people in this gallery .
We 're talking about Eric Massa 24/7 on the TV .
We 're talking war and peace , $ 3 billion dollars , a thousand lives , and no press ?
No press ?
You want to know why the American public is fit ?
They 're fit because they 're not seeing their Congress do the work they 're sent to do .
It 's because the press of the United States is not covering the most significant issue of national importance and that 's laying of lives down ... for the service of our country .
It 's despicable the national press corps right now .

For Esmé - with Love and Squalor
The New Yorker , April 8 , 1950 , pages 28 - 36
JUST RECENTLY , by air mail , I received an invitation to a wedding that will take place in England on April 18th .
It happens to be a wedding I 'd give a lot to be able to get to , and when the invitation first arrived , I thought it might just be possible for me to make the trip abroad , by plane , expenses be hanged .
However , I 've since discussed the matter rather extensively with my wife , a breathtakingly levelheaded girl , and we 've decided against it -- for one thing , I 'd completely forgotten that my mother - in - law is looking forward to spending the last two weeks in April with us .
I really do n't get to see Mother Grencher terribly often , and she 's not getting any younger .
She 's fifty - eight .
( As she 'd be the first to admit . )
All the same , though , wherever I happen to be I do n't think I 'm the type that does n't even lift a finger to prevent a wedding from flatting .
Accordingly , I 've gone ahead and jotted down a few revealing notes on the bride as I knew her almost six years ago .
If my notes should cause the groom , whom I have n't met , an uneasy moment or two , so much the better .
Nobody 's aiming to please , here .
More , really , to edify , to instruct .
In April of 1944 , I was among some sixty American enlisted men who took a rather specialized pre-Invasion training course , directed by British Intelligence , in Devon , England .
And as I look back , it seems to me that we were fairly unique , the sixty of us , in that there was n't one good mixer in the bunch .
We were all essentially letter - writing types , and when we spoke to each other out of the line of duty , it was usually to ask somebody if he had any ink he was n't using .
When we were n't writing letters or attending classes , each of us went pretty much his own way .
Mine usually led me , on clear days , in scenic circles around the countryside .
Rainy days , I generally sat in a dry place and read a book , often just an axe length away from a ping - pong table .
The training course lasted three weeks , ending on a Saturday , a very rainy one .
At seven that last night , our whole group was scheduled to entrain for London , where , as rumor had it , we were to be assigned to infantry and airborne divisions mustered for the D Day landings .
By three in the afternoon , I 'd packed all my belongings into my barrack bag , including a canvas gas - mask container full of books I 'd brought over from the Other Side .
( The gas mask itself I 'd slipped through a porthole of the Mauretania some weeks earlier , fully aware that if the enemy ever did use gas I 'd never get the damn thing on in time . )
I remember standing at an end window of our Quonset but for a very long time , looking out at the slanting , dreary rain , my trigger finger itching imperceptibly , if at all .
I could hear behind my back the uncomradely scratching of many fountain pens on many sheets of V - mail paper .
Abruptly , with nothing special in mind , I came away from the window and put on my raincoat , cashmere muffler , galoshes , woollen gloves , and overseas cap ( the last of which , I 'm still told , I wore at an angle all my own - - slightly down over both ears ) .
Then , after synchronizing my wristwatch with the clock in the latrine , I walked down the long , wet cobblestone hill into town .
I ignored the flashes of lightning all around me .
They either had your number on them or they did n't .
In the center of town , which was probably the wettest part of town , I stopped in front of a church to read the bulletin board , mostly because the featured numerals , white on black , had caught my attention but partly because , after three years in the Army , I 'd become addicted to reading bulletin boards .
At three - fifteen , the board stated , there would be children 's - choir practice .
I looked at my wristwatch , then back at the board .
A sheet of paper was tacked up , listing the names of the children expected to attend practice .
I stood in the rain and read all the names , then entered the church .
A dozen or so adults were among the pews , several of them bearing pairs of small - size rubbers , soles up , in their laps .
I passed along and sat down in the front row .
On the rostrum , seated in three compact rows of auditorium chairs , were about twenty children , mostly girls , ranging in age from about seven to thirteen .
At the moment , their choir coach , an enormous woman in tweeds , was advising them to open their mouths wider when they sang .
Had anyone , she asked , ever heard of a little dickeybird that dared to sing his charming song without first opening his little beak wide , wide , wide ?
Apparently nobody ever had .
She was given a steady , opaque look .
She went on to say that she wanted all her children to absorb the meaning of the words they sang , not just mouth them , like silly - billy parrots .
She then blew a note on her pitch - pipe , and the children , like so many underage weightlifters , raised their hymnbooks .
They sang without instrumental accompaniment -- or , more accurately in their case , without any interference .
Their voices were melodious and unsentimental , almost to the point where a somewhat more denominational man than myself might , without straining , have experienced levitation .
A couple of the very youngest children dragged the tempo a trifle , but in a way that only the composer 's mother could have found fault with .
I had never heard the hymn , but I kept hoping it was one with a dozen or more verses .
Listening , I scanned all the children 's faces but watched one in particular , that of the child nearest me , on the end seat in the first row .
She was about thirteen , with straight ash - blond hair of ear - lobe length , an exquisite forehead , and blase eyes that , I thought , might very possibly have counted the house .
Her voice was distinctly separate from the other children 's voices , and not just because she was seated nearest me .
It had the best upper register , the sweetest - sounding , the surest , and it automatically led the way .
The young lady , however , seemed slightly bored with her own singing ability , or perhaps just with the time and place ; twice , between verses , I saw her yawn .
It was a ladylike yawn , a closed - mouth yawn , but you could n't miss it ; her nostril wings gave her away .
The instant the hymn ended , the choir coach began to give her lengthy opinion of people who can't keep their feet still and their lips sealed tight during the minister 's sermon .
I gathered that the singing part of the rehearsal was over , and before the coach 's dissonant speaking voice could entirely break the spell the children 's singing had cast , I got up and left the church .
It was raining even harder .
I walked down the street and looked through the window of the Red Cross recreation room , but soldiers were standing two and three deep at the coffee counter , and , even through the glass , I could hear ping - pong balls bouncing in another room .
I crossed the street and entered a civilian tearoom , which was empty except for a middle - aged waitress , who looked as if she would have preferred a customer with a dry raincoat .
I used a coat tree as delicately as possible , and then sat down at a table and ordered tea and cinnamon toast .
It was the first time all day that I 'd spoken to anyone .
I then looked through all my pockets , including my raincoat , and finally found a couple of stale letters to reread , one from my wife , telling me how the service at Schrafft 's Eighty - eighth Street had fallen off , and one from my mother - in - law , asking me to please send her some cashmere yarn first chance I got away from " camp . "
While I was still on my first cup of tea , the young lady I had been watching and listening to in the choir came into the tearoom .
Her hair was soaking wet , and the rims of both ears were showing .
She was with a very small boy , unmistakably her brother , whose cap she removed by lifting it off his head with two fingers , as if it were a laboratory specimen .
Bringing up the rear was an efficient - looking woman in a limp felt hat -- presumably their governess .
The choir member , taking off her coat as she walked across the floor , made the table selection - - a good one , from my point of view , as it was just eight or ten feet directly in front of me .
She and the governess sat down .
The small boy , who was about five , was n't ready to sit down yet .
He slid out of and discarded his reefer ; then , with the deadpan expression of a born heller , he methodically went about annoying his governess by pushing in and pulling out his chair several times , watching her face .
The governess , keeping her voice down , gave him two or three orders to sit down and , in effect , stop the monkey business , but it was only when his sister spoke to him that he came around and applied the small of his back to his chair seat .
He immediately picked up his napkin and put it on his head .
His sister removed it , opened it , and spread it out on his lap .
About the time their tea was brought , the choir member caught me staring over at her party .
She stared back at me , with those house - counting eyes of hers , then , abruptly , gave me a small , qualified smile .
It was oddly radiant , as certain small , qualified smiles sometimes are .
I smiled back , much less radiantly , keeping my upper lip down over a coal - black G.I. temporary filling showing between two of my front teeth .
The next thing I knew , the young lady was standing , with enviable poise , beside my table .
She was wearing a tartan dress --a Campbell tartan , I believe .
It seemed to me to be a wonderful dress for a very young girl to be wearing on a rainy , rainy day .
" I thought Americans despised tea , " she said .
It was n't the observation of a smart aleck but that of a truth - lover or a statistics - lover .
I replied that some of us never drank anything but tea .
I asked her if she 'd care to join me .
" Thank you , " she said .
" Perhaps for just a fraction of a moment . "
I got up and drew a chair for her , the one opposite me , and she sat down on the forward quarter of it , keeping her spine easily and beautifully straight .
I went back -- almost hurried back -- to my own chair , more than willing to hold up my end of a conversation .
When I was seated , I could n't think of anything to say , though .
I smiled again , still keeping my coal - black filling under concealment .
I remarked that it was certainly a terrible day out .
" Yes ; quite , " said my guest , in the clear , unmistakable voice of a small - talk detester .
She placed her fingers flat on the table edge , like someone at a seance , then , almost instantly , closed her hands -- her nails were bitten down to the quick .
She was wearing a wristwatch , a military - looking one that looked rather like a navigator 's chronograph .
Its face was much too large for her slender wrist .
" You were at choir practice , " she said matter - of - factly .
" I saw you . "
I said I certainly had been , and that I had heard her voice singing separately from the others .
I said I thought she had a very fine voice .
She nodded .
" I know .
I 'm going to be a professional singer . "
" Really ?
Opera ? "
" Heavens , no .
I 'm going to sing jazz on the radio and make heaps of money .
Then , when I 'm thirty , I shall retire and live on a ranch in Ohio . "
She touched the top of her soaking - wet head with the flat of her hand .
" Do you know Ohio ? " she asked .
I said I 'd been through it on the train a few times but that I did n't really know it .
I offered her a piece of cinnamon toast .
" No , thank you , " she said .
" I eat like a bird , actually . "
I bit into a piece of toast myself , and commented that there 's some mighty rough country around Ohio .
" I know .
An American I met told me .
You 're the eleventh American I 've met . "
Her governess was now urgently signalling her to return to her own table -- in effect , to stop bothering the man .
My guest , however , calmly moved her chair an inch or two so that her back broke all possible further communication with the home table .
" You go to that secret Intelligence school on the hill , do n't you ? " she inquired coolly .
As security - minded as the next one , I replied that I was visiting Devonshire for my health .
" Really , " she said , " I was n't quite bom yesterday , you know . "
I said I 'd bet she had n't been , at that .
I drank my tea for a moment .
I was getting a trifle posture - conscious and I sat up somewhat straighter in my seat .
" You seem quite intelligent for an American , " my guest mused .
I told her that was a pretty snobbish thing to say , if you thought about it at all , and that I hoped it was unworthy of her .
She blushed - automatically conferring on me the social poise I 'd been missing .
" Well .
Most of the Americans I 've seen act like animals .
They 're forever punching one another about , and insulting everyone , and -- You know what one of them did ? "
I shook my haad .
" One of them threw an empty whiskey bottle through my aunt 's window .
Fortunately , the window was open .
But does that sound very intelligent to you ? "
It did n't especially , but I did n't say so .
I said that many soldiers , all over the world , were a long way from home , and that few of them had had many real advantages in life .
I said I 'd thought that most people could figure that out for themselves .
" Possibly , " said my guest , without conviction .
She raised her hand to her wet head again , picked at a few limp filaments of blond hair , trying to cover her exposed ear rims .
" My hair is soaking wet , " she said .
" I look a fright . "
She looked over at me .
" I have quite wavy hair when it 's dry . "
" I can see that , I can see you have . "
" Not actually curly , but quite wavy , " she said .
" Are you married ? "
I said I was .
She nodded .
" Are you very deeply in love with your wife ?
Or am I being too personal ? "
I said that when she was , I 'd speak up .
She put her hands and wrists farther forward on the table , and I remember wanting to do something about that enormous - faced wristwatch she was wearing -- perhaps suggest that she try wearing it around her waist .
" Usually , I 'm not terribly gregarious , " she said , and looked over at me to see if I knew the meaning of the word .
I did n't give her a sign , though , one way or the other .
" I purely came over because I thought you looked extremely lonely .
You have an extremely sensitive face . "
I said she was right , that I had been feeling lonely , and that I was very glad she 'd come over .
" I 'm training myself to be more compassionate .
My aunt says I 'm a terribly cold person , " she said and felt the top of her head again .
" I live with my aunt .
She 's an extremely kind person .
Since the death of my mother , she 's done everything within her power to make Charles and me feel adjusted . "
" I 'm glad . "
" Mother was an extremely intelligent person .
Quite sensuous , in many ways . "
She looked at me with a kind of fresh acuteness .
" Do you find me terribly cold ? "
I told her absolutely not -- very much to the contrary , in fact .
I told her my name and asked for hers .
She hesitated .
" My first name is Esme .
I do n't think I shall tell you my full name , for the moment .
I have a title and you may just be impressed by titles .
Americans are , you know . "
I said I did n't think I would be , but that it might be a good idea , at that , to hold on to the title for a while .
Just then , I felt someone 's warm breath on the back of my neck .
I turned around and just missed brushing noses with Esme 's small brother .
Ignoring me , he addressed his sister in a piercing treble : " Miss Megley said you must come and finish your tea ! "
His message delivered , he retired to the chair between his sister and me , on my right .
I regarded him with high interest .
He was looking very splendid in brown Shetland shorts , a navy - blue jersey , white shirt , and striped necktie .
He gazed back at me with immense green eyes .
" Why do people in films kiss sideways ? " he demanded .
" Sideways ? " I said .
It was a problem that had baffled me in my childhood .
I said I guessed it was because actors ' noses are too big for kissing anyone head on .
" His name is Charles , " Esme said .
" He 's extremely brilliant for his age . "
" He certainly has green eyes .
Have n't you , Charles ? "
Charles gave me the fishy look my question deserved , then wriggled downward and forward in his chair till all of his body was under the table except his head , which he left , wrestler 's - bridge style , on the chair seat .
" They 're orange , " he said in a strained voice , addressing the ceiling .
He picked up a comer of the tablecloth and put it over his handsome , deadpan little face .
" Sometimes he 's brilliant and sometimes he 's not , " Esme said .
" Charles , do sit up ! "
Charles stayed right where he was .
He seemed to be holding his breath .
" He misses our father very much .
He was s - l - a - i-n in North Africa . "
I expressed regret to hear it .
Esme nodded .
" Father adored him . "
She bit reflectively at the cuticle of her thumb .
" He looks very much like my mother - - Charles , I mean .
I look exactly like my father . "
She went on biting at her cuticle .
" My mother was quite a passionate woman .
She was an extrovert .
Father was an introvert .
They were quite well mated , though , in a superficial way .
To be quite candid , Father really needed more of an intellectual companion than Mother was .
He was an extremely gifted genius . "
I waited , receptively , for further information , but none came .
I looked down at Charles , who was now resting the side of his face on his chair seat .
When he saw that I was looking at him , he closed his eyes , sleepily , angelically , then stuck out his tongue -- an appendage of startling length -- and gave out what in my country would have been a glorious tribute to a myopic baseball umpire .
It fairly shook the tearoom .
" Stop that , " Esme said , clearly unshaken .
" He saw an American do it in a fish - and - chips queue , and now he does it whenever he 's bored .
Just stop it , now , or I shall send you directly to Miss Megley . "
Charles opened his enormous eyes , as sign that he'd heard his sister 's threat , but otherwise did n't look especially alerted .
He closed his eyes again , and continued to rest the side of his face on the chair seat .
I mentioned that maybe he ought to save it -- meaning the Bronx cheer - - till he started using his title regularly .
That is , if he had a title , too .
Esme gave me a long , faintly clinical look .
" You have a dry sense of humor , have n't you ? " she said -- wistfully .
" Father said I have no sense of humor at all .
He said I was unequipped to meet life because I have no sense of humor . "
Watching her , I lit a cigarette and said I did n't think a sense of humor was of any use in a real pinch .
" Father said it was . "
This was a statement of faith , not a contradiction , and I quickly switched horses .
I nodded and said her father had probably taken the long view , while I was taking the short ( whatever that meant ) .
" Charles misses him exceedingly , " Esme said , after a moment .
" He was an exceedingly lovable man .
He was extremely handsome , too .
Not that one 's appearance matters greatly , but he was .
He had terribly penetrating eyes , for a man who was intransically kind . "
I nodded .
I said I imagined her father had had quite an extraordinary vocabulary .
" Oh , yes ; quite , " said Esme .
" He was an archivist - - amateur , of course . "
At that point , I felt an importunate tap , almost a punch , on my upper arm , from Charles ' direction .
I turned to him .
He was sitting in a fairly normal position in his chair now , except that he had one knee tucked under him .
" What did one wall say to the other wall ? " he asked shrilly .
" It 's a riddle ! "
I rolled my eyes reflectively ceilingward and repeated the question aloud .
Then I looked at Charles with a stumped expression and said I gave up .
" Meet you at the corner ! " came the punch line , at top volume .
It went over biggest with Charles himself .
It struck him as unbearably funny .
In fact , Esme had to come around and pound him on the back , as if treating him for a coughing spell .
" Now , stop that , " she said .
She went back to her own seat .
" He tells that same riddle to everyone he meets and has a fit every single time .
Usually he drools when he laughs .
Now , just stop , please . "
" It 's one of the best riddles I 've heard , though , " I said , watching Charles , who was very gradually coming out of it .
In response to this compliment , he sank considerably lower in his chair and again masked his face up to the eyes with a corner of the tablecloth .
He then looked at me with his exposed eyes , which were full of slowly subsiding mirth and the pride of someone who knows a really good riddle or two .
" May I inquire how you were employed before entering the Army ? " Esme asked me .
I said I had n't been employed at all , that I 'd only been out of college a year but that I like to think of myself as a professional short - story writer .
She nodded politely .
" Published ? " she asked .
It was a familiar but always touchy question , and one that I did n't answer just one , two , three .
I started to explain how most editors in America were a bunch --
" My father wrote beautifully , " Esme interrupted .
" I 'm saving a number of his letters for posterity . "
I said that sounded like a very good idea .
I happened to be looking at her enormous - faced , chronographic - looking wristwatch again .
I asked if it had belonged to her father .
She looked down at her wrist solemnly .
" Yes , it did , " she said .
" He gave it to me just before Charles and I were evacuated . "
Self - consciously , she took her hands off the table , saying , " Purely as a momento , of course . "
She guided the conversation in a different direction .
" I 'd be extremely flattered if you 'd write a story exclusively for me sometime .
I 'm an avid reader . "
I told her I certainly would , if I could .
I said that I was n't terribly prolific .
" It does n't have to be terribly prolific !
Just so that it is n't childish and silly . "
She reflected .
" I prefer stories about squalor . "
" About what ? " I said , leaning forward .
" Squalor .
I 'm extremely interested in squalor . "
I was about to press her for more details , but I felt Charles pinching me , hard , on my arm .
I turned to him , wincing slightly .
He was standing right next to me .
" What did one wall say to the other wall ? " he asked , not unfamiliarly .
" You asked him that , " Esme said .
" Now , stop it . "
Ignoring his sister , and stepping up on one of my feet , Charles repeated the key question .
I noticed that his necktie knot was n't adjusted properly .
I slid it up into place , then , looking him straight in the eye , suggested , " Meetcha at the corner ? "
The instant I 'd said it , I wished I had n't .
Charles ' mouth fell open .
I felt as if I 'd struck it open .
He stepped down off my foot and , with white - hot dignity , walked over to his own table , without looking back .
" He 's furious , " Esme said .
" He has a violent temper .
My mother had a propensity to spoil him .
My father was the only one who did n't spoil him . "
I kept looking over at Charles , who had sat down and started to drink his tea , using both hands on the cup .
I hoped he'd turn around , but he did n't .
Esme stood up .
` Il faut que je parte aussi , " she said , with a sigh .
" Do you know French ? "
I got up from my own chair , with mixed feelings of regret and confusion .
Esme and I shook hands ; her hand , as I 'd suspected , was a nervous hand , damp at the palm .
I told her , in English , how very much I 'd enjoyed her company .
She nodded .
" I thought you might , " she said .
" I 'm quite communicative for my age . "
She gave her hair another experimental touch .
" I 'm dreadfully sorry about my hair , " she said .
" I 've probably been hideous to look at . "
" Not at all !
As a matter of fact , I think a lot of the wave is coming back already . "
She quickly touched her hair again .
" Do you think you 'll be coming here again in the immediate future ? " she asked .
" We come here every Saturday , after choir practice . "
I answered that I 'd like nothing better but that , unfortunately , I was pretty sure I would n't be able to make it again .
" In other words , you can't discuss troop movements , " said Esme .
She made no move to leave the vicinity of the table .
In fact , she crossed one foot over the other and , looking down , aligned the toes of her shoes .
It was a pretty little execution , for she was wearing white socks and her ankles and feet were lovely .
She looked up at me abruptly .
" Would you like me to write to you ? " she asked , with a certain amount of color in her face .
" I write extremely articulate letters for a person my --"
" I 'd love it . "
I took out pencil and paper and wrote down my name , rank , serial number , and A.P.O. number .
" I shall write to you first , " she said , accepting it , " so that you do n't feel compromised in any way . "
She put the address into a pocket of her dress .
" Goodbye , " she said , and walked back to her table .
I ordered another pot of tea and sat watching the two of them till they , and the harassed Miss Megley , got up to leave .
Charles led the way out , limping tragically , like a man with one leg several , inches shorter than the other .
He did n't look over at me .
Miss Megley went next , then Esme , who waved to me .
I waved back , half getting up from my chair .
It was a strangely emotional moment for me .
Less than a minute later , Esme came back into the tearoom , dragging Charles behind her by the sleeve of his reefer .
" Charles would like to kiss you goodbye , " she said .
I immediately put down my cup , and said that was very nice , but was she sure ?
" Yes , " she said , a trifle grimly .
She let go Charles ' sleeve and gave him a rather vigorous push in my direction .
He came forward , his face livid , and gave me a loud , wet smacker just below the right ear .
Following this ordeal , he started to make a beeline for the door and a less sentimental way of life , but 1 caught the half belt at the back of his reefer , held on to it , and asked him , " What did one wall say to the other wall ? "
His face lit up .
" Meet you at the corner ! " he shrieked , and raced out of the room , possibly in hysterics .
Esme was standing with crossed ankles again .
" You 're quite sure you wo n't forget to write that story for me ? " she asked .
" It does n't have to be exclusively for me .
It can --"
I said there was absolutely no chance that I 'd forget .
I told her that I 'd never written a story for anybody , but that it seemed like exactly the right time to get down to it .
She nodded .
" Make it extremely squalid and moving , " she suggested .
" Are you at all acquainted with squalor ? "
I said not exactly but that I was getting better acquainted with it , in one form or another , all the time , and that I 'd do my best to come up to her specifications .
We shook hands .
" Is n't it a pity that we did n't meet under less extenuating circumstances ? "
I said it was , I said it certainly was .
" Goodbye , " Esme said .
" I hope you return from the war with all your faculties intact . "
I thanked her , and said a few other words , and then watched her leave the tearoom .
She left it slowly , reflectively , testing the ends of her hair for dryness .
This is the squalid , or moving , part of the story , and the scene changes .
The people change , too .
I 'm still around , but from here on in , for reasons I 'm not at liberty to disclose , I 've disguised myself so cunningly that even the cleverest reader will fail to recognize me .
It was about ten - thirty at night in Gaufurt , Bavaria , several weeks after V - E Day .
Staff Sergeant
X was in his room on the second floor of the civilian home in which he and nine other American soldiers had been quartered , even before the armistice .
He was seated on a folding wooden chair at a small , messy - looking writing table , with a paperback overseas novel open before him , which he was having great trouble reading .
The trouble lay with him , not the novel .
Although the men who lived on the first floor usually had first grab at the books sent each month by Special Services , X usually seemed to be left with the book he might have selected himself .
But he was a young man who had not come through the war with all his faculties intact , and for more than an hour he had been triple - reading paragraphs , and now he was doing it to the sentences .
He suddenly closed the book , without marking his place .
With his hand , he shielded his eyes for a moment against the harsh , watty glare from the naked bulb over the table .
He took a cigarette from a pack on the table and lit it with fingers that bumped gently and incessantly against one another .
He sat back a trifle in his chair and smoked without any sense of taste .
He had been chain - smoking for weeks .
His gums bled at the slightest pressure of the tip of his tongue , and he seldom stopped experimenting ; it was a little game he played , sometimes by the hour .
He sat for a moment smoking and experimenting .
Then , abruptly , familiarly , and , as usual , with no warning , he thought he felt his mind dislodge itself and teeter , like insecure luggage on an overhead rack .
He quickly did what he had been doing for weeks to set things right : he pressed his hands hard against his temples .
He held on tight for a moment .
His hair needed cutting , and it was dirty .
He had washed it three or four times during his two weeks ' stay at the hospital in Frankfort on the Main , but it had got dirty again on the long , dusty jeep ride back to Gaufurt .
Corporal Z , who had called for him at the hospital , still drove a jeep combat - style , with the windshield down on the hood , armistice or no armistice .
There were thousands of new troops in Germany .
By driving with his windshield down , combat - style , Corporal Z hoped to show that he was not one of them , that not by a long shot was he some new son of a bitch in the E.T.O .
When he let go of his head , X began to stare at the surface of the writing table , which was a catchall for at least two dozen unopened letters and at least five or six unopened packages , all addressed to him .
He reached behind the debris and picked out a book that stood against the wall .
It was a book by Goebbels , entitled " Die Zeit Ohne Beispiel . "
It belonged to the thirty - eight - year - old , unmarried daughter of the family that , up to a few weeks earlier , had been living in the house .
She had been a low official in the Nazi Party , but high enough , by Army Regulations standards , to fall into an automatic - arrest category .
X himself had arrested her .
Now , for the third time since he had returned from the hospital that day , he opened the woman 's book and read the brief inscription on the flyleaf .
Written in ink , in German , in a small , hopelessly sincere handwriting , were the words " Dear God , life is hell . "
Nothing led up to or away from it .
Alone on the page , and in the sickly stillness of the room , the words appeared to have the stature of an uncontestable , even classic indictment .
X stared at the page for several minutes , trying , against heavy odds , not to be taken in .
Then , with far more zeal than he had done anything in weeks , he picked up a pencil stub and wrote down under the inscription , in English , " Fathers and teachers , I ponder ` What is hell ? '
I maintain that it is the suffering of being unable to love . "
He started to write Dostoevski's name under the inscription , but saw - - with fright that ran through his whole body -- that what he had written was almost entirely illegible .
He shut the book .
He quickly picked up something else from the table , a letter from his older brother in Albany .
It had been on his table even before he had checked into the hospital .
He opened the envelope , loosely resolved to read the letter straight through , but read only the top half of the first page .
He stopped after the words " Now that the g.d. war is over and you probably have a lot of time over there , how about sending the kids a couple of bayonets or swastikas . . . "
After he'd torn it up , he looked down at the pieces as they lay in the wastebasket .
He saw that he had overlooked an enclosed snapshot .
He could make out somebody 's feet standing on a lawn somewhere .
He put his arms on the table and rested his head on them .
He ached from head to foot , all zones of pain seemingly interdependent .
He was rather like a Christmas tree whose lights , wired in series , must all go out if even one bulb is defective .
The door banged open , without having been rapped on .
X raised his head , turned it , and saw Corporal Z standing in the door .
Corporal Z had been X's jeep partner and constant companion from D Day straight through five campaigns of the war .
He lived on the first floor and he usually came up to see X when he had a few rumors or gripes to unload .
He was a huge , photogenic young man of twenty - four .
During the war , a national magazine had photographed him in Hurtgen Forest ; he had posed , more than just obligingly , with a Thanksgiving turkey in each hand .
" Ya writin ' letters ? " he asked X . " It 's spooky in here , for Chrissake . "
He preferred always to enter a room that had the overhead light on .
X turned around in his chair and asked him to come in , and to be careful not to step on the dog .
" The what ? "
" Alvin .
He 's right under your feet , Clay .
How ' bout turning on the goddam light ? "
Clay found the overhead - light switch , flicked it on , then stepped across the puny , servant 's - size room and sat down on the edge of the bed , facing his host .
His brick - red hair , just combed , was dripping with the amount of water he required for satisfactory grooming .
A comb with a fountain - pen clip protruded , familiarly , from the right - hand pocket of his olive - drab shirt .
Over the left - hand pocket he was wearing the Combat Infantrymen 's Badge ( which , technically , he was n't authorized to wear ) , the European Theatre ribbon , with five bronze battle stars in it ( instead of a lone silver one , which was the equivalent of five bronze ones ) , and the pre-Pearl Harbor service ribbon .
He sighed heavily and said , " Christ almighty . "
It meant nothing ; it was Army .
He took a pack of cigarettes from his shirt pocket , tapped one out , then put away the pack and rebuttoned the pocket flap .
Smoking , he looked vacuously around the room .
His look finally settled on the radio .
" Hey , " he said .
" They got this terrific show comin ' on the radio in a coupla minutes .
Bob Hope , and everybody . "
X , opening a fresh pack of cigarettes , said he had just turned the radio off .
Undarkened , Clay watched X trying to get a cigarette lit .
" Jesus , " he said , with spectator 's enthusiasm , " you oughta see your goddam hands .
Boy , have you got the shakes .
Ya know that ? "
X got his cigarette lit , nodded , and said Clay had a real eye for detail .
" No kidding , hey .
I goddam near fainted when I saw you at the hospital .
You looked like a goddam corpse .
How much weight ya lose ?
How many pounds ?
Ya know ? "
" I do n't know .
How was your mail when I was gone ?
You heard from Loretta ? "
Loretta was Clay 's girl .
They intended to get married at their earliest convenience .
She wrote to him fairly regularly , from a paradise of triple exclamation points and inaccurate observations .
All through the war , Clay had read all Loretta 's letters aloud to X , however intimate they were -- in fact , the more intimate , the better .
It was his custom , after each reading , to ask X to plot out or pad out the letter of reply , or to insert a few impressive words in French or German .
" Yeah , I had a letter from her yesterday .
Down in my room .
Show it to ya later , " Clay said , listlessly .
He sat up straight on the edge of the bed , held his breath , and issued a long , resonant belch .
Looking just semi-pleased with the achievement , he relaxed again .
" Her goddam brother 's gettin ' outa the Navy on account of his hip , " he said .
" He 's got this hip , the bastard . "
He sat up again and tried for another belch , but with below - par results .
A jot of alertness came into his face .
" Hey .
Before I forget .
We gotta get up at five tomorrow and drive to Hamburg or someplace .
Pick up Eisenhower jackets for the whole detachment . "
X , regarding him hostilely , stated that he did n't want an Eisenhower jacket .
Clay looked surprised , almost a trifle hurt .
" Oh , they 're good !
They look good .
How come ? "
" No reason .
Why do we have to get up at five ?
The war 's over , for God 's sake . "
" I do n't know -- we gotta get back before lunch .
They got some new forms in we gotta fill out before lunch ....
I asked Bulling how come we could n't fill 'em out tonight -- he's got the goddam forms right on his desk .
He do n't want to open the envelopes yet , the son of a bitch . "
The two sat quiet for a moment , hating Bulling .
Clay suddenly looked at X with new - higher - interest than before .
" Hey , " he said .
" Did you know the goddam side of your face is jumping all over the place ? "
X said he knew all about it , and covered his tic with his hand .
Clay stared at him for a moment , then said , rather vividly , as if he were the bearer of exceptionally good news , " I wrote Loretta you had a nervous breakdown . "
" Oh ? "
" Yeah .
She 's interested as hell in all that stuff .
She 's majoring in psychology . "
Clay stretched himself out on the bed , shoes included .
" You know what she said ?
She says nobody gets a nervous breakdown just from the war and all .
She says you probably were unstable like , your whole goddam life . "
X bridged his hands over his eyes -- the light over the bed seemed to be blinding him -- and said that Loretta 's insight into things was always a joy .
Clay glanced over at him .
" Listen , ya bastard , " he said .
" She knows a goddam sight more psychology than you do . "
" Do you think you can bring yourself to take your stinking feet off my bed ? " X asked .
Clay left his feet where they were for a few do n't - tell - me - where - to - put - my - feet seconds , then swung them around to the floor and sat up .
" I 'm goin ' downstairs anyway .
They got the radio on in Walker 's room . "
He did n't get up from the bed , though .
" Hey .
I was just tellin ' that new son of a bitch , Bernstein , downstairs .
Remember that time I and you drove into Valognes , and we got shelled for about two goddam hours , and that goddam cat I shot that jumped up on the hood of the jeep when we were layin ' in that hole ?
Remember ? "
" Yes - - do n't start that business with that cat again , Clay , God damn it .
I do n't want to hear about it . "
" No , all I mean is I wrote Loretta about it .
She and the whole psychology class discussed it .
In class and all .
The goddam professor and everybody . "
" That 's fine .
I do n't want to hear about it , Clay . "
" No , you know the reason I took a pot shot at it , Loretta says ?
She says I was temporarily insane .
No kidding .
From the shelling and all . "
X threaded his fingers , once , through his dirty hair , then shielded his eyes against the light again .
" You were n't insane .
You were simply doing your duty .
You killed that pussycat in as manly a way as anybody could 've under the circumstances . "
Clay looked at him suspiciously .
" What the hell are you talkin ' about ? "
" That cat was a spy .
You had to take a pot shot at it .
It was a very clever German midget dressed up in a cheap fur coat .
So there was absolutely nothing brutal , or cruel , or dirty , or even - - "
" God damn it ! "
Clay said , his lips thinned .
" Ca n't you ever be sincere ? "
X suddenly felt sick , and he swung around in his chair and grabbed the wastebasket -- just in time .
When he had straightened up and turned toward his guest again , he found him standing , embarrassed , halfway between the bed and the door .
X started to apologize , but changed his mind and reached for his cigarettes .
" C'mon down and listen to Hope on the radio , hey , " Clay said , keeping his distance but trying to be friendly over it .
" It 'll do ya good .
I mean it . "
" You go ahead , Clay . . . .
I 'll look at my stamp collection . "
" Yeah ?
You got a stamp collection ?
I did n't know you --"
" I 'm only kidding . "
Clay took a couple of slow steps toward the door .
" I may drive over to Ehstadt later , " he said .
" They got a dance .
It 'll probably last till around two .
Wanna go ? "
" No , thanks .
. . .
I may practice a few steps in the room . "
" O.K . G'night !
Take it easy , now , for Chrissake . "
The door slammed shut , then instantly opened again .
" Hey. O.K. if I leave a letter to Loretta under your door ?
I got some German stuff in it .
Willya fix it up for me ? "
" Yes .
Leave me alone now , God damn it . "
" Sure , " said Clay .
" You know what my mother wrote me ?
She wrote me she 's glad you and I were together and all the whole war .
In the same jeep and all .
She says my letters are a helluva lot more intelligent since we been goin ' around together . "
X looked up and over at him , and said , with great effort , " Thanks .
Tell her thanks for me . "
" I will .
G'night ! "
The door slammed shut , this time for good .
X sat looking at the door for a long while , then turned his chair around toward the writing table and picked up his portable typewriter from the floor .
He made space for it on the messy table surface , pushing aside the collapsed pile of unopened letters and packages .
He thought if he wrote a letter to an old friend of his in New York there might be some quick , however slight , therapy in it for him .
But he could n't insert his notepaper into the roller properly , his fingers were shaking so violently now .
He put his hands down at his sides for a minute , then tried again , but finally crumpled the notepaper in his hand .
He was aware that he ought to get the wastebasket out of the room , but instead of doing anything about it , he put his arms on the typewriter and rested his head again , closing his eyes .
A few throbbing minutes later , when he opened his eyes , he found himself squinting at a small , unopened package wrapped in green paper .
It had probably slipped off the pile when he had made space for the typewriter .
He saw that it had been readdressed several times .
He could make out , on just one side of the package , at least three of his old A.P.O. numbers .
He opened the package without any interest , without even looking at the return address .
He opened it by burning the string with a lighted match .
He was more interested in watching a string burn all the way down than in opening the package , but he opened it , finally .
Inside the box , a note , written in ink , lay on top of a small object wrapped in tissue paper .
He picked out the note and read it .
17 , ----ROAD ,
-----DEVON
JUNE 7 , 1944
DEAR SERGEANT X ,
I hope you will forgive me for having taken 38 days to begin our correspondence but , I have been extremely busy as my aunt has undergone streptococcus of the throat and nearly perished and I have been justifiably saddled with one responsibility after another .
However I have thought of you frequently and of the extremely pleasant afternoon we spent in each other 's company on April 30 , 1944 between 3:45 and 4:15 P.M. in case it slipped your mind .
We are all tremendously excited and overawed about D Day and only hope that it will bring about the swift termination of the war and a method of existence that is ridiculous to say the least .
Charles and I are both quite concerned about you ; we hope you were not among those who made the first initial assault upon the Cotentin Peninsula .
Were you ?
Please reply as speedily as possible .
My warmest regards to your wife .
Sincerely yours ,
ESMA
P.S. I am taking the liberty of enclosing my wristwatch which you may keep in your possession for the duration of the conflict .
I did not observe whether you were wearing one during our brief association , but this one is extremely water - proof and shockproof as well as having many other virtues among which one can tell at what velocity one is walking if one wishes .
I am quite certain that you will use it to greater advantage in these difficult days than I ever can and that you will accept it as a lucky talisman .
Charles , whom I am teaching to read and write and whom I am finding an extremely intelligent novice , wishes to add a few words .
Please write as soon as you have the time and inclination .
HELLO HELLO HELLO HELLO HELLO HELLO HELLO HELLO HELLO HELLO LOVE AND KISSES CHALES
It was a long time before X could set the note aside , let alone lift Esme 's father 's wristwatch out of the box .
When he did finally lift it out , he saw that its crystal had been broken in transit .
He wondered if the watch was otherwise undamaged , but he had n't the courage to wind it and find out .
He just sat with it in his hand for another long period .
Then , suddenly , almost ecstatically , he felt sleepy .

Inscribed ostrich shell fragments found in South Africa are among the earliest examples of the use of symbolism by modern humans , scientists say .
The etched shells from Diepkloof Rock Shelter in Western Cape have been dated to about 60,000 years ago .
Details are reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The researchers , who have investigated the material since 1999 , argue that the markings are almost certainly a form of messaging - of graphic communication .
" The motif is two parallel lines , which we suppose were circular , but we do not have a complete refit of the eggs , " explained Dr Pierre - Jean Texier from the University of Bordeaux , Talence , France .
" The lines are crossed at right angles or oblique angles by hatching .
By the repetition of this motif , early humans were trying to communicate something .
Perhaps they were trying to express the identity of the individual or the group , " he told BBC News .
Symbolic thought - the ability to let one thing represent another - was a giant leap in human evolution , and sets our species apart from the rest of the animal world .
Understanding when and where this behaviour first emerged is a key quest for scientists studying human origins .
Arguably the earliest examples of conceptual thought are the pieces of shell jewellery discovered at Skhul Cave in Israel and from Oued Djebbana in Algeria .
These artefacts are 90,000 - 100,000 years old .
Shell beading from 75,000 years ago is also found at Blombos Cave in South Africa , as well as a number of ochre blocks that have engravings not dissimilar to those at Diepkloof .
Etched ochre blocks from Blombos However , the significance of the Diepkloof finds may lie in their number , which proves such markings could not have been simple doodlings .
" What is extraordinary at Diepkloof is that we have close to 300 pieces of such engravings , which is why we are speaking of a system of symbolic representation , " Dr Texier said .
The team , which includes Dr Guillaume Porraz from the University of Tubingen , tried themselves to recreate the markings using pieces of flint .
" Ostrich egg shells are quite hard .
Doing such engravings is not so easy .
You have to pass through the outer layer to get through to the middle layer , " Dr Texier explained .
The team 's experiments also suggest that the colouration of the fragments is natural and not the result of the application of pigments .
The group was able to reproduce similar hues by baking pieces of shell near a fire .
Early humans pierced and strung shells together as jewellery Professor Chris Stringer , of London 's Natural History Museum , said the find was important .
" Here we 've got something that we can compare with later material that clearly does have important signalling value in the populations , " he told BBC News .
" It 's a very nice link between the Middle Stone Age , the later Stone Age and even recent populations in South Africa .
One question now is whether this is a special site , or as we excavate more sites will we find this material is more widespread ? "

It ’s going to be a long time ( if ever ) before I track down the entire Golden Age run of the Flash , but I ’ve finally tracked down the last item on a list I ’ve been trying to complete for four years .
Getting Started
For the longest time I just assumed Golden Age comics would cost too much to collect .
Then in late 2005 I picked a maximum , bid on several auctions on eBay ( not expecting to win ) , and actually won two of them .
They were n’t in good condition , but one of them was complete , and all I wanted to do was be able to read the stories .
So I took the appearance lists for those Golden Age villains who had survived into the Silver Age and beyond — villains who had returned like the Fiddler and the Thinker , or who had been re-imagined like Star Sapphire , the Turtle or the Thorn — removed anything that I had as a reprint , and made a list of books to track down .
Discovery
The first year I had pretty good success , and bought a bunch of other Golden Age books .
I read them , indexed character appearances , and discovered forgotten recurring characters like the Worry Wart , Deuces Wilde , the Eel and the Keystone City Liars Club .
After a while , though , the supply of ( relatively ) cheap , reader ’s - grade copies on eBay dried up .
Cons did n’t help because , as near as I can tell , most Golden Age collectors do it for the history .
They ’re looking for the books that are in the best condition possible , so that ’s what dealers bring with them .
Pursuing the Shade
The one book I most wanted from the beginning proved to be the hardest to find : Flash Comics # 33 , the first appearance of the Shade .
After four years , I finally found it .
Last month a falling - apart copy showed up on eBay starting at $ 50 , in a lot with two other books in much better condition .
I figured it would quickly move beyond my price range , and did n’t even bother bidding — but I did put a watch on it .
The day it closed , eBay sent me a reminder .
Amazingly , it was only up to $ 55 , so I put in a bid .
Even more amazingly , it only went up to $ 56 .
To my astonishment , when I checked my email the next morning , there had n’t been any more bids .
I ’d won !
It ’s a strange feeling — a mix of astonishment and exhilaration — to finally track down something I ’d sought for so long .
I wrote up most of this post that day , but held off publishing it , just in case something went wrong .
It took a while , but the book arrived today .
Success !
It smelled musty .
The edges of the cover were flaking .
The front and back cover were held together with tape , and stuck to the rest of the book only because there was a hole in the cover , letting the tape stick to the spine .
The pages were faded from their original white to a dull brown , but some of the ink remained bright .
In short , it was pretty much what I expected , as far as condition goes .
As for the story , I was n’t really sure what to expect .
Unlike the Fiddler or the Thinker , the Shade only made that one appearance during the Golden Age .
And of course the modern , Starman - based interpretation is much darker ( no pun intended ) than anything DC would have published in the pages of Flash Comics .
Commanding the Night
What I found was a fairly standard comedic Golden - Age Flash tale in which the original Scarlet Speedster battles a gang of crooks .
Their leader dresses all in black and calls himself the Shade , but has n’t quite developed into a full super - villain yet .
Instead of a device in his cane which projects darkness ( like the Silver Age version ) , or magical powers that produce and manipulate darkness ( like the modern version ) , he has an air conditioner - sized device which his gang uses to suck the light out of an area ( using a bit of cringe - worthy pseudoscience that deserves its own post ) .
Actually reading it was kind of disappointing .
I suppose doing so removed the air of mystery around the Shade ’s origins .
And let ’s face it , given the prevailing style of the book , especially early in the decade , there is no possible way it could have lived up to what the Shade has since become .
At the same time , it ’s fascinating to look back at how the character has changed from his one - off appearance in 1942 , to his reappearance in 1961 , to his re-imagining in the 1990s .

Some nurses paid more than family doctors
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Despite the growing shortage of family doctors in the United States , medical centers last year offered higher salaries and incentives to specialist nurses than to primary care doctors , according to an annual survey of physicians ' salaries .
Primary care doctors were offered an average base salary of $ 173,000 in 2009 compared to an average base salary of $ 189,000 offered to certified nurse anesthetists , or CRNAs , according to the latest numbers from Merritt Hawkins & Associates , a physician recruiting and consulting firm .

And the firm 's projections for 2010 indicate that the average base salary for family physicians will be about $ 178,000 compared to $ 186,000 for CRNAs .
CRNAs are advanced practice nurses who administer anesthesia to patients .
An important distinction between CRNAs and anesthesiologists is that when anesthesia is administered by a nurse anesthetist , it is still recognized as the practice of nursing rather than a practice of medicine .
" It 's the fourth year in a row that CRNAs were recruited at a higher pay than a family doctor , " said Kurt Mosley , staffing expert with Merritt Hawkins & Associates .
CRNA salaries have trended higher as the number of surgical procedures picked up pace over the past few years , fueling demand for anesthesiologists and anesthetists .
Anesthesiologists ' average salary is $ 344,000 , according to Merritt Hawkins .
Mosley said medical doctors and specialists , including anesthesiologists , typically have four to five years more of medical training than CRNAs .
After spending a lot of time speaking with physicians around the country , he said many family doctors are starting to feel like " second - class citizens . "
This type of income disparity " wo n't make them feel better , " he said .
Most primary care doctors say they 're already struggling to make ends meet as their costs rise faster than what Medicare and private insurers are paying them .
Looking at these compensation trends , the biggest concern for the nation 's health care system is how to encourage more medical students to pick primary care as their specialty at a time when the nation is already facing a shortage of about 60,000 primary care doctors .
" The demand for primary care doctors will increase twofold when health reform happens and millions of more Americans have access to health care , " said Mosley .
" Who is going to triage these patients ?
It 's not the neurologist or pulmonologist .
It has to be the primary care doctor . "
The American Association of Nurse Anesthetists ( AANA ) , in comments subsequent to the original publication of this story , disputed the Merritt Hawkins figures .
The group says the average nurse anesthetist salary is closer to $ 158,000 , based on its own data collected from 10,000 of its 40,000 members .
" The Merritt Hawkins estimate is inflated because often when hospitals reach the point where they 're willing to hire a recruiting firm , they 've exhausted all other means to fill a position , " said Lisa Thiemann , senior director of professional practice for the AANA and a CRNA for 14 years .
The association also said comparing its members to family practice physicians is not appropriate , since they provide different services , and that a fairer comparison is to anesthesiologists , who make much more .
" We deliver anesthesia to our patients and keep them safe and comfortable during surgery , and working with or without anesthesiologists we enable hospitals to keep their ORs functioning smoothly , " Thiemann said .
" From our perspective , we are fairly compensated for the level of responsibility we shoulder . "
If you thought BioShock had some creepy enemies , wait until you get a look at the enemy concepts that did n't make it into the game .
Irrational Games pulled out these five pieces of concept art from deep within its vaults , giving fans a taste of a BioShock that might have been .
There seems to be a strong focus on disproportionate limbs and a human - insect hybrid theme that never reached fruition , though it did manage to help sell the game .

Hello !
Welcome to our Banh Mi community & thank you for sharing the love of Vietnamese sandwiches !
Contact & inquiries at editor ( at) battleofthebanhmi( dot ) com
Vietnamese baguette sandwiches , called Banh Mi , have attracted a loyal fan base like never before .
Like a musical band with rock star status , these sandwiches have an almost cult - like following of epicurean devotees .
The uniqueness of these sandwiches not only lies within the french influenced baguette , but it ’s also the flavor packed , savory Viet fillings that what makes the marriage of the two main ingredients a true love affair .
It starts with a Viet style french baguette ; usually made with a combination of rice and / or wheat flour , resulting in a very light , crackly crust and not overly dense bread .
The majority of Viet bakeries strive & compete to achieve a golden , crackly crust with just a touch of center , where most of the baguette is more crust than center .
A few other may be content on creating a Viet baguette that is a little more soft and chewy on the outside , and a little more “ hoagie ” like .
So there is a bread for almost everyone .
Inside the length of the cut baguette or ( occasionally a full demi-baguette ) , a great banh mi should have luscious , Viet flavored fillings such as pork prepared in numerous ways ; juicy pork meat ball ( xiu mai ) , bar - b - que ( thit nuong ) , shredded ( bi ) and pork roll ( cha lua ) .
Cold cut combinations ( pork roll , ham , and / or head cheese ) , grilled chicken ( ga nuong ) , sardine ( ca moi ) , scrambled egg ( trung chien ) and vegetarian ( chay ) are just a sampling of the plethora of possibilities one may be offered on the menu .
Other common ingredients used to finish the sandwich often are : liver pate , homemade mayo , touch of soy sauce , shredded pickled carrots & daikon , fresh cilantro , jalapeño heat and crispy cucumber slices .
Most any of these condiments may be omitted since , banh mi are nearly always made to order .
To top off that banh mi high ” , they are still “ light ” on the pocketbook .
Rock on !
Some of the more contemporary locations makes it easy to order and pick up with state - of - the - art , bi-lingual , computerized voice systems .
But the real novelty behind these sandwiches lies behind the cultural experience , occasional language barriers and sometimes challenge of righting your way to the front to order your bánh mì .
This is priceless .
For the bakeries that have n’t adapted to America quite so quickly , you ’ll have to push your way to the front just as hard as the little old lady next to ya .
Here , it ’s not “ first come , first serve ” but more like whom evers ’ order gets heard first by the cashier .
Do n’t expect to get the friendliest service either sometimes , but do n’t ever take it personal .
They ’re just focused on getting you the best sandwich they can in record speed .
Just know that if it ’s busy with a Vietnamese crowd , you ’re getting a respectable sandwich .
A true banh mi quest would n’t be as authentic and fun without experiencing the latter of the two scenarios .
One note of caution though : in - consistency can run rampant at some of these places .
Depending on the mood of who ’s working the sandwich station that day , a sandwich can leave you satisfied or aching for more filling .
We ’ve debated over the better Việt baguette on the battlefields of Little Saigon , now the real battle of the banh mi continues on culinary battlefields all across America .
There are so many independent banh mi shops / bakeries that deserve our time and cravings .
Some heated discussions may argue over factors based on the quality of the bread , fillings or vice versa .
Our personal battles over our favorite banh mi starts with the bread , continues with the fillings and still has ho end in sight .
Attention all banh mi buddies !!
We now we seek the opinion of banh mi junkies from all around .
Where is your favorite banh mi place ?
Share your favorite place so that if any of us are far away from home , we can satisfy our cravings for a good sandwich in any part of the country .
Visit the link of where your favorite shop is and post about where you think they make the best banh mi .
Difference of opinions will arise , but remember that we are all bound by one common thread - the search and appreciation of a good banh mi sandwich .
So please , house rules are to post only your favorite .
Lets just discuss the positives and where the recommended eateries are .
Do not post any negative comments about any banh mi place , because we would rather spend our precious time eating than reading any negative , non-constructive posts .
No haters , only banh mi lovers .

China Wants to Connect its High - Speed Rail to Europe ( Largest Infrastructure Project in History )
March 13th , 2010 by Zachary Shahan
China is clearly taking the lead on high - speed rail , but it is not satisfied just to have it within its own country .
It wants a straight connection to Europe on high - speed rail now .
It might seem like a pipe dream if it were n’t for the fact that China is already about halfway through the construction of the largest high - speed rail ( HSR ) network in the world with the fastest trains in the world .
With its internal projects getting closer to completion , China ’s new goal is to continue on with a HSR revolution internationally in order to create two - day HSR trip times between Beijing and London ( which itself might get some pretty fast trains soon ) !
But it is about much more than a rail connection or two to Europe .
The news of China ’s plans were announced in the South China Morning Post this week .
The international network is supposed to include a total of 17 countries .
As mapped , this is likely to be the largest infrastructure project in history .
It would also extend south to Singapore and northeast into Mongolia and Russia .
Its main connection to Europe would likely go through India , Pakistan and the Middle East .
Although , exact routes are not yet determined .
Plans Moving Forward
Reportedly , negotiations with the relevant 17 countries are already underway .
China would like to fund the whole project itself in exchange for natural resources it lacks .
One of the senior consultants working on the project , Wang Mengshu , said , “ We would actually prefer the other countries to pay in natural resources rather than make their own capital investment . ”
Myanmar and Russia already have rail links planned and China is also in communication with Iran , Pakistan and India regarding development of the internal rail lines in each of those countries that would connect to the network .
Additionally , construction for the Southeast Asia link has started and Burma is about to begin building its portion of the link .
The central and eastern European portions of the network are moving forward as well .
“ We have also already carried out the prospecting and survey work for the European network , and central and eastern European countries are keen for us to start , ” Wang said .
China wants to complete this network in 10 years .
Who Benefits ?
Clearly , China is intent on this for its own benefit .
In exchange for developing the system , it could acquire tons of much needed natural resources from other countries , as stated above .
However , perhaps more importantly , creating such a network would probably solidify China ’s central role in the Asian economy and perhaps even the world economy .
Nonetheless , China says that other countries approached it for help and that is how the idea got started .
“ It was not China that pushed the idea to start with , ” said Wang .
“ It was the other countries that came to us , especially India .
These countries cannot fully implement the construction of a high - speed rail network and they hoped to draw on our experience and technology . ”
So , presumably , all the countries connected to the network would benefit from better transportation options and increased mobility .
However , with China at the center of the process , it is likely to be the biggest winner .
The countries perhaps losing out due to the system ’s development and investment would be those across the ocean who are more reliant on international air travel .
Is China going to make the US ’ HSR network ( if it ever gets built ) look like a toy train set ?
Is this huge system ever going to get built ?
Is it going to get built in 10 years as China hopes ?
With transportation being a central factor influencing economies and power since at least as long back as large - scale transportation options were formed , the answers to these questions are going to be intrinsically tied to the balance of power in the world economy and global society .

Many people the world over love beer , but there are some folks out there who unfortunately , are just not too keen on the stuff .
Often this can be because they ’ve never had a proper introduction to all the different tastes and variety that beer has to offer .
Sadly in America almost all of the beer one will be causally exposed to is exactly one type - the light lager .
This is unfortunate because as we ’ve tried to show , there is an endless array of different flavors and tastes that beer is capable off .
As the craft beer movement continues to grow steadily throughout the US more and more people are encountering new and interesting beers beyond the pilsner to explore .
Unfortunately some folks ’ first encounter with craft beer still may not win them over .
Perhaps they tried a spicy IPA when hops just is n’t for them , or a rich and creamy Guinness when the sweet taste is n’t their style .
Without knowing any better , such an encounter my lead someone to give up on beer entirely .
I believe there is a beer out there for everyone .
It ’s with this in mind that we present some suggestions for how to introduce beer to someone who prefers other types of alcoholic drinks .
Wine –
If you prefer wine you probably enjoy subtle , smooth flavors and may find the sometimes brash and bold tastes of beer to be too much .
If that is the case I would recommend try some nice Belgian beers .
Belgium has a strong brewing history and beers from this small country are regularly regarded as some of the best in the world .
The most famous Belgian beers are actually made by Trappist monks in a tradition dating back centuries .
The Belgian Tripel such as Chimay Tripel is great for white wine drinkers while the double and quad will be good for red wine enthusiasts .
Try Chimay Red or Blue if that ’s what interests you .
Gin – I ’ve always found gin spicy , slightly bitter and smooth .
With this is mind I ’d recommend the hoppier German style beers .
To start with a real pilsner ( not the pale imitation of them passed off by Coors and the like ) is a great place to start .
Prima Pils from Victory is an amazing American craft pilsner .
Sam Adams Noble Pils is also a great new version with a great hop flavor .
A Helles lager like Weihenstephaner Original is also lovely .
Burbon / Whiskey –
If dark and full flavored is your thing , give rye beer a try , with something like Founder ’s Red Rye .
Also Barleywine might suit your tastes , try Serra Nevada Big Foot for that , or Old Horizontal from Victory .
Give a Dopplebock a try too , such as the classic one , Celebrator .
Rum – Sweeter beers might be good for a rum drinker , so something like a milk stout might be a good idea , such as Left Hand Milk Stout .
Wheat wine is also good for this type of taste , my favorite of this style is Smuttynose .
Also a dark wheat beer like a dunkelweizen , say Weihenstephaner Dark , would probably go well also .
Vodka – A beer that ’s clean and smooth might be a good match for a vodka drinker .
For that I ’d recommend something like a Belgian wit .
This style has received a lot of attention thanks to Blue Moon ’s surprising popularity .
Because Blue Moon is made by Coors , some are reluctant to drink it .
Other great examples of the style include Hoegaarden ( owned by Anheuser - Busch ) , Allagash White and Blanche De Chambly from Uniboue .
I do n’t mean to imply with the above recommendations that each type of alcohol tastes similar to beers I ’ve paired with them , but rather that someone who enjoys each alcohol might find similar things to enjoy with each beer .
If you disagree with any of the above suggestions or have a specific question in mind feel free to ask us , either in the comments below , on Twitter or Tumblr .
Cheers !
Though the Grateful Dead were based in the San Francisco Bay area and were closely identified with the psychedelic movement that emerged in the mid-1960s there , Louise Mirrer , president of the historical society , justified the exhibition by referring to the band ’s “ great New York pedigree . ”
The Dead first played New York City in June 1967 and went on to perform here more than 150 times , including many shows at the Fillmore East , which Ms. Mirrer called “ the band ’s home away from home . ”

The larger archive at the university , which has received a $ 615,000 grant from the federal government ’s Institute of Museum and Library Services but is looking for additional financing , will have both a physical and an online presence .
But even before the archive is fully mounted , the historians , sociologists , anthropologists , theologians , musicologists and other academic researchers who make up the growing field known as Grateful Dead Studies are eager to plunge in .
“ We ’re ecstatic with anticipation , ” said Nicholas Meriwether , editor of “ All Graceful Instruments : The Contexts of the Grateful Dead Phenomenon ” and a historian at the University of South Carolina .
“ That archive is a remarkable window not just into Haight - Ashbury and the dawn of the modern rock theater , but to all the documentary evidence and heritage of the counterculture and all the issues historians are concerned about in discussing the 1960s . ”
The archive was one of the subjects talked about last month when the Grateful Dead Scholars Caucus convened in Albuquerque for its 13th annual meeting .
In a journal called Dead Letters some of the researchers have also published essays with titles like “ The Taoist Perspective in ‘ Weather Report Suite , ’ ” and “ How the Music Played the Band : Grateful Dead Improvisation and Merleau - Ponty . ”
“ If I were starting out , I ’d find the archive to be amazing as a way to bring a fresh eye and new perspective to what happened , ” said Rebecca G. Adams , a sociologist at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro who has been researching the Deadhead phenomenon for more than two decades .
“ There are millions of projects people could do . ”
One of the things that often emerge from the climate debate is the problem that few people have a sufficient grasp of any aspect of the climate issue to speak with any authority .
As far as some are concerned , the fact that we are not climate scientists hangs over anything we say here on this blog , for instance , even though what we ’re really interested in are the moral and political dimensions of the debate .
Does every debate about the climate outside of the science academy consist of nothing more than a battle of received wisdoms ?
Are our views about the climate debate formed from nothing more than what the people we trust say ?
That the climate debate is very complicated and seemingly predicated on scientific theory and empirical observation looks like a good reason to exclude non-qualified opinion from the debate .
Yet the desire to exclude non-qualified opinion from the debate about what to do may well be the motivation for such an argument .
Such elitism is everywhere in this debate .
It begins with arguments like George Monbiot ’s in Heat …
It [ the campaign against climate change ] is a campaign not for abundance but for austerity .
It is a campaign not for more freedom but for less .
Strangest of all , it is a campaign not just against other people , but against ourselves .
… And it ends with undemocratic political institutions such as the UK ’s Climate Change Committee and ( if it had succeeded ) the COP15 treaty .
Climate science was the source of all moral authority in the world .
Impeccably well - behaved , selfless and incorruptible scientists laboured tirelessly to understand what Objective Truth Herself said .
Meanwhile , evil , self - interested and unqualified parties had been paid by huge corporations vast sums of money to distort the message that had been spoken by Objective Truth to scientists through Science .
Then Climategate happened , and messed the whole thing up .
Now , of course , George Monbiot has had to apologise because he invested his trust so heavily in “ climate science ” .
When he felt this trust had been broken , he had to call for Phil Jones ’ head .
But as we ’ve been arguing all along , you did n’t need to see what was going on at CRU – which was probably perfectly normal – to know that the arguments produced by every green poseur between Monbiot and Miliband was unsound .
What happens now things are n’t so clear - cut ?
Nature ( magazine ) abhors a ( moral ) vacuum …
In an editorial this week , it said ,
Climate scientists are on the defensive , knocked off balance by a re-energized community of global - warming deniers who , by dominating the media agenda , are sowing doubts about the fundamental science .
So , although even Monbiot seems to have been reflective about the failure that Climategate represented , some seem intent on reanimating the cartoonish categories in the debate .
Blaming “ deniers ” for Climategate , and the disarray experienced by climate activists is a very silly move .
What caused the argument to topple over and to lose credibility was its own structural weakness , not the efforts of deniers .
Too much was expected of climate science .
the onslaught seems to be working : some polls in the United States and abroad suggest that it is eroding public confidence in climate science at a time when the fundamental understanding of the climate system , although far from complete , is stronger than ever .
Ecologist Paul Ehrlich at Stanford University in California says that his climate colleagues are at a loss about how to counter the attacks .
“ Everyone is scared shitless , but they do n’t know what to do , ” he says .
It ’s interesting that Nature chooses an ecologist – and not just any old ecologist – to speak for climate science , and climate scientists .
Ehrlich is just about the last person Nature – which claims to be a ‘ weekly journal of science ’ – ought to turn to for scientific objectivity , or to comment on ‘ attacks on science ’ .
For Ehrlich is not simply famous for having had his own predictions spectacularly fail , he speaks as the re-inventor of Malthusianism and as a passionate advocate of controlling population .
His failed predictions were used as the basis for a political movement once before .
This movement made itself prominent by scaring everyone shitless about the end of the world .
In order to restore the public ’s trust , says the Nature editorial …
scientists must acknowledge that they are in a street fight , and that their relationship with the media really matters .
Anything strategic that can be done on that front would be useful , be it media training for scientists or building links with credible public - relations firms .
In this light , there are lessons to be learned from the current spate of controversies .
For example , the IPCC error was originally caught by scientists , not sceptics .
Had it been promptly corrected and openly explained to the media , in full context with the underlying science , the story would have lasted days , not weeks .
The IPCC must establish a formal process for rapidly investigating and , when necessary , correcting such errors .
It may well have been scientists who found the problem with the 2035 glacier claim .
But it was this humble little blog which found the baseless ‘ 50 % of crops in Africa ’ claim in IPCC WGII .
What Nature still does n’t get is that the claims made in IPCC reports – never mind their errors – no matter how forcefully they are presented in their “ full context with the underlying science ” , are not presented in their full context with the underlying politics .
Ehrlich ’s politics preceded the science .
And so it is with the arguments the IPCC ’s projections towards climate catastrophe .
The Malthusian dynamic that Ehrlich reinvented in fact works for species of animals .
But humans are different because we can respond to our circumstances .
In order to make his theory work for human society , Ehrlich has to rule out the possibility of human agency .
This is the premise of so much environmental alarmism , including that which is now pushed in Nature .
The editorial later reminds that , “ the core science supporting anthropogenic global warming has not changed ” .
But Nature forgets that something exists prior to “ the core science ” , and that is the presupposition of impotence .
Nature continue :
Public trust in scientists is based not just on their competence , but also on their perceived objectivity and openness .
Researchers would be wise to remember this at all times , even when casually e-mailing colleagues .
..
And perhaps when they are blocking FOI requests …
Public trust in science has little to do with the ascendency of the environmental message .
In fact , what has driven the greening of politics is hinted at in the Nature editorial : “ polls consistently show that people trust scientists more than almost anybody else to give honest advice ” .
As public trust in politics has waned , so politicians ’ have had to seek new ways of establishing legitimate authority .
And so aimless politicians have hidden their hollow political visions behind “ science ” and crises such as those constructed by Ehrlich .
Ehrlich penned his gloomy tome as the incredible post - war economic boom came to a close , and the optimism of the White Heat moment began to flicker and dim .
Thanks to Ehrlich ’s prophecies , politicians no longer had to make promises about how they were going to make the world a better place , but instead just had to point to the looming ecological crisis to explain why they could n’t .
Science , which had once put people on the moon , is now being used to limit peoples ’ expectations .
The only sensible comment from nature is that “ Scientists must not be so naive as to assume that the data speak for themselves ” .
And yet that is precisely what scientists and politicians have done .
The claims that “ the science is in ” , “ the science is settled ” , “ the debate is over ” , and the casting of this debate as one between “ science ” and those who wish to “ attack science ” all do exactly that .
They obscure the fact that a great many presuppositions and prejudices lie behind and hidden by “ the science ” .
The consequence is that , as it is revealed that climate science simply cannot bear the weight of the moral and political claims that are invested in it , trust in science will be eroded .
It is those who are passing themselves off as the “ defenders of science ” who will be responsible .
We 've heard the stats about women and social gaming .
Nearly half of women play online games .
So Lifetime , in their pursuit to learn about all things women - related , conducted a year - long , in - depth study to go inside the minds of women gamers .

They like casual gaming like Farmville and Fashion Wars .
They buy more console games then men .
Even Nintendo is marketing to them .
Kris Soumas , head of games for AETN Digital Media , and Matt Lashey , vice president of strategic insights for Lifetime , said they surveyed gaming CEOs , talked to a pool of men , and surveyed to more than a 1,000 women about their habits and opinions about gaming .
The result is Lifetime 's report , She 's Got Game : Women & Gaming Study .

Lifetime plans to offer these stats and details to marketers and advertisers , and use them for their own game - building pursuits .
Lifetime Game Studios Korea , is headquartered in Seoul , and they also own Roiworld .com stateside .
Here 's just a few stats based on their study : Women play online more than men ( 55 % vs. 45 % ) .
Women play more frequently ( and differently ) than men .
A majority of women gamers like to play on their own ( 83 % ) .
Many women say they play to compete against other people ( 47 % ) .
They made 7 game - related buys in the past year .

They also put women into several separate categories : immersives , competitors , bonders , dabblers and minders .
One web supervisor at a university , described as an " immersive , " says she can " play forever " and likes games like Left 4 Dead and God of War .
Other women gamers , like bonders , love getting physical when gaming , and see it as a great way to connect with their family .

When I was first getting started with Ruby , I heard a lot of talk about blocks , and how you could " cast " them to Procs by using the & operator when calling methods .
Last week , in comments about my last post ( Ruby is NOT a Callable Oriented Language ( It ’s Object Oriented ) ) , I heard that claim again .
To be honest , I never really thought that much about it , and the idea of " casting " a block to a Proc never took hold in my mental model , but when discussing my post with a number of people , I realized that a lot of people have this concept in their mental model of Ruby .
It is not part of Ruby 's semantics .
In some cases , Ruby 's internal implementation performs optimizations by eliminating the creation of objects until you specifically ask for them .
Those optimizations are completely invisible , and again , not part of Ruby 's semantics .
Let 's look at a few examples .
Blocks vs. Procs
Consider the following scenarios :
def foo yield end def bar ( &block ) puts block .object_id baz( &block ) end def baz ( & block ) puts block .
object_id yield end foo { puts " HELLO " } # => " HELLO " bar { puts " HELLO " } #= > " 2148083200
2148083200
HELLO "
Here , I have three methods using blocks in different ways .
In the first method ( foo ) , I do n't specify the block at all , yielding to the implicit block .
In the second case , I specify a block parameter , print its object_id , and then send it on to the baz method .
In the third case , I specify the block , print out its object_id and yield to the block .
In Ruby 's semantics , these three uses are identical .
In the first case , yield calls an implicit Proc object .
In the second case , it takes an explicit Proc , then sends it on to the next method .
In the last case , it takes an explicit Proc , but yields to the implicit copy of the same object .
So what 's the & thing for ?
In Ruby , in addition to normal arguments , methods can receive a Proc in a special slot .
All methods can receive such an argument , and Procs passed in that slot are silently ignored if not yielded to :
def foo puts " HELLO " end foo { something_crazy } # => " HELLO "
On the other hand , if you want a method to receive a Proc in that slot , and thus be able to yield to it , you specify that by prefixing it with an & :
def foo yield end my_proc = Proc.new { puts " HELLO " } foo( &my_proc )
Here , you 're telling the foo method that my_proc is not a normal argument ; it should be placed into the proc slot and made available to yield .
Additionally , if you want access to the Proc object , you can give it a name :
def foo( &block ) puts block .
object_id yield end foo { puts " HELLO " } #= > " 2148084320
HELLO "
This simply means that you want access to the implicit Proc in a variable named block .
Because , in most cases , you 're passing in a block ( using do / end or {} ) , and calling it using yield , Ruby provides some syntax sugar to make that simple case more pleasing .
That does not , however , mean that there is a special block construct in Ruby 's semantics , nor does it mean that the & is casting the a block to a Proc .
You can tell that blocks are not being semantically wrapped and unwrapped because blocks passed along via & share the same object_id across methods .
Mental Models
For the following code there are two possible mental models .
def foo( &block ) puts block .
object_id yield end b = Proc.new { puts " OMG " } puts b.object_id foo( &b ) #=> 2148084040
2148084040
OMG
In the first , the &b unwraps the Proc object , and the &block recasts it into a Proc .
However , it somehow also wraps it back into the same wrapper that it came from into the first place .
In the second , the &b puts the b Proc into the block slot in foo 's argument list , and the &block gives the implicit Proc a name .
There is no need to explain why the Proc has the same object_id ; it is the same Object !
These two mental models are perfectly valid ( the first actually reflects Ruby 's internal implementation ) .
I claim that those who want to use the first mental model have the heavy burden of introducing the new concept to the Ruby language of a non - object block , and that as a result , it should be generally rejected .
Metaclasses
Similarly , in Ruby 's internal implementation , an Object does not get a metaclass until you ask for one .
obj = Object.new # internally , obj does not have a metaclass here obj.to_s # internally , Ruby skips right up to Object when searching for #to_s , since # it knows that no metaclass exists def obj.hello puts " HELLO " end # now , Ruby internally rewrites obj 's class pointer to point to a new internal # metaclass which has the hello method on it obj.to_s #
Now , Ruby searches obj's metaclass before jumping up to Object obj.to_s #
Now , Ruby skips the search because it 's already cached the method # lookup
All of the comments in the above snippet are correct , but semantically , none of them are important .
In all cases , Ruby is semantically looking for methods in obj 's metaclass , and when it does n't find any , it searches higher up .
In order to improve performance , Ruby skips creating a metaclass if no methods or modules are added to an object 's metaclass , but that does n't change Ruby 's semantics .
It 's just an optimization .
By thinking in terms of Ruby 's implementation , instead of Ruby 's semantics , you are forced to think about a mutable class pointer and consider the possibility that an object has no metaclass .
Mental Models
Again , there are two possible mental models .
In the first , Ruby objects have a class pointer , which they manipulate to point to new metaclass objects which are created only when methods or modules are added to an object .
Additionally , Ruby objects have a method cache , which they use to store method lookups .
When a method is looked up twice , in this mental model , some classes are skipped because Ruby already knows that they do n't have the method .
In the second mental model , all Ruby objects have a metaclass , and method lookup always goes through the metaclass and up the superclass chain until a method is found .
As before , I claim that those who want to impose the first mental model on Ruby programmers have the heavy burden of introducing the new concepts of " class pointer " and " method cache " , which are not Ruby objects and have no visible implications on Ruby semantics .
Regular Expression Matches
In Ruby , certain regular expression operations create implicit local variables that reflect parts of the match :
def foo ( str ) str =~ /e(. ) l/ p $ ~ p $ ` p $ ' p $ 1 p $ 2 end foo ( " hello " ) # => #< MatchData " ell " 1 : " l " >
" h "
" o "
" l "
nil
This behavior is mostly inherited from Perl , and Matz has said a few times that he would not support Perl 's backrefs if he had it to do over again .
However , the provide another opportune example of implicit objects in Ruby .
Mental Models
In this case , there are three possible mental models .
In the first mental model , if you do n't use any $ local variables , they do n't exist .
When you use a specific one , it springs into existence .
For instance , when using $ 1 , Ruby looks at some internal representation of the last match and retrieves the last capture .
If you use $ ~ , Ruby creates a MatchData object out of it .
In the second mental model , when you call a method that uses regular expressions , Ruby walks back up the stack frames , and inserts the $ local variables on it when it finds the original caller .
If you later use the variables , they are already there .
Ruby must be a little bit clever , because the most recent frame on the stack ( which might include C frames , Java frames , or internal Ruby frames in Rubinius ) is not always the calling frame .
In the last mental model , when you call a method that uses regular expressions , there is an implicit match object available ( similar to the implicit Proc object that is available in methods ) .
The $ ~ variable is mapped to that implicit object , while the $ 1 variable is the equivalent of $ ~ [ 1 ] .
Again , this last mental model introduces the least burdensome ideas into Ruby .
The first mental model introduces the idea of an internal representation of the last match , while the second mental model ( which again , has the upside of being how most implementations actually do it ) introduces the concept of stack frames , which are not Ruby objects .
The last mental model uses an actual Ruby object , and does not introduce new concepts .
Again , I prefer it .
Conclusion
In a number of places , it is possible to imbue Ruby semantics with mental models that reflect the actual Ruby implementation , or the fact that it 's possible to imagine that a Ruby object only springs into existence when it is asked for .
However , these mental models require that Ruby programmers add non-objects to the semantics of Ruby , and requiring contortions to explain away Ruby 's own efforts to hide these internals from the higher - level constructs of the language .
For instance , while Ruby internally wraps and unwraps Procs when passing them to methods , it makes sure that the Proc object attached to a block is always the same , in an effort to hide the internal details from programmers .
As a result , explaining Ruby 's semantics in terms of these internals requires contortions and new constructs that are not natively part of Ruby 's object model , and those explanations should be avoided .
To be clear , I am not arguing that it 's not useful to understand Ruby 's implementation .
It can , in fact , be quite useful , just as it's useful to understand how C's calling convention works under the covers .
However , just as day - to - day programmers in C do n't need to think about the emitted Assembler , day - to - day Ruby programmers do n't need to think about the implementation .
And finally , just as C implementations are free to use different calling conventions without breaking existing processor - agnostic C ( or the mental model that C programmers use ) , Ruby implementations are free to change the internal implementation of these constructs without breaking pure - Ruby code or the mental model Ruby programmers use .
NEW YORK used to be a second - string city when it came to coffee .
No longer .
Over the last two years , more than 40 new cafes and coffee bars have joined a small , dedicated group of establishments where coffee making is treated like an art , or at least a high form of craft .
At places like Bluebird Coffee Shop in the East Village , the espresso is so plush and bright that it tastes sweet on its own .
The elaborate designs in the cappuccino ’s foam at Third Rail Coffee in the West Village are n’t just to show off , but are a sign that the barista properly steamed the milk so that it holds its form .
At Abraço in the East Village , you can get drip coffee brewed by the cup , not drawn from an urn .
For years New Yorkers had to look to places like Stumptown Coffee Roasters in Portland , Ore. , or Blue Bottle Coffee in San Francisco for this kind of quality .
Now both companies have opened roasters and coffee bars in New York .
Four Barrel Coffee of San Francisco will be roasting here soon .

The last four games the Atlanta Thrashers have blocked an incredible 62 shots ( while their opposition blocked just 32 ) .
Their positional defense was very good in the home - and - home sweep of Philadelphia .
But the key indicator of team success in the post - Kovalchuk era has been their offensive output .
Since the big trade the Thrashers have played 16 games .
When the Thrashers score three goals or more the team 's record is 8 - 0 - 2 and when they score 2 goals or less their record is 0 - 5 - 1 .
That is a pretty stark difference .
Three goals has been the tipping point .
How about defense ?
When the Thrasher allow 2 or fewer their record is 5 - 2 - 1 and when they allow 3 or more their record is 3 - 3 - 2 .
Obviously , they are better when they allow fewer goals , but the difference is not as stark as the offensive side of things .
The Thrashers face an enormous game on Tuesday night against the Bruins .
A win on Tuesday would put them in possession of 8th place ( although Boston would have one game in hand ) .
As a hockey watcher I 'm tremendously excited about the fact that they have put together an unlikely hot streak to claw their way back into this race .
During the 5 games loss streak , I remarked to a friend " I can deal with not making the playoffs , but it sure would have been nice for them to stay in this thing and battle right down to the final weekend . "
Well it looks like my wish might actually happen now .
Even if the Thrashers do beat the Bruins , they face some daunting obstacles .
There are also some very tough teams coming up on the end of the season schedule .
Once they get past them , they face teams that have been eliminated -- but those clubs are playing for pride and for jobs and they can easily beat the Thrashers if they let up in the effort department .
Lately the Thrasher have benefited from good fortune in terms of facing Brian Boucher twice and catching both Ottawa and Philly on a downswing .
On the long run that sort of luck tends to even out .
On the flip side , the Thrashers could stay lucky in the short run , sometimes you flip a coin and you get a series of " heads " even if the coin is fair .
There are only 10 more games left in the season -- a victory over the Bruins and 6 wins after that might be enough to put them into the post - season party .
If the Thrashers manage to go 7 - 3 over the last ten , all it would take is a 6 - 5 record by Boston or a 4 - 6 record by Philadelphia or Ottawa and Atlanta slips in .
If just one of those teams teams ( BOS , PHI , OTT ) keep struggling over the final weeks the door is open for a hard working and lucky Thrashers squad .
Can they keep the offense flowing ?
Can they keep scoring enough goals to pull that off ?
Can they get the Power Play to heat up ?
Who will step up and get hot next ?

As death toll from fatal house fires increases
Mayor plans to relocate poor residents to “ downsize ” Detroit
By Jerry White
9 March 2010
A spate of fatal house fires has occurred in Detroit since the beginning of the year , the majority of which have claimed victims who had their electrical and gas service cut off by the utility giant DTE Energy .
The tragedies — including a January 5 fire on Dexter Ave. that killed two disabled men and a third resident , and a March 4 blaze on Bangor Street , which claimed the lives of three small children — occur as city officials are outlining plans to force residents out of poor neighborhoods and bulldoze their houses in order to eliminate sewerage , public lighting , fire protection and other services to whole swaths of the city .
Meanwhile , the mayor is continuing to gut basic services to the population .
The Detroit Free Press reported Monday that Mayor David Bing ’s administration is “ exploring consolidating the city ’s health and human services department , closing the Herman Kiefer health complex and shuttering all but two Neighborhood City Halls , ” in order to save $ 2 million a year .
Although the cost of providing health services at Herman Kiefer is largely picked up by the federal government , city officials complain that the physical upkeep of the aging facility is costing $ 1 million a year .
The bigger question being asked by the Bing administration , the Free Press quotes Bing official Charles Beckham as saying , is “ should we be in the business of providing health services at all . ”
The facility — which services 2,000 people a day — is one of the only public health sites in the city , and for decades has provided poor Detroiters with the only access to vaccinations , HIV testing , health fairs and other services .
With an infant mortality rate already equivalent to that of the Dominican Republic and ill health chronically pervasive throughout the city , the closing of Kiefer will have deadly consequences .
From the moment he took office Mayor Bing , a multimillionaire and former CEO of a steel and auto parts manufacturer in Detroit , has declared a war on the working class of the city , laying off more than a 1,000 workers , demanding draconian wage cuts from the remaining workforce , and slashing services .
Along with the governor - appointed emergency financial director of the Detroit schools , Bing has overseen the closing of scores of schools and a series of attacks on the living standards and working conditions of teachers .
Detroit has become a model for the Obama administration ’s reactionary urban policy , which includes “ shrinking ” cities , ” like Detroit , which have been decimated by decades of industrial decline and budget cutting .
In the last two years alone tens of thousands of auto jobs in the area have been wiped out , including those shed under the White House ’s forced bankruptcy of GM and Chrysler .
With the backing of the Obama administration , including a $ 40 million federal award for “ renewal work , ” Bing is embarking on a plan to expel poor residents from “ desolate ” neighborhoods and supposedly relocate them to more “ stable ” areas .
According to the Detroit News , the Democratic Party - aligned “ Brookings Institution , local foundation leaders , several national funding groups and the White House offered financial support of up to $ 100 million a year for downsizing the city . ”
Bruce Katz , vice president of the Brookings ’ Metropolitan Policy Program , told the News , “ There is a nothing - left - to - lose quality in Detroit , much like there was in New Orleans after Katrina . ”
Speaking on local radio news station WJR last month , Bing said the relocation idea was “ absolutely ” part of his plans to slash costs .
“ There is just too much land and too many expenses for us to continue to manage the city as we have in the past . ”
He continued , “ You ca n’t support every neighborhood .
You can support every community across this city .
Those communities that are stable , we ca n’t allow them to go down the tubes .
That ’s not a good business decision from my standpoint . ”
Bing said he would use internal and outside studies to determine who the “ winners and losers ” would be .
“ If we can incentivize some of the folks that are in those desolate areas , they can get a better situation .
If they stay where they are I absolutely cannot give them all the services that they require . ”
In identifying “ stable ” neighborhoods , Bing said , he was also looking at neighborhoods surrounding schools that Emergency Financial Manager Robert Bobb previously singled out for spending , the Michigan news web site MLive.com reported .
This makes it clear that the mayor and Bobb are working in tandem to shut down services , including public schools , in the poorest neighborhoods and channel money into areas where only better - off segments of the population will be able to afford to live .
In the end , this will mean driving the poor out of the city .
To where , would be anyone ’s guess .
The decline of Detroit — whose population has fallen from 2 million in 1950 to around 900,000 today — is likely unparalleled in modern history , with the exception of cities destroyed by war and natural disasters .
This devastation was the deliberate policy of the corporate and political establishment that beginning in the 1970s and 1980s waged an unrelenting war against the working class in the city , which through its mass struggles had attained the highest per capita income in America .
After three decades of plant closings and mass layoffs , Detroit has become the poorest big city in America .
Having rejected any measures to provide jobs and attract workers back into the city , such as a mass public works project to hire the unemployed and rebuild Detroit , the Obama administration and Bing are seeking to plunge the final knife into the city , with unprecedented social consequences .
A recent survey showed that a third of Detroit ’s residential parcels are either vacant lots or abandoned homes .
Detroit ’s unused lots are the largest of any city in the country .
According to an Associated Press story Monday , the mayor ’s “ radical renewal plan calls for turning large swaths of this now - blighted , rusted - out city into the fields and farmland that existed before the automobile …
Roughly a quarter of the 139 - square - mile city could go from urban to semi-rural . ”
The proposals for “ urban farming ” are largely fantasies to provide a “ Green ” façade to the destruction of what was once America ’s fourth largest city and a manufacturing center for the global auto industry .
Having largely destroyed the city , the Democratic Party is now parceling off its most attractive assets — the mayor has hinted that he plans to privatize the city ’s Public Lighting Department by selling it to DTE Energy — and open up large tracts of cheap land for private investment .
The city is reportedly planning to offer residents 125 percent of the value of their homes , which have fallen in some cases to a few thousand dollars .
It is also reportedly planning to use Eminent Domain laws to remove those that resist , seize their homes and flatten them .
The “ legal ” justification for the seizure of personal homes will reportedly include the dubious constitutional argument that a single house remaining in an otherwise abandoned neighborhood is “ blighting ” the city because it requires fire and other services to the detriment of the larger community .
In addition to other business interests , there is little doubt that Bing ’s downsizing plans have the backing of DTE Energy , whose CEO Anthony Earley was one of the mayor ’s campaign fundraisers .
Shutting down large portions of the city would reduce the cost of maintaining power and gas lines and give the company ’s “ Revenue Protection Department ” a smaller area to patrol when it comes to discontinuing service for non-payment or for those who have jerry - rigged electrical service in a desperate attempt to maintain heat for their families in the winter .
According to press reports , the Brookings Institution in a recent study identified another 50 cities besides Detroit , including Philadelphia , Pittsburgh , Baltimore and Memphis , which need to “ shrink . ”
In Michigan , the former center of GM ’s manufacturing empire , the city of Flint is planning similar measures in a plan overseen by former Democratic congressman Dale Kildee .

Skyrocketing phone and television prices are a key area of concern for the CRTC , but the regulator has no easy answers for fixing the problem , according to a report issued this week .
" Although it requires further study , it appears that bundling strategies are having the effect of enabling service providers to maintain price levels , " the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission said in its lengthy Navigating Convergence report , released on Tuesday .
" With the exception of internet pricing ( which has fallen slightly ) , telephone and [ television ] pricing has been on an upward trajectory in comparison with the overall consumer price index . "
The regulator said cable and phone companies are using bundled services — where customers are offered a package of phone , wireless , television and internet — as their main " competitive weapon " because subscribers with multiple services are less likely to defect to a competitor .
Once locked in , the companies are raising prices at a higher rate than standard consumer inflation , the regulator said .
This is a problem not just because consumers are paying more but also because alternative competitors — some of whom can only offer a single service — are put at a disadvantage .
" It seems unlikely that in the short - to mid-term , the most sophisticated bundles of internet / phone / television ( the ' triple play ' ) will be offered by any other than the incumbent facilities - based providers , " the CRTC said .
" Competitor inability to offer triple - and quad - play services has the potential to entrench the dominant position held by incumbent facilities - based providers . "
Phone services were deregulated in 2006 after an order from the federal government .
Then Industry Minister Maxime Bernier said that by allowing phone companies such as Bell and Telus to set their own prices , consumers would benefit from more choice and flexibility .
Numbers from the CRTC report show that that has not happened and that prices have climbed .
Television costs , meanwhile , have skyrocketed since deregulation in 2002 .
Estimates have pegged the increase in a typical bill at 70 per cent over that time .
Television providers have said the higher costs are the result of additional and improved services , such as digital and high - definition .
About 90 per cent of Canadian households subscribe to television services , the CRTC said .
Handful of gatekeepers
New wireless companies such as Wind Mobile and Mobilicity will help boost competition and lower cellphone prices , but their overall effect will be mitigated by " the continued popularity of bundles and continued contract provisions , " the report said .
The CRTC anticipates it will have to review certain regulations and even consider re-regulating other areas in the next few years in order to counter potentially anti-competitive actions from converged service providers such as Bell , Rogers , Telus and Shaw .
" Consumer protection is likely to become a more important consideration for the commission in the mid-term as a handful of providers establish themselves as the primary gatekeepers to all manner of communications services using digital technologies , " it said .
The report played down the idea of lifting foreign ownership restrictions — identified by many industry analysts , including a federally appointed panel , as a major cause of the lack of competition in the industry — as a solution .
Foreign companies have little incentive to fund local programming , the CRTC said , which runs counter to the regulator 's main purpose as a protector of Canadian culture .
" Should legislative changes occur that permit greater foreign participation in the Canadian communications landscape , there may be a requirement to examine enforcement mechanisms and regulatory tools to ensure that non-Canadian entities comply with Canadian regulations designed to achieve ... cultural and consumer objectives , " the report said .
Wide - ranging report
According to a CRTC spokesman , the report was a wide - ranging " state of the union " study designed to outline areas of regulatory concern for the near term .
It was not meant to prescribe or predict any action , he said .
The report identified the internet 's disruptive influence on traditional telecommunications and broadcasting business models in Canada and suggested that a more holistic approach will be needed to regulating these markets in the future .
New copyright legislation and a national digital strategy is needed so that the regulator has a better framework from which to work , it said .
The CRTC would also like to work more closely with Industry Canada and Canadian Heritage in determining how issues such as the subsidization of Canadian content should be handled in the internet age .
With an increasing number of telecommunications and broadcasting options becoming available online , the revenue that traditional service providers used to earn is becoming fragmented , the report said .
In the near term , this will force a reconsideration of requirements to fund Canadian programming , as well as subsidized services such as universal phone access .
" The provision of programming has transcended one - way broadcasting models and can no longer be technologically constrained to geographically based providers , " the report said .
" Initiatives aimed at the preservation of Canadian programming and the protection of consumers may be increasingly required in the programming sphere . "
For the time being , the CRTC report said , the status quo can be maintained in most services .
Geo-blocking technologies that prevent Canadians from accessing television programming on U.S. websites , for example , seem to be working , so no immediate action is needed .
" At this point , it may be premature to suggest either the extension of existing regulatory structures to new services , or the loosening of regulation on incumbent entities , " the CRTC said .
When I was young I thought busy people were more important than everyone else .
Otherwise , why would they be so busy ?
I had busy bosses , busy parents , and I assumed they must have meaningful things to do .
It seemed an easy way to see who mattered and who did n’t .
The busy must matter more , and the lazy mattered less .
This is the cult of busy .
That simply by always seeming to have something to do , we all assume a person is important or successful .
It explains the behavior of many people at work .
By appearing busy , others bother them less , and simultaneously believe they ’re doing well at their job .
It ’s quite a trick .
I now believe the opposite to be true .
Or the near opposite .
Here ’s why :
Time is the singular measure of life .
It ’s one of the few things you can not get more of .
Knowing how to use it well is possibly the most important skill you can have .
.
It ’s one of the few things you can not get more of .
Knowing how to use it well is possibly the most important skill you can have .
The person who gets a job done in one hour will seem less busy than the one who can only do it in five .
How busy a person seems is not necessarily indicative of the quality of their results .
Someone who is better at something might very well seem less busy , because they are more effective .
Results matter more than the time spent to achieve them .

Being in demand can have good and bad causes .
Someone with a line of people waiting to talk to them outside their office door at work seems busy , and therefore seems important .
But somehow the clerk running the slowest supermarket checkout line in the universe is n’t praised in the same way ; it means they ’re ineffective .
People who are at the center of everything are n’t necessarily good at what they do ( although they might be ) .
The bar of being busy falls far well below the bar of being good .

The compulsion to save time may lead nowhere .
If you ’re always cutting corners to save time , when exactly are you using the time you ’ve saved ?
There is this illusion some day in the future you get back all the time you ’ve squirreled away in one big chunk .
I do n’t think time works this way .
For most Americans , it seems most of our time savings goes straight into watching television .
That ’s where all the time savings we think we get actually goes .

The phrase “ I do n’t have time for … ” should never be said .
We all get the same amount of time every day .
If you ca n’t do something it ’s not about the quantity of time .
It ’s really about how important the task is to you .
I ’m sure if you were having a heart attack , you ’d magically find time to go to the hospital .
That time would come from something else you ’d planned to do , but now seems less important .
This is how time works all the time .
What people really mean when they say “ I do n’t have time ” is this thing is not important enough to earn my time .
It ’s a polite way to tell people that they , or their request , is not important to you .
This means people who are always busy are time poor .
They have a time shortage .
They have time debt .
They are either trying to do too much , or they are n’t doing what they ’re doing very well .
They are failing to either a ) be effective with their time b ) do n’t know what they ’re trying to effect , so they scramble away at trying to optimize for everything , which leads to optimizing nothing .
On the other hand , people who truly have control over time have some in their pocket to give to someone in need .
They have a sense of priorities that drive their use of time and can shift away from the specific ordinary work that ’s easy to justify , in favor of the more ethereal , deeper things that are harder to justify .
They protect their time from trivia and idiocy .
These people are time rich .
They provide themselves with a surplus of time .
They might seem to idle , or to relax , more often than the rest , but that may be a sign of their mastery not their incompetence .
I deliberately try not to fill my calendar .
I choose not to say Yes to everything .
To do so would make me too busy , and I think , less effective at what my goals are .
I always want to have some margin of my time in reserve , time I ’m free to spend in any way I choose , including doing almost nothing at all .
I ’m free to take detours .
I ’m open to serendipity .
Some of the best thinkers throughout history had some of their best thoughts while going for walks , playing cards with friends , little things that generally would not be considered the hallmarks of busy people .
It ’s the ability to pause , to reflect , and relax , to let the mind wander , that ’s perhaps the true sign of time mastery , for when the mind returns it ’s often sharper and more efficient , but most important perhaps , happier than it was before .

Invariably , there comes a time in each teams season when the fan base can either start looking forward to the playoffs ( Detroit , this will soon be you ) or shrug , sigh , get over it , and then wonder who will be available at the NHL Entry Draft .
And when that time comes , many hockey patrons join a very small group of consumers who seemingly want LESS for their money because they feel that being in 15th place in the conference is more desirable than 9th .
With the Stars win last night they jumped from 13th to 10th in the standings , and consequently from 10th to 13th in draft order .
Draft Order Team Points 1 Oilers 55 2 Bruins 64 3 Islanders 68 4 Hurricanes 69 5 Blue Jackets 70 6 Lightning 70 7 Panthers 71 8 Rangers 71 9 Thrashers 75 10 Wild 76 11 Ducks 76 12 Blues 77 13 Stars 78 14 Flames 83
Repeating last years # 8 position is looking unlikely with 9 games to play .
Dallas needs only 5 points to tie last years ' output , but the East really brought it 's game this year , hogging all the top spots ( apart from those magnificent Oilers ) .
Ironically , there are teams like the Thrashers who are in better draft AND playoff position than the Stars .
That 's life in the West .
With 10 % of the season yet to be played out , would fans really rather they lose ?
Some say that once the writing is on the wall , the players slump their shoulders and apathy sets in .
I disagree , but not entirely .
It 's natural for the compete level to come down a little bit , but once the puck drops and the in game battles commence , it 's plain to see that they still want to win these games .
You can't take the competitive nature out of professional athletes .
Athletes do n't care about draft position .
The only way to tank in the NHL , or any sport for that matter , is to remove the players from the games themselves , and that 's just not done in hockey .
In basketball you can shutdown an " ailing " superstar and essentially tank your season .
You can trot a rookie QB in football and expect to continue losing .
No one admits these things happen , but sometimes they do .
Besides , there are still story - lines to be played out .
Can Kari Lehtonen continue to improve ?
Can Jamie Benn pass 20 goals in his rookie year ?
Can Mike Modano get back on the ice ?
Will Marty Turco be given a proper " goodbye home game " ?
I 'd like to see all of those things happen , and happen within the context of winning .
Still , picking 14th or 3rd , we have to educate ourselves as June and a reportedly deep draft approach .
Mike Heika says the Stars might want to turn their attentions toward collegiate players ...
The Stars have signed a few collegiate free agents in the past , including Tyler Shelast out of Michigan Tech ( still in the organization ) and Hobey Baker winners Marty Sertich out of Colorado College and Junior Lessard out of Minnesota - Duluth .
Sertich and Lessard speak to the success rate that Nieuwendyk is talking about , as both moved out of the Stars organization and stayed in the AHL .
Lessard is now playing in Europe .
But the new GM insists that the team will be a part of aggressive scouting of any potential free agents .
`` I think you definitely have to look everywhere you can for help , '' he said .
`` They have done that in the past here , and we 'll definitely keep it up . ''
Here 's a list of some undrafted college players .

We were too uncivilized to set much value on personal belongings .
We wanted to have things only in order to give them away .
We had no money , and therefore a man ’s worth could n’t be measured by it .
We had no written law , no attorney or politicians , therefore we could n’t cheat .
We were in a really bad way before the white man came , and I do n’t know how we managed to get along without the basic things which , we are told , are absolutely necessary to make a civilized society .

I have a new book coming out , and I am very excited about it !
It has horror and comedy and sad bits and bits of baby on the floor , and it is called One Bloody Thing After Another and you can buy it at that link !
To celebrate , I am gonna be posting stories and things that I have n't posted before , or which have somehow gone missing from the internet .
If you like them , show them to people and maybe subtly suggest that they buy my new books for twelve of their very best friends ?
Or just enjoy the story .
That 's probably just as good , to be honest .
Here 's a story from It 's Too Late to Say I'm Sorry .
prohibitionist RI governor Donald Carcieri
A special Rhode Island legislative commission created to review and assess marijuana policy has endorsed decriminalizing the possession of up to an ounce of marijuana .
The decision came Tuesday , when the Special Senate Panel on Marijuana Prohibition endorsed a report calling for decriminalization
Led by Sen. Joshua Miller ( D - Cranston ) , the panel concluded in the report that " marijuana law reform " could save the state valuable funds by ending " costly arrests and incarcerations due to simple possession of marijuana . "
Estimates of the savings ranged from $ 232,000 to $ 12.7 million .
Under current Rhode Island law , possession of less than an ounce is a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail and a $ 500 fine .
Although few people are actually jailed for simple possession in Rhode Island , some 399 have been since 2007 , and have served an average of 3 1/2 months .
Also , the consequences of even a misdemeanor criminal conviction can have an adverse impact on people for years .
The panel voted to approve the proposal by a vote of 11 - 2 .
The no votes came from law enforcement representatives , who warned that marijuana was " dangerous . "
The report and its recommendations now go before the full Senate .
BHOPAL : Four infants aged below two years died and 17 children fell ill after they were administered an anti-measles and tetanus vaccine at Anganwadi centres in Damoh town , in Madhya Pradesh .
Around 20 infants were administered the vaccine at two Anganwadi centres in Damoh on Friday afternoon .
By Sunday afternoon , four of these infants were dead while the others had been admitted to a local hospital in a critical condition .
Preliminary investigation by district health officials revealed that the tragedy was caused due to the negligence of a nurse .
The district administration has suspended all vaccination programmes and instructed health officials to stop further immunization until the investigation into the incident was complete .
Samples from the vaccines administered to the infants have been sent for examination to New Delhi .
Chief medical and health officer Dr DK Shrivastava said that the " cold - chain or sub - zero temperature under which the vaccine has to be stored seemed to have been ignored or broken " .
A district hospital nurse , responsible for supply of the vaccines to the Anganwadi workers , has been booked for negligence and destruction of evidence .
According to SP DK Arya , the nurse had taken vaccines home in a thermos flask and stored it overnight in her refrigerator .
Next day she brought back the flask and distributed the vaccines to the Anganwadi workers .
Oh sure , this might not accelerate to ludicrous speed in 3 seconds flat , and it might not look like something Jules Verne brought back from the future , but it is the one electro - vehicular concept we can reliably expect to see hit retail in 2011 .
Indian carmaker Tata promised us an eco-friendly version of its ultra- affordable Nano , and what you see above is the corporeal fulfillment of that pledge .
Our comrades at Autoblog report that the Nano EV will go into production alongside the Indica Vista EV and should be available to buy at some point next year .
As far as we 're concerned , when it comes to cars other people have to drive , this might be at the very top of our list .

Soca report into forgeries used in Dubai killing says personal data was stolen in border checks
Passing through Israel 's Ben Gurion airport , a few miles east of Tel Aviv , is a unique experience no first - time visitor is likely to forget .
It represents the pinnacle of modern aviation security .
Baggage is passed through giant , state - of - the - art machines , and travellers – both arriving and leaving – are frequently subjected to lengthy , personal and repetitive questioning by officials , on their ethnic background and that of any local acquaintances they may have made .
It is not at all uncommon for the mostly youthful immigration officers to wander off , passports and tickets in hand , ostensibly to consult with their seniors .
Surrendering documents at check - in or at immigration has hitherto been considered a necessary evil for all those travelling in and out of Ben Gurion .
But the evidence that the Israeli state has been taking the information gleaned from these inspections to create cloned identities for its spies introduces a new level of risk to the experience .
The report by the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency ( Soca ) into the use of cloned British passports in the Dubai assassination makes clear their view that this is what happened as Britons travelled through the airport in the months and years before the plot was hatched to kill the Hamas commander Mahmoud al - Mabhouh .
The Soca report concluded that the passports must have been cloned at the airport or at other interfaces with Israeli officialdom , such as airline offices in other countries .
There were no other links between the 12 individuals whose identities were stolen .
According to insiders , the language in the Soca report , produced after a four - week investigation , was " direct " and the findings unequivocal : the inquiry showed that the victims ' data was taken , stored and passed on when they handed their passports to Israeli officials or those linked to them .
" We can not pin it on individuals , but the evidence draws us to the conclusion that the only place these passports could have been cloned is when they were inspected at the Israeli border or in other countries , where they were passed to Israelis , " said one source .
In some cases , this information theft had taken place several years before the assassination .
One of the Britons involved told investigators he had not travelled out of Israel for more than two years .
Soca concluded the report on their findings last week and handed it to the Home Office on Friday , which passed it to the Foreign Office on Monday .
It then moved from the criminal sphere to the diplomatic , as the foreign secretary , David Miliband , translated the raw findings into concrete measures to be taken against Israel : the expulsion of a diplomat and a travel warning that Israeli officials were not to be entrusted with passports .
The foreign secretary 's decision to accuse Israel directly in parliament yesterday reflected both the certainty among British officials of Israeli state involvement , and the anger among diplomats and security officials at such a blatant infringement of British sovereignty .
At least 12 British passports were used in the Mabhouh plot , more than any other nation's .
That irritation was heightened by Israel 's record .
In 1986 , eight British passports were found inside an Israeli embassy envelope in a West German telephone box , apparently left there by an absent - minded Mossad agent .
The next year , a Palestinian found with an arms cache in Hull turned out to be a double - agent working for the Mossad , taking part in a covert operation Israel had omitted to tell Britain about .
After investigating operations by the Mossad , the Thatcher government expelled an Israeli diplomat , Arie Regev , for " activities incompatible with his status " .
And the Israeli government of the day gave an assurance that such transgressions would not be repeated .
Today , Britain is looking for similar assurances .
According to those close to the Soca investigation , detectives soon realised the passports involved were no ordinary forgeries of the type most often seen during inquiries into organised crime , terrorist support networks and money launderers in the UK and abroad .
Most experts agree that British passports are notoriously difficult to forge , and those which do come to light are either poorly doctored originals , or passports created from fake documents .
" It is rare for us to see forged British passports , " said one police expert .
" When we do , they are not often of the quality which could pass through an international border . "
So when investigators from Soca examined the details of the passports , they immediately noticed the difference .
" These were incredibly good forgeries .
They are not the thing that anyone could do , " said an investigative source .
" The originals were still in the hands of their owners and someone had used the information to create a new document .
The quality of the forgeries made it highly likely that there was state involvement . "
The accusations will put considerable strain on Britain 's relationship with Israel .
But MI6 , which pursued its own informal investigation into the affair , is likely to maintain its close , professional relationship with the Mossad .
Key findings from the Soca investigation have been passed to the United States and to investigators in the United Arab Emirates , who are leading the inquiry into the murder of Mabhouh .
To all intents and purposes the Soca investigation is now closed , although detectives may still be asked to provide additional information to the Foreign Office or the Dubai authorities .
GREAT BROOK FARM STATE PARK , MA — In a surprising development that has confirmed a number of longstanding local rumors , authorities discovered the 32nd Regiment of His Majesty 's Royal British Army still fighting the Revolutionary War in a small wooded area outside of Carlisle , MA Monday .

The disoriented foot soldiers — who in the spring of 1776 survived a barrage of Patriot cannon fire at Dorchester Heights only to become lost during the subsequent British retreat — were found by park rangers marching in the direction of a nearby Price Chopper supermarket .

" Keep ye muskets at the ready , men , " Col .
Edmund Thorpe of Leicestershire was heard shouting to his troops as they prepared to cross an empty stretch of Route 225 , which Thorpe claimed was a primary gunpowder supply route .
" There is danger in this valley , for the traitorous coward Washington and his militia are said to camp just beyond that ridge . "
Area folklore and occasional reports from nearby RV parks have for years suggested the presence of a ragged , hardy band of British soldiers still remaining from the Revolutionary War .
But what was once dismissed as legend has now been verified by Walter Carp of the Merrimac Valley Historical Society , who identified the 32nd Regiment after watching its members struggle to scale a razor - wire fence near a local recycling center .
Advertisement
" That 's them , all right — the old 32nd , " Carp said .
" They fought valiantly at Breed 's Hill , but they never seemed to have the right coordinates when it came time to track an enemy .
Looks like they might be a little worse for wear , the poor fellows . "
One of several Redcoat campfires recently discovered in the Carlisle area .

The regiment 's last mention in historical records came in March 1776 , when the soldiers garrisoned a small fort near the Concord River and awaited orders from Gen. William Howe , then commander in chief of British forces .
Though regiment scout James Winthrop reportedly estimates that Howe is no more than 80 kilometers from their location , public records indicate the general has been in London since his burial there in 1814 .
" Howe can not be far , " said Winthrop , pointing to a faded map sketched on worn hemp paper .
" No more than a fortnight away . "

After receiving intelligence on the foreign military unit , the Pentagon immediately dispatched F - 15s from the 104th Fighter Wing of the Massachusetts Air National Guard , but the planes were called off after British foreign secretary David Miliband assured officials that the redcoats did not represent the United Kingdom .
While the 32nd Regiment 's numbers have dwindled over the past two centuries due to illness and desertion , the remaining holdouts have vowed to continue fighting until the colonists ' siege of Boston is repelled .
They then plan to rendezvous with the King 's 14th Regiment at Fort Ticonderoga , near the current site of the Diamond Run Shopping Mall , to restock on hardtack and tobacco .

" ' Tis been a long and bitter struggle with our foolhardy American cousins , " 2nd Lt. Henry Bertram said during a brief pipe break near the soccer field of Washington Elementary School .
" Dearly do I miss my fair wife , Abigail , and our precious babe , Elizabeth , safe at home in Leicestershire .
Why , my daughter must be tall as a barrel by now ! "
Having survived the brutal winters of 1831 , 1907 , and 1999 , most members of the regiment appear to believe that the worst stretch of the war is over , and that a full surrender of all colonial militias to the Royal Army is imminent .
However , after spotting a number of new outposts last week in the growing Colonial Estates subdivision west of Boston , some have argued that the Americans may in fact be making gains .

" Fie on your childish speculations , " said Col .
Thorpe , responding to growing concerns in his ranks .
" I will not have this regiment torn asunder by such cowardly prattle .
Somewhere in the Province of Massachusetts
Bay there is a loyal countryman in whose farmhouse we can tarry for a night .
Once rested , we shall strike a final blow to the treasonous Yankees . "
Added Thorpe , " By God , the jewel of the His Majesty 's crown sha n't be lost ! "
The last reported sighting of the 32nd Regiment occurred in January , when a number of Carlisle locals claimed to have seen the redcoats loitering in or around their backyards .
Advertisement
" I saw some old guys in funny costumes messing around near my toolshed about a month ago , " said Bay State Electronics Supply employee Jim Hicks , 45 .
" But when I flicked on the porch lights they ran back into the woods . "
Local law enforcement officials said the soldiers are now considered suspects in a string of unsolved garden burglaries that began in 1838 , as well as in the 2003 deaths of five Revolutionary War reenactors near Lowell , MA .

The Centers for Disease Control is investigating whether the regiment may also be responsible for the recent deaths of several thousand New England residents from smallpox .

It can also translate to “ Brother Penetrating ” or “ Penetrating Brother ” … but …

蔷薇余香 :
He does n’t really look like a beggar , more like a vagabond .
The quality of this person ’s tops are all not bad , a down jacket , cotton jacket , even a leather jacket inside , and though they ’re a bit dirty , they ’re all in good condition , not the kind that beggars find from the trash .
That photo of him walking is indeed very handsome , very Japanese or Korean [ style ] .
And some are like a Hong Kong actor .

From Tianyi123 :
Ningbo ’s Handsome Guy Beggar is just a poor / pitiful guy
Many netizens have sent me messages asking me to verify whether that latest famous handsome guy begger is really a beggar .
Here I will testify that it can be said that he is .
Long ago in 2008 I encountered him .
Most people who see him will avoid him , treating him as a beggar and the link , but actually this is not accurate .
乞丐 [ qǐgài “ beggar ” ] in our country ’s ancient words first appeared as a monosyllabic word .
The meaning of 乞 [ qǐ ] in the golden texts was “ to beg ” .
But he does not beg , nor does he know how to beg , because he has psychological problems ( in Ningbo they call it “ great fog sickness ” ) .
They do not have an identity , they do not have family , they ’ve even forgotten who they are .
They are a group of people abandoned by society , and their final outcome is to die without anyone inquiring about them .
They wander in the space between humans and animals .
Help them a bit and they become humans , ignore them and they are animals .
He once said this to me : “ Find a girl to love me . ”
When I first met him , he was picking up discarded cigarettes to smoke again .
I asked him : Hungry ?
He said : Hungry .
I again asked :
Here ’s 10 yuan , do you know how to go buy something to eat by yourself ?
( I wanted to test his ability to take care of himself )
He said : Okay .
With the 10 yuan , he then purchased a pack of cigarettes at a small shop nearby .
I asked :
Is n’t your stomach was hungry ?
Why did n’t you buy something to eat ?
He pointed at a trash can , then pointed at his stomach .
At the time , I did not understand , thinking he was able to pick trash to exchange for food [ sort trash for recyclable items to exchange for money ] .
However later , I saw a scene that broke my heart .
Only when spending time with him in later days did I understand why he likes to wear women ’s clothes .
Maybe you will say :
Male deviant , simply perverted , simply likes women ’s clothes .
You will only be partially right , as the real reason is his heart yearns for a home , a woman to take care of him , love him .
Sometimes he is himself , and sometimes he pretends to be the woman that loves him .
Every time I find him , I will always give him 10 yuan .
And he always goes to buy a pack of cigarettes .
He has many sets of women ’s clothes , all picked out from piles of trash .
People will ask : Aside from smoking , how does he solve his food problem if he also does not know to beg ?
The below pictures are of him finding things to eat .
I hope your ability to stomach things is stronger than my old cat .
In front of the door to a flower shop , the ground has discarded food discarded by the florist ( I despise this flower shop ’s disgusting behavior of discarding refuse in front of its door , ruining the public sanitation , and on rainy days the oil makes it easy for pedestrians to slip and fall ) .
Seeing that there is still a small piece of meat on the ground , he squats down to pick it up to eat .
At this moment , my heart cried .
These people who truly need our attention have instead been ruined by a bunch of beggars and cheats / con-artists .
Since they already are unable to tell the difference between what is real and what is fake , they might as well close the door on love .
Today , the reason I spent half a year ’s time to investigate and experience their lives is to wake up everyone ’s caring hearts , so that we will go help them , so they can become a meaningful person .
Turning around again to look at the stuff on the ground , this is stuff even a dog would not eat ( these days there are people who treat dogs better than people ) , and I do n’t know why I thought of something that was once written :
Behind red doors food go to waste , while frozen bones lie on the streets .
His road may be very long or it may be very short .
What his future will be like I do not know .
2010 March 2 UPDATE : Here are two videos spreading on Kaixin001 about Brother Sharp .
Because he had become popular on the internet , many people went to go find him , asking him where he is from , offering to help him go back home ( to his hometown or family ) , or help him find work .
However , this frightened him and he would only cry without speaking .
Someone to love you .

Evidence Mounts NATO Report Lied on Afghan Civilian Killings
Rear Admiral Smith Admits No Evidence of Claimed ‘ Firefight ’
The February 12 night raid against a house party in Afghanistan ’s Paktia Province remains shrouded in mystery , but NATO ’s official story appears to be crumbling as even NATO officials concede that the claims made were not strictly true .
NATO ’s official statement claimed at the time that the raid on the home led to a “ fire fight ” against “ several insurgents ” who were killed , before NATO made a “ gruesome discovery ” of bound and gagged bodies in a nearby room .
NATO is conceding now that all of the slain people were civilians killed in the raid .
NATO communications direct Rear Admiral Greg Smith also admitted that they had no real evidence that the men slain at the home had ever fired a shot against the NATO forces .
Witnesses at the site reported that one of the people in the compound , a local policeman , shouted “ do n’t fire , we work for the government ” before being gunned down by the invading forces .
Rear Admiral Smith defended the killing of the policeman , however , saying “ if you have got an individual stepping out of a compound , and if your assault force is there , that is often the trigger to neutralise ( read : kill ) the individual .
You do n’t have to be fired upon to fire back .
Since the incident , all those detained by NATO have been released without charges .
In addition , the US has reportedly paid $ 2,000 to the family for each of the civilians killed in the attack .
Be truly glad .
There is wonderful joy ahead ! "

As the U.S. prepares to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan on a mission that will include defending a civilian population in a narco - economy , Colombia 's experience with drug traffickers and terrorism may be instructive .
AN ELECTRONICS manufacturer with a history of making false environmental claims has been caught doctoring fridges to make them appear more energy efficient .
LG Electronics has agreed to compensate potentially thousands of consumers after two of its fridges - models L197NFS and P197WFS - were found to contain an illegal device that activates an energy - saving mode when it detects room conditions similar to those in a test laboratory .
The so - called circumvention device was discovered last month by the consumer advocacy group , Choice .
The device detects test conditions - typically 22 degrees - and activates the energy - saving mode , creating the impression of lower running costs and energy usage .
The devices have been banned in Australia since 2007 .
In reality the fridge , which has a 3.5 star energy rating , costs an extra $ 250 to run over 10 years and can severely affect food quality because the fridge can shut off when opened .
Encounter with Hundreds of Thousands of Ladybugs Posted by Steven Goodheart on March 3 , 2010 · 4 Comments
LADYBUGS ! LOTS of ladybugs !

nature blog and take a look at my new post about my discovery of several hundred thousand ladybugs amassed in the Berkeley Hills near my home .
The post is called :
They are the Lady ( bugs ) of the Canyon
I ’ve got some good images , though the huge swarm was too spread - out to catch on camera without making the ladybugs disappear in the dense foliage of Strawberry Canyon .
I had to settle for close - ups like these :
As usual , I also include some fun science about these amazing creatures and discuss the folklore around this most popular insect in the world .
Also , do n’t miss the link to an amazing video of a ladybug swarm that will give you some idea of what it was like to see what I saw in person !

The speeches at AIPAC , the pro-Israel lobby group , on Monday by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Netanyahu ’s subsequent meeting with US President Barack Obama are widely seen as drawing to a close what Israeli ambassador to the US Michael Oren called the “ most severe crisis in US - Israel relations ” in decades .
This rapprochement comes on the heels of a series of seemingly angry statements top members of the Obama Administration released , after Israel announced construction of 1,600 new illegal housing units in occupied East Jerusalem while US Vice President Joe Biden was in the country .
In fact , the basis for the Obama Administration ’s criticisms of the settlement announcement — as well as the significance of the crisis itself — has been widely misconstrued by both supporters and critics of Israel .
AIPAC and the Anti-Defamation League ( ADL ) were “ shocked and stunned ” that Biden and Clinton called the Israeli announcement “ insulting . ”
AIPAC urged the administration to “ take immediate steps to defuse the tension with the Jewish state ” and “ move away from public demands and unilateral deadlines directed at Israel . ”
Meanwhile , the ADL mused , “ One can only wonder how far the US is prepared go in distancing itself from Israel . ”
Voices more critical of Israel , such as Richard Dreyfuss of The Nation , suggested that “ this is not just the reaction to an insulting announcement during the visit of Vice President Biden , ” but rather “ the Obama Administration is beginning to realize that Israeli intransigence … is a major obstacle to US policy in the region . ”
Dreyfuss predicted that this “ might turn into the most significant confrontation between the United States and Israel ” since the 1956 Suez War .
Contrary to both of these positions , the Obama Administration merely reacted to a diplomatic affront it was dealt by the Israeli government .
Israel ’s announcement came on the same day that Biden had arrived in the country to proudly confirm the US ’ “ absolute , total and unvarnished ” commitment to its ally , and commence indirect talks with the Palestinians .
Following the announcement , protests and violent clashes broke out in Jerusalem and elsewhere throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territories .
Responding to this pressure , the Arab League threatened to cancel its endorsement of the indirect negotiations , with Secretary Amr Moussa even announcing that the Ramallah - based Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas had decided not to participate in the talks .
As the endorsement was the only political cover Abbas had to re-enter negotiations , the US administration took careful notice of these events as pressure on Abbas to abandon talks from within the territories mounted .
With the Arab world outraged and Biden humiliated due to the degree of US complicity that the timing of the announcement revealed , the Obama Administration was forced to react .
Clinton said the timing of the announcement was “ insulting , ” while top aide David Axelrod called it an “ affront ” that “ seemed calculated ” to undermine the peace talks .
The Obama Administration hopes that this PR display will allow the US to fortify its farcical claim to be an “ honest broker ” in the peace process , provide Abbas the political cover to re-enter negotiations , and send a message to the Israeli government that American leaders are to be treated with respect .
As CNN reported , Netanyahu has now set up a team to investigate why the settlement construction announcement was made during Biden ’s visit .
Netanyahu may well have been telling the truth when he claimed to be “ surprised ” by the public criticisms by the US government .
The day before , one day after US envoy George Mitchell arrived to broker newly - announced “ proximity talks , ” the State Department explicitly approved Israel ’s construction of 112 new apartments in an illegal settlement outside Bethlehem .
The assent came despite Netanyahu ’s declaration of a “ moratorium ” on settlement building , which he has insisted cannot include such illegal construction in Israeli - occupied East Jerusalem , a position the US has accepted .
UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon has also chastised Israel for its “ provocative actions , ” including record - high rates of stripping Palestinians from Jerusalem their residency rights and infringements on Palestinian religious sites that are clearly designed to incite a Palestinian response or otherwise make it impossible for Abbas to return to the negotiating table .
Yet even when the administration was at its most critical of Israel , following Obama ’s speech in Cairo last year , Israel was reassured that the actions taken by the US would be “ largely symbolic . ”
Indeed , Obama unconditionally re-authorized the loan guarantees program and massive US aid — conservatively estimated at $ 7 million per day — has continued without threat of reduction .
Obviously , the Obama Administration is hardly concerned about Israeli violations of international law , previous agreements it has signed , or the human rights of the Palestinians .
The implication throughout is that had the announcement come a week before Biden visited ( or even a day before , as the Bethlehem announcement did ) there would have been no problem .
Indeed , just one week later , after the Israeli government announced construction on an additional 426 East Jerusalem settlement homes , Clinton “ bolstered her support for the Jewish state , ” according to The Washington Post .
The Israeli army then opened fire on peaceful protestors in Gaza twice in two days , and carried out air strikes on targets in Gaza , while Clinton issued another statement saying that the steps offered by the Israeli government to resolve the dispute were “ useful and productive . ”
The escalating repression continued Sunday , when the Israeli army shot and killed four Palestinian youths in 24 hours in the West Bank , two aged 18 and two 16 .
Simultaneously , Netanyahu issued a statement proclaiming that Israel would never cease building illegally in East Jerusalem as Ban Ki-moon arrived in Israel .
Clearly , recent condemnations of these projects as “ illegal ” by Ban and the European Union did not stop Obama from welcoming Netanyahu to Washington on Monday with a private meeting , nor Clinton from proudly sharing the stage with him at the AIPAC conference to reaffirm the US commitment to support Israel ’s rejection of the international consensus for resolving the conflict .
Though she did say the settlements “ undermine mutual trust , ” she did not acknowledge their illegality and mostly stressed the threat that US support for them poses to its “ credibility ” as an “ honest broker , ” thus urging Israel to refrain from such flagrantly provocative behavior while reinforcing that the US - Israel relationship is “ rock solid . ”
The US hopes that this pretended outrage will lend its role as “ honest broker ” enough credibility to keep the “ peace process ” moving , itself merely a PR facade that shields Israeli crimes from public scrutiny .
If it does not , the US will undoubtedly pay little mind to the harsh words spoken this week and do as it has done before : blame the Palestinians for its failure and support Israeli repression .

Many die in India temple stampede , police say
Most of those gathered at the ceremony were from nearby villages
At least 63 people have died in a stampede after the gate of a Hindu temple collapsed in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh , police say .
Dozens more were injured in the panic at the temple in Pratapgarh district , 650 km ( 400 miles ) south - east of Delhi .
All of the dead identified so far are women and children , police say .
The temple gate was still being built .
Hundreds of people have been killed in stampedes at crowded Indian temples in recent years .
' Counted all the bodies '
Thursday 's disaster happened at a popular Ram Janaki temple in the town of Kunda in Pratapgarh district , about 25 km ( 15 miles ) north of the city of Allahabad .
The temple is owned by a Hindu holy man , Jagadguru Kripalu Ji Maharaj , who police say was marking the anniversary of the death of his wife with a ritual feast .
INDIA STAMPEDES January 2010 : Seven people die at festival on Ganges in West Bengal September 2008 : More than 220 people die at temple in Jodhpur August 2008 :
At least 140 people die at temple in Himachal Pradesh March 2008 :
At least eight people killed at temple in Madhya Pradesh January 2005 : Up to 300 people die on pilgrimage to Maharashtra temple
Timeline : Most deadly stampedes
In pictures : Indian stampede Thousands of people had gathered for the ceremonial feast and free distribution of clothes - the stampede occurred when people scrambled to collect the offerings being handed out .
Local journalists told the BBC they were mostly poor people from local villages .
Police officials said an iron gate leading to the temple complex collapsed , leading to a crowd surge .
" We have now counted all the bodies and they include 37 children and 26 women who had come to collect free gifts , " assistant superintendent of police SP Pathak told AFP news agency from the scene of the disaster .
The BBC's Ram Dutt Tripathi in the state capital , Lucknow , said the temple gate was under construction when it collapsed .
Investigation Emergency teams and ambulances were rushed to the site , some from neighbouring districts and the injured have been taken to hospitals .
Hundreds of people gathered at local hospitals for news of their relatives .
" She had just wandered in to see what was happening , " 38 - year - old Gudal , whose seven - year - old daughter died in the stampede , told the Associated Press news agency .
The chief minister of Uttar Pradesh state , Ms Mayawati , has ordered an inquiry into the incident .
Government officials say it appears that the organisers of the event had been unprepared to deal with the size of the crowd .
Eyewitnesses say it took a while for help to arrive and there was no - one on hand initially to offer them any assistance .
There have been a number of similar accidents in India in which large numbers of people congregate in an area ill - equipped to handle big gatherings .
In 2008 , nearly 300 people were killed in stampedes and scores injured in two different Hindu temples in Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh states .

Son of Hamas founder reveals how he saved Israeli President from terror plot
International
ani -Staff
By Super Admin
London , Feb 28 ( ANI ) : Israeli President Shimon
Peres is among the many who owe their lives to the son of a founder of Hamas , according to a dramatic account to be published this week .
Mosab Hassan Yousef , the son of Sheikh Hassan Yousef - Hamas chief since August 200 , will reveal the heroics of how he became an informant for the Israeli domestic security service Shin Bet , as a top agent codenamed the ' Green Prince ' and the risks he took during a decade as a spy for Israel .
n his book , Son of Hamas , he describes his remarkable double life as a top Israeli agent , his conversion to Christianity and how he swapped the West Bank for the West Coast .
he disclosure that among his activities he thwarted a 2001 plot to blow up Peres , then Foreign Minister and now the Israeli head of state , will also heighten the risk he now faces himself from potential assassins .
According to Yousef 's account , he was serving as aide and driver to his father , Sheikh Hassan Yousef , when he visited one of Hamas ' top terrorists , a deadly bomb - maker called Abdhullah Barghouti .
The Hamas leader urged Barghouti to rein in his campaign of killing after two major attacks that summer in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem , because he feared Israel would invade the West Bank in retaliation .
However , Barghouti revealed that he had already dispatched four devices to blow up the car of Peres .
He agreed to make a call to the men now in charge of the bombs and the younger Yousef was sent to buy a new mobile phone that would be destroyed after the conversation so it could not be traced .
The Green Prince immediately passed the number to Shin Bet , which eavesdropped on the call , allowing it to foil the operation .
It was one of dozens of suicide - bombing attempts and assassination plots that he helped prevent , including a plan to kill one of Israel 's most important religious figures , Rabbi Ovadia Yosef , spiritual leader of the conservative Shas party .

They ’d like everyone to be impressed that they reduced the bonus number by $ 20 million .
Impressed ?
Senator Grassley is sort of right with his criticism , though for some strange reason he forgot to include Bush and Paulson , who deserve as much or possibly a bit more than Obama .
There ’s plenty of blame to go around and Congress could include themselves in the blame as well just as voters do .
The American International Group has agreed to cut employee bonuses by $ 20 million and will distribute about $ 100 million on Wednesday , according to people with knowledge of the negotiations .
But the reductions may not be enough to appease the company ’s critics , who do not accept the company ’s argument that it has to honor contracts established before its government bailout .
“ A.I.G. has taxpayers over a barrel , ” said Senator Charles E. Grassley , an Iowa Republican , in a statement on Tuesday night .
“ The Obama administration has been outmaneuvered .
And the closed - door negotiations just add to the skepticism that the taxpayers will ever get the upper hand . ”

The two - year , $ 12 million project , …
The Springfield Road was the scene of serious rioting in 2005 " They are not implacably opposed to each other - they were stopping in the middle of their fight to go across to each other and have a smoke break . "
Implausible as it may sound , community workers on both sides of the Springfield Road insist that " recreational rioting " has become so casually regular that its participants occasionally enjoy friendly respite during their destructive orgies .
The road is scarred from two weeks of trouble - melted road signs and burnt patches of tarmac indicative of a fortnight where barely an evening has passed without a riot .
For the most part , stones and rocks are hurled but occasionally petrol bombs have been part of the deadly arsenal employed .
On Tuesday night , police arrested a 14 - year - old boy after they tried to intervene and were themselves attacked .
It is part of a pattern of trouble across west Belfast in the past two weeks , which is again leaving police , statutory agencies and community groups scratching their heads and wondering how to put a stop to this before six months of spring and summer .
Community
The prevailing wisdom is that strong community work is an essential part of the counter attack against the trouble .
And it is an approach that has been fruitful in many parts of the city .
But for Daniel Jack and Noel Large who work for Interaction Belfast along the Springfield Road , the more recent trouble presents a whole new challenge .
They say that many of the rioters are not even from the Springfield Road area but , after organising via their mobile phones and internet , are coming in from as far away as Divis on the nationalist side and from Springmartin and Highfield on the loyalist side .
Despite their origins they have plenty in common , according to Noel Large .
" They are not implacable enemies by any means .
At times , when they are not shouting over at each other , they are actually congregating on the same side .
" There were nights when they were actually stopping in the middle of their fight to go across and have a smoke with each other . "
Bongs
Not simply tobacco either , judging by the significant litter of plastic bottles or " bongs " which are used to smoke cannabis .
Such nihilistic existences are not merely threats to each other .
Many motorists from the expanse of west Belfast travel along the road on their way to the Royal Victoria Hospital .
If setting fire to traffic lights is politics , it is not a kind of politics I have ever heard of
Michael George , Colinglen Neighbourhood Partnership Daniel says that the hail of missiles potentially presents a mortal threat to motorists .
" We know that all it takes is for a driver to lose his concentration for a moment and someone is going to be seriously injured . "
Trouble is also blighting another of the arterial veins that thrusts its way through west Belfast .
The Stewartstown Road is generally republican territory .
The lack of nearby loyalists to clash with has not deterred some of its youthful residents who are content to fight amongst each other - and increasingly in the past couple of weeks with the PSNI .
Thuggery Michael George , community safety officer with Colin Neighbourhood Partnership , says that the trouble began before Christmas with fights organised in local schools .
Now , the youthful ire - some involved are believed to be as young as 10 or 11 - is focused on the PSNI .
Michael George explains : " Some people have asked me whether this sort of behaviour is politically motivated .
Well , if setting fire to traffic lights has anything to do with politics , it is not a kind of politics I have ever heard of .
It 's mindless thuggery .
" I 've seen young people as young as 10 with full bottles of petrol and lighters .
It 's the first time they 've been involved with anything like this and they are going to put themselves in danger . "
Such trouble has been a feature in many parts of Northern Ireland for generations - despite significant resources being invested to deal with it .
The police have come under attack in recent days in west Belfast
The vogue is for a " multi-agency " approach with the police sharing responsibility with safety groups and community workers - basically dealing with the problem as much as a social issue as a matter of security .
Determination Nevertheless Michael George suggests that the police have more to do .
He said : " After Christmas , the police sat back and waited for more resources and it allowed the thing to build and grow momentum when they could have got in and nipped it in the bud . "
He accepts though that other groups , including schools and parents , have a role to play .
And parents are firmly within the police 's focus as well .
PSNI Inspector Mark Robinson said his officers are determined to bring the trouble to an end .
He added : " The actions of a minority are in stark contrast to the efforts of police and fire personnel whose only concerns are ensuring the safety of local people and upholding law and order .
" We would thank local representatives who have been working with police to address these incidents .
That work is ongoing at multi-agency and community level .
" We would urge parents to make sure they know where their children are and what they are doing . "

Linky : le compteur intelligent communicant d’Engie ?
Le compteur Linky offre de nombreux avantages tant pour les consommateurs que pour les fournisseurs d’électricité et le gestionnaire de réseau .
Cependant , est-il possible de refuser son installation ?
Comment lire la consommation sur ce type de compteur ?
Puis - je refuser le compteur Linky ?
La mise en place du compteur Linky est devenue une obligation selon le décret n° 2010 - 1022 du 31 août 2010 .
En effet , tout bâtiment doit disposer d’un dispositif de comptage sur les réseaux publics d’électricité .
D’ailleurs , le contrat avec votre gestionnaire de réseau stipule qu’il doit toujours avoir accès à votre compteur linky .
Le refus d’installation du compteur Linky de votre part peut provoquer la coupure d’électricité sur votre bâtiment .

Scientists think they have a pretty good idea of how orbital variations drive the glacial cycles that have dominated Earth 's recent history .
Periodic changes in the Earth 's rotational tilt and orientation , called Milankovitch cycles , alter how sunlight gets distributed over the planet 's surface , driving the advance and retreat of ice sheets .
But some of the details of how this system operates remain a bit hazy , and researchers have been puzzled by a transition called the Mid-Brunhes Event , which took place 430,000 years ago .
Before the Mid-Brunhes , even the warm interglacials were colder than the present , with significant ice sheets left behind ; afterwards , the conditions were similar to our current ones .
A paper published this weekend at Nature Geoscience examines a number of interglacial periods both before and after the Mid-Brunhes Event , and ties the climatic changes into differences in the Milankovich influences on the climate , enhanced by forcings from greenhouse gasses .
The net result is a more moderate interglacial , with warmer winters and slightly cooler summers , with most of the changes happening during the Southern Hemisphere 's summer .
Milankovitch cycles are driven by subtle changes in the Earth 's orientation towards the sun .
The Earth 's axis of rotation is n't vertical relative to the plane of the solar system ; instead , its tilt , or obliquity , is currently off by roughly 23° , and varies by over one degree in either direction over the course of tens of thousands of years .
The direction of this axis , as well as the orientation of the long axis of the planet 's elliptical orbit , also vary on similar time scales ( called the precession ) .
Combined , these factors influence how sunlight gets distributed across the surface of the Earth .
Warmer , interglacial periods are associated with the Northern Hemisphere summer seeing peak exposure to sunlight .
The actual difference in energy terms is quite small , but feedbacks enhance the small effect .
For example , the increased sunlight begins to melt the glacial ice sheets , exposing ground that absorbs far more radiation .
Ocean circulation also increases , adding CO 2 to the atmosphere and increasing greenhouse forcings .
If the process is so similar for each interglacial , though , why the big switch at the Mid-Brunhes Event ?
The authors at first attempted to tie it directly to orbital forcings by plotting the peak precession and obliquity against the peak temperature ( temperature was estimated using oxygen isotope ratios obtained from ocean sediments ) .
Unfortunately , the pattern they saw was essentially random , which sent them back to the drawing board .
The next thing they tried worked significantly better : they plotted the distribution of sunlight across the Earth 's surface for each interglacial .
It turns out that the post - Mid-Brunhes interglacials had a notably different distribution of warmth .
In the Northern Hemisphere 's summer , more recent interglacials are notable for receiving less sunlight , while the Southern Hemisphere remains largely unchanged .
During the Northern Hemisphere 's winter , however , the other pole gets a lot more sunlight .
The authors used a climate model to see how this would impact temperatures once other forcings and feedbacks , such as greenhouse gasses , are considered .
It turns out that both poles and ( to a lesser extent ) all the continents heat up dramatically during the Northern Hemisphere 's winter , while they cool off only slightly during the spring and summer .
This should be sufficient to enhance both the ice and greenhouse gas feedbacks , producing the warmer interglacials that have characterized the last 430,000 years .
If the authors are right , then what looked to be a change of state — a distinct before - and - after centered on the Mid-Brunhes Event — is actually simply the result of subtle differences in the operation of a single , cyclical system .
If there 's a frustration with the paper , it 's that the authors do n't run their system any further than is needed to evaluate that last million years .
That 's reasonable in the sense that this is the period for which ice cores provide good climate data , but it would be interesting to know whether the apparent changes in solar input that the authors see following the Mid-Brunhes will reverse in the future , or have flip - flopped in the more distant past .
It would make their model into a predictive one , which could be confirmed if we get better data on climates older than our ice cores .

Editor Danis
Rose with a new limited - edition copy of James Joyce 's ' Finnegans Wake ' , published by the Houyhnhnm Press
CRITICS agree it is James Joyce 's most difficult book , putting ' Ulysses ' in the ha'penny place when it comes to leaving a reader perplexed .
Now ' Finnegans Wake ' is to be republished in a new edition for the first time , more than 70 years after the famous novel first appeared in 1939 .
In what will be the literary highlight of the year , the new edition of the book will be launched next Thursday in Dublin Castle by Finance Minister Brian Lenihan , a Joyce enthusiast .
The new , corrected edition is the fruit of 30 years ' hard work by two Dubliners , Danis Rose and John O'Hanlon , who are textual scholars .
They went back to Joyce 's 50 - plus original notebooks which eventually became ' Finnegans Wake ' , to correct thousands of mistakes that had crept into the text .
The mistakes were mainly the result of type - setting errors and Joyce 's poor proof - reading due to failing eyesight .
Spotting them was far from easy , because the novel is full of words Joyce made up himself .
The mistakes made a difficult book even more confusing .
Now this new edition at last presents the novel in the form in which Joyce intended .
But it wo n't come cheap -- at least initially .
The new edition of the book is being published in a limited edition of 1,000 copies by the Houyhnhnm Press .
Bound
Two - hundred of these will be bound in black calf - skin and will cost €900 each .
The remaining 800 will cost €300 each .
But the good news for ordinary readers is that the book will be available next year in a trade edition from Penguin priced at around € 20 .
Mr Rose and Mr O'Hanlon have spent years verifying , codifying , collating and clarifying the 20,000 pages of notes , typescripts and proofs comprising Joyce 's " litters from aloft " .
The new reading text of ' Finnegans Wake ' , typographically re-set for the first time in its publishing history , incorporates some 9,000 minor , yet crucial , corrections and amendments , covering punctuation marks , font choice , spacing , misspellings , misplaced phrases and ruptured syntax .
Although individually minor , these changes are crucial in facilitating a smooth reading of the book .
Danis
Rose said yesterday : " Although it seems like a long time to be editing a single work , in many ways I 'm astonished that it only took 30 years when you consider that the typesetting alone took 10 . "
Poet Seamus Deane and Joyce expert Bruce Arnold will also speak at the launch in Dublin Castle next week , as will the editors Danis Rose and John O'Hanlon .
Dubliner Rose is the editor of ' Ulysses : A New Reader 's Edition ' as well as the author of ' The Textual Diaries of James Joyce ' .
O'Hanlon , who has collaborated with Rose in most of his Joyce projects , is a mathematician .

I do n't have a vote for the end of season NHL awards and I doubt that the PHWA is close to awarding me one .
I do , however , have a vote in the SB Nation version of the NHL awards that will be cast at the end of the season .
I 'm not sure who I 'm voting for in the race for all of the trophies , but I know for certain that I 'm casting my vote for the Hart Memorial Trophy for most valuable player in the NHL for Detroit goaltender Jimmy Howard .
Howard will be making his 23rd straight start in goal tonight for Detroit and it's during his starts streak that Detroit has saved their playoff hopes .
On the night that Howard 's streak began , the Red Wings were 25 - 28 and sat ninth in the conference , one point behind Calgary .
Since handing the reigns to Howard , the Red Wings have gone 14 - 8 and now sit sixth in the conference , three points behind Nashville with two games in hand .

That Chris Osgood struggled early in the season is n't news .
His save percentage was terrible on a Detroit team that was outshooting their opponents , and it showed in the team 's win-loss record .
GP MIN W L EGA GA GAA SA SV SV % SO 2009 - Chris Osgood 22 1193 7 8 59 2.97 536 477 .890 1
Detroit was outshooting at even strength but losing with Osgood in goal .
Osgood was getting shelled on the penalty kill .
GP MIN W L EGA GA GAA SA SV SV % SO 2009 - Jimmy Howard 57 3373 32 15 126 2.24 1702 1576 .926 2
Then came Jimmy Howard .
Looking deeper into the stats , Detroit was outshooting at a better rate with Osgood in goal .
Detroit 's Corsi percentage in front of Osgood was .547 .
In front of Howard the rate dips slightly to .532 .
Osgood 's even strength save percentage was a not - so - good .902 .
To put that in perspective , both Devan Dubnyk and Jeff Deslauriers have been better at even strength .
Chris Osgood , hang your head in shame .
Howard stepped up and has delivered .927 at even strength and he 's been one of the three best goalies in the league on the penalty kill .
With Howard in the nets , Detroit has a very good chance to finish fifth in the conference and I doubt that Mike Babcock will take Howard out of the nets unless the last game of the season is meaningless .
Howard 's starts streak should stretch all the way to 29 games .
None of this means that Jimmy Howard will be able to deliver these results over the long term .
None of this suggests that Howard deserves a multi- year multi-million dollar contract that NHL general managers seem to love to hand out to goaltenders .
All I 'm saying is that this year Jimmy Howard saved the Red Wings season and for that he deserves the Hart Trophy .

Introduction
In late 1993 , a new armed faction emerged in Liberia , known as the Liberian Peace Council ( LPC ) , which has been fighting Charles Taylor 's National Patriotic Front of Liberia ( NPFL ) in the southeast of the country .
While both sides have been responsible for severe human rights abuses against the civilian population , in recent weeks the LPC appears to have stepped up its campaign against civilians , especially those it considers to have supported the NPFL .
Some 40,000 civilians have been displaced by the fighting , and they describe systematic and gratuitous abuses by the LPC .
There are consistent reports that elements of the Nigerian contingent of ECOMOG , the West African peacekeeping force -- not the Ghanaians or the Ugandans , who are also stationed in the area -- are aiding the LPC .
Displaced persons and other observers report that the Nigerians are supplying arms and ammunition to the LPC as a way to weaken the NPFL , while profiteering on the side .
It is not clear how high up the collaboration goes in the Nigerian contingent .
The United Nations mission in Liberia , UNOMIL , has a mandate to report on violations of the cease - fire and violations of humanitarian law , but it has not been reporting publicly about the situation in the southeast .
By avoiding the human rights issues , UNOMIL is failing to implement its mandate in Liberia .
In April , the U.N. Security Council extended UNOMIL 's mandate for another six months , with the proviso that the situation be reviewed on May 18 .
Human Rights Watch / Africa calls on the U.N. to ensure that UNOMIL implements its mandate in Liberia , including the requirement to report on violations of humanitarian law .
Human Rights
Watch / Africa further calls on ECOMOG to launch an immediate investigation of the charges that members of the Nigerian contingent may be assisting the LPC , and make its findings public .
* * * * * Liberia remains a divided country : the Liberian National Transitional Government ( LNTG ) , a coalition government , was seated on March 7 and now governs the capital , Monrovia , backed by the West African peacekeeping force ( ECOMOG ) ; Charles Taylor 's National Patriotic Front of Liberia ( NPFL ) , claims to control 60 percent of the country ; the United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia ( ULIMO ) , made up primarily of soldiers from former President Samuel Doe 's army , the Armed Forces of Liberia ( AFL ) , controls at least two western counties ; and a new faction , the Liberian Peace Council ( LPC ) , also made up largely of Krahns from the AFL , controls territory in the southeast .
The peace agreement signed in July 1993 , known as the Cotonou accord , was believed to be Liberia 's last , best hope .
The accord stipulated that concomitant with disarmament , a five - person Council of State elected by all the factions would take power from the interim government until elections were held .
A thirty - five - member transitional parliament would include thirteen members from the NPFL and the interim government , and nine from ULIMO .
An important element of the plan involved the creation of a UN Observer Mission in Liberia ( UNOMIL ) to help supervise and monitor the agreement , in conjunction with ECOMOG .
The plan also provided for an expanded ECOMOG force , under the auspices of the OAU , to be composed of African troops outside the West African region .
By the end of January 1994 , some 800 Tanzanians were deployed in Kakata , and 900 Ugandans were in Buchanan .
Although some progress was made in early 1994 toward ending Liberia 's bloody civil war , the situation is now very precarious .
Political infighting and renewed combat have brought disarmament to a virtual standstill .
As of late April , only some 2,500 combatants had been demobilized , out of a possible total of 40 - 60,000 .
In March , ULIMO split into two along ethnic lines : the Krahn group , headed by Gen. Roosevelt Johnson , is battling the Mandingos , led by Alhadji Kromah .
The inter- ULIMO fighting in the western counties of Bomi and Cape Mount has reportedly claimed hundreds of civilian lives since it flared up in March .
Two other factions , the NPFL and LPC , have been fighting in the southeast , taking a heavy toll on the civilian population .
Indeed , a characteristic of the Liberian civil war has been that civilians suffer the most , and are killed in far greater numbers than combatants .
The lack of protection for civilians from abuses by all sides and the profound distrust among the warring factions remain obstacles to lasting peace .
The Liberian Peace Council ( LPC )
The fighting between Charles Taylor 's NPFL and a relatively new faction , calling itself the Liberian Peace Council ( LPC ) , began in October 1993 and continues at this writing .
The LPC claims to control six counties -- Sinoe , Grand Gedeh , River Cess , Grand Kru , Maryland , and Grand Bassa .
The fighting , which began in the area of Grand Kola , got as far as the LAC plantation in early February , and had reached the outskirts of Buchanan by late April .
Little is known about the LPC .
The LPC emerged after the Cotonou peace agreement was signed by the NPFL , ULIMO and the interim government in July 1993 .
It is clear that the LPC is an offshoot of former President Doe 's army , the Armed Forces of Liberia , and of the Krahn wing of ULIMO .
It is composed mainly of people from the Krahn ethnic group .
" The LPC was formed because the Mandingos [ in ULIMO ] were n't going to spill blood to liberate Grand Gedeh [ the county where many of the Krahn live ] , " a well - informed , foreign observer in Monrovia noted .
" The only way to get the LPC to disarm is to convince ECOMOG that they will be safe with Taylor in the government . "
1
The lpc's strength is estimated to be some 800 fighters , organized into mobile combat units .
It is headed by George Boley , a Krahn and former minister of education in the Doe government , also formerly a member of ULIMO .
According to Boley , the LPC was formed because of " continued acts of atrocities by the NPFL in southeastern Liberia " since the Cotonou agreement .
He also claimed that most of his fighters were refugees from the Ivory Coast who had been forced to flee from the NPFL .
Boley described the LPC as " a broad - based national entity which advocates the protection of the rights of exiled and displaced citizens and residents of Liberia as well as the restoration of constitutional democratic leadership in Liberia . "
2
In recent statements , LPC spokespersons have made it clear that they will continue fighting until they are included in the transitional government .
LPC Secretary General , Octavius Walker , told reporters on April 14 that the LPC wanted six seats in the transitional parliament as well as portfolios in the interim government , but that discussions with the NPFL had failed to produce an agreement on amending the Cotonou accord to include the LPC .
" We will fight on until they include us in the administrative process , " he said .

LPC and NPFL Attacks on Civilians Thousands of civilians have been displaced by the fighting , with some 40,000 registered in the city of Buchanan alone , according to international relief organizations .
Testimony from displaced persons and foreign observers indicates that the LPC is responsible for serious human rights abuses against the civilian population , especially those the LPC considers to have supported the NPFL .
Abuses include widespread looting , arbitrary arrest and detention , forcible recruitment , beatings , torture , rape , and extrajudicial executions .
The NPFL has also been responsible for abuses against civilians .
When the NPFL recaptures a village from the LPC , the inhabitants are often considered to have collaborated with the LPC .
In one incident reported in January 1994 in Yapperstown , the NPFL killed eight women and nine men whom they accused of helping the LPC .
4
As a foreign national in Buchanan noted : " It 's terminal either way .
If the NPFL comes , they say you are LPC , and visa versa . "
5 David , a displaced Bassa man who arrived in Buchanan in late April , described the way civilians have suffered at the hands of both factions : " First the NPFL took our things .
They killed my brother 's pregnant wife in November 1993 .
My brother survived and told me about the killing . "
Then , he said , the LPC came : " They told the whole village to leave .
We escaped -- about 300 or 400 of us -- and went to the bush for two months . "
6
In some cases , the displaced persons either do not know , or are afraid to reveal , which faction was responsible for the attack .
One very elderly man interviewed by Human Rights Watch / Africa in a Buchanan hospital had been shot in the chest and had his right hand smashed by the same fighter .
" It 's just gratuitous violence , " a foreign relief worker commented .
There are many cases of villages being burned by either the NPFL or the LPC , and sometimes both factions destroyed part of the village at different times .
Among the villages in the southeast reportedly burned include the following : Darsaw Town ; Debah Town ; Johnsoo Town ; Bleabeh Town , almost entirely burned by the LPC , then the NPFL burned what remained ; Jamestown , burned by the NPFL ; Talowtown , burned by both NPFL and LPC ; Tubmanville , burned by LPC ; Yapperstown ; Flayzor Town .
7
The majority of the displaced are women , children , and the elderly ; able - bodied men are usually arrested and either forcibly recruited or incarcerated .
Many of the displaced are suffering from bullet wounds , dehydration , or malnutrition .
Some civilians were caught in cross - fire , but others were clearly targeted .
Abuses by the LPC
While both sides are responsible for widespread looting , arbitrary arrests , beatings , and extrajudicial executions , it appears that the LPC has stepped up its campaign against civilians .
On one day in mid-April , twelve displaced persons arrived in Buchanan , having been tortured with roasted cutlasses by the LPC .
The men were burned on their backs and on their genitals ; the women were beaten .
8
The following cases were reported to Human Rights Watch / Africa : J. , a medical worker from River Cess , fled the fighting with eighteen of his relatives in late February 1994 .
He was arrested by the LPC on March 3 in Neetown , apparently because he had an identity card issued by the NPFL 's civilian arm , the NPRAG , which the LPC took as proof that he fought with the NPFL .
His relatives were allowed to continue to Buchanan , but he was subjected to a form of torture known as " tabey . "
9
Although one LPC fighter wanted to execute him , another fighter intervened and brought him to the battalion commander , a former AFL colonel .
He was then taken to a makeshift jail .
Despite their threats , J. refused to state that he was an NPFL rebel .
During his imprisonment , he was forced to work for the fighters , performing such functions as picking cassava , cutting wood , digging for copper , and picking coconuts .
There were approximately seventy - five other men in the jail with him , all civilians from the Bassa ethnic group .
The women , girls , and children were held separately in a church building , and it was believed that many of the women were raped by the LPC .
10 In early April , a young man was identified by an LPC fighter to be an NPFL rebel .
Although he denied the charge , the LPC arrested him and tied him up .
The fighters roasted their cutlasses in a fire and then burned the man over various parts of his body .
Since the man continued to deny the allegation , one of the fighters decided to take more drastic measures to force the confession : he got his army knife , and cut out the man 's right eye .
At that point , the battalion commander arrived , angered because he had not ordered such treatment .
However , since they had no means to care for the wounded man , the commander ordered him to be executed .
Five LPC fighters took the man into the bush and killed him with cutlasses .
On February 3 , 1994 , the LPC captured Gorwor Town and began searching the civilians .
They found three young men , one about fifteen years old , the other two in their early twenties .
When searching the youngest one , they found a Charles Taylor T - shirt in his bag ( on the back was written , " Ghankay 11 is OK " ) .
All three young men were then shot .
M. , a twenty - seven - year - old medical worker , was arrested by the LPC in Newcess beach and forced to work as a combat medic .
When he tried to refuse , three Krahn soldiers beat him .
The Role of ECOMOG
There are consistent reports that members of the Nigerian contingent of ECOMOG -- not the Ugandans or the Ghanaians , who are also stationed in the area -- are aiding the LPC .
Displaced persons and foreign observers believe that the Nigerians are supplying arms and ammunition to the LPC as a way to weaken the NPFL , and possibly profiteering on the side .
The background to the hostility between NPFL and the Nigerian contingent of ECOMOG dates back to the initial ECOMOG intervention in August 1990 , when Charles Taylor accused Nigeria 's President Ibrahim Babangida of attempting to rescue Liberian President Doe .
Taylor 's NPFL soon targeted West African nationals from the countries participating in ECOMOG , including many Nigerians ; it is believed that hundreds were executed , and hundreds of others were held in detention .
An uneasy truce existed between 1990 and 1992 , but the recalcitrance of the warring factions made a political settlement impossible .
The NPFL grew increasingly hostile toward ECOMOG , particularly the Nigerian contingent .
Taylor referred to Babangida as a " mad dictator " and accused him of trying to commit genocide on the Liberian people .
ECOMOG finally began to deploy its forces in NPFL territory in April 1992 , in accordance with the Geneva peace agreement , but was forced to withdraw all its forces after the offensive of a new warring faction , ULIMO , against the NPFL .
However , Taylor prohibited the departure of 580 ECOMOG soldiers stationed in NPFL territory , and effectively held them hostage until late September , when they were released due to the intervention of former President Jimmy Carter .
During their return to Monrovia , many of the soldiers were humiliated , beaten , and had their weapons , vehicles and personal belongings confiscated by the NPFL .
This incident increased ECOMOG 's hostility toward the NPFL .
The situation exploded again in October 1992 , when the NPFL attacked Monrovia .
The urgency of the situation compelled ECOMOG to accept the assistance of other Liberian factions -- the AFL and ULIMO -- in fighting the NPFL .
There have been many allegations that ECOMOG actually armed ULIMO and the AFL .
Sources in the State Department and the Pentagon have confirmed that ECOMOG supplied -- or at least facilitated -- some arms to AFL and ULIMO .
There were also many reports that ECOMOG provided transportation to ULIMO fighters .
A remarkably similar pattern seems to be emerging between Nigerian ECOMOG and the LPC .
Residents of Buchanan report that LPC fighters have free run of the city , sometimes checking their weapons at an ECOMOG checkpoint at the outskirts of the city and reclaiming them when they leave .
Some observers have reported seeing a joint ECOMOG /lpc checkpoint , and displaced persons report seeing the Nigerians transporting LPC .
The implications of this are obviously very serious , even though it is not clear how high up the collaboration goes in the Nigerian contingent .
On March 7 , the Liberian National Transitional Government was seated , a new interim government with representatives of all the factions who signed the Cotonou agreement in July 1993 .
A high - ranking official of the new government was skeptical about ECOMOG 's intentions :
At one time , there was only Taylor , there was no ULIMO .
ECOMOG sat here until ULIMO was born under some mysterious circumstances .
They told us not to worry , that ULIMO would be put in its place .
Now , they say the same thing about the LPC .
12 A foreign diplomat in Monrovia echoed this sentiment , calling the LPC " ULIMO East . "
13
He continued : " Who monitors the monitors , monitoring the peacekeepers ? "
However , there are also examples of other contingents in ECOMOG protecting civilians from the LPC .
When the LPC attacked Compound 2 outside Buchanan in March , many civilians were injured or killed , and those who could fled to SOS Village , approximately six km .
away , where the Ugandan contingent of ECOMOG was based .
This was followed by some 175 NPFL fighters with about 400 of their relatives who also sought refuge at SOS Village , and who agreed to hand their weapons over to ECOMOG .
The LPC responded by accusing ECOMOG of assisting the NPFL .
For its part , the NPFL accused ECOMOG of enticing the soldiers to come into the disarmament center , and demanded that their soldiers be returned .
The U.N. Response UNOMIL was established by the Security Council on September 22 , 1993 , initially for seven months .
It comprises 303 military observers tasked with monitoring the cease - fire and verifying that the regional peacekeeping force , ECOMOG , is fulfilling its mandate to secure the country and carry out disarmament .
UNOMIL is also supposed to help coordinate humanitarian relief and report violations of international humanitarian law to the Secretary - General .
This mandate should enable the U.N. to deploy personnel throughout the country and provide accurate information about what all the factions are doing , including their responsibility for human rights violations .
In April , the United Nations Security Council extended the UNOMIL 's mandate for another six months , but called for the situation to be reviewed on May 18 and June 30 .
This provides an important opportunity to re-examine UNOMIL 's progress and purpose , and reinforce the need for its mandate to be implemented .
UNOMIL has not been reporting publicly on either the violations of the cease - fire in the southeast or violations of humanitarian law , although apparently reports are being sent to New York .
According to General Opande , the commander of UNOMIL : " We collect as much information as possible , wherever we go , whatever we see , whatever we hear . "
But he made it clear that UNOMIL has to be careful in investigating human rights abuses .
" We 've done some investigations , but they have n't been conclusive .
14 UNOMIL is itself restricted in its movements , and has not been capable of conducting investigations of such violations .
As a U.N. colonel explained : Often a twelve or fifteen - year - old boy stops a U.N. car , and starts complaining and arguing ....
He only knows that he is in power and that he has someone who will do anything he commands -- even kill .
Sometimes it takes hours of discussion , when they have no right to restrict us .
15 In one incident in March , General Opande was evacuating forty - six civilians from a combat zone .
Although he had received authorization from the faction that controlled the area , ULIMO , the convoy was still harassed at every checkpoint .
After the LPC attack on Compound 2 , UNOMIL apparently tried to investigate reports that civilians were killed by the LPC ; the UNOMIL observers were then detained by the LPC for a couple of hours .
16 When asked about the relations between Nigerian ECOMOG and the LPC , UNOMIL officials admitted that they had heard such reports , but could not confirm them .
" Maybe there are some deals going on between ECOMOG and the LPC , " one U.N. official said .
" But they do n't need a lot of weapons and ammunition to take an area in Liberia . "
He continued : " These factions take what they want from a village -- they kill , rape , stay in charge for a couple of weeks .
Then the other group counterattacks .
But they do n't really attack each other ; it 's the civilians who are attacked . "
17 Unfortunately , the U.N. is reluctant to discuss human rights abuses , for fear of derailing the peace process .
According to former president of the interim government , Amos Sawyer :
The question of casting blame for anything -- including human rights violations -- is the last thing the U.N. wants to get involved in .
It stands in the way of access .
The U.N. is being unwittingly manipulated by the so - called parties , because it wants to maintain its relevance to those parties .
18 By avoiding the human rights issues , the U.N. is failing to discharge its mandate in Liberia .
Recommendations To the United Nations : The U.N. mission in Liberia constitutes one of the only means of exerting pressure on the Nigerians , as well as the warring factions , to halt this downward spiral .
The U.N. must implement its mandate : U.N. observers are authorized to report on violations of the cease - fire and of humanitarian law , and they must protest publicly when they are restricted in their movements .
The U.N. must pay close attention to the situation in the southeast , and perhaps recommend replacing some of the Nigerian contingent with Ghanaians and Ugandans , who have a good reputation among the civilians .
The new human rights officer for UNOMIL must engage in active human rights monitoring , so that human rights violations can be documented and their perpetrators identified .
The human rights aspect of the UNOMIL mandate must be reinforced , so that the observers are fully cognizant of their responsibility to report on violations of human rights .
To ECOMOG : ECOMOG should launch an immediate investigation into the charges that members of the Nigerian contingent are assisting the LPC , and make its findings public .
ECOMOG must ensure that all the warring factions -- NPFL , AFL , ULIMO , and LPC -- are disarmed and demobilized in a systematic and even - handed manner .

In Campo , Calif. , a fence stretches along a desolate area of the U.S. - Mexico border .
The federal government wants to install radar , sensors and cameras , but the plan is beset by delays .
Campo agents were supposed to be hooked up to the virtual fence in early 2009 .
( Brian L. Frank for The Wall Street Journal )
The Bush administration created the Secure Border Initiative Network in 2005 to provide real - time pictures of activity along the border .
The system was contracted out to Boeing in 2006 .
More than $ 600 million later , only a 28 - mile - long prototype has been delivered .
( Brian L. Frank for The Wall Street Journal )
Frustrated by the delays , citizens -- calling themselves minutemen -- took up the job .
They installed 20 cameras , encased in PVC pipe for protection , on a private ranch ; they wired them to solar panels and a transmitter that broadcasts the captured images on the Internet .
So far , they 've spent $ 40,000 to cover a one - mile strip and fortify fence ranches .
( Brian L. Frank for The Wall Street Journal )
" It 's tough to keep all the units up and running , " said minuteman Howard " Ridgerunner " Smith , a 59 - year - old retired mechanic .
On a recent day , 16 of their cameras were down due to rainy weather .
They do n't use their motion detector because it 's mostly triggered by wind - stirred vegetation .
( Brian L. Frank for The Wall Street Journal )
The government had its own problems : blurry images , radar that could n't differentiate between people and animals and field agents who could n't log onto their laptops .
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection says the prototype is fixed , but Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano froze most funding to the project Tuesday .

Clashes between Japanese whaling vessels and activists from the Sea Shepherd anti-whaling group have received global attention , but do not go down well in Japan , where whale meat is still considered a delicacy , as the BBC 's Roland Buerk reports .
Whale meat , once widely consumed , is now considered a delicacy in Japan
In the Taru- ichi restaurant in Tokyo's Shinjuku nightclub district , they are getting ready for another busy night .
There is no doubt about what is on the menu here : " Whales of the World " posters are the first thing customers see as they walk through the sliding door .
Shintaro Sato is the manager , running the business his father founded 40 years ago .
This evening he recommends whale sashimi [ raw slices ] , deep - fried whale or whale stew .
' Terrorists '
As for the whale penis suspended from the ceiling , that is best eaten boiled with a side order of ginger , although Mr Sato admits the taste is " a little strange " .
When it comes to anti-whaling activists like Peter Bethune , the Sea Shepherd captain brought to Japan and arrested by the coastguard after boarding a whaler in the Southern Ocean , he is uncompromising .
" They are terrorists , I think , " he says .
" Their purpose is money . "
When we were growing up we did n't have ample food , so this was meat for us , our protein
Mitoshi Noguchi
A group of salarymen has ordered a plate of whale sashimi to share with their glasses of sake .
They have chosen the restaurant for an office night out .
Like many other Japanese , Mitoshi Noguchi says he does not give whaling much of a thought .
The issue is discussed on Japanese television and in newspapers less than in countries where there is opposition to whaling like Australia .
But when he sees images of anti-whaling activists clashing with the Japanese fleet he is irritated .
For him there is nothing wrong with eating whale , it reminds him of school lunch .
" When we were growing up we did n't have ample supply of food , so this was meat for us , our protein , " he says .
" So when we eat it now it 's very reminiscent .
It 's delicious . "
' Reality ' check Mr Noguchi is in late middle age , but on the same table is one of his much younger colleagues , Yoshitaka Takayanagi , born after the meat was phased out in Japanese schools .
Many in Japan see Pete Bethune as little more than a " terrorist " Few Japanese eat whale regularly these days , especially the young , and he has only eaten it twice before .
" I think it 's part of Japanese culture , " Mr Takayanagi says .
" But I have n't had that many chances to try it .
If it 's becoming extinct we should not eat it .
So I do n't totally disagree with them [ anti- whaling protestors ] .
" If I could n't eat it I guess I could live without it . "
While the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society has been confronting Japanese whalers on the high seas , Greenpeace has been taking a different approach to end whaling .
It is trying to turn the take - it - or - leave - it attitude to whale meat among many young Japanese into outright opposition to whaling .
Most of the people , once they know about it , think this is not a science at all
Junichi Sato , Greenpeace
They have produced videos and held protests highlighting the cost to taxpayers of subsidising the annual whale hunt in the Southern Ocean , justified by Japan as scientific research .
" Japanese people need to know the reality of this so - called scientific research , " says Junichi Sato , a Greenpeace programme director .
" Most of the people in Japan do n't know that Japan is killing close to 1,000 whales a year in the Southern Ocean .
" Most of the people , once they know about it , think this is not a science at all .
That 's a start , that 's why we need to feed information . "
Meat trade
It was to try to draw attention to whaling that Junichi Sato and another Greenpeace member intercepted a box of whale meat at a courier company depot two years ago .
Mr Sato wanted to prove whale meat was being sold on the black market Crewmen , they claimed , had smuggled it from the taxpayer - subsidised whaling fleet to sell on the black market , with the connivance of the authorities .
They handed their evidence , very publicly , to prosecutors .
" They promised to have a proper investigation , but a month later they dropped it , " says Mr Sato .
" On the very same day the Tokyo Metropolitan Police arrested us .
They basically did n't prosecute the corruption in the government .
" They instead prosecuted the person who exposed the corruption . "
Mr Sato and his colleague are on trial .
They hope to be cleared on the grounds they were acting in the public interest , but if convicted of theft could face up to 10 years in prison .
Peter Bethune , the Sea Shepherd activist brought to Japan , could yet face a trial too .
After his arrest he was led off the Shonan Maru 2 by the coastguard , the scene hidden from photographers with a blue plastic sheet .
He is being held on suspicion of trespassing on a vessel .
If charged and convicted he could be fined or imprisoned .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A measure to give some 57 million elderly people , veterans and persons with disabilities a $ 250 check was rejected by the Senate on Wednesday , a setback for the powerful seniors ’ lobby .

President Barack Obama has called for Congress to approve the payments to make up for their benefits not increasing this year , but the Senate defeated it 50 to 47 .
The payments would have added $ 13 billion to a $ 108 billion job - creation package pending in the Senate .
Congress approved payments last year as part of the $ 862 billion stimulus package .
Social Security payments for the elderly and disabled will stay flat this year for the first time since 1975 because they are tied to consumer prices , which decreased amid the worst economic recession in 70 years .
That follows a year in which payments rose by 5.8 percent , largely due to a spike in gasoline prices .
“ It is wrong to turn our backs on seniors in this moment of economic difficulty , ” said Independent Senator Bernie Sanders , who sponsored the amendment .
But Republican Senator Judd Gregg pointed out that the bill would defeat the purpose of indexing Social Security payments to inflation .
“ The law says it should n’t be given , ” Gregg said .
At least 10 Democrats agreed with Gregg and joined 40 Republicans to defeat the proposal .

Do n't Fret About Cholesterol
Recommendations :
About the author
( NewsTarget ) I 'd like to shine the spotlight on one of medicine 's sacred cows - the belief that lowering cholesterol with drugs protects against heart attacks and premature death .
Our obsession with cholesterol began in the 1950s when studies linked high consumption of animal fat with high rates of heart disease .
This opened the door for clinical trials that laid the foundation of a new paradigm : the cholesterol theory of cardiovascular disease .
This theory has had profound ramifications .
It changed the way we eat ( fats bad , carbohydrates good ) and contributed to our problems with obesity and diabetes .
It wormed its way into " clinical practice guidelines " - cholesterol management has become a " standard of care " that doctors are expected to follow .
It spawned the invasive heart surgery industry , based on the presumption that cholesterol - laden blockages must be bypassed or propped open .
And it led to the creation of the best - selling class of medications in history : cholesterol - lowering statin drugs , which generate more than $ 15 billion in worldwide sales every year .
But it 's all a house of cards .
No matter what you 've been led to believe , a high cholesterol level is not a reliable sign of an impending heart attack .
In fact , growing numbers of experts question whether cholesterol matters at all .
As for statin drugs , for most of the 40 - plus million Americans recommended to take them for the rest of their lives , they 're an ineffective , expensive , side effect - riddled fraud .
When a patient taking Lipitor , Zocor , or another statin drug comes to Whitaker Wellness , we discontinue it at once .
" But my cholesterol level is 240 . "
" My doctor told me I 'll have a heart attack if I do n't take this drug .
" My father died of heart disease , so I have to take it . "
I 've heard all these justifications and more , and I still recommend that my patients get off statins .
Here 's why .
First , they 're not very effective .
These drugs do lower cholesterol , but so what ?
We 're not treating lab numbers .
We 're treating patients , and the ultimate goal in cholesterol management is to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease .
Except for a very limited number of people , there is absolutely no evidence that statins protect against heart attack or premature death .
Are you over age 65 ?
Not a single study suggests you 'll receive any benefits , even if your cholesterol goes down substantially .
A woman of any age ?
Same story .
A man younger than 65 who has never had a heart attack ?
Ditto , no help at all .
For middle - aged men who have had a heart attack , statins may lower risk of a repeat heart attack , but that 's the extent of it .
I know this is hard to buy in light of the multiple drug advertisements and glowing endorsements from doctors .
But keep in mind that pharmaceutical companies do a superb job of pulling the wool over the eyes of consumers and physicians alike by withholding unfavorable study results and making false , misleading , and often deceptive claims .
That 's why I want to step around confusing statistics and tell you about an easy - to - understand measure that you 'll never hear about in drug ads .
It 's called " number needed to treat , " or NNT , and it describes the number of patients who would need to be treated with a medical therapy in order to prevent one bad outcome .
Experts consider an NNT over 50 to be " worse than a lottery ticket .
" Lipitor ads claim that it reduces risk of heart attack by 36 percent .
Sounds pretty good until you look at the fine print , do the math ( which John Carey did in a great article in Business Week ) , and figure out that the drug 's NNT is 100 .
This means that 100 people must be treated with Lipitor in order for just one heart attack to be prevented .
The other 99 people taking the drug receive no benefit .
To put this into perspective , the NNT of antibiotics for treating H. pylori , the underlying cause of stomach ulcers , is 1.1 .
These drugs knock out the bacteria in 10 out of 11 people who take it , making them a reliable , cost - effective therapy .
At the other end of the spectrum are statins , which as a class have an NNT of 250 , 500 , or higher depending on the study you look at .
What a deal for drugs that can cost more than a thousand bucks a year and are almost guaranteed to cause problems .
Statins lower cholesterol by suppressing the activity of an enzyme in the liver involved in the production of cholesterol .
But this enzyme has multiple functions , including the synthesis of coenzyme Q10 .
CoQ10 is a key player in the metabolic processes that energize our cells .
No wonder statin users often suffer from fatigue , muscle pain and weakness , and even heart failure - the cells are simply running out of juice .
The second most frequent adverse effects of statins are problems with memory , mood , suicidal behavior , and neurological issues .
Other common complaints include sexual dysfunction , and liver and digestive problems .
Symptoms range from minor ( achiness , forgetfulness ) to serious ( complete but temporary amnesia , permanent memory loss ) to lethal ( congestive heart failure , rhabdomyolysis or complete muscle breakdown ) .
One statin drug , Baycol , was taken off the market a few years ago after it caused dozens of deaths from rhabdomyolysis .
Several studies have also linked statin drugs with an increased risk of cancer .
Because physicians rarely warn of these side effects , few patients suspect their drugs may be the reason they begin feeling bad - and it's often a revelation when they put two and two together .
Simply discontinuing these medications can result in tremendous improvements in health and well - being .
Texas cardiologist Peter Langsjoen , MD , published a study showing that when symptomatic patients got off their statins and started taking 240 mg of CoQ10 per day , they had significant decreases in fatigue , myalgias ( muscle aches ) , dyspnea ( shortness of breath ) , memory loss , and / or peripheral neuropathy .
As you can see , we need to shift away from this myopic focus on statin drugs and lowering cholesterol , and take a more holistic view .
Folks , you do n't need statins - you need a program that addresses all the known risk factors for heart attack , stroke , and other cardiovascular disorders .
Inflammation , not high cholesterol , is the primary cause of heart disease .
Harvard researchers have discovered that a high blood level of C - reactive protein , a marker of inflammation , is more predictive of heart disease than cholesterol .
To get a handle on inflammation , lose weight - especially if you carry excess fat in the abdominal area .
Exercise .
Stop smoking .
Eat plenty of vegetables and several weekly servings of salmon , sardines , and other omega - 3 fatty acids , and avoid sugars and starches .
The beauty of this program is that it targets not only inflammation but other conditions that contribute to cardiovascular disease , including high blood pressure , diabetes , even cholesterol .
Best of all , it 's a foundation for overall good health .
Your program should include a well - rounded nutritional supplement regimen , as well .
My number - one suggestion for inflammation in all its guises is fish oil .
This supplement also improves blood flow , discourages excess clotting , helps normalize heart rhythm , and saves lives by reducing risk of sudden cardiac death .
Folic acid and other B - complex vitamins are important because they lower levels of homocysteine , a toxic substance that damages the arteries .
The mineral magnesium relaxes the arterial walls , which improves blood flow , lowers blood pressure , and helps prevent arrhythmias .
And antioxidants , such as vitamins C and E , provide protection against damaging free radicals - another contributor to cardiovascular disease .
Supplements that boost the heart 's energy are recommended as well .
One is coenzyme Q10 .
In addition to serving as a potent antioxidant , CoQ10 also increases the heart muscle 's efficiency and protects against the adverse effects of statin drugs .
Another is D-ribose , a natural sugar that is the structural backbone of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , the energy that fuels cellular function .
As far as cholesterol lowering is concerned , there are a number of natural therapies that work well , including flaxseed and other sources of fiber , niacin , plant sterols , and policosanol .
In short , do what you can to manage your cholesterol , but do n't worry about it if your level is particularly stubborn .
The average cholesterol of people who have heart disease is n't much higher than the level of those who do n't .
If high cholesterol runs in your family , concentrate on what you can control , and remember , numbers are n't everything . *
Here are suggested daily doses of the supplements discussed above : fish oil 2 - 8 g , folic acid 800 - 1,200 mcg , magnesium 500 - 1,000 mg , vitamins C 1,000 - 5,000 mg , and E 400 - 800 IU , CoQ10 100-400 mg , D- ribose 10 - 15 g , flaxseed 1/ 4 cup , niacin 500 - 2,000 mg , plant sterols 1,500 - 2,000 mg , and policosanol 20 mg .

Stacey
Hyde was 17 at the time of the offence A Somerset teenager has been jailed for life , with a minimum term of nine years , for stabbing her best friend 's boyfriend to death .
Stacey Hyde , 18 , of Wells , repeatedly plunged a kitchen knife into the back of Vincent Francis , 34 , at a flat in Charter Way in the city last year .
Bristol Crown Court heard that Hyde objected to the way that Mr Francis treated her friend Holly Banwell .
Jailing her , Mr Justice Field said drink was a major factor in the murder .
Hyde had pleaded not guilty on grounds of self - defence .
The judge told her on the night of the murder she was " very , very drunk " .
Frenzied attack
He said : " You were a young teenager when you started drinking - the age of 12 .
By the time you were 17 , you had been drinking very heavily .
" I 've no doubt that drink played a major role in the commission of this offence . "
Mr Francis was struck up to 17 times by the knife in what police described as a frenzied attack , the court was told .
Mr Francis died an hour after a stab wound pierced his lung Waitress Hyde had been invited back to the flat Mr Francis and 27 - year - old Ms Banwell shared for a drinking session on 4 September , but a fight broke out .
The court was told she ran at Mr Francis , knocking him to the ground , after hearing a row break out between him and Ms Banwell .
Mr Francis and Ms Banwell 's relationship was described as volatile and occasionally violent .
After the stabbing , Hyde - who was 17 at the time - told Ms Banwell : " I did it for you because I do n't like the way he treats you . "
Hyde said she had picked up the 10.25 ins ( 26 cm ) knife because she felt threatened by Mr Francis , but the jury rejected this defence .

' Cash for Appliances ' coming to a state near you
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
A government program that gives consumers rebates on purchases of energy - efficient household appliances is ramping up in states across the country .
The $ 300 million ' Cash for Appliances ' program , first announced last year , is funded by the government 's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and is similar to other federal programs like Cash for Caulkers and Cash for Clunkers .
Under the program , consumers are eligible to receive rebates on new , energy - efficient appliances such as refrigerators or washing machines .
The rebates vary by state , type of appliance , and level of efficiency .
Rebates are only available on appliances with the Energy Star logo , which meet the energy efficiency guidelines set by the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy .
The goal of Cash for Appliances is to help American 's conserve energy , while also boosting retail sales and ultimately helping spur the economic recovery .
In New York , where the program went into effect Friday , rebates range from $ 75 to $ 105 on refrigerators , freezers and clothes washers .
The rebates can be as high as $ 555 for bundled purchases of all three appliances .
" This program will provide a tremendous incentive for consumers all across New York to reduce their energy consumption while providing an important stimulus to our economy , " New York Gov. David Paterson said in a statement .
Georgia , which also launched its program Friday , is offering consumers rebates of up to $ 199 on items such as air - source heat pumps , solar - powered water heaters and gas boilers .
California received the most funding , with $ 35.3 million .
The state already has incentives in place of energy - efficient appliances , but will begin offering additional rebates under the federal program in April .
Texas received the second - largest amount of funding .
The state plans to start its $ 23.3 million program in April .
Oklahoma , which had the smallest budget at $ 1.9 million , will also start its program in April .
While the program is still rolling out in most states , Kansas blew through its $ 2.7 million budget for the appliance program relatively quickly .
The state , which already had a list of applicants under an existing program , closed its program in late January after being open for just over one month .
Three other states have also already launched appliance rebate programs : Connecticut , Oregon and Illinois .
The program should help boost spending on efficient products in the short term , said Matt Golden , head of nonprofit trade group Efficiency First .
However , to meet the nation 's energy needs in the future , he said the government will have to focus on services , rather than products .
" It 's moving the market towards more efficient appliances , which is good , " he said .
" But it lacks the scale to be a long term solution . "
Meanwhile , retailers say it 's difficult to predict how the program will impact sales because the conditions vary widely from state to state .
" It 's tough to say , from a sales perspective , because each state has such a different program , " said Home Depot spokeswoman Jean Neimi .
" But we 're excited the program is in place .
Any opportunity to educate our customers on the benefits of energy efficiency is welcome . "
An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that West Virginia received the second - largest amount of funding .
Things were bad all over the U.S. in 2009 , but some areas got hit harder than others .
Overall U.S. per capita income dropped 2.6 % to about $ 31,000 .
Connecticut , home to many of the titans of finance , continued to be the state with the highest per capita income in the nation at $ 54,000 , but it was in the top 10 in terms of declines from 2008 with a 3.3 % drop .
Wyoming had the largest personal income drop in the country at 5.9 % .
Only four states posted gains in per capita personal income with West Virginia coming out on top with a 1.8 % increase , though it has seventh lowest level in the nation .
Every state experienced a decline in employment last year .
Unsurprisingly , California , the most populous state , lost the most jobs , but its average unemployment rate of 11.4 % , fourth highest in the nation , showed that the decline was disproportionate compared to other states .
North Dakota , the nation ’s third least populous state , had the smallest drop in jobs , but it also had the lowest average unemployment rate .
Home prices , as measured by Federal Housing Finance Agency which only tracks mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , posted large declines in bubble areas such as Nevada , Arizona and Florida .
But 18 states posted year - to - year gains , according to FHFA whose index may understate declines since it does n’t track jumbo or subprime loans .

This kind of speed could be fatal for the crew of the Enterprise ( Image : Paramount / Everett / Rex Features )
Update :
An earlier version of this story referred to the Borg using cloaking technology , which several readers pointed out is not supported by televisual evidence .
Of course , we were speculating on the technology existing in the alternate universe created by J. J. Abrams .
However , to avoid confusion we have amended the decloaking reference to cite the Romulans .
Star Trek fans , prepare to be disappointed .
Kirk , Spock and the rest of the crew would die within a second of the USS Enterprise approaching the speed of light .
The problem lies with Einstein ’s special theory of relativity .
It transforms the thin wisp of hydrogen gas that permeates interstellar space into an intense radiation beam that would kill humans within seconds and destroy the spacecraft ’s electronic instruments .
Advertisement
Interstellar space is an empty place .
For every cubic centimetre , there are fewer than two hydrogen atoms , on average , compared with 30 billion billion atoms of air here on Earth .
But according to William Edelstein of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore , Maryland , that sparse interstellar gas should worry the crew of a spaceship travelling close to the speed of light even more than Romulans decloaking off the starboard bow .
Special relativity describes how space and time are distorted for observers travelling at different speeds .
For the crew of a spacecraft ramping up to light speed , interstellar space would appear highly compressed , thereby increasing the number of hydrogen atoms hitting the craft .
Death ray
Worse is that the atoms ’ kinetic energy also increases .
For a crew to make the 50,000 - light - year journey to the centre of the Milky Way within 10 years , they would have to travel at 99.999998 per cent the speed of light .
At these speeds , hydrogen atoms would seem to reach a staggering 7 teraelectron volts – the same energy that protons will eventually reach in the Large Hadron Collider when it runs at full throttle .
“ For the crew , it would be like standing in front of the LHC beam , ” says Edelstein .
The spacecraft ’s hull would provide little protection .
Edelstein calculates that a 10 - centimetre - thick layer of aluminium would absorb less than 1 per cent of the energy .
Because hydrogen atoms have a proton for a nucleus , this leaves the crew exposed to dangerous ionising radiation that breaks chemical bonds and damages DNA .
“ Hydrogen atoms are unavoidable space mines , ” says Edelstein .
The fatal dose of radiation for a human is 6 sieverts .
Edelstein ’s calculations show that the crew would receive a radiation dose of more than 10,000 sieverts within a second .
Intense radiation would also weaken the structure of the spacecraft and damage its electronic instruments .
Edelstein speculates this might be one reason why extraterrestrial civilisations have n’t paid us a visit .
Even if ET has mastered building a rocket that can travel at the speed of light , he may be lying dead inside a weakened craft whose navigation systems have short - circuited .
Edelstein presented his results on Saturday at the American Physical Society meeting in Washington DC .

Forming a double helix prevents the RNA from going round in circles ( Image : Laguna Design / SPL )
The primordial soup that gave birth to life on Earth may have had an extra , previously unrecognised ingredient : a “ molecular midwife ” that played a crucial role in allowing the first large biomolecules to assemble from their building blocks .
The earliest life forms are thought by many to have been based not on DNA but on the closely related molecule RNA , because long strands of RNA can act as rudimentary enzymes .
This would have allowed a primitive metabolism to develop before life forms made proteins for this purpose .
RNA strands are formed from building blocks called nucleotides linked together head to tail in a long chain .
This happens easily if the nucleotides can bind to another RNA strand that guides their assembly .
However , the earliest RNA molecules to form , billions of years ago , would have had no pre-existing RNA to guide them .
Advertisement
Round in circles
Till now , attempts to mimic this first synthesis have always hit a fatal obstacle : instead of binding to the tail of a new nucleotide , the head of a growing chain latches onto its own tail instead .
This tendency to form circles keeps RNA molecules from growing much longer than three to six nucleotides – far too short to function as enzymes .
“ That is a big problem , ” says Nicholas Hud , a chemist at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta .
“ How do we get a molecule long enough to do something interesting ? ”
The answer , Hud thinks , may be the presence of a “ molecular midwife ” – a molecule that nestles between adjacent nucleotides and encourages two growing RNA strands to bind together in a double helix .
Since this double helix is much stiffer than a single RNA strand , it is less likely to bend around on itself and form a circle .
If the concentration of molecules in the solution later decreased – as , for example , if rain diluted a primordial puddle – the midwives would tend to slip back out of their slots in the RNA molecule .
This would allow the two RNA strands to separate , leaving exactly the sort of long , single - stranded RNA molecule that might act as a catalyst in the RNA world .
Double helices
Sure enough , when Hud and his colleagues added ethidium – which is known to slip between a double helix – to a solution of nucleotides , they found that they joined up into long double helices instead of short circles .
The team studied DNA nucleotides , because the resulting chains are easier to work with , but the same should apply for RNA , they say .
Ethidium itself is a rather complicated molecule with several benzene - like or “ aromatic ” rings , and is unlikely to have been available to fill this role in the primordial soup .
However , molecules found in ancient meteorites suggest that the prebiotic Earth was rich in compounds with a similar structure .
Hud ’s next challenge is to show that some of these polycyclic aromatic molecules can indeed help RNA molecules assemble .
“ Ethidium demonstrates the principle .
Is there something among that mix that serves the same purpose ? ” says Gerald Joyce , a biochemist who studies the origin of life at Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla , California .

Karl Rove has a memoir out on Tuesday , and like those in politics tend to , he uses the book as a chance to defend the work he did while in the White House .
In Courage and Consequence , Rove denies having any involvement with the prosecution of Don Siegelman and the firing of seven U.S. attorneys , lays into Democrats who accused the White House of lying about weapons of mass destruction , and delivers a big wet smooch to his former boss George W. Bush .
But the book ’s not all about him .
Rove also savages Al Gore for questioning Saddam Hussein ’s possession of WMDs as “ the most pathetic display of hypocrisy ” and accuses President Obama of playing “ fast and loose with the facts . ”
Lest you forget , this is man whose name is now a synonym for dirty politics .
But more interesting than the stories of his time in the Bush Administration is one about the time he got beat up by a girl .
Here ’s the story as recounted by the Washington Post ’s Steven Livingston :
Almost makes you feel sorry for little Karl Rove .

The Ultimate Fighting Championship has been banned from German television .
The Bavarian state office for new media ( BLM ) revoked the promotion ’s broadcast clearance on Thursday for programming including “ The Ultimate Fighter , ” “ UFC Unleashed ” and “ UFC Fight Night , ” which had been televised on German sports television channel DSF since March 2009 .
“ The committee deems that television formats characterized by the extend of violence shown to be unacceptable , “ read a statement from the BLM .
The BLM also described the programming as a “ breach of taboos like punching a downed opponent , ” which is illegal under article 111a of the Bavarian constitution .
The paragraph deals with the glorification of violence in the media .
The BLM decision did not state an exact date when the UFC programming would no longer be allowed to air .
DSF Chief Executive Officer Zeljko Karajica was unable to assess the full consequences the decision will have for the sports channel .
“ We have taken note of today ’s decision by the BLM , ” Karajica told Sherdog.com .
“ However , we cannot give a final comment as we have to examine what kind of consequences it will have internally , especially with regard to the existing contractual relationship with the UFC .
” The UFC and DSF reached an agreement in February 2009 to air around 500 hours of UFC programming over the next three years .
The network has aired the promotion ’s pay - per - view events starting with UFC 96 , mostly on a one - week delay .
While the ratings have been solid for the nightly broadcasts , the channel has complained about a lack of advertising customers interested in the product .
Thursday ’s ban is not going to be in immediate effect , as the channel plans to run a delayed broadcast of “ UFC Live : Vera vs. Jones ” on Monday .
Marshall Zelaznik , UFC UK president and managing director of international development , took the same line as Karajica in a press release issued on Friday .
“ We have been monitoring this development together with our partner DSF for a couple of weeks , ” said the release .
“ Although we are not surprised by the decision , we consider it unusual to take action without listening to the concerning parties first .
” Zelaznik additionally stated that they are in the process of arranging a hearing with the BLM .
“ The Bavarian state office for new media has approved UFC programming on DSF twice on separate occasions in the past , ” said Zelaznik .
“ That is why we deem the sudden ban unusual as the content of our programming has not changed .
We have also had a commission for youth protection in the media review the situation and they deemed the broadcast legal if televised after 11 p.m .
” The UFC UK president also rejected the accusations that the company was glorifying violence , especially by the fact that it is legal to punch a downed opponent .
He requested the commission to “ look at the sport as a whole ” and criticized the decision - makers for “ not taking the time to learn about the sport before rendering a decision .
” During additional correspondence with Sherdog.com on Friday , Zelaznik said the UFC is " still allowed to air on DSF and in fact is continuing to air until a final decision from BLM is rendered .
" A silver lining on the horizon for the promotion , which has been under heavy fire from both media and politicians , is a pledge of allegiance from local co-promoter and concert mogul Marek Lieberberg , who helped host the U.S. - based organization ’s debut event , UFC 99 , in Cologne last June .
The BLM ’s decision “ will not change a thing about our excellent cooperation with the UFC , ” the 63 - year - old wrote to Sherdog.com in an e-mail .
UFC 99 , which included a 195 - pound catch - weight bout between Wanderlei Silva and Rich Franklin , was heavily criticized by local officials and the press .
To quell disapproval , the promotion said that the venue agreed to a stipulation where patrons had to be over 18 years of age to attend the event .
Toyota 's troubles with so - called sudden acceleration are so well publicized , we 're not going to run them down here .
But we 'd remind the world 's largest carmaker that it might be far worse .
As well as sticky accelerator pedals and ill - fitting floor mats , they could also be facing cars that spontaneously combust .

Tata Nano Europa at Geneva Auto Show
Flaming Tatas ?
That 's what seems to be happening in India , according to Indian Autos Blog .
There have now been several cases in which the tiny , adorable Tata Nano , the world 's cheapest car , has burst into flames .
While only 7,500 Nanos have been built thus far , three separate fires were reported last fall , two on the same day , while the cars were parked .
Those incidents involved smoke from the steering column .
Fault battery ?
Switch short circuit ?
The first case was initially attributed to a faulty battery .
Debasis Ray , a Tata Motors spokesperson , later said the incidents stemmed from a short circuit in the Nano's " combination switch . "
A new supplier was quickly chosen for the switch , and Tata checked the few thousand cars then on the road .
But this week , a more serious fire erupted .
Chauffered in a new Nano
Mumbai insurance agent Satish Sawant had just picked up his new Nano at the dealer .
He was being chauffered home in it ( he does not yet drive ) when a motorcyclist signaled that something was wrong .
Flames coming from the rear of the car ( where the engine is located ) quickly spread , and although Sawant and the driver escaped , the Nano was severely damaged .
Full investigation
To its credit , Tata has now ordered a thorough investigation into the cause of the Sawant fire , which it called a " unique case . "
It also offered a full refund to Sawant .
The ignition - switch fires may send chills down the spine of Ford engineers , who likely recall the mysterious fires that afflicted hundreds of Ford trucks parked inside garages and elsewhere .
Faulty Ford switch : 14 million vehicles
In that case , a cruise - control deactivation switch from Texas Instruments was ultimately deemed the culprit .
Several home fires and at least two deaths were attributed to fires caused when the faulty switch overheated .
In the end , Ford had to recall more than 14 million vehicles to replace the switch .
We hope and trust Tata will get on top of any problems long before that .
Toyota recall guide

Once seated , Mr. Huynh hardly glanced at the 300 or so items on the menu before spitting out a long order for our waiter .
Meanwhile , the sound of shattering pots rang throughout the restaurant .
The reason was n’t clumsiness .
It turned out that the house specialty , rice cooked in a clay pot , is served after a ritual you are n’t likely to find in New York : before serving , waiters break the clay pots and then scrape out the crispy patties of rice that remain .
To ensure there are no lingering shards of clay , glove - clad waiters toss the rice patties across the room to each other before depositing them on diners ’ tables and sprinkling them with a scallion - spiked sauce .
( According to Richard Sterling , a friend who lives in Ho Chi Minh City and wrote Lonely Planet ’s “ World Food : Vietnam , ” this is an ancient tradition in Southeast Asia , but one that is rarely performed these days . )
As the baked rice landed on our table , a waiter showed me a scar on his thumb from breaking a pot , a hazard of the job .
A few minutes later , a procession of dishes began arriving : Japanese eggplant , sautéed with enough garlic to take out a vampire ; steamed blood cockles ; caramelized fish hatchlings cooked in a clay pot ; and lotus root salad .
All were washed down with a bia da , beer with ice , a time - honored southern Vietnam tradition .

But Mr. Huynh , I would quickly learn , never settles for just one meal .
Every time we met , whether for breakfast , lunch or dinner , we ’d make several stops , snacking our way down the street .
Sometimes we ’d slurp up a bowl of pho before he ’d guide me down alleyways for one of the many variations on the theme of bun ( pronounced “ boon ” ) , a vermicelli noodle bowl filled with pork and veggies .
Then we ’d stop at a cart for sticky rice or a pork - crammed banh mi sandwich and then , finally , sit down on a sidewalk stool for a dosa - like shrimp - and - pork - stuffed banh xeo .
( Whether we were eating street food or at a restaurant , the meal for two , plus a couple of beers , rarely exceeded $ 20 . )
“ The most authentic food in Saigon is at street carts and simple restaurants , ” he said during one of our multi-stop extravaganzas .
One day , while Mr. Huynh had a business meeting , I stopped into the Black Cat , a restaurant owned by a friend of a friend , Geoffrey Deetz , originally from the Bay Area .
Over cold bottles of Vietnamese beer , he took my guide ’s comments a step further : “ It ’s more about style than substance at the new trendy restaurants , ” he said , explaining that most Vietnamese chefs have yet to successfully elevate traditional cuisine .
As Vietnam ’s robust economy continues to grow and newly built skyscrapers devour blocks that once offered no - frills food options , finding decent dining in the central District 1 is becoming a challenge .

A SWIMMER claimed all men are being branded as paedophiles after new changing room rules were imposed across Kirklees .
Father - of - three Craig Roper said he was upset when he was ordered out of Scissett Baths ’ men ’s changing room because schoolchildren were using it .
Mr Roper , who has used the baths regularly for 30 years , said he normally went to the noon public length swimming .
He said if schoolboys were still getting changed he would use the private cubicles .
But on March 18 Mr Roper found himself in a bust up with a female teacher after being let into the electronically operated room by a lifeguard .
He said : “ She said ‘ What are you doing in here , you ’re not supposed to be here ? ’
“ I said ‘ This is a male public changing area ’ , but she said , ‘ we ’ve rented this space ’ . ”
Mr Roper was then forced to use the bath ’s separate sauna facility to change .
He said : “ It implies that any male is perceived as paedophilic or as a threat or pervert .
“ They have n’t done this on the female side .
“ I do n’t take it personally I just resent the introduction of a plethora of rules and regulations without considering how it impacts people ’s lives .
“ It would now seem that the local schools have initiated a policy of ‘ lock down ’ and implemented designated exclusion zones in what should be public spaces .
“ After decades of the common sense approach to the multi-use of this small pool with limited resources it would now seem that the politically correct brigade have hijacked the agenda .
“ These new imposed rules and regulations interfere with the civil liberties of the general public wanting to use this public sports centre . ”
A spokeswoman for Kirklees Active Leisure ( KAL ) , said the policy was there to protect all customers and applied both to male and female changing rooms .
She said : “ We take all of our customers ’ safety and privacy very seriously and in order to protect all of our customers against any potential incidents we have a number of policies in place .
“ In response to the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 and the Kirklees Council Safe Practice in School Pools , KAL Pools and other Swimming Activities 2008 , we have a duty to specific groups in our community including our local schools to provide safeguarding of children .
“ Kirklees Active Leisure introduced a new school swimming policy in 2007 in partnership with the education service stating that the teacher in charge of school swim sessions has the responsibility to ensure the safety and supervision of the pupils .
“ As part of this policy KAL , where possible , make arrangements for separate school changing areas to be available .
“ This is the case at Scissett Baths , alternative changing areas are available to other customers during this time .
These policies not only protect children but also all of our customers . ”
Mr Roper ’s incident comes shortly after businessman Mirko Fischer said he was suing British Airways after he was told he could not sit next to a child that was not his son .
The airline has a policy that bans male passengers from sitting next to children they do n’t know – even if the child ’s parents are on board .
I have been watching parts of [ Douglas Crockford ’s talks on the history and future of Javascript ] ( http://yuiblog.com/crockford/).
In his third talk Douglas talks about functions .
If you are somewhat familiar with Javascript you know that functions are , somewhat oddly , used to create new objects .
The original “ intended ” way ( which Douglas calls the _pseudo - classical_ way ) of doing this is as follows :
~~~~~~~
function Person ( name , age ) {
this .name = name ;
this.age = age ;
}
Person.prototype.getNameAndAge = function ( ) {
return “ Name : “ + this .name + “ and age : “ + this .age ;
} ;
var p = new Person ( “ Zef Hemel ” , 26 ) ;
console.log(p.getNameAndAge ( ) ) ;
~~~~~~~
What we do here is define a constructor function ` Person` , which starts with a capital P , to indicate that it should be used in conjunction with the `new` operator , as demonstrated in the second last line .
The second statement adds a method to the `Person` prototype , which in practice makes that method available to all ` Person` objects ( including ones already created ) .
The last two statements instantiate a ` Person` object and calls the `getNameAndAge` method .
Using this mechanism you can also implement inheritance .
Let ’s introduce a ` LivingBeing` “ super class ” , which has an `age` property :
~~~~~~~
function LivingBeing ( age ) {
this.age = age ;
}
LivingBeing.prototype.getAge = function ( ) {
return this .age ;
} ;
~~~~~~~
Alright , now we ’ll define the `Person` contructor again , but assign a new instance of `LivingBeing` to its prototype , which will add all fields and methods available in ` LivingBeing` to all ` Person` objects ( again , including existing ones ) .
Then , we add an additional method to ` Person` objects : `getNameAndAge` :
~~~~~~~
function Person ( name , age ) {
this .name = name ;
this.age = age ;
}
Person.prototype = new LivingBeing ( ) ;
Person.prototype.getNameAndAge = function ( ) {
return “ Name : “ + this .name + “ and age : “
+ this.getAge ( ) ;
} ;
var p = new Person ( “ Zef Hemel ” , 26 ) ;
console.log(p.getNameAndAge ( ) ) ;
~~~~~~~
For more information on how inheritance and prototypes work , read [ this excellent page in the Mozilla documentation ] ( https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Details_of_the_Object_Model).
Now , Crockford suggests that there is a nicer , cleaner and more natural way to do object - oriented programming and inheritance in Javascript , which he calls _functional inheritance_ .
The functional - inheritance style version of the above program looks as follows :
~~~~~~~~
function livingBeing ( age ) {
return {
getAge : function ( ) {
return age ;
}
} ;
}
function person ( name , age ) {
var that = living Being ( age ) ;
that.getNameAndAge = function ( ) {
return “ Name : “ + name + “ and age : “ + that.getAge ( ) ;
} ;
return that ;
}
var p = person ( “ Zef Hemel ” , 26 ) ;
console.log(p.getNameAndAge ( ) ) ;
~~~~~~~~
Note that the invocation style of the constructors changed here too , no `new` keyword should be used .
I agree that this is a nice style , although it makes extending existing objects with additional methods / fields hard , but one could argue this is a bad idea anyway .
Although clean , it also seems more expensive to execute , because you ’re basically composing an object from scratch every time — you start out with an empty object and that push in all its methods and fields — while with the pseudo - classical approach you create one prototype object with all the methods , and then simply point to that object .
Theoretically _calling_ a method would then be more expensive , because at invocation - time the prototype hierarchy has to be traversed .
But maybe Javascript engines have a clever solution to all of this and in practice it does n’t matter .
I decided to investigate .
I benchmarked two things :
1 . The performance of object creation , by creating 10 x 1,000,000 objects
2 . The performance of method calling on a single object , by invoking a method 10 x 1,000,000 times
I did each 10 times , so that I can take an average time on each .
I executed this benchmark on four browsers running on my Mac ( Macbook Pro ) :
* Firefox 3.5
* Chrome 5 ( dev )
* Safari 4
* Opera 10.50 b
** Disclaimer 1 :** The reason I executed these on these four browsers is not to compare their performance , _this is not a good way to compare browser performance_ , but mainly to check that the results in different browsers do not diverge too much .
** Disclaimer 2 :** What I ’m testing is not representative for real programs .
If one approach is going to be twice as fast as the other , this does not imply that your programs are going to be twice as fast , it means that _object creation_ is twice as fast , or method invocation is twice as fast .
Whether that matters to you depends on the amount of objects you create or methods you call .
Benchmark 1 : Object creation
— — — — — — — — — — — — — —
This benchmark creates 1,000,000 objects .
First using the pseudo - classical style and then through the functional style .
The ( http://gist.github.com/318662).
The times reported are in milliseconds for 1,000,000 objects being created .
As mentioned , every test is performed 10 times of which I took the average :
** Update :**
The previous version of the benchmark script contained a major flaw that increased the execution time of the functional style considerably .
This has now been adjusted in the graph .
Thanks Adrian for noticing this .
This chart clearly shows that creating objects using the pseudo - classical style is cheaper in all browsers .
This varies from about 35 % cheaper ( Chrome ) up around three times as cheap ( Firefox ) .
If you create huge amounts of objects in your code , you may want to take this into consideration .
Benchmark 2 : Method invocation
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — —
This benchmark creates one object and then invokes the same method on it 1,000,000 times .
First using the pseudo - classical style and then through the functional style .
The ( http://gist.github.com/318662).
The results are as follows :
I would have expected that method invocation would have been cheaper in the functional style of object creation , but it turns out it ’s not .
The differences here are almost negligible , so I ’d say that in practice it does n’t really matter what style you choose if your application is heavy on method calls .
Still , I felt that the functional style must be cheaper especially if you use inheritance .
So I [ adapted my benchmark script ] ( http://gist.github.com/319415) to introduce a level of inheritance ( like the `LivingBeing` “ super class ” ) .
However , method calls using the pseudo - classical style are still cheaper , although less so .
Perhaps , if you use 4 + levels in your object hierarchy , the functional style method calls may start to become cheaper ( although I expect _creating_ those objects will be much more expensive ) .
It seems that method invocation on objects created using the functional style are roughly as expensive as using the pseudo - classical style .
Conclusion
— — — — —
There are two properties to take into account when deciding what object - creation style you ’re going to use in your code .
1 . Which style produces clearer code ?
This depends on the taste of both on the developers of the code , but if you ’re developing a library for others , possibly also on the expectations of your audience .
Scanning through some Javascript libraries it seems the pseudo - classical approach is much more popular .
Consequently , your audience is likely going to expect and be more comfortable with this approach .
That ’s something to take into account .
2 . Is the code CPU / memory intensive , does it create lots of objects ?
If so , the pseudo - classical approach is superior .
Robert Wright on culture , politics and world affairs .
Several months ago , a 63 - year - old Harvard professor lost control of his 2005 Toyota Highlander , crashed into another car and died , along with two family members .
Now the government is trying to decide whether Highlanders of this vintage are prone to sudden acceleration and should be added to the lengthy Toyota recall list .
I drive a 2005 Toyota Highlander , and ever since I read about the case of the 63 - year - old Harvard professor , I ’ve felt … well , nothing in particular .
I mean , I ’m sorry about the professor and his family , but I think this whole Toyota thing is overblown .
Let ’s do the math .
My back - of - the - envelope calculations ( explained in a footnote below ) suggest that if you drive one of the Toyotas recalled for acceleration problems and do n’t bother to comply with the recall , your chances of being involved in a fatal accident over the next two years because of the unfixed problem are a bit worse than one in a million — 2.8 in a million , to be more exact .
Meanwhile , your chances of being killed in a car accident during the next two years just by virtue of being an American are one in 5,244 .
So driving one of these suspect Toyotas raises your chances of dying in a car crash over the next two years from .01907 percent ( that ’s 19 one - thousandths of 1 percent , when rounded off ) to .01935 percent ( also 19 one - thousandths of one percent ) .
I can live with those odds .
Sure , I ’d rather they were better , but it ’s not worth losing sleep over .
And I do n’t think it ’s worth all the bandwidth the Toyota story has consumed over the past couple of months .
But lots of Americans seem to disagree with me .
Why ?
I think one reason is that not all deaths are created equal .
A fatal brake failure is scary , but not as scary as your car seizing control of itself and taking you on a harrowing death ride .
It ’s almost as if the car is a living , malicious being .
Maybe we should get used to this kind of scare , because cars are becoming more like living beings .
I suspect that Toyota ’s acceleration problems lie in the software — the “ electronic throttle control , ” which replaces the old - fashioned direct mechanical link between your foot and the throttle with a “ brain ” that “ decides ” how much the throttle should open in response to foot pressure , depending on the circumstances .
A fatal brake failure is scary , but not as scary as your car seizing control of itself and taking you on a harrowing death ride .
I ’m not a fan of electronic throttle control — I did n’t like the feel of it when I bought my Toyota , and I still do n’t — but it ’s getting hard to find a car that does n’t have it .
So too with various other little vehicular brains , like electronic stability control , which will deny you permission to take turns at dangerously high speeds ; our cars are , increasingly , software - driven — that is , they ’re doing more and more of the driving .
And software , as the people at Microsoft or Apple can tell you , is full of surprises .
It ’s pretty much impossible to anticipate all the bugs in a complex computer program .
Hence the reliance on beta testing ( and on the subsequent , de facto beta testing that is also known as “ selling the product and then reading the user forums ” ) .
Now , “ beta testing ” sounds creepy when the process by which testers uncover bugs can involve death .
But there are two reasons not to start bemoaning the brave new world we ’re entering .
First , even back before cars were software - driven , beta testing was common .
Any car is a system too complex for designers to fully anticipate the upshot for life and limb .
Hence decades of non-microchip - related safety recalls .
Second , the fact that a feature of a car can be fatal is n’t necessarily a persuasive objection to it .
One feature that all cars possess and that has been shown to cause death is motion .
But we ’ve decided that the benefits of automated motion are worth the cost of more than 30,000 American lives each year .
Seems like a good trade - off to me .
After all , high - speed motion will also save some lives ( e.g. those of ambulance - driven heart - attack victims ) and improve the quality of life in various ways .
Life is full of trade - offs , and sometimes trade - offs involve death .
Similarly , those software features that are sure to have unanticipated bugs , including fatal ones , have upsides .
Electronic stability control keeps cars from flipping over , and electronic throttle control improves mileage .
Good mileage may seem less worth sacrificing a life for than , say , God or country .
But bad mileage means consuming more gas , creating more pollution and contributing to global warming — and so ultimately translates into lost or degraded lives .
Besides , good mileage means dollars saved , and dollars can be translated into human welfare .
I could take the gas money I save via electronic throttle control and send it to Africa and save several lives .
It worries me that this Toyota thing worries us so much .
Of course , I probably wo n’t .
But if I do n’t — if I pass up the chance to spend some money to save a life — am I any less culpable than Toyota was when it bargained with the government to get the least costly fix available ( new floor mats ) without obsessing over whether floor mats were the root of the problem ?
( Perhaps the most nauseating sight in Washington recently — and that ’s saying something — was the infinitely contrite Toyota head , Akio Toyoda , being browbeaten by legislators who , God knows , discharge their professional responsibilities no more conscientiously than he discharges his . )
Do n’t get me wrong .
It ’s good that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration keeps an eye on carmakers , so that the beta testing does n’t get too gruesome .
But it worries me that this Toyota thing worries us so much .
We live in a world where responding irrationally to risk ( say , the risk of a terrorist attack ) can lead us to make mistakes ( say , invading Iraq ) .
So the Toyota story is a kind of test of our terrorism - fighting capacity — our ability to keep our wits about us when things seem spooky .
Passing the test depends on lots of things .
It depends on politicians resisting the temptation to score cheap points via the exploitation of irrational fear .
It depends on journalists doing the same .
And it depends on Americans in general keeping cool , notwithstanding the likely failure of many politicians and journalists to do their part .
So go out today and buy a Toyota .
It ’s the patriotic thing to do .
Tedious methodological footnote for statistics nerds :
As best I can make out from published reports , the following is the case :
Toyota has recalled about 6 million vehicles in the United States to correct a sudden acceleration problem , and when the last of those recalls was issued , the number of fatal accidents that had been linked to sudden acceleration was 17 .
That would suggest that if you drive one of those 6 million vehicles , and you do n’t get the problem fixed , your likelihood of being involved in a fatal accident due to the defect is 2.8 in a million ( 17 in 6 million ) .
To judge by the model years of the recalled cars , it looks as if the average vehicle ( of those 6 million ) has been on the road for about two years — which means that , to put a finer point on it , 2.8 in a million is your probability of being involved in a fatal accident in the course of a two - year period .
In the most recent two years for which I could find data ( 2007 and 2008 ) , a total of 57,216 drivers or passengers died in car accidents in the United States .
( That ’s the sum of the 2007 and 2008 numbers in the “ subtotal 1 ” row here . )
Those deaths are in an American population of 300 million ; dividing 57,216 by 300 million gives you the one in 5,244 I cite above as the chances of dying in a car accident over a two - year period just by virtue of being an American .
Now , strictly speaking , the numbers in the previous two paragraphs are n’t comparable .
The number in the first paragraph is “ fatal accidents , ” whereas the number in the second paragraph is “ drivers or passengers killed . ”
And there ’s always a chance that you could be involved in a fatal accident without being among the dead .
In that sense , my calculations actually overstate the risk of death posed to you by driving a Toyota with a speed - control problem .
On the other hand , in cases where the Toyota driver is n’t the one killed in a fatal accident , a family member may be the victim — and that can be almost literally a fate worse than death .
So for back - of - the - envelope math , I think my numbers are adequate .
If you really want to get down in the weeds and ask why I did n’t compare apples to apples — either 1 ) compare fatal accidents to fatal accidents or 2 ) compare fatalities to fatalities :
1 ) The routinely collected government numbers for “ fatal auto accidents ” include accidents that killed only pedestrians or motorcyclists , and so far as I can tell the Toyota numbers do n’t include any such accidents ; 2 ) if I used “ fatalities , ” I ’d in principle be including passengers who do n’t own a Toyota but were riding in one at the time of an accident .
And the point of the thought experiment that yields the 2.8 - in - a - million number is to help owners of Toyotas ask how much risk is associated with driving their cars .
A caveat : Since the most recent sudden - acceleration recall in late January , at which point those 17 fatal accidents had been reported , the number of reported accidents has grown .
As this article notes , by mid-February an additional nine fatal crashes were brought to the government ’s attention , including the one involving the 63 - year - old Harvard professor .
But many if not most of these seem to involve vehicles that are n’t among the 6 million that have been recalled — so , in the calculations above , it would n’t make sense to add 9 to the 17 unless you added the additional Toyota models ( e.g. 2005 Highlanders ) to the six million recalled models — which I ca n’t do , since I do n’t have those numbers ( and which might yield little change in the overall risk probabilities anyway ) .
Besides , the posited connection between these fatal accidents and sudden acceleration seems in many cases extremely conjectural .
So far as I can tell from available news accounts , the basis for suspecting unintended acceleration in the Harvard professor ’s crash may be just that the professor “ lost control ” of his car .
Well , loss of control is a pretty common feature of car crashes .
Another case seems to be under study because the sibling of a driver who died after his 2008 Toyota Tacoma pickup truck hit a pole wrote , “ It may relate to the gas pedal , so let Toyota know to recall this model too . ”
Moreover , now that Toyota ’s speed - control problems are world - famous , you ’re naturally going to get a flood of reports conjecturally linking Toyota accidents to those problems , so until those reports are appraised , the data is n’t worth much .
And that , by the way , explains why you should n’t put too much stock in graph like this , which seems to show Toyota way outdistancing other car makers in speed - control complaints .
So far as I can tell , the number of reported accidents in all years of that graph include reports not filed until after Toyota ’s problems became famous , so reports about Toyota accidents are naturally going to way outdistance reports about accidents involving other kinds of cars .
Notwithstanding all this , it ’s certainly possible that there have been fatal accidents that were caused by acceleration problems and are n’t included among the 17 cases known at the time of the most recent recall .
On the other hand , the evidence linking the accidents to acceleration problems is n’t overwhelming in all of those 17 cases .
So it ’s conceivable that the number 17 actually overstates the risk .
In any event , that number seems like the number to go with for the time being , all things considered .

I recently attended the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) in D.C. , with video camera in hand , to report on the attendees .
I was particularly interested in interviewing James O'Keefe , the miscreant ( and accused felon ) responsible for the ACORN video media hoax that The BRAD BLOG has been meticulously detailing for several weeks , including the important focus on how the mainstream corporate media ( the old - media ) has been had by the scam .
O'Keefe 's phony " pimp " story has been debunked , but , as Brad Friedman has shown , the old - media remains remarkably reticent to admit their errors , and the publisher of the videos , O'Keefe 's employer and promoter , Andrew Breitbart has been unwilling to help them off the hook .
Witness the outrageous email responses from the NYTimes ' Senior Editor for Standards Greg Brock and then from their Public Editor Clark Hoyt , when it was shown to them that " the paper of record " had been had -- that O'Keefe had never " visited Acorn offices ... dressed so outlandishly " in the now - infamous " pimp " costume as the paper had reported , as O'Keefe had represented , and as Breitbart himself had claimed in his own column , to the public .
While I did n't get the chance to speak with O'Keefe , I did catch up with his partner in fraud , Hannah Giles .
Alas , she was surrounded by a protective coterie and fled without answering any questions when one of her entourage recognized me .
But then my luck turned .
I trekked to the basement to cover the " XPAC " party and found myself standing shoulder to shoulder with Breitbart , O'Keefe 's promoter , publisher and employer , and owner of the website which launched the infamously damaging , misleading , deceptive and highly doctored video tapes .
I had previously questioned Breitbart at a press conference at the National Press Club press last October .
He 's had a pretty easy ride of it since then , facing questioning only from a largely adulatory press .
Though old - media , as Brad has shown , have been remarkably reluctant to demand answers to hard questions from Breitbart -- or any of the players involved in the ACORN secret video scheme -- I felt it important to do so for a number of reasons .
The results were revealing , both in Breitbart 's insanely manic demeanor , and in the substantive content of his answers to my questions .
Ultimately , as I believe you 'll find in the video , he reveals a lot about his own editorial judgment , professionalism and reliability -- none of it is good …
* * *
The Breitbart / O'Keefe media fraud has been wildly successful for the pair , helping to launch Breitbart 's BigGovernment.com site late last year .
But , unfortunately , it 's hurt a great number of innocents .
Lost in the outrage against the New York Times for having fallen for the scam without bothering to fact - check , as The BRAD BLOG has been detailing for the past several weeks , is the fact that Breitbart and his ward O'Keefe , have accomplished a despicable goal :
They 've all - but destroyed an organization committed to helping those Americans most in need .
Real people -- thousands of children amongst them -- will suffer hardship as a direct consequence of Breitbart 's and O'Keefe 's mendacious and malicious hoax , and singularly partisan political agenda .
When will the media get around to telling that story ?
And what of the damage that disreputable propagandists like Breitbart and O'Keefe bring to the real citizen journalists in the new media -- those of us striving not to sell a political agenda under false pretenses , but rather , hoping to document facts , truth , and on - the - record positions of those who would corrupt our system through disingenuousness , self - enrichment and lies ?...
A Few Thoughts on the Above Video
For most of my childhood , I grew up in foster care .
I was nourished by government - provided school - lunches at government - run public schools .
There , I was taught and cared for by government employees - my teachers .
The physicians that treated my chicken pox were paid by the government .
The people that cared about me -- my teachers , social workers and physicians -- were all government employees .
And some of them were pretty remarkable .
Today , I 've graduated law school and am doing work that I enjoy and ( I hope ) adds to the lives of others .
I 'm not sure I 'd be here if it were n't for the teachers that recognized a young boy 's ferocious appetite for knowledge , notwithstanding the constant upheaval in his personal life .
If it were n't for government employees that cared and had the patience of saints , who knows where this formerly - troubled kid might have ended up ?
The reason I bring this up is that ACORN works in , and with , broken communities filled with kids that are not that much different than I was .
ACORN helps some of the least fortunate people in the country .
The work is difficult , frustrating , emotionally draining , low - paid and often thankless .
But people with big hearts , lots of hope and immeasurable persistence in the face of adversity go to work every day determined to help kids and families in need .
So when James O'Keefe dishonestly attacks the group , and perpetuates quasi- racist smears ... and the media swallows his story uncritically ... and then O'Keefe is treated as a hero by folks that can afford to travel across the country to attend a 3 - day political wank - fest … Well …
That bothers me .
Moreover , the secondary consequences of the Breitbart / O'Keefe scheme are likely to take a toll on another group who deserve far better : those of us that have committed ourselves to excellence in the progressive new media space .
The old - media has demonstrated zero capacity for critical self - examination .
Witness those outrageous emails from the Times editors , as published on The BRAD BLOG , offering absurd excuses for standing by demonstrably inaccurate reporting .
It was n't just the New York Times who was had .
Dozens of others old - media outlets were played as well , and have been similarly reticent at offering corrections and retractions , even now that both Breitbart and O'Keefe 's " prostitute " partner Hannah Giles has admitted that his 70 's - era " pimp " get - up was an add - on after - thought , used only to " pimp " the videos themselves to the public .
Once old - media comes to terms with the fact that they have been suckered by a couple of amateurish buffoons , it seems they are willing to go to any length to pass the blame and avoid taking accountability for their own failures .
I hope the old - media takes some lessons from the above video , and decides to review their own failings to date , and how they might make up for it with real reporting and investigation of such clearly partisan , agenda - driven operatives the future .
In any sane world , the old - media would spend a little time navel - gazing to figure out how they were so easily suckered by James O'Keefe , Andrew Breitbart , Fox News and talk radio .
But , alas , even the New York Times ' " reader 's representative " , Public Editor Clark Hoyt has obstinately refused to recommend corrections to the Times ' repeatedly error - riddled coverage .
Rather than accept responsibility , issue corrections and take steps to avoid such easily - averted errors in the future , Hoyt has instead created a false equivalency , shockingly accusing " every person in this argument " as " pushing a political agenda " -- and the broad - brush new - media , a bastion of progressive strength , is tarred as unreliable , somehow , along with it .
After Brad Friedman meticulously walked Hoyt through the inconsistencies in the O'Keefe / Breitbart story and offered definitive proof that their entire construct was a malicious hoax , Hoyt 's response to Friedman was to say that Friedman , like O'Keefe and Breitbart , had an agenda and was therefore unreliable .
See the trick ?
Friedman spent scores of hours trying to save the New York Times from itself , proving every which way to Sunday that Breitbart and O'Keefe were dishonest hucksters .
For all his efforts , Brad asked only for a correction .
He asked only that the " paper of record " report accurately .
But when Hoyt and the Times finally ran out of excuses and could no longer conjure remotely plausible counterclaims to Friedman 's systematic presentation of hard evidence , the paper declared everyone tainted somehow ( except themselves of course ) and walked away from the table .
Old -media has demonstrated little capacity for distinguishing wheat from chaff in the new - media .
This will likely continue , as they lump the responsible progressive new - media together with a laughably absurd rightwing electronic propaganda machine and declare everyone suspect -- even as it takes the progressive new - media themselves to help the old - media understand how they 've been had by those who deceptively use the guise of " new media " and " citizen journalist " to ply their same old dishonest trade .
Overview
In this tutorial , learn to find and load the shared libraries that your Linux programs need .
Learn to :
Determine which libraries a program needs
Know how the system finds shared libraries
Load shared libraries
Shared libraries
When you write a program , you rely on many pieces of code that someone else has already written to perform routine or specialized functions for you .
These pieces of code are stored in shared libraries .
To use them , you link them with your code , either when you build the program or when you run the program .
About this series
This series of tutorials helps you learn Linux system administration tasks .
You can also use the material in these tutorials to prepare for the Linux Professional Institute ’s LPIC - 1 : Linux Server Professional Certification exams .
See “ Learn Linux , 101 : A roadmap for LPIC - 1 ” for a description of and link to each tutorial in this series .
The roadmap is in progress .
This tutorial reflects the Version 5.0 objectives as updated on October 29 , 2018 .
As tutorials are completed , they will be added to the roadmap .
This tutorial helps you prepare for Objective 102.3 in Topic 102 of the Linux Server Professional ( LPIC - 1 ) exam 101 .
The objective has a weight of 1 .
Prerequisites
To get the most from the tutorials in this series , you should have a basic knowledge of Linux and a working Linux system on which you can practice the commands covered in this tutorial .
Sometimes different versions of a program format output differently , so your results might not always look exactly like the listings and figures shown here .
In particular , many of the examples in this tutorial come from 64 - bit systems .
I have included some examples from 32 - bit systems to illustrate significant differences .
Static and dynamic linking
Linux systems have two types of executable programs :
Statically linked executables : Contain all the library functions that they need to execute ; all library functions are linked into the executable .
They are complete programs that do not depend on external libraries to run .
One advantage of statically linked programs is that they work without your needing to install prerequisites .
: Contain all the library functions that they need to execute ; all library functions are linked into the executable .
They are complete programs that do not depend on external libraries to run .
One advantage of statically linked programs is that they work without your needing to install prerequisites .
Dynamically linked executables : Much smaller programs ; they are incomplete in the sense that they require functions from external shared libraries to run .
Besides being smaller , dynamic linking permits a package to specify prerequisite libraries without needing to include the libraries in the package .
By using dynamic linking , many running programs can share one copy of a library rather than occupying memory with many copies of the same code .
For these reasons , most programs today use dynamic linking .
An interesting example on many Linux systems is the ln command ( / bin/ln ) , which creates links between files , either hard links or soft ( or symbolic ) links .
This command uses shared libraries .
Shared libraries often involve symbolic links between a generic name for the library and a specific level of the library , so if the links are not present or broken for some reason , then the ln command itself might be inoperative , creating a circular problem .
To protect against this possibility , some Linux systems include a statically linked version of the ln program as the sln program ( / sbin/sln ) .
Listing 1 illustrates the great difference in size between the dynamically linked ln and the statically linked sln .
The example is from a Fedora 22 64 - bit system .

Which libraries are needed
Though not part of the current LPI exam requirements for this topic , you should know that many Linux systems today run on hardware that supports both 32 - bit and 64 - bit executables .
Many libraries are thus compiled in 32 - bit and 64 - bit versions .
The 64 - bit versions are usually stored under the / lib64 tree in the filesystem , while the 32 - bit versions live in the traditional / lib tree .
You will probably find both / lib / libc - 2.11.1.so and /lib64/libc-2.11.1.so on a typical 64 - bit Linux system .
These two libraries allow both 32 - bit and 64 - bit C programs to run on a 64 - bit Linux system .
The ldd command
Apart from knowing that a statically linked program is likely to be large , how can you tell whether a program is statically linked ?
And if it is dynamically linked , how do you know what libraries it needs ?
The ldd command can answer both questions .
If you are running a system such as Debian or Ubuntu , you probably do n’t have the sln executable , so you might also want to check the / sbin / ldconfig executable .
Listing 2 shows the output of the ldd command for the ln and sln executables and also the ldconfig executable .
The example is from a Fedora 22 64 - bit system ( atticf20 ) .
For comparison , the output from Ubuntu 14 32 - bit system ( attic - u14 ) is shown for / bin/ln .
Listing 2 . Output of ldd for sln and ln [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ # Fedora 22 64‑bit [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ ldd / sbin/sln /sbin/ldconfig /bin/ln /sbin/sln : not a dynamic executable / sbin/ ldconfig : not a dynamic executable / bin/ln : linux‑vdso.so.1 ( 0x00007ffedd31e000 ) libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 ( 0x00007f2d3bd5d000 ) /lib64/ld‑linux‑x86‑64.so.2 ( 0x00007f2d3c11d000 ) ian@attic‑u14:~/data/lpic‑1 $ # Ubuntu 14 32‑bit ian@attic‑u14:~/data/lpic‑1 $ ldd /bin/ln linux‑gate.so.1 => ( 0xb779d000 ) libc.so.6 => /lib/i386‑linux‑gnu/libc.so.6 ( 0xb75d7000 ) /lib/ld‑linux.so.2 ( 0xb77a0000 )

Because ldd is actually concerned with dynamic linking , it tells us that both sln and ldconfig are statically linked by telling us that they are “ not a dynamic executable , ” while it tells us the names of three shared libraries ( linux-vdso.so.1 , libc.so.6 , and / lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 ) that the ln command needs .
Note that . so indicates that these are shared objects or dynamic libraries .
This output also illustrates three different types of information you are likely to see .
linux-vdso.so.1
is the Linux Virtual Dynamic Shared Object , which I discuss in a moment .
You can also see linux - gate .
so.1 as in the Ubuntu 14 example .
libc.so.6
has a pointer to / lib64 / libc.so.6 or /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 .
You can also see this pointing to / lib / libc.so.6 on older 32 - bit systems .
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
is the absolute path to another library .
In Listing 3 , I use the ls -l command to show that the last two libraries are , in turn , symbolic links to specific versions of the libraries .
The example is from a Fedora 22 64 - bit system .
This allows library updates to be installed without the need to relink all the executables that use the library .
Listing 3 . Library symbolic links [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ # Fedora 22 64‑bit [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ ls ‑l /lib64/libc.so.6 /lib64/ld‑linux‑x86‑64.so.2 lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 10 Feb 23 10:33 /lib64/ld‑linux‑x86‑64.so.2 ‑> ld‑2.21.so lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 12 Feb 23 10:33 /lib64/libc.so.6 ‑> libc‑2.21.so

Linux Virtual Dynamic Shared Objects
In the early days of x86 processors , communication from user programs to supervisor services occurred through a software interrupt .
As processor speeds increased , this became a serious bottleneck .
Starting with Pentium ® II processors , Intel® introduced a Fast System Call facility to speed up system calls using the SYSENTER and SYSEXIT instructions instead of interrupts .
The library that you see as linux - vdso . so. 1 is a virtual library , or Virtual Dynamic Shared Object , that is located only in each program ’s address space .
Some systems call this linux - gate .so.1 .
This virtual library provides the necessary logic to allow user programs to access system functions through the fastest means available on the particular processor , either interrupt , or with most newer processors , fast system call .
Dynamic loading
From the preceding , you might be surprised to learn that / lib/ld- linux.so.2 and its 64 - bit cousin , / lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 , which both look like shared libraries , are actually executables in their own right .
They are the code that is responsible for dynamic loading .
They read the header information from the executable , which is in the Executable and Linking Format ( ELF ) format .
From this information , they determine what libraries are required and which ones need to be loaded .
They then perform dynamic linking to fix up all the address pointers in your executable and the loaded libraries so that the program will run .
The man page for ld- linux .
so also describes ld.so , which performed similar functions for the earlier a.out binary format .
Listing 4 illustrates using the -- list option of the ld-linux .
so cousins to show the same information for the ln command that Listing 2 showed with the ldd command .
Listing 4 .

Note that the hex addresses might be different between the two listings .
They are also likely to be different if you run ldd twice .
Dynamic library configuration
So how does the dynamic loader know where to look for executables ?
As with many things on Linux , there is a configuration file in /etc .
In fact , there are two configuration files : /etc/ld.so.conf and /etc/ld.so.cache .
Listing 5 shows the contents of /etc/ld.so.conf on a 64 - bit Fedora 22 system .
Note that /etc/ld.so.conf specifies that all the .conf files from the subdirectory ld.so.conf.d should be included .
Older systems might have all entries in /etc/ld.so.conf and not include entries from the /etc/ld.so.conf.d directory .
The actual contents of /etc/ld.so.conf or the /etc/ld.so.conf.d directory might be different on your system .
Listing 5 . Content of /etc/ld.so.conf [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ # Fedora 22 64‑bit [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ cat /etc/ld.so.conf include ld.so.conf.d/.conf [ ian@atticf20 ~ ] $ ls /etc/ld.so.conf.d/.conf

Program loading needs to be fast , so use the ldconfig command to process the ld.so.conf file and all the included files from ld.so.conf.d and libraries from the trusted directories , / lib and /usr / lib , and any others supplied on the command line .
The ldconfig command creates the necessary links and cache to recently used shared libraries in /etc/ld.so.cache .
The dynamic loader uses the cached information from ld.so. cache to locate files that are to be dynamically loaded and linked .
If you change ld.so.conf ( or add new included files to ld.so.conf.d ) , you must run the ldconfig command ( as root ) to rebuild your ld.so. cache file .
Normally , you use the ldconfig command without parameters to rebuild ld.so.cache .
There are several other parameters you can specify to override this default behavior .
As usual , try man ldconfig for more information .
Listing 6 illustrates the use of the -p parameter to display the contents of ld.so.cache .

Loading specific libraries
If you ’re running an older application that needs a specific older version of a shared library , or if you ’re developing a new shared library or version of a shared library , you might want to override the default search paths used by the loader .
This might also be needed by scripts that use product - specific shared libraries that might be installed in the / opt tree .
Just as you can set the PATH variable to specify a search path for executables , you can set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to a colon - separated list of directories that should be searched for shared libraries before the system ones specified in ld.so.cache .
For example , you might use a command like :
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/oldstuff:/opt/IBM/AgentController/lib

Supreme Court rejects Williams ' plea Schwarzenegger denies clemency for former gang leader RELATED QUICKVOTE Was California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger right not to grant clemency to killer Stanley Tookie Williams ?
Yes No or View Results YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Stanley Tookie Williams Crime , Law and Justice or or Create Your Own SACRAMENTO , California ( CNN ) -- The U.S. Supreme Court refused to stay the execution Monday of convicted killer Stanley Tookie Williams , clearing the way for him to die by injection shortly after midnight .
The high court was the former gang leader 's last chance to avoid death by injection after California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger denied him clemency earlier Monday and a federal appeals court panel rejected a request to stay his execution .
Williams , who co-founded the Crips street gang in Los Angeles , is scheduled to die at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday ( 3:01 a.m. ET ) at San Quentin State Prison , near San Francisco .
Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson , who met with Williams earlier in the day , criticized Schwarzenegger for deciding not to spare Williams .
Jackson said Williams , who was convicted of killing four people in two 1979 robberies in Los Angeles , had earned clemency and that Schwarzenegger 's decision was about " making politicians look tough , but that does not make it right . "
Lora Owens , the stepmother of one of the men Williams was convicted of killing , said she felt " justice is going to be done tonight . "
" I had faith that when Governor Arnold looked at the facts of the case that he was going to decide not to do clemency , " said Owens , whose 26 - year - old stepson , Albert Owens , was shot to death in a February 1979 convenience store holdup in Los Angeles .
" I do n't like it being said it 's a political decision .
It was an evidence decision . "
A jury convicted Williams of killing Owens by shooting him twice in the back with a 12 - gauge shotgun while the victim was face down on the floor .
The jury also convicted him of shooting and killing an immigrant couple and their 41 - year - old daughter less than two weeks later while stealing less than $ 100 cash from their motel .
Both cases were handled in a single trial .
Williams was sentenced to death in 1981 .
Schwarzenegger announced his decision not to commute Williams ' sentence to life in prison without parole shortly after a three - judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , based in San Francisco , rejected an affidavit from the convict 's lawyers that suggested someone framed him .
California 's Supreme Court rejected an emergency request to stay the execution on Sunday .
In their appeal to the 9th Circuit , his attorneys pinned their hopes on the declaration of a new witness -- Gordon Bradbury von Ellerman -- a jail trusty detained with Williams in the Los Angeles County Jail from 1979 to 1980 .
In the affidavit , von Ellerman said he was the cellmate of another trusty , identified as George " Roger " Oglesby .
Von Ellerman said Los Angeles Sheriff 's Department personnel provided Oglesby with documents to aid him in testifying against Williams in return for reduced or dropped charges .
" I was personally aware that Los Angeles Sheriff 's Department personnel would often provide information to these inmates so that they could help frame defendants for crimes , " he said in the statement .
A statement from Schwarzenegger read : " The possible irregularities in Williams ' trial have been thoroughly and carefully reviewed by the courts , and there is no reason to disturb the judicial decisions that uphold the jury 's decisions that he is guilty of these four murders and should pay with his life . "
Williams , who would be 52 on December 29 , spent part of Monday with his attorneys and family members at San Quentin .
As Williams was being moved to a holding cell next to the death chamber Monday evening , his lead attorney , John Harris , said the convict was " at peace . "
But his lawyers have renewed their request for clemency to Schwarzenegger , citing the statements of three new witnesses Harris said could provide exculpatory evidence .
" He 's at peace , but we 're fighting , and he knows it , " Harris said .
A crowd of protesters had begun to gather outside the gates of San Quentin early Monday evening .
One demonstrator carried a sign that read , " Do n't kill in my name . "
While in prison , Williams became an anti-gang crusader , but he has consistently refused to take part in a debriefing with authorities to provide them potentially valuable information about the Crips gangs , said lead prosecutor John Monaghan .
While maintaining his innocence in the four murders , Williams has denounced gang violence and written children 's books with an anti-gang message , donating the proceeds to anti-gang community groups .
He said he was trying to prevent young people from making the choices he did .
Celebrities , teachers and anti-death penalty advocates have spoken on Williams ' behalf , but Schwarzenegger questioned the sincerity of Williams ' conversion to nonviolence .
" Stanley Williams insists he is innocent , and that he will not and should not apologize or otherwise atone for the murders of the four victims in this case , " the governor wrote .
" Without an apology and atonement for these senseless and brutal killings , there can be no redemption . "
