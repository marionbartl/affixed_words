The recession has finally answered the question that centuries of philosophers could not :
The glass is half - empty .
That ’s because sales of bottled water have fallen for the first time in at least five years , assailed by wrathful environmentalists and budget - conscious consumers who have discovered that tap water is practically free .
Even Nestle , the country ’s largest seller of bottled water , is beginning to feel a bit parched .
On Wednesday , it reported that profits for the first half of the year dropped 2.7 % , the first decline in six years .
The biggest loser ?
Water .
“ It ’s an obvious way to cut back , ” said Joan Holleran , director of research for market research firm Mintel .
“ People might still be buying bottled water , but you can bet that they ’re refilling those bottles . ”

The news delighted environmentalists , who have long berated the industry for wasting natural resources and stuffing landfills with plastic bottles .
“ I thought we ’d never be able to impact sales of bottled water , and all of a sudden it ’s really gained momentum , ” said Wenonah Hauter , executive director of advocacy group Food & Water Watch .
“ I think we ’re making real progress . ”
Not so long ago , bottled water was bubbling .
It climbed up the ranks of America ’s favorite beverages in recent years , beating out juice to become the third most popular in 2008 , according to Mintel .
( Soda is the drink of choice by far , followed by milk . )
Sales of bottled water swelled 59 % to $ 5.1 billion from 2003 to 2008 , making it one of the fastest - growing beverages .
About 70 % of consumers say they drink bottled water .
But the economic downturn is stemming the tide .
Nestle sells a variety of brands , such as Poland Spring , Deer Park , S. Pellegrino and Perrier .
It was the only sector in Nestle ’s food and beverage group to post a decline in global sales during the first half of the year , down 2.9 % because of weakness in the United States and Western Europe .
Coca -Cola has also blamed softening demand for weaker U.S. sales of its bottled waters .
According to consulting firm Beverage Marketing Corp. , Americans drank 8.7 billion gallons of bottled water last year , compared with 8.8 billion in 2007 -- the first decline this decade .
Per capita consumption dropped from 29 gallons to 28.5 .
Jeff Cioletti , editor in chief of trade publication Beverage World , said he does n’t believe bottled water will return to galloping growth for a long while .

“ There were sort of a lot of head winds , ” he said .
Those forces include not only the economic downturn but also the massive campaign by environmentalists to get consumers to turn on the tap .
According to Food & Water Watch , more than 17 million barrels of oil -- enough to fuel 1 million cars for a year -- are needed to produce the plastic water bottles sold in the United States annually .
And about 86 % of the empty bottles get thrown into the trash rather than recycled .
Beverage companies have responded through recycling initiatives and by buying carbon off - sets .
Hauter said that she has worked on water issues for about a decade but that the movement took off about three years ago .
The group fans out to festivals and other public events , pouring water for attendees into corn-based , biodegradable cups or metal containers bearing the name of its campaign , “ Take Back the Tap . ”

The metal containers are also available online for about $ 20 each .
Sales , she reports , have been strong .

Palestinian medical sources reported that two fighters were wounded when the Israeli Air Force fired , on Monday at dawn , a number of missiles into an area , east of Khan Younis , in the southern part of the Gaza Strip .
Adham Abu Salmiyya , spokesperson of the Higher Committee of Medical Services in Gaza , reported that the army bombarded Khuza ’a town , east of Khan Younis , targeting fighters of the Al Qassam Brigades , the armed wing of Hamas , inflicting two injuries ; one seriously .
Local sources reported that the bombarded area is a training zone for the Al Qassam Brigades ; damage to nearby buildings was reported .
Furthermore , local sources reported that Israeli jets dropped leaflets warning the residents to stay at least 300 meters away from the border fence between Gaza and Israel .
The leaflets included details maps setting the “ no - man zone ” , and warning that any person who approaches the area will be subject to army fire .
Similar to repeated previous incidents , the army provided a cell phone number and an email asking the residents to collaborate with Israel , and to provide information about resistance fighters and about the siege - busting tunnels across the border area between Gaza and Egypt .
On Sunday , the army bombarded the Gaza Strip inflicting seven injuries among the civilian population , including four children .
The Israeli army killed three Palestinians and injured more than twenty others in a number of attacks and air strikes targeting the Gaza Strip since the beginning of this month .
Is this the face of Osama bin Laden ?
New Al - Qaeda video may show first footage of terror chief since 2007
The video is deliberately blurred , the view is only partial , and it lasts for just a few short seconds .
But that is enough for the tantalising question to be raised :
Is this the first video footage of Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to emerge in more than two years ?
The video , posted on the internet by Al Qaeda 's media branch As Sahab , was a taped message by another Al Qaeda high - up , Abu Yah - ya al - Libi .
Is this the same man ?
A still image from the video released on Tuesday , left , appears to resemble Osama bin Laden , pictured in a file photo from 2007 , right - but digital blurring makes it impossible to confirm
Another still from Tuesday 's video , left , shows bin Laden staring straight at the camera .
The image resembles another image of bin Laden taken exactly five years ago today , right - but is it him ?
He was preaching a sermon on Tuesday when the video was recorded .
It is not clear where the sermon was taking place .
Most of the video is of good quality - but , near the end , the view suddenly blurs as the camera zeroes in on one man in the crowd getting to his feet .

The apparently - deliberate obstruction of the bearded man 's face , combined with the setting , was enough for some of the Italian media to venture their theory that he was in fact Osama bin Laden .
Washington - based think intelligence study group IntelCenter , which released stills from Tuesday 's video , said no new footage of bin Laden has been seen since 2007 .
The organisation also said its own analysis of the video could not determine if the man was bin Laden or not .
Many MailOnline readers have argued that the man in the video is not bin Laden as his beard is a different colour .
However viewers elsewhere have pointed out that bin Laden has dyed his beard before , and could have done so again .
The dying of beards is a popular practice among Arab leaders , said Rita Katz , director of the SITE Institute , a Washington - based group that monitors terror messages .
Dye job : Left , Osama bin Laden in the October 29 , 2004 image ; and right , bin Laden in an image posted on an Al Qaeda website in 2007 .
His beard appears to have been dyed in the later image , said Rita Katz , director of the SITE Institute

This clearer image from earlier in the video shows Abu Yahya Al Libi , standing centre , preaching his Eid al - Fitr sermon to the crowd .
It is not clear which man is the one who may or may not be Osama bin Laden
Editor ’s Note :
We ’re re-posting this column by Scott Ritter as President Obama announces that he is sending 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan .
There is a curious phenomenon taking place in the American media at the moment : the lionization of Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the American military commander in Afghanistan .
Although he has taken a few lumps for playing politics with the White House , McChrystal has generally been sold to the American public as a “ Zen warrior , ” a counterinsurgency genius who , if simply left to his own devices , will be able to radically transform the ongoing debacle that is Afghanistan into a noble victory that will rank as one of the greatest political and military triumphs of modern history .
McChrystal ’s resume and persona ( a former commander of America ’s special operations forces , a tireless athlete and a scholar ) have been breathlessly celebrated in several interviews and articles .
Reporters depict him as an ascetic soldier who spouts words of wisdom to rival Confucius , Jesus and Muhammad .
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent Gen. McChrystal to “ fix ” the war in Afghanistan in the way that his boss , that earlier military prophet Gen. David Petraeus , “ fixed ” Iraq .
Whether by accident or design , McChrystal ’s mission became a cause célèbre of sorts for an American media starved for good news , even if entirely fabricated , coming out of Afghanistan .
One must remember that the general has accomplished little of note during his short tenure to date as the military commander in Afghanistan .
His entire reputation is built around the potential to turn things around in Afghanistan .
And to do this , McChrystal has said he needs time , and 40,000 - plus additional American troops .
There are currently around 68,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan .
McChrystal ’s request would raise that number to around 110,000 troops – the same number as the Soviets had deployed in Afghanistan at the height of their failed military adventure some 20 years ago .
McChrystal , or more accurately , his staff , has authored a not - so - secret report that outlines the reasoning behind this massive increase in American military involvement in Afghanistan .
Rightly noting that the American - led effort is currently failing , McChrystal argues that only a massive infusion of U.S. troops , and a corresponding “ surge ” of American civilians , can achieve the stability necessary to transform Afghanistan from the failed state it is today .
A viable nation capable of self - government , the new Afghanistan could maintain internal security so that terrorist organizations like al - Qaida will not be able to take root , flourish and once again threaten American security from the sanctuary of a lawless land .
This concept certainly looks good on paper and plays well in the editorial section .
And why should n’t it ?
It touches on all the romantic notions of America as liberator and defender of the oppressed .
The problem is that the assumptions made in the McChrystal report are so far removed from reality as to be ludicrous .
McChrystal operates under the illusion that American military power can provide a shield from behind which Afghanistan can remake itself into a viable modern society .
He has deluded himself and others into believing that the people of Afghanistan want to be part of such a grand social experiment , and furthermore that they will tolerate the United States being in charge .
The reality of Afghan history , culture and society argue otherwise .
The Taliban , once a defeated entity in the months following the initial American military incursion into Afghanistan , are resurgent and growing stronger every day .
The principle source of the Taliban ’s popularity is the resentment of the Afghan people toward the American occupation and the corrupt proxy government of Hamid Karzai .
There is nothing an additional 40,000 American troops will be able to do to change that basic equation .
The Soviets tried and failed .
They deployed 110,000 troops , operating on less restrictive lines of communication and logistical supply than the United States .
They built an Afghan army of some 45,000 troops .
They operated without the constraints of American rules of engagement .
They slaughtered around a million Afghans .
And they lost , for the simple reason that the people of Afghanistan did not want them , or their Afghan proxies .
Some pundits and observers make note of the fact that the Afghan people were able to prevail over the Soviets only because of billions of dollars of U.S. aid , which together with similar funding from Saudi Arabia and the logistical support of Pakistan , allowed the Afghan resistance to coalesce , grow and ultimately defeat the Soviets and their Afghan allies .
They note that there is no equivalent source of empowerment for the Taliban in Afghanistan today .
But they are wrong .
The Taliban receive millions of dollars from sympathetic sources in the Middle East , in particular from Saudi Arabia , and they operate not only from within Afghanistan , but also out of safe havens inside Pakistan .
Indeed , one of the unique aspects of the Afghan conflict is the degree to which it has expanded into Pakistan , making any military solution in one theater contingent on military victory in the other .
But the reality is that the more one employs military force in either Afghanistan or Pakistan , the more one strengthens the cause and resources of the Islamic insurgents in both places .
Pashtunistan , once a fanciful notion built around the concept of a united Pashtun people ( the population in eastern Afghanistan and western Pakistan are primarily drawn from Pashtun tribes ) , has become a de facto reality .
The decision by the British in 1897 to separate the Pashtun through the artificial device of the so - called Durand Line ( which today constitutes the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan ) has been exposed today as a futile effort to undermine tribal links .
No amount of military force can reverse this .
Thus the solution itself becomes the problem , thereby creating a never - ending circular conflict which has the United States expending more and more resources to resolve a situation that has nothing to do with the reality on the ground in Afghanistan , and everything to do with crafting a politically viable salve for what is in essence a massive self - inflicted wound .
It is the proverbial dog chasing after its own tail , a frustrating experience made even more so by the fact that any massive commitment of troops brings with it the fatal attachment of national pride , individual hubris and , worst of all , the scourge of domestic American politics , so that by the time this dog bites its tail , it will be so blinded by artificialities that rather than recognize its mistake , it will instead proceed to consume itself .
In the case of Afghanistan , our consumption will be measured in the lives of American servicemen and women , national treasure , national honor , and , of course the lives of countless Afghan dead and wounded .
The manner in which McChrystal has peddled his plan for Afghanistan to the American media , and to Congress , may be politically savvy .
It is certainly insubordinate .
The decision to employ American military power is the sole prerogative of the American president .
A general may offer advice , but any effort to engage the machinery of politics to pressure a sitting president defies the basic constitutional tenet of civilian control over the military .
President Obama , once a constitutional law professor , should know as much , and would do well to severely reprimand McChrystal for his actions .
Or better yet , Obama should fire McChrystal and replace him with someone who respects the rule of law and the chain of command .
Obama may have won the Nobel Peace Prize , but if he allows himself to be bullied into supporting McChrystal ’s foray into Afghanistan , he will reveal himself as the worst kind of warmonger .
True , he did n’t invent the Afghan quagmire .
That honor resides with George W. Bush , who also is to blame for the American fiasco in Iraq .
But history will be surprisingly gentle toward America ’s 43rd president .
Bush will share the blame for his calamitous military decisions with the mistaken policies of previous administrations , a compliant Congress , headstrong advisers , servile intelligence agencies and , of course , the shock of the events of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Bush will be seen more as a useful idiot than a ruthless ideologue .
Obama , with his obvious intelligence , soaring rhetorical skills and Nobel credentials , does not readily fit such a characterization .
If he decides to reinforce failure in Afghanistan by dispatching tens of thousands more American troops to that disaster , America ’s 44th president will cement himself as a grand fraud , a hawk hiding in dove feathers .
Given his potential for doing good , one clearly would not want such a scenario to play out .
The president ’s lack of military experience screams out when he calls America ’s involvement in Afghanistan a “ good war . ”
He would have been better off trying to make the case for a justifiable war , or even a necessary war , but to label a process that brings about the death and injury of thousands as “ good ” makes me wonder about Obama ’s fitness to be commander in chief .
His seeming inexperience on national security affairs and foreign policy leave him vulnerable to domestic political pressures that emanate from these arenas .
The president does possess the vision to see a world in which America stands side by side with other nations as an equal , operating with a shared notion of due process and respect for the rule of law , but that does n’t square with any decision to deploy more troops to Afghanistan .
Expanding the war in Afghanistan will lend credence to the central worry about Obama : that , at the end of the day , this man of vision might in fact be little more than an Illinois politician who is willing to barter away American life , treasure and good will for political gain on the domestic front .
And , in doing so , it will undermine his noble vision of an America “ resetting ” its relationship with the world following eight years of unilateralist militarism .
A true leader , one with substance and gravitas , would be able to stand up to the combined pressure of the military , the right - wing of Congress and the American media .
He would draw the correct conclusions from the lessons of history , which prove again and again that Afghanistan is not a problem that can be solved by foreign military intervention .
The fact that Obama might be compelled to alleviate the political pressure he is receiving from these sources by condemning America to another decade of death and destruction in Afghanistan and , most probably , Pakistan , reinforces any perception of his weakness as a national leader .
Afghanistan has , over the centuries , earned its reputation as the graveyard of empires .
Just ask the Greeks , Mongols , British and Russians .
If Barack Obama ultimately agrees to dispatch more American troops to Afghanistan , he will ensure not only that America will add its name to the list of those who have failed in their effort to conquer the unconquerable , but also that his name will join the ranks of those leaders throughout history who succumbed to the temptations of hubris when given the choice between war and peace .
The Nobel committee will have failed in its gambit to motivate America ’s 44th president to embrace the mantle of peacemaker , and the American people will be left to sort through the detritus of war brought on by yet another failed president .
Of course , the future is not yet set in stone .
The decision to dispatch more troops , although the subject of much rumor and speculation , has been delayed pending the final dispensation of Afghanistan ’s controversial presidential election .
One can only hope that President Obama will take advantage of this timely “ pause ” to reconsider his options regarding Afghanistan beyond the single - minded rush to reinforce a current policy the U.S. military has acknowledged as having gone nowhere in the eight years of American military engagement .
Vice President Joe Biden had earlier proposed a policy course that would have de-emphasized military engagement with the Taliban , focusing instead on rooting out the forces of al - Qaida still operating in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
President Obama was reportedly not sold on Biden ’s thinking when it was first presented last March .
Perhaps now , upon reflection , the president will do the right thing and reduce America ’s military involvement in both Afghanistan and Pakistan , either along the lines proposed by Vice President Biden , or through some other mechanism .
There is no military solution to the problems facing the United States today in Afghanistan , and thus the correct course of action is to de-militarize the situation by reducing , not expanding , America ’s military presence .
Clearly Gen. Stanley McChrystal is not the man for this task .
He should be replaced by someone within the ranks of the U.S. military who shares Obama ’s vision of peace , and with it the need to redefine the mission in South Asia .
The legitimate requirements of American national security will not be satisfied by any massive military commitment to the region .
Hopefully , President Obama will recognize this fact and get out .
That would be a sign of greatness , and present to the American people and the rest of the world a leader worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize .

The storm over the new version of the diagnostic manual for psychiatrists shows no signs of dying down as a committee member has publicly resigned over concerns that new diagnoses are being created without proper regard to the scientific evidence .
The 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental disorders , known as the DSM-V , is due out in 2012 .
It is hotly anticipated because it defines mental illness for the USA and much of the world .
The Carlat Psychiatry Blog reports that Dr. Jane Costello , a member of the Work Group on Disorders in Childhood and Adolescence , recently resigned in protest at what she suggests are unrealistic aims and a disregard of the research evidence .
A copy of her resignation letter has already found its way online .
Carlat also reports that Allen Frances and Robert Spitzer , both chiefs of the committee for past versions of the manual , have amplified their recent criticisms in a leaked letter by writing to the American Psychiatric Association Board of Trustee to denounce the DSM - V leadership as having “ lost contact with the field ” and urging that “ It is your responsibility to save DSM - V from itself before it is too late ” .
As Frances ’ last public criticism was greeted by a strongly worded and surprisingly personal response , this may be the beginning of a drawn out public battle .

Following the uproar over Democrat Jack Conway ’s ad criticizing his opponent ’s college antics and questioning his religious faith , Republican Rand Paul has taken a 12 - point lead in Kentucky ’s bitter U.S. Senate race .
The latest Rasmussen Reports telephone survey of Likely Voters in the state , taken Wednesday night , shows Paul with 53 % support to Conway ’s 41 % .
Two percent ( 2 % ) prefer some other candidate in the race , and four percent ( 4 % ) are undecided .
( To see survey question wording , click here . )
After narrowing somewhat last week , the race moves back to where it ’s been for most of the year .
As a result , it ’s moving back from Leans Republican to Solid Republican in the Rasmussen Reports Election 2010 Senate Balance of Power rankings .
In 12 surveys prior to last week , Paul had led by seven to 15 points each time , earning 46 % to 59 % of the vote .
Conway , Kentucky ’s current attorney general , picked up 34 % to 42 % support in those same surveys .
The candidates held their final debate on Monday night , and Democrats are now trying to capitalize on a violent incident outside the debate involving a Paul supporter and an liberal activist .
Former President Clinton is scheduled to come to the state on Monday to campaign for Conway .

I 'm answering this , and I 'm making it a community wiki , since I am copying and pasting from an existing document .
For the record , I use Amanda Enterprise as my backup solution , and I do n't use the tape encryption that it provides , for the very reasons that you mention .
I was researching tape encryption , and I came across a great whitepaper from HP talking about LTO - 4 encryption , and included are many possibilities for key management .
Here 's a basic rundown of the available options that are presented :
• Native mode encryption ( sometimes referred to as set and forget ) .
This method controls the LTO4 encryption from within the tape drive library .
There is one key that is set by way of the library management interface ( Web GUO or Operator Control Panel ) .
This method encrypts all tapes with the same key , with the downside of negatively impacting the security level .
• Software - based encryption encrypts the data before it leaves the server and keys are stored in the internal database or catalog of the application .
This method of encryption places a high load on the server as the software performs many mathematical operations using host processing power .
Several applications including HP Open View Storage Data Protector 6.0 offer encryption as a feature .
Although the security of date encrypted this way is very high ( as the data is encrypted in transit ) , because encrypted data is highly random it then becomes impossible to achieve any data compression downstream in the tape drive and therefore storage is inefficient .
• Keys managed by the ISV application , also known as in - band key management .
The ISV software supplies the keys and manages them , and the Ultrium LTO4 Tape Drive then performs the encryption .
Keys would be referenced by the key - associated data and stored in the applications internal database .
( Please refer to your individual ISV backup application vendor for support of this functionality ) .
• An in - band encryption appliance intercepts the Fibre Channel links and encrypts the data in - flight .
These products are available from several vendors such as Neoscale and Decru .
Key management is from a hardened key management appliance .
This method is independent of ISV software and supports legacy tape drives and libraries .
Data compression must be performed by these devices as compression within the tape drive is not possible after encryption .
• A SAN fabric switch with encryption capability is similar to the in - band appliance , but encryption hardware is embedded in the switch .
• A Key Management Appliance works with enterprise class libraries such as the HP StorageWorks EML and ESL E - series libraries .
It is known as out - of - band key management , as the key is supplied to the tape drive by the key management appliance .
Figure 8 shows the basic components of a key management appliance .
The backup applications have no knowledge of the encryption capability of the tape drive .
The keys are supplied to the tape library controller by way of a network connection using a Secure Sockets Layer ( SSL ) , recently renamed Transport Layer Security ( TLS ) .
This is an encrypted connection necessary to protect the security of the keys in transit from the appliance .
To set up the security , a digital certificate is installed into the library management hardware .
This establishes the necessary secure connection .
The setup of the SSL / TLS uses public key encryption , but then after the handshake is complete , a secret key passes to encrypt the link .
When tapes are restored , the key associated data , ( retrieved from the tape ) , is used to reference the request for the correct key to decrypt the tape independent of the backup application .

Notes :
Generally , regional results will be not included in this table if the margin of error is +/- 8 % or greater .
* = approx .
margin of error calculated from ( 0.5 / ( SQRTn * 1.96 ) ) * 100 , where n is the sample size .
When trying to do quick mental math to figure out a margin of error for a poll you hear about in the media , try 1 / SQRTn * 100 .

Japan 's All Nippon Airways ( ANA ) is asking its passengers to go to the toilet before boarding so it can reduce aircraft weight .
The unusual request is part of an experiment by the airline to cut carbon dioxide emissions .
Japan 's NHK television is reporting that ANA began the one - month experiment today on 42 international and domestic flights .
The airline will place staff near boarding gates to ask passengers waiting for flights to go and use the restroom .
ANA hopes it will reduce the weight of the aircraft and cut nearly five tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions from flights .
The airline says it may expand the trial if it is well received by passengers .

Researchers had a person walk around a square of 28 radio transceivers mounted on plastic pipes .
The person creates shadows in the radio waves , resulting in the blob - like image ( right ) .
A new contraption that essentially sees through walls using radio receivers to track moving objects could one day help police and others nab intruders and rescue hostages or fire victims .
Joey Wilson and Neal Patwari of the University of Utah used so - called radio tomographic imaging ( RTI ) , which can detect and track moving people or other objects in an area surrounded by inexpensive radio transceivers that send and receive signals , they announced today .
To test out the technique , the researchers placed a wireless network of 28 radio transceivers around a square - shaped portion of an atrium and a similar part of the lawn .
The transceivers were placed on 4 - foot - tall ( 1.2 m ) stands made of plastic pipe so they would make measurements at a person 's torso level .
As a person walked around each area , measurements showed the radio signal strengths between all of the transceivers .
The resulting processed data displayed a blob - like image of the moving target on a computer screen .
A similar , yet improved method allowed the researchers to effectively see through walls .
In this experiment , a network of 34 transceivers helped to track moving people behind a brick wall .
This study is detailed on arXiv.org , an online archive for preprints of scientific papers .
The research is awaiting publication in the journal IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing .
Here 's how the signals get converted into blob - like images :
Unlike radar , which measures radio signals that have bounced off an object , radio tomographic imaging measures " shadows " in radio waves .
These shadows are essentially weaker signals created when the radio waves pass through a person or other object .
Wilson and Patwari collected radio signal strength measurements in all their experiments , first when the study area was empty and then when a person walked through it .
From that data , the duo developed math formulas and used them in a computer program to convert weaker signals — which occur when someone walks through the radio signals and creates so - called shadows — into a bird 's - eye - view image of that person walking .
The team says such signals can travel through obstructions , such as walls , trees and smoke , and of course it works in the dark .
Although the system still needs improvements , Patwari said , " the plan is that when there is a hostage situation , for example , or some kind of event that makes it dangerous for police or firefighters to enter a building , then instead of entering the building first , they would throw dozens of these radios around the building and immediately they would be able to see a computer image showing where people are moving inside the building . "
Patwari added , " They are reusable and you can pick them up afterwards . "
This is n't the first device with Superman - like visual prowess .
A wireless radar technology called LifeReader , which has garnered given a first phase contract worth $ 850,000 by the U.S. Army , can accurately detect and monitor heart and respiration activity of multiple subjects wirelessly , with no contact to the subjects .
The goal is to develop military applications for the device that can see through walls to find people inside .
An X - ray imaging technique recently revealed colorful details of a painting hidden beneath another painting by famed American artist N.C. Wyeth .
Essentially , an instrument shot intense X - ray beams at the painting , which were emitted by different chemical elements in the paint pigments and collected by a microscope instrument .
A device that takes information gathered by a small digital camera in a pair of glasses and sends it to a " lollipop " electrode that sits on a person 's tongue could some day help the blind to see .
A transplanted womb would not be permanent
The first successful human womb transplant could take place within two years , British scientists have said .
London - based experts say they have worked out how to transplant a womb with a regular blood supply so it will last long enough to carry a pregnancy .
Research involving donor rabbits was presented at a US fertility conference .
The charity Uterine Transplant UK is seeking funding of £ 250,000 after being denied grants by several medical research bodies .
A breakthrough could offer an alternative to surrogacy or adoption for women whose own wombs have been damaged by diseases such as cervical cancer .
Up to 200 women in the UK are said to use surrogate mothers each year .
In the latest research conducted at the Royal Veterinary College in London , five rabbits were given a womb using a technique which connected major blood vessels , including the aorta .
Two of the rabbits lived to 10 months , with examinations after death indicating the transplants had been a success .
' Huge interest ' Richard Smith , consultant gynaecological surgeon at Hammersmith Hospital , told the American Society for Reproductive Medicine conference in Atlanta the team 's next step would involve getting rabbits pregnant through IVF treatment .
The technique would then be used on larger animals .
Other research projects in the past have carried out similar experiments on pigs , goats , sheep and monkeys .
I think there is a big difference between demonstrating effectiveness in a rabbit and being able to do this in a larger animal or a human
Tony Rutherford , British Fertility Society
A human transplant has also been tried once before - in Saudi Arabia in 2000 - but the womb came from a live donor , and was rejected after three months .
Mr Smith suggested it may have failed because surgeons had not worked out how to connect the blood vessels properly .
The UK study involved transplanting the womb with all its arteries , veins and bigger vessels .
" I think there are certain technical issues to be ironed out but I think the crux of how to carry out a successful graft that 's properly vascularised - I think we have cracked that one . "
A transplanted womb would only stay in place long enough for a woman to have the children she wanted .
And any baby would have to be delivered by Caesarean section as a transplanted human womb is unlikely to be able to withstand natural labour .
Conception would also need to be through IVF because women with a transplanted womb could be at higher risk of ectopic pregnancy .
Mr Smith acknowledged the procedures were seen as " a step too far in terms of fertility management " among the medical profession but said interest from patients was huge .
Tony Rutherford , chairman of the British Fertility Society , said : " I think there is a big difference between demonstrating effectiveness in a rabbit and being able to do this in a larger animal or a human ... "
Clare Lewis - Jones , from Infertility Network UK , said " a great deal of thought and discussion " was needed on the issue including the ethical ramifications .

These are the compilation of wonderful scenes of orang utans in Borneo .
Once widespread throughout the forests of Asia , orang utans are now confined to just two islands , Sumatra and Borneo .
There are two genetically distinct species : the Sumatran orangutan ( Pongo abelii ) and the Bornean orangutan ( Pongo pygmaeus ) .
The two species show slightly different physical characteristics .
Sumatran orangutans have lighter hair and a longer beard than their Bornean relatives , and Sumatran males have narrower cheekpads .
Both species are highly endangered due to habitat loss and poaching .
The orangutan is one of our closest relatives in the animal kingdom , sharing 96.4 % of our DNA .
Indigenous peoples of Indonesia and Malaysia call this ape “ Orang Hutan ” which literally translates as “ Person of the Forest ” .
The main threat to the Orangutan is habitat loss , as rainforest is cut down for timber logging or cleared for human settlement .
Because of increased availability , the diet of Sumatran orang - utans has a higher percentage of pulpy fruit and figs compared to that of Bornean orang - utans .
For this Monday special , I want introduce you our new friend , orang utan !

Latin America 's leading country escaped the financial crisis relatively unscathed and is reporting economic figures America can only dream of .
Brazil , which investors can play using the iShares MSCI Brazil ( EWZ ) , literally feeds the world with its products and has far fewer crisis scenarios to worry about than countries such as the U.S. , China , and Japan .
While the stock market is on fire and the timing may not be perfect , the story of Brazil is a multi - decade theme still in its infancy .
This country is just as important to the world 's future as China .

Haluan mennä teatteriin , joten ostan liput Lippu. fi - internetpalvelun kautta .
Se on tunnetusti näppärä ja kätevä tapa menettää hermonsa ja kuolla aivoverenvuotoon .
Kirjoitan hakulaatikkoon mental finland , koska haluan keskiluokkaisena sivistysyksilönä osallistua syksyn tärkeimpään kulttuuriporvarilliseen keskusteluun .
Saan eteeni luettelon :
Tästä listasta ei voi tietenkään ostaa mitään tai nähdä loppuunvarattuja esityksiä , mutta voi klikata linkkiä , jolloin esille pulpsahtaa lähes samanlainen lista :
Hmm .
Päättelen , että lippuja on jäljellä vain ensimmäiseen esitykseen :
Siispä kliksautan ensimmäistä linkkiä ja saan eteeni lippuvalinnan .
Vihdoinkin .
Lisätäänpä itselle sopiva lippu koriin , niin johan alkaa bourdieulaista kulttuuripääomaa ropista toimittajan laariin :
Ai niin , unohdin kirjautua sisään :
Hassua – lippu ei siirtynyt ostoskoriin samalla kun kirjauduin sisään :
No , ostetaanpa se uudestaan ( olisikohan tämä nyt kolmas kerta ) , niin nyt se varmaan onnistuu :
Loppuunvarattu !
Onpa harmi .
Valitsen siis kahdesta tarjolla olevasta katsomosegmentistä toisen :
Jaa , eipä ollut sielläkään .
Täytynee siis päätellä , että vaikka tämä oli kaikista esityksistä ainoa , jota ei listasivulla mainittu loppuunmyydyksi , se silti on loppuunmyyty .
On ehkä hitusen rasittavaa kaupata asiakkaille lippuja , joita ei kuitenkaan ole olemassa .
Siitä tulee mieleeni eräs tv-ohjelma :
Eikä siinä vielä kaikki !
Jos nimittäin olisin onnistunut ostamaan liput , pärähtäisi silmille seuraavanlainen hauskuus :
APUA APUA LASKURI SEITSEMÄN MINUUTTIA HÄTÄ !
Sitä voisi kuvitella , että jos lisäisi ostoskoriin vaikka toisen esityksen liput , niin laskuri nollaantuisi .
Vaan ei : aikaa on tasan tuon verran , ja kun se on kulunut :

South Puget Sound 's Resident Professional
Theatre , Centerstage is up to something big , really big , billions - and - billions - of - stars BIG .
On September 25th Centerstage
Theatre will present a world premiere musical , Carl Sagan 's CONTACT .
This new show is overflowing with " star stuff " and is sure to launch the theater 's stellar 2009 - 2010 Season into the stratosphere !
Centerstage 's Managing Artistic Director Alan Bryce explains his passion and enthusiasm for this new project , " Centerstage is dedicated to bringing high quality entertainment at an affordable prIce To South Puget Sound , and I am determined to push the artistic limits of this fantastic theatre by creating new work for our own community and the greater theatre community at large .
Carl Sagan 's mind - bending brilliance and drama will translate well to the stage , and I am thrilled that our theatre is the first to explore the theatrical potential of this new work . "
The book was adapted by Alan Bryce who will also serve as the show 's director .
Amy Engelhardt , ASCAP award - winner and member of The Bobs , is the lyricist and European Composer of the Year Peter Sipos , wrote the music .
LA - based Roni Blak will choreograph the show .
Dana Friedi is the costume designer and set / lighting designer Craig Wollam will incorporate the elaborate video projections by skilled video designer Riley Dickens into the overall design .
Bryce continues , " it 's not every day that Federal Way audiences get a chance to participate in the development of a new musical and I know this experience will enlighten us all - as microscopic residents of this ‘ pale blue dot ' in the middle of the vast universe we inhabit . " s
Carl Sagan 's widow , Ann Druyan recently wrote to Centerstage , " My feeling is hugely positive ... I really believe your CONTACT has a place on Broadway and all around the planet . "
Carl Sagan and his wife spent long periods of time in Seattle during the mid 1990s when Sagan received bone marrow treatments at the FrEd Hutchinson Cancer Research Center .
Carl Sagan died December 1996 , in Seattle , after a long battle with bone marrow disease .
But he never gave up his dream of going to the stars .
Sagan created the character of Ellie Arroway , the director of " Project Argus , " for his novel CONTACT which was first published in 1985 .
Like Sagan , Ellie unflinchingly searches for extraterrestrial intelligence .
After encountering the first confirmed communication from extraterrestrial beings , she discovers something more dramatic and unexpected than anyone could have ever predicted .
It is interesting to note that Sagan named Eleanor ( Ellie ) Arroway , after two people : Eleanor Roosevelt , a " personal hero " of Sagan 's wife , and Voltaire , whose last name was Arouet .
American astronomer Jill Tarter , director of the Center for SETI Research , served as a consultant to actor Jodie Foster during the making of the film CONTACT .
She also inspired and consulted with Sagan when he originally developed his fictional character of Ellie Arroway .
Jill Tarter visited Seattle in August 2009 and met with Alan Bryce and the new musical 's leading lady , Caitlin Frances .
Carl Sagan 's CONTACT is part of the discounted 5 - 9 - or 10 - show Season Pass which is on sale now .
Single tickets for all 12 performances are also on sale now and available by phone at ( 253 ) 661-1444 , online at www.centerstagetheatre.com, and in person at the Knutzen Family Theater box office .

There are 3 performances a week on Friday and Saturday evenings at 8:00 pm plus a Sunday matinee at 2:00 pm .
The new Wine with the Director featuring wines by Mount Baker Vineyard and Winery is Saturday October 3rd .
Centerstage patrons meet with the show 's director at 7:00 pm for wine and hors d'oeuvres .
The Director will give a short presentation on the show you are about to see that night with a general audience Q&A for anyone who wishes to stay after the performance .
Tickets to the new Wine with the Director are $ 10 and include a glass of wine .
The cast of 18 locally - based actors in Carl Sagan 's CONTACT includes : Caitlin Frances ( Ellie ) , Matthew Posner ( Joss ) and Eric Hartley ( Hadden ) , Zoe McLane , Jamie Pederson , Natalie Moe , Lance Channing , Joe McCarthy , Alison Monda , Sophia Federighi , Amber Cutlip , Dana Johnson , AnnaMaria Pasley Horn , Matthew Ahrens , James Patrick , Branden Edwards and Jonathan Wright .
Astronomer , educator and author , Carl Sagan was the world 's greatest popularizer of science , reaching millions of people through newspapers , magazines and television broadcasts .
He is well - known for his work on the PBS series Cosmos , the Emmy - award - winning show that became the most - watched series in public - television history .
It was seen by more than 500 million people in 60 countries .
The accompanying book , Cosmos was the best - selling science book ever published in English .
Sagan played a leading role in NASA 's Mariner , Viking , Voyager and Galileo expeditions to other planets .
He received NASA Medals for Exceptional Scientific Achievement and twice for Distinguished Public Service .
He received 22 honorary degrees for his contributions to science , literature , education and the preservation of the environment and many awards for his work on the long - term consequences of nuclear war and reversing the nuclear arms race .
Other awards include : the John F. Kennedy Astronautics Award of the American Astronautical Society ; the Explorers Club 75th Anniversary Award and the Konstantin Tsiolkovsky Medal of the Soviet Cosmonauts Federation .
He also was the recipient of the Pulitzer Prize ( 1978 ) and the Public Welfare Medal , the highest award of the National Academy of Sciences .
Sagan was a Distinguished Visiting Scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California and a contributing editor of Parade magazine , where he published many articles about science and about the disease that he battled for the last two years of his life .
He died in Seattle in December , 1996 .
Centerstage Is Federal Way 's resident Theatre Company .
It was founded in 1977 and for the past ten years has produced shows at the Knutzen Family Theatre on the shores of Puget Sound .
Initially created as a performance conservatory for aspiring actors , Centerstage 's mission has expanded and is now committed to producing " innovative , accomplished productions of popular work and for new work with the widest possible audience appeal . "
Hits like last season 's Always ... Patsy Cline certainly fall into the former category .
Centerstage has produced many exciting new works in recent years including : 4 Christmases , commissioned from 5 - time Grammy Nominee , John Forster ; a new musical version of the Dickens ' classic Nicholas Nickleby ; Robin Hood the first full production of Tom Meehan , Peter Sipos and Martin Charnin 's new project ; Alan Bryce 's Nightmare of a Married Man which won the Tacoma News Tribune 's " Best New Play Award , 2007 - 2008 Season " ; and two traditional English " pantomimes , " including the wildly popular Aladdin , from one of the masters of this uniquely British Theatrical art form , Paul Hendy .
Perhaps the most ambitious project undertaken by Centerstage is the world premiere musical Carl Sagan 's Contact .
In April 2009 , the City of Federal Way awarded the Knutzen Family Theatre management contract to Centerstage saving both the city and theatre company over $ 50,000 .

ARROYO GRANDE , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) -- Jack Bogle published " The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism " four years ago .
The battle 's over .
The sequel should be titled : " Capitalism Died a Lost Soul . "
Worse , we 've lost " America 's Soul . "
And , worldwide , the consequences will be catastrophic .
That 's why a man like Hong Kong contrarian economist Marc Faber warns in his Doom , Boom & Gloom Report : " The future will be a total disaster , with a collapse of our capitalistic system as we know it today . "
No , not just another meltdown , another bear - market recession like the one recently triggered by Wall Street 's too - greedy - to - fail banks .
Faber is warning that the entire system of capitalism will collapse .
Get it ?
The engine driving the great " American Economic Empire " for 233 years will collapse , a total disaster , a destiny we created .
OK , deny it .
But I 'll bet you have a nagging feeling that maybe he 's right , that the end may be near .
I have for a long time : I wrote a column back in 1997 : " Battling for the Soul of Wall Street . "
My interest in " The Soul " -- what Jung called the " collective unconscious " -- dates back to my Ph.D. dissertation , " Modern Man in Search of His Soul , " a title borrowed from Jung 's 1933 book , " Modern Man in Search of a Soul . "
This battle has been on my mind since my days at Morgan Stanley 30 years ago , witnessing the decline .
Has capitalism lost its soul ?
Guys like Bogle and Faber sense it .
Read more about the soul in physicist Gary Zukav 's " The Seat of the Soul , " Thomas Moore 's " Care of the Soul " and sacred texts .
But for Wall Street and American capitalism , use your gut .
You know something 's very wrong : A year ago , too - greedy - to - fail banks were insolvent , in a near - death experience .
Now , magically , they 're back to business as usual , arrogant , pocketing outrageous bonuses while Main Street sacrifices , and unemployment and foreclosures continue rising as tight credit , inflation and skyrocketing federal debt are killing taxpayers .
Yes , Wall Street has lost its moral compass .
It created the mess , but now , like vultures , Wall Streeters are capitalizing on the carcass .
They have lost all sense of fiduciary duty , ethical responsibility and public obligation .
Here are the Top 20 reasons American capitalism has lost its soul :
1. Collapse is now inevitable
Capitalism has been the engine driving America and the global economies for over two centuries .
Faber predicts its collapse will trigger global " wars , massive government - debt defaults , and the impoverishment of large segments of Western society . "
Faber knows that capitalism is not working , capitalism has peaked , and the collapse of capitalism is " inevitable . "
When ?
He hesitates : " But what I do n't know is whether this final collapse , which is inevitable , will occur tomorrow , or in five or 10 years , and whether it will occur with the Dow at 100,000 and gold at $ 50,000 per ounce or even confiscated , or with the Dow at 3,000 and gold at $ 1,000 . "
But the end is inevitable , a historical imperative .
2. Nobody 's planning for a ' Black Swan '
While the timing may be uncertain , the trigger is certain .
Societies collapse because they fail to plan ahead , cannot act fast enough when a catastrophic crisis hits .
Think " Black Swan " and read evolutionary biologist Jared Diamond 's " Collapse : How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed . "
A crisis hits .
We act surprised .
Should n't .
But it 's too late : " Civilizations share a sharp curve of decline .
Indeed , a society 's demise may begin only a decade or two after it reaches its peak population , wealth and power . "
Warnings are everywhere .
Why not prepare ?
Why sabotage our power , our future ?
Why set up an entire nation to fail ?
Diamond says : Unfortunately " one of the choices has depended on the courage to practice long - term thinking , and to make bold , courageous , anticipatory decisions at a time when problems have become perceptible but before they reach crisis proportions . "
Sound familiar ?
" This type of decision - making is the opposite of the short - term reactive decision - making that too often characterizes our elected politicians , " thus setting up the " inevitable " collapse .
Remember , Greenspan , Bernanke , Bush , Paulson all missed the 2007 - 8 meltdown :
It will happen again , in a bigger crisis .
3. Wall Street sacked Washington
Bogle warned of a growing three - part threat -- a " happy conspiracy " -- in " The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism : " " The business and ethical standards of corporate America , of investment America , and of mutual fund America have been gravely compromised . "
But since his book , " Wall Street America " went over to the dark side , got mega - greedy and took control of " Washington America . "
Their spoils of war included bailouts , bankruptcies , stimulus , nationalizations and $ 23.7 trillion new debt off - loaded to the Treasury , Fed and American people .
Who 's in power ?
Irrelevant .
The " happy conspiracy " controls both parties , writes the laws to suit its needs , with absolute control of America 's fiscal and monetary policies .
Sorry Jack , but the " Battle for the Soul of Capitalism " really was lost .
4 . When greed was legalized
Go see Michael Moore 's documentary , " Capitalism : A Love Story . " " Disaster Capitalism " author Naomi Klein recently interviewed Moore in The Nation magazine : " Capitalism is the legalization of this greed .
Greed has been with human beings forever .
We have a number of things in our species that you would call the dark side , and greed is one of them .
If you do n't put certain structures in place or restrictions on those parts of our being that come from that dark place , then it gets out of control . "
Greed 's OK , within limits , like the 10 Commandments .
Yes , the soul can thrive around greed , if there are structures and restrictions to keep it from going out of control .
But Moore warns : " Capitalism does the opposite of that .
It not only does n't really put any structure or restrictions on it .
It encourages it , it rewards " greed , creating bigger , more frequent bubble / bust cycles .
It happens because capitalism is now in " the hands of people whose only concern is their fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders or to their own pockets . "
Yes , greed was legalized in America , with Wall Street running Washington .
5 . Triggering the end of our ' life cycle '
Like Diamond , Faber also sees the historical imperative : " Every successful society " grows " out of some kind of challenge . "
Today , the " life cycle " of capitalism is on the decline .
He asks himself : " How are you so sure about this final collapse ? "
The answer : " Of all the questions I have about the future , this is the easiest one to answer .
Once a society becomes successful it becomes arrogant , righteous , overconfident , corrupt , and decadent ... overspends ... costly wars ... wealth inequity and social tensions increase ; and society enters a secular decline . "
Success makes us our own worst enemy .
Quoting 18th century Scottish historian Alexander Fraser Tytler : " The average life span of the world 's greatest civilizations has been 200 years " progressing from " bondage to spiritual faith ... to great courage ... to liberty ... to abundance ... to selfishness ... to complacency ... to apathy ... to dependence and ... back into bondage ! "
Where is America in the cycle ?
" It is most unlikely that Western societies , and especially the U.S. , will be an exception to this typical ' society cycle . ' ...
The U.S. is somewhere between the phase where it moves ' from complacency to apathy ' and ' from apathy to dependence . ' "
In short , America is a grumpy old man with hardening of the arteries .
Our capitalism is near the tipping point , unprepared for a catastrophe , set up for collapse and rapid decline .
15 more clues capitalism lost its soul ... is a disaster waiting to happen
Much more evidence litters the battlefield :
Wall Street wealth now calls the shots in Congress , the White House America 's top 1 % own more than 90 % of America 's wealth
The average worker 's income has declined in three decades while CEO compensation exploded over ten times
The Fed is now the ' fourth branch of government ' operating autonomously , secretly printing money at will Since Goldman and Morgan became bank holding companies , all banks are back gambling with taxpayer bailout money plus retail customer deposits Bill Gross warns of a " new normal " with slow growth , low earnings and stock prices
While the White House 's chief economist retorts with hype of a recovery unimpeded by the " new normal " Wall Street 's high - frequency junkies make billions trading zombie stocks like AIG , FNMA , FMAC that have no fundamental value beyond a Treasury guarantee 401 ( k ) s have lost 26.7 % of their value in the past decade Oil and energy costs will skyrocket Foreign nations and sovereign funds have started dumping dollars , signaling the end of the dollar as the world 's reserve currency
In two years federal debt exploded from $ 11.2 to $ 23.7 trillion New financial reforms will do little to prevent the next meltdown
The " forever war " between Western and Islamic fundamentalists will widen
As will environmental threats and unfunded entitlements
" America Capitalism " is a " Lost Soul " ... we 've lost our moral compass ... the coming collapse is the end of an " inevitable " historical cycle stalking all great empires to their graves .
Downsize your lifestyle expectations , trust no one , not even media .
Faber is uncertain about timing , we are not .
There is a high probability of a crisis and collapse by 2012 .
The " Great Depression 2 " is dead ahead .
Unfortunately , there 's absolutely nothing you can do to hide from this unfolding reality or prevent the rush of the historical imperative .
The concrete pedestrian ramps at the brand - new $ 1.5 billion city - subsidized Yankee Stadium have been troubled by cracks , and the team is seeking to determine whether the problems were caused by the installation , the design , the concrete or other factors , according to several people briefed on the problems .
The ramps were built by a company accused of having links to the mob , and the concrete mix was designed and tested by a company under indictment on charges that it failed to perform some tests and falsified the results of others .
But it is unclear whether work performed by either firm contributed to the deteriorating conditions of the ramps .
The Yankees have hired an engineering company to take samples from the ramps  they ascend from field level to the stadium ’s upper tiers , carrying thousands of people each game  to determine the cause and the extent of the problems as the team finishes its first season in the new stadium and prepares for what could be its first World Series there .
A spokeswoman for the team , Alice McGillion , called the cracks “ cosmetic , ” saying that they posed no safety issues because they did not affect the structural integrity of the ramps .
She characterized the work to repair the problems as “ routine remediation , ” which she said was “ usual in this kind of building or in any other building . ”

In what is considered one of his most hair - raising , thought - provoking , and outrageous
With the predictability bestowed by hindsight , Australia won the Champions Trophy last night .
They arrived for the event as holders but were considered to be a team in transition , no longer the dominant force .
It was the turn of others : South Africa , India , Sri Lanka , Pakistan and , in particularly wild dreams , England maybe .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Ho hum .
As it unfolded , it became clear that only one team had worked out when , where and how to peak for a major tournament and by the time the final itself arrived there really seemed to be only one team in it .
That did not quite prove to be so , but while a six - wicket margin against New Zealand did not represent a hammering , nor did it tell of a close and tense contest .
Shane Watson made his second successive hundred , in 129 balls , for Australia .
He finished the match with two sixes , having started the tournament with two ducks .
There were 26 balls to spare , but had New Zealand made 300 instead of the 200 they managed , Australia would no doubt have found a way of chasing them .
In an event that has been an impressive advertisement for the 50 - over format this was not the dull climax it needed or deserved .
On the morning of the match , New Zealand lost their captain and most complete cricketer , Daniel Vettori , to a strained hamstring , which did nothing to alter their status as rank underdogs .
Their hearts must have sank as quickly as their odds stretched .
There was one fleeting , fairytale moment in the match when New Zealand might have dared to dream that they could upset Australia 's well - stocked applecart .
Chasing the forlorn total , Australia were rocking at six for two with the new ball swinging and one of the two was Ricky Ponting himself , the champion batsman .
But there is a difference between rocking and falling over the edge .
The third - wicket pair of Watson and Cameron White did not survive comfortably .
Shane Bond , delivering a top - class spell of genuine fast bowling , might have had either of them at any time , several times whistling it past bats being employed on a wing and a prayer .
But they survived this onslaught and gradually took control .
Had Brendon McCullum , Vettori 's replacement , taken a catch running backwards from White 's top - edged pull when the score was only 41 , or had the world umpire of the year , Aleem Dar , been better disposed to granting a huge appeal for lbw by James Franklin against
White when it had reached 98 , windows might have opened for New Zealand .
But as it was they stayed shut and then the blinds came down .
It had been a tremendous team effort for the Kiwis to get this far .
During the tournament they lost four key players , but the fourth , Vettori , was the most important key of all , the one who could unlock the opposition through force of personality and smart cricket .
For Australia , it was their third consecutive victory in ICC 50 - over competitions after the Champions Trophy in 2006 and the World Cup in 2007 .
Patently , they are not what they were , but they keep doing it .
New Zealand were unfeasibly slow out of the blocks but Australia hardly eased their passage .
Aaron Redmond and Martin Guptill staged a slow second - wicket half - century partnership , Neil Broom and James Franklin an equally sedate one for the sixth wicket .
Australia were as disciplined in the field as they had been throughout .
When Bond and Kyle Mills tore in , New Zealand demonstrated why they have come so far .
But Watson , driving hard and also essaying some delicate shots , and White put Australia virtually out of reach .
Where they have been for so long .

Gould brings : English character to final
David Shepherd and Dickie Bird were not only the best English umpires , they were also the most memorable characters .
Shepherd , with his superstitious hopping , and Bird , with his gruff Yorkshire ways , became celebrities .
Ian Gould , who became the first Englishman to umpire a major ICC final since that pair 's heyday when he stood at Australia v New Zealand yesterday , appears to be of a similar mould .
Known as " Gunner Gould " , from his days as an Arsenal reserve goalkeeper , the former Middlesex wicketkeeper and Sussex captain divides his time between umpiring and indulging his football passion as chairman of Southern League side Burnham .
Gould says he has no interest in celebrity but his seemingly unique follow - up to calling " Over " by shouting " right - hander " or " left - hander " has led some to draw comparisons with his famous predecessors .

keypusher : < bubo bubo >
I agree with you about Morphy -- he belonged in there .
I probably would have gone with Morphy vs Harrwitz , 1858 but of course your choice is also a great game .
My own quarrel with the NBE is I think they neglected defense in favor of the attack .
I would n't have minded seeing games like Botvinnik vs Reshevsky , 1948 or Reshevsky vs Bronstein , 1953 .
But there are a lot of great games in there and , you 're right , I do like the book .
No collection of great games will ever be able to satisfy everyone .

Hi Bubo ,
I hit on this as well .
Morphy vs Duke Karl / Count Isouard , 1858 ( kibitz # 782 ) which mentions in ' The Mammoth Book of Chess . ' they had Morphy at the Opera 9 times .
( then for some reason they drop it in later editions . )
I think what I say in that post holds water .
" If 100 hundred Kibitzers on here drew up a list of the 10 greatest games placed in any order I doubt if any two list would contain the same 10 games . "
It 's a beauty and eye of the beholder situation .

HarryP :
This was the first game I ever played over the moves of .
I was 12 years old .
What a gem this is .
It 's like a small but perfect diamond .
Jan-01 - 19 Albion 1959 : Okay , now it ' my turn to have a say on this " Immortal Game ? " which has endured around the world for decades .
We can universally accept that Bg4 ?
Was a bad move .
After this , black 's game becomes difficult .
Could the allies have defended this position any better ?
Up to move 8 , black 's replies are more or less forced until move 9 , then b5 ?? was a shocker of a move that got what it deserved .
There appears to be no decent moves left here for black !
Is chess really that easy ?
Of course not , but the quality of chess players back then was woefully inferior to the standard in the 21st century , even at club level .
Difficult to know how good a player Morphy really was , he was clearly the best at the time and beat his contemporaries .
But how would have fared against later generations ?
He could not played this sort of chess today , nor could he have got away with all those sacrificial and flashy attacks against computers , they would have found the best defence and easily refuted his sacrifices .
This was one of the first games that I played through , after I had worked out chess annotation .
Still up there in the list of instructive games after all these years !

Troller : Michael Oondatje 's latest novel " Warlight " has a mother explaining this game over 2 - 3 pages to her son , narrator of the story .
Inspiration may have come from Walter Tevis ( https://lithub.com/michael-ondaatje...) -
I do not know if Oondatje is a chess player himself .
At least I recall no references to chess in his other novels I have read , " Anil 's Ghost " and " The English Patient " .
Be that as it may , I had to revisit this great game which I had not seen for 25 years .

thegoodanarchist : If Fischer played the " Game of The Century " , then surely this is " Game of The ( Previous ) Century " , in the previous century ( if you get my meaning ) .
But in this century , " Game of The Previous Century " is probably this one : Karpov vs Kasparov , 1985 or this one :
Botvinnik vs Tal , 1960
Of course , it could also be the original one !

Feb -26-20 SacrificialBlunder : I 'm amazed at the people saying that 8 . Nc3 was n't the best move .
People saying that 8 . Bxf7 + is better !
Well , at depth 42 on Stockfish 11 the evaluation for the top 3 moves is as follows : 1 . Qxb7 ( 2.15 )
2. Nc3 ( 2.10 )
3. 0-0 ( 1.61 )
I think it 's definitely safe to say that Bxf7 + is n't the best move , by far .
But , to think Qxb7 is best is strange to me .
First off , Nc3 retains all the threats , develops another piece , and just puts more pressure on Black to play accurately .
Qxb7 takes us into the endgame up a pawn with the bishop pair , as well as black having serious weaknesses on the queen side .
But you 've just released all the tension and you no longer have initiative .
It 's crazy to me , even seeing the engine evaluation showing that Qxb7 is slightly better than Nc3 , to think that Qxb7 is ever the better move to make .
I would play 8 . 0 - 0 before I ever thought about letting black trade queens .
And after 8 . Nc3 black is forced to play 8 ... c6 , if he does n't , the Nc3's evaluation is much better than Qxb7 .
After Qxb7 and the trade of queens , there are a ton of plans with similar evaluations for black .
So you guys would rather lose the initiative , go into a 50 move endgame and let black choose from many different plans than forcing black to play accurately , keeping the initiative , and play for mate ?
That just seems like a really bad way to explore the game tree .
8 . Nc3 is one of the most instructive moves I 've ever learned from .
Feb -26 - 20 Petrosianic : < First off , Nc3 retains all the threats , develops another piece , and just puts more pressure on Black to play accurately .
Qxb7 takes us into the endgame up a pawn with the bishop pair , as well as black having serious weaknesses on the queen side .
But you 've just released all the tension and you no longer have initiative . >
Yes , Qxb7 cashes in one advantage for a material advantage .
The reason to avoid that is the belief that you can cash in even bigger if you wait .
Can you ?
You say Stockfish does n't seem to think so ( although it clearly likes both moves a lot ) .
If Black does n't play the insanely obliging move 9 ... b5 , White does n't have it nearly as easy as he did in the game .
Feb -26 -20 asiduodiego :
When I show this game to friends to teach them about chess , I always say that 8 Qxb7 is a fine move , but with the problem that leads to simplification immediatly .
White is much better , being a pawn up , and ahead of development , but I think Morphy prefered 8 Nc3 because Black position is cramped , and difficult to develop , so perhaps he thinks it 's better to develop a piece ( usually a sound judgment ) rather than go pawngrabbing ( which was n't his style ) .
I think maybe Black should have played 8 ... b6 , because this move can allow for Black to ( perhaps eventually ) to move the Queen , move the Bishop and then castle .
When I teach this game , I use it as a lesson in the good old principle of " DON'T FORGET TO CASTLE , DAMN IT ! " ( in Spanish I use stronger words ) .
Feb -26 - 20 asiduodiego :
I think this game should be used as a learning tool on " The importance of following the Chess basic principles " which Morphy discovered ( or maybe he was born knowing the dang things , who knows ) .
Black 's game is very bad , but it seems typical play of a player who is constantly improvising in every move , instead of following sound positional and development principles .
Morphy 's play perhaps is not completly accurate by engine standards ( I think 8 Qxb7 is just a fine move if you find yourself in this position ) , but 8 Nc3 is good as a learning tool : " Take out all your pieces to play ! " .
Black , of course , is playing very badly in this game , and moves such as 9 ... b5 ?? is inviting disaster .
But , from a beginner 's point of view , is hard to notice immediatly why such move is that bad , in fact , I guess for a beginner is just a natural move " let 's relieve pressure from f7 by taking this bishop out of here " .
This game is a gem because it shows almost every sound principle of chess in action against a completely clueless opponent .

Hi asiduodiego ,
< I think this game should be used as a learning tool on " The importance of following the Chess basic principles " >
I think you will find that game is in 95 % of the Chess Primers that have ever been written .
It is probably the most famous game in the world ( not the best ... the most famous . )
Edward Winter has good page on it
https://www.chesshistory.com/winter...
Go right down the bottom and I get a huffy - puffy mention ( though I am honoured ) for basically cracking a joke .
( which I actually did re-do to make it clear it was a joke . )
" As shown at the English Chess Forum , Geoff Chandler [ ME ! ] has written falsehoods about our treatment of the Morphy opera game , also demonstrating his reluctance / incapacity to set matters straight .
We have never said which opera was being performed , because we can not say .
All available evidence has been quoted impartially , whichever way it leans . "

I agree this game is not the best game of all time ( not even in the " Romantic Era " ) , but I think it 's probably the most instructive display of the many basic principles .
Let us review :
1- Always develop your pieces .
2- Play with tempo .
3- Do n't forget to castle .
4- Attack the pinned piece .
5- Play with ALL your pieces .
6- Remove the defenders .
Some games ( such as the original " Immortal " ) also deal with some of these principles , but the Immortal is much more chaotic ( being a King 's Gambit ) .
In this game , all the plays of White flow as natural , easy and principled .
The only play of White which needs more explanation is 10 Nxb5 !.
Beginners wonder about this : " Why the Knight sacrifice ? " .
The explanation of course is : " Open lines of attack against a weak uncastled king " .
It 's really a gem for learning .
In my opinion the best ( and also very instructive ) game of the " Romantic Era " of Chess is the " Evergreen " , in which the principles described previously also are also present .
The advantage of this game is that is shorter and more to the point .
Regarding the Opera , I 've read many different versions : The Marriage of Figaro , the Barber of Seville , Norma , etc .
Also , I 've read details such as the Duke Karl and his friend Count Isouard made such noise , that everyone began to pay attention to them instead of the Opera .
Nice details , but probably fictitious .
Sometimes I laugh thinking that , perhaps in the future , some 500 years from now , the facts of the game will be completely lost or twisted , but the game list remains intact , and people will be saying that the " Opera " of this game was " Cats " or the musical version of " Monty Python and the Holy Grail " .

Hi asiduodiego ,
Yes the game is a chess writers dream and I think I 'm on safe ground when I say it has been published more than any other game .
I 've always liked this game .
Morphy vs T J Bryan , 1859 18.h4 to deflect the Queen from e7 .
There are 1000's of examples of a combination being played after you deflect a piece from guarding a certain square .
But one could not fail to be impressed with that one .
The lesson will stick .

Mar-01 - 20 MordimerChess :
Thank you guys for all the information about this game .
Really awesome and rich discussion .
There is nothing more to add about the game :)
I produced the video of this game :
https://youtu.be/jjQhRM5dV6Y
with some funny accents explaining what was fetish of Duke of Brunswick or how people still argue the name of the opera , when the game was played .
Author of the butcher / artist remark is also very interesting as it has often been quoted sourcelessly with reference to 8 Bxf7 + , and not also 8 Qxb7 .
Enjoy the material ;)

1 . Is the Internal Revenue Service ( “ IRS ” ) an organization within the U.S. Department of the Treasury ?
Answer : No .
The IRS is not an organization within the United States Department of the Treasury .
The U.S. Department of the Treasury was organized by statutes now codified in Title 31 of the United States Code , abbreviated “ 31 U.S.C . ”
The only mention of the IRS anywhere in 31 U.S.C. §§ 301‑315 is an authorization for the President to appoint an Assistant General Counsel in the U.S. Department of the Treasury to be the Chief Counsel for the IRS .
See 31 U.S.C. 301(f ) ( 2 ) .
At footnote 23 in the case of Chrysler Corp. v. Brown , 441 U.S. 281 ( 1979 ) , the U.S. Supreme Court admitted that no organic
Act for the IRS could be found , after they searched for such an Act all the way back to the Civil War , which ended in the year 1865 A.D. The Guarantee Clause in the U.S. Constitution guarantees the Rule of Law to all Americans ( we are to be governed by Law and not by arbitrary bureaucrats ) .
See Article IV , Section 4 .
Since there was no organic
Act creating it , IRS is not a lawful organization .
2 . If not an organization within the U.S. Department of the Treasury , then what exactly is the IRS ?
Answer :
The IRS appears to be a collection agency working for foreign banks and operating out of Puerto Rico under color of the Federal Alcohol Administration ( “ FAA ” ) .
But the FAA was promptly declared unconstitutional inside the 50 States by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of U.S. v. Constantine , 296 U.S. 287 ( 1935 ) , because Prohibition had already been repealed .
In 1998 , the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit identified a second “ Secretary of the Treasury ” as a man by the name of Manual Díaz - Saldaña .
See the definitions of “ Secretary ” and “ Secretary or his delegate ” at 27 CFR 26.11 ( formerly 27 CFR 250.11 ) , and the published decision in Used Tire International , Inc. v. Manual Díaz - Saldaña , court docket number 97‑2348 , September 11 , 1998 .
Both definitions mention Puerto Rico .
When all the evidence is examined objectively , IRS appears to be a money laundry , extortion racket , and conspiracy to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity , in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1951 and 1961 et seq . ( “ RICO ” ) .
Think of Puerto RICO ( Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ) ; in other words , it is an organized crime syndicate operating under false and fraudulent pretenses .
See also the Sherman Act and the Lanham Act .
3 . By what legal authority , if any , has the IRS established offices inside the 50 States of the Union ?
Answer :
After much diligent research , several investigators have concluded that there is no known
Act of Congress , nor any Executive Order , giving IRS lawful jurisdiction to operate within any of the 50 States of the Union .
Their presence within the 50 States appears to stem from certain Agreements on Coordination of Tax Administration ( “ ACTA ” ) , which officials in those States have consummated with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue .
A template for ACTA agreements can be found at the IRS Internet website and in the Supreme Law Library on the Internet .
However , those ACTA agreements are demonstrably fraudulent , for example , by expressly defining “ IRS ” as a lawful bureau within the U.S. Department of the Treasury .
( See Answer to Question 1 above . )
Moreover , those ACTA agreements also appear to violate State laws requiring competitive bidding before such a service contract can be awarded by a State government to any subcontractor .
There is no evidence to indicate that ACTA agreements were reached after competitive bidding processes ; on the contrary , the IRS is adamant about maintaining a monopoly syndicate .
4. Can IRS legally show “ Department of the Treasury ” on their outgoing mail ?
Answer : No .
It is obvious that such deceptive nomenclature is intended to convey the false impression that IRS is a lawful bureau or department within the U.S. Department of the Treasury .
Federal laws prohibit the use of United States Mail for fraudulent purposes .
Every piece of U.S. Mail sent from IRS with “ Department of the Treasury ” in the return address , is one count of mail fraud .
See also 31 U.S.C. 333 .
5 . Does the U.S. Department of Justice have power of attorney to represent the IRS in federal court ?
Answer : No. Although the U.S. Department of Justice ( “ DOJ ” ) does have power of attorney to represent federal agencies before federal courts , the IRS is not an “ agency ” as that term is legally defined in the Freedom of Information Act or in the Administrative Procedures Act .
The governments of all federal Territories are expressly ex cluded from the definition of federal “ agency ” by Act of Congress .
See 5 U.S.C. 551( 1 ) ( C ) .
Since IRS is domiciled in Puerto Rico ( RICO ? ) , it is thereby ex cluded from the definition of federal agencies which can be represented by the DOJ .
The IRS Chief Counsel , appointed by the President under authority of 31 U.S.C. 301 ( f ) ( 2 ) , can appear , or appoint a delegate to appear in federal court on behalf of IRS and IRS employees .
Again , see the Answer to Question 1 above .
As far as powers of attorney are concerned , the chain of command begins with Congress , flows to the President , and then to the IRS Chief Counsel , and NOT to the U.S. Department of Justice .
6 . Were the so - called 14th and 16th amendments properly ratified ?
Answer : No. Neither was properly ratified .
In the case of People v. Boxer ( December 1992 ) , docket number # S - 030016 , U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer fell totally silent in the face of an Application to the California Supreme Court by the People of California , for an ORDER compelling Senator Boxer to witness the material evidence against the so - called 16th amendment .
That so ‑called “ amendment ” allegedly authorized federal income taxation , even though it contains no provision expressly repealing two Constitutional Clauses mandating that direct taxes must be apportioned .
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court have both ruled that repeals by implication are not favored .
See Crawford Fitting Co. et al. v. J.T. Gibbons , Inc. , 482 U.S. 437 , 442 ( 1987 ) .
The material evidence in question was summarized in AFFIDAVITs that were properly executed and filed in that case .
Boxer fell totally silent , thus rendering those affidavits the “ truth of the case . ”
The so ‑called 16th amendment has now been correctly identified as a major fraud upon the American People and the United States .
Major fraud against the United States is a serious federal offense .
See 18 U.S.C. 1031 .
Similarly , the so - called 14th amendment was never properly ratified either .
In the case of Dyett v. Turner , 439 P.2d 266 , 270 ( 1968 ) , the Utah Supreme Court recited numerous historical facts proving , beyond any shadow of a doubt , that the so‑called 14th amendment was likewise a major fraud upon the American People .
Those facts , in many cases , were Acts of the several State Legislatures voting for or against that proposal to amend the U.S. Constitution .
The Supreme Law Library has a collection of references detailing this major fraud .
The U.S. Constitution requires that constitutional amendments be ratified by three - fourths of the several States .
As such , their Acts are governed by the Full Faith and Credit Clause in the U.S. Constitution .
See Article IV , Section 1 .
Judging by the sheer amount of litigation its various sections have generated , particularly Section 1 , the so‑called 14th amendment is one of the worst pieces of legislation ever written in American history .
The phrase “ subject to the jurisdiction of the United States ” is properly understood to mean “ subject to the municipal jurisdiction of Congress . ” ( See Answer to Question 19 below . )
For this one reason alone , the Congressional Resolution proposing the so - called 14th amendment is provably vague and therefore unconstitutional .
See 14 Stat. 358-359 , Joint Resolution No. 48 , June 16 , 1866 .
7 . Where are the statutes that create a specific liability for federal income taxes ?
Answer : Section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code ( “ IRC ” ) contains no provisions creating a specific liability for taxes imposed by subtitle A. Aside from the statutes which apply only to federal government employees , pursuant to the Public Salary Tax Act , the only other statutes that create a specific liability for federal income taxes are those itemized in the definition of “ Withholding agent ” at IRC section 7701 ( a ) ( 16 ) .
For example , see IRC section 1461 .
A separate liability statute for “ employment ” taxes imposed by subtitle C is found at IRC section 3403 .
After a worker authorizes a payroll officer to withhold taxes , typically by completing Form W‑4 , the payroll officer then becomes a withholding agent who is legally and specifically liable for payment of all taxes withheld from that worker ’s paycheck .
Until such time as those taxes are paid in full into the Treasury of the United States , the withholding agent is the only party who is legally liable for those taxes , not the worker .
See IRC section 7809 ( “ Treasury of the United States ” ) .
If the worker opts instead to complete a Withholding Exemption Certificate , consistent with IRC section 3402 ( n ) , the payroll officer is not thereby authorized to withhold any federal income taxes .
In this latter situation , there is absolutely no liability for the worker or for the payroll officer ; in other words , there is no liability PERIOD , specifically because there is no withholding agent .
8 . Can a federal regulation create a specific liability , when no specific liability is created by the corresponding statute ?
Answer : No. The U.S. Constitution vests all legislative power in the Congress of the United States .
See Article I , Section 1 .
The Executive Branch of the federal government has no legislative power whatsoever .
This means that agencies of the Executive Branch , and also the federal Courts in the Judicial Branch , are prohibited from making law .
If an Act of Congress fails to create a specific liability for any tax imposed by that Act , then there is no liability for that tax .
Executive agencies have no authority to cure any such omission by using regulations to create a liability .
“ [ A ] n administrative agency may not create a criminal offense or any liability not sanctioned by the lawmaking authority , especially a liability for a tax or inspection fee . ”
See Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Acker , 361 U.S. 87 , 4 L.Ed.2d 127 , 80 S.Ct. 144 ( 1959 ) , and Independent Petroleum Corp. v. Fly , 141 F.2d 189 ( 5th Cir. 1944 ) as cited at 2 Am Jur 2d , p. 129 , footnote 2 ( 1962 edition ) [ bold emphasis added ] .
However , this cite from American Jurisprudence has been removed from the 1994 edition of that legal encyclopedia .
9 . The federal regulations create an income tax liability for what specific classes of people ?
Answer :
The regulations at 26 CFR 1.1 - 1 attempted to create a specific liability for all “ citizens of the United States ” and all “ residents of the United States ” .
However , those regulations correspond to IRC section 1 , which does not create a specific liability for taxes imposed by subtitle A .
Therefore , these regulations are an overly broad extension of the underlying statutory authority ; as such , they are unconstitutional , null and void ab initio ( from the beginning , in Latin ) .
The Acker case cited above held that federal regulations can not exceed the underlying statutory authority .
( See Answer to Question 8 above . )
10 .
How many classes of citizens are there , and how did this number come to be ?
Answer :
There are two ( 2 ) classes of citizens : State Citizens and federal citizens .
The first class originates in the Qualifications Clauses in the U.S. Constitution , where the term “ Citizen of the United States ” is used .
( See 1:2:2 , 1:3:3 and 2:1:5 . )
Notice the UPPER - CASE “ C ” in “ C itizen ” .
The pertinent court cases have defined the term “ United States ” in these Clauses to mean “ States United ” , and the full term means “ Citizen of ONE OF the States United ” .
See People v. De La Guerra , 40 Cal. 311 , 337 ( 1870 ) ; Judge Pablo De La Guerra signed the California Constitution of 1849 , when California first joined the Union .
Similar terms are found in the Diversity Clause at Article III , Section 2 , Clause 1 , and in the Privileges and Immunities Clause at Article IV , Section 2 , Clause 1 .
Prior to the Civil War , there was only one ( 1 ) class of Citizens under American Law .
See the holding in Pannill v. Roanoke , 252 F. 910 , 914‑915 ( 1918 ) , for definitive authority on this key point .
The second class originates in the 1866 Civil Rights Act , where the term “ citizen of the United States ” is used .
This Act was later codified at 42 U.S.C. 1983 .
Notice the lower - case “ c ” in “ citizen ” .
The pertinent court cases have held that Congress thereby created a municipal franchise primarily for members of the Negro race , who were freed by President Lincoln ’s Emancipation Proclamation ( a war measure ) , and later by the Thirteenth Amendment banning slavery and involuntary servitude .
Compelling payment of a “ tax ” for which there is no liability statute is tantamount to involuntary servitude , and extortion .
Instead of using the unique term “ federal citizen ” , as found in Black ’s Law Dictionary , Sixth Edition , it is now clear that the Radical Republicans who sponsored the 1866 Civil Rights
Act were attempting to confuse these two classes of citizens .
Then , they attempted to elevate this second class to constitutional status , by proposing a 14th amendment to the U.S. Constitution .
As we now know , that proposal was never ratified .
( See Answer to Question 6 above . )
Numerous court cases have struggled to clarify the important differences between the two classes .
One of the most definitive , and dispositive cases , is Pannill v. Roanoke , 252 F. 910 , 914‑915 ( 1918 ) , which clearly held that federal citizens had no standing to sue under the Diversity Clause , because they were not even contemplated when Article III in the U.S. Constitution was first being drafted , circa 1787 A.D .
Another is Ex parte Knowles , 5 Cal. 300 ( 1855 ) in which the California Supreme Court ruled that there was no such thing as a “ citizen of the United States ” ( as of the year 1855 A.D. ) .
Only federal citizens have standing to invoke 42 U.S.C. 1983 ; whereas State Citizens do not .
See Wadleigh v. Newhall , 136 F. 941 ( C.C. Cal. 1905 ) .
Many more cases can be cited to confirm the existence of two classes of citizens under American Law .
These cases are thoroughly documented in the book entitled “ The Federal Zone : Cracking the Code of Internal Revenue ” by Paul Andrew Mitchell , B.A. , M.S. , now in its eleventh edition .
See also the pleadings in the case of USA v. Gilbertson , also in the Supreme Law Library .
11 . Can one be a State Citizen , without also being a federal citizen ?
Answer : Yes .
The 1866 Civil Rights
Act was municipal law , confined to the District of Columbia and other limited areas where Congress is the “ state ” government with exclusive legislative jurisdiction there .
These areas are now identified as “ the federal zone . ”
( Think of it as the blue field on the American flag ; the stars on the flag are the 50 States . )
As such , the 1866 Civil Rights
Act had no effect whatsoever upon the lawful status of State Citizens , then or now .
Several courts have already recognized our Right to be State Citizens without also becoming federal citizens .
For excellent examples , see State v. Fowler , 41 La. Ann. 380 , 6 S. 602 ( 1889 ) and Gardina v. Board of Registrars , 160 Ala.
155 , 48 S. 788 , 791 ( 1909 ) .
The Maine Supreme Court also clarified the issue by explaining our “ Right of Election ” or “ freedom of choice , ” namely , our freedom to choose between two different forms of government .
See 44 Maine 518 ( 1859 ) , Hathaway , J. dissenting .
Since the Guarantee Clause does not require the federal government to guarantee a Republican Form of Government to the federal zone , Congress is free to create a different form of government there , and so it has .
In his dissenting opinion in Downes v. Bidwell , 182 U.S. 244 at 380 ( 1901 ) , Supreme Court Justice Harlan called it an absolute legislative democracy .
But , State Citizens are under no legal obligation to join or pledge any allegiance to that legislative democracy ; their allegiance is to one or more of the several States of the Union ( i.e. the white stars on the American flag , not the blue field ) .
12 . Who was Frank Brushaber , and why was his U.S. Supreme Court case so important ?
Answer : Frank Brushaber was the Plaintiff in the case of Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad Company , 240 U.S. 1 ( 1916 ) , the first U.S. Supreme Court case to consider the so‑called 16th amendment .
Brushaber identified himself as a Citizen of New York State and a resident of the Borough of Brooklyn , in the city of New York , and nobody challenged that claim .
The Union Pacific Railroad Company was a federal corporation created by Act of Congress to build a railroad through Utah ( from the Union to the Pacific ) , at a time when Utah was a federal Territory , i.e. inside the federal zone .
Brushaber ’s attorney committed an error by arguing that the company had been chartered by the State of Utah , but Utah was not a State of the Union when Congress first created that corporation .
Brushaber had purchased stock issued by the company .
He then sued the company to recover taxes that Congress had imposed upon the dividends paid to its stockholders .
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled against Frank Brushaber , and upheld the tax as a lawful excise , or indirect tax .
The most interesting result of the Court ’s ruling was a Treasury Decision ( “ T.D. ” ) that the U.S. Department of the Treasury later issued as a direct consequence of the high Court ’s opinion .
In T.D. 2313 , the U.S. Treasury Department expressly cited the Brushaber decision , and it identified Frank Brushaber as a “ nonresident alien ” and the Union Pacific Railroad Company as a “ domestic corporation ” .
This Treasury Decision has never been modified or repealed .
T.D. 2313 is crucial evidence proving that the income tax provisions of the IRC are municipal law , with no territorial jurisdiction inside the 50 States of the Union .
The U.S. Secretary of the Treasury who approved T.D. 2313 had no authority to extend the holding in the Brushaber case to anyone or anything not a proper Party to that court action .
Thus , there is no escaping the conclusion that Frank Brushaber was the nonresident alien to which that Treasury Decision refers .
Accordingly , all State Citizens are nonresident aliens with respect to the municipal jurisdiction of Congress , i.e. the federal zone .
13 .
What is a “ Withholding agent ” ?
Answer : ( See Answer to Question 7 first . )
The term “ Withholding agent ” is legally defined at IRC section 7701 ( a ) ( 16 ) .
It is further defined by the statutes itemized in that section , e.g. IRC 1461 where liability for funds withheld is clearly assigned .
In plain English , a “ withholding agent ” is a person who is responsible for withholding taxes from a worker ’s paycheck , and then paying those taxes into the Treasury of the United States , typically on a quarterly basis .
See IRC section 7809 .
One cannot become a withholding agent unless workers first authorize taxes to be withheld from their paychecks .
This authorization is typically done when workers opt to execute a valid W‑4 “ Employee ’s Withholding Allowance Certificate . ”
In plain English , by signing a W‑4 workers designate themselves as “ employees ” and certify they are allowing withholding to occur .
If workers do not execute a valid W‑4 form , a company ’s payroll officer is not authorized to withhold any federal income taxes from their paychecks .
In other words , the payroll officer does not have “ permission ” or “ power of attorney ” to withhold taxes , until and unless workers authorize or “ allow ” that withholding ‑‑ by signing Form W‑4 knowingly , intentionally and voluntarily .
Pay particular attention to the term “ Employee ” in the title of this form .
A properly executed Form W‑4 creates the presumption that the workers wish to be treated as if they were “ employees ” of the federal government .
Obviously , for people who do not work for the federal government , such a presumption is a legal fiction , at best .
14 . What is a “ Withholding Exemption Certificate ” ?
Answer : A “ Withholding Exemption Certificate ” is an alternative to Form W‑4 , authorized by IRC section 3402 ( n ) and executed in lieu of Form W‑4 .
Although section 3402 ( n ) does authorize this Certificate , the IRS has never added a corresponding form to its forms catalog ( see the IRS “ Printed Products Catalog ” ) .
In the absence of an official IRS form , workers can use the language of section 3402 ( n ) to create their own Certificates .
In simple language , the worker certifies that s/he had no federal income tax liability last year , and anticipates no federal income tax liability during the current calendar year .
Because there are no liability statutes for workers in the private sector , this certification is easy to justify .
Many public and private institutions have created their own form for the Withholding Exemption Certificate , e.g. California Franchise Tax Board , and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , Maryland .
This fact can be confirmed by using any search engine , e.g. google.com , to locate occurrences of the term “ withholding exemption certificate ” on the Internet .
This term occurs several times in IRC section 3402 .
15 .
What is “ tax evasion ” and who might be guilty of this crime ?
Answer : “ Tax evasion ” is the crime of evading a lawful tax .
In the context of federal income taxes , this crime can only be committed by persons who have a legal liability to pay , i.e. the withholding agent .
If one is not employed by the federal government , one is not subject to the Public Salary Tax Act unless one chooses to be treated “ as if ” one is a federal government “ employee . ”
This is typically done by executing a valid Form W‑4 .
However , as discussed above , Form W‑4 is not mandatory for workers who are not “ employed ” by the federal government .
Corporations chartered by the 50 States of the Union are technically “ foreign ” corporations with respect to the IRC ; they are decidedly not the federal government , and should not be regarded “ as if ” they are the federal government , particularly when they were never created by any Act of Congress .
Moreover , the Indiana Supreme Court has ruled that Congress can only create a corporation in its capacity as the Legislature for the federal zone .
Such corporations are the only “ domestic ” corporations under the pertinent federal laws .
This writer ’s essay entitled “ A Cogent Summary of Federal Jurisdictions ” clarifies this important distinction between “ foreign ” and “ domestic ” corporations in simple , straightforward language .
If Congress were authorized to create national corporations , such a questionable authority would invade States ’ rights reserved to them by the Tenth Amendment , namely , the right to charter their own domestic corporations .
The repeal of Prohibition left the Tenth Amendment unqualified .
See the Constantine case supra .
For purposes of the IRC , the term “ employer ” refers only to federal government agencies , and an “ employee ” is a person who works for such an “ employer ” .

Why does IRS Form 1040 not require a Notary Public to notarize a taxpayer ’s signature ?
Answer :
This question is one of the fastest ways to unravel the fraudulent nature of federal income taxes .
At 28 U.S.C. section 1746 , Congress authorized written verifications to be executed under penalty of perjury without the need for a Notary Public , i.e. to witness one ’s signature .
This statute identifies two different formats for such written verifications : ( 1 ) those executed outside the “ United States ” and ( 2 ) those executed inside the “ United States ” .
These two formats correspond to sections 1746 ( 1 ) and 1746 ( 2 ) , respectively .
What is extremely revealing in this statute is the format for verifications executed “ outside the United States ” .
In this latter format , the statute adds the qualifying phrase “ under the laws of the United States of America ” .
Clearly , the terms “ United States ” and “ United States of America ” are both used in this same statute .
They are not one and the same .
The former refers to the federal government -- in the U.S. Constitution and throughout most federal statutes .
The latter refers to the 50 States that are united by , and under , the U.S. Constitution .
28 U.S.C. 1746 is the only federal statute in all of Title 28 of the United States Code that utilizes the term “ United States of America ” , as such .
It is painfully if not immediately obvious , then , that verifications made under penalty of perjury are outside the “ United States ” ( read “ the federal zone ” ) if and when they are executed inside the 50 States of the Union ( read “ the State zone ” ) .
Likewise , verifications made under penalty of perjury are outside the 50 States of the Union , if and when they are executed inside the “ United States ” .
The format for signatures on Form 1040 is the one for verifications made inside the United States ( federal zone ) and outside the United States of America ( State zone ) .
17 .
Does the term “ United States ” have multiple legal meanings and , if so , what are they ?
Answer : Yes .
The term has several meanings .
The term " United States " may be used in any one of several senses . [ 1 ]
It may be merely the name of a sovereign occupying the position analogous to that of other sovereigns in the family of nations . [ 2 ]
It may designate the territory over which the sovereignty of the United States extends , or [ 3 ] it may be the collective name of the States which are united by and under the Constitution .
See Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt , 324 U.S. 652 ( 1945 ) [ bold emphasis , brackets and numbers added for clarity ] .
This is the very same definition that is found in Black ’s Law Dictionary , Sixth Edition .
The second of these three meanings refers to the federal zone and to Congress only when it is legislating in its municipal capacity .
For example , Congress is legislating in its municipal capacity whenever it creates a federal corporation , like the United States Postal Service .
It is terribly revealing of the manifold frauds discussed in these Answers , that the definition of “ United States ” has now been removed from the Seventh Edition of Black ’s Law Dictionary .
18 . Is the term “ income ” defined in the IRC and , if not , where is it defined ?
Answer : The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has already ruled that the term “ income ” is not defined anywhere in the IRC : “ The general term ‘ income ’ is not defined in the Internal Revenue Code . ” U.S. v. Ballard , 535 F.2d 400 , 404 ( 8th Circuit , 1976 ) .
Moreover , in Mark Eisner v. Myrtle H. Macomber , 252 U.S. 189 ( 1920 ) , the high Court told Congress it could not legislate any definition of “ income ” because that term was believed to be in the U.S. Constitution .
The Eisner case was predicated on the ratification of the 16th amendment , which would have introduced the term “ income ” into the U.S. Constitution for the very first time ( but only if that amendment had been properly ratified ) .
In Merchant 's Loan & Trust Co. v. Smietanka , 255 U.S. 509 ( 1921 ) , the high Court defined “ income ” to mean the profit or gain derived from corporate activities .
In that instance , the tax is a lawful excise tax imposed upon the corporate privilege of limited liability , i.e. the liabilities of a corporation do not reach its officers , employees , directors or stockholders .
19 .
What is municipal law , and are the IRC ’s income tax provisions municipal law , or not ?
Answer : Yes .
The IRC ’s income tax provisions are municipal law .
Municipal law is law that is enacted to govern the internal affairs of a sovereign State ; in legal circles , it is also known as Private International Law .
Under American
Law , it has a much wider meaning than the ordinances enacted by the governing body of a municipality , i.e. city council or county board of supervisors .
In fact , American legal encyclopedias define “ municipal ” to mean “ internal ” , and for this reason alone , the Internal Revenue Code is really a Municipal Revenue Code .
A mountain of additional evidence has now been assembled and published in the book “ The Federal Zone ” to prove that the IRC ’s income tax provisions are municipal law .
One of the most famous pieces of evidence is a letter from a Connecticut Congresswoman , summarizing the advice of legal experts employed by the Congressional Research Service and the Legislative Counsel .
Their advice confirmed that the meaning of “ State ” at IRC section 3121 (e ) is restricted to the named territories and possessions of D.C. , Guam , Virgin Islands , American Samoa , and Puerto Rico .
In other words , the term “ State ” in that statute , and in all similar federal statutes , includes ONLY the places expressly named , and no more .
20 .
What does it mean if my State is not mentioned in any of the federal income tax statutes ?
The general rule is that federal government powers must be expressed and enumerated .
For example , the U.S. Constitution is a grant of enumerated powers .
If a power is not enumerated in the U.S. Constitution , then Congress does not have any authority to exercise that power .
This rule is tersely expressed in the Ninth Amendment , in the Bill of Rights .
If California is not mentioned in any of the federal income tax statutes , then those statutes have no force or effect within that State .
This is also true of all 50 States .
Strictly speaking , the omission or exclusion of anyone or any thing from a federal statute can be used to infer that the omission or exclusion was intentional by Congress .
In Latin , this is tersely stated as follows : Inclusio unius est exclusio alterius .
In English , this phrase is literally translated :
In clusion of one thing is the ex clusion of all other things [ that are not mentioned ] .
This phrase can be found in any edition of Black ’s Law Dictionary ; it is a maxim of statutory construction .
The many different definitions of the term “ State ” that are found in federal laws are intentionally written to appear as if they include the 50 States PLUS the other places mentioned .
As the legal experts in Congress have now confirmed , this is NOT the correct way to interpret , or to construct , these statutes .
If a place is not mentioned , every American may correctly infer that the omission of that place from a federal statute was an intentional act of Congress .
Whenever it wants to do so , Congress knows how to define the term “ United States ” to mean the 50 States of the Union .
See IRC section 4612 ( a ) ( 4 ) ( A ) .
21 . In what other ways is the IRC deliberately vague , and what are the real implications for the average American ?
There are numerous other ways in which the IRC is deliberately vague .
The absence of any legal definition for the term “ income ” is a classic deception .
The IRS enforces the Code as a tax on everything that “ comes in , ” but nothing could be further from the truth .
“ Income ” is decidedly NOT everything that “ comes in . ”
More importantly , the fact that this vagueness is deliberate is sufficient grounds for concluding that the entire Code is null , void and unconstitutional , for violating our fundamental Right to know the nature and cause of any accusation , as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment in the Bill of Rights .
Whether the vagueness is deliberate or not , any statute is unconstitutionally void if it is vague .
If a statute is void for vagueness , the situation is the same as if it had never been enacted at all , and for this reason it can be ignored entirely .
22 . Has Title 26 of the United States Code ( “ U.S.C. ” ) ever been enacted into positive law , and what are the legal implications if Title 26 has not been enacted into positive law ?
Answer : No .
Another , less obvious case of deliberate deception is the statute at IRC section 7851 ( a ) ( 6 ) ( A ) , where it states that the provisions of subtitle F shall take effect on the day after the date of enactment of “ this title ” .
Because the term “ this title ” is not defined anywhere in 26 U.S.C. , least of all in the section dedicated to definitions , one is forced to look elsewhere for its meaning , or to derive its meaning from context .
Throughout Title 28 of the United States Code -- the laws which govern all the federal courts -- the term “ this title ” clearly refers to Title 28 .
This fact would tend to support a conclusion that “ this title ” , as that term is used in the IRC , refers to Title 26 of the United States Code .
However , Title 26 has never been enacted into positive law , as such .
Even though all federal judges may know the secret meaning of “ this title ” , they are men and women of UN common intelligence .
The U.S. Supreme Court ’s test for vagueness is violated whenever men and women of common intelligence must necessarily guess at the meaning and differ as to the application of a vague statute .
See Connally et al. v. General Construction Co. , 269 U.S. 385 , 391 ( 1926 ) .
Thus , federal judges are applying the wrong test for vagueness .
Accordingly , the provisions of subtitle F have never taken effect .
( “ F ” is for en F orcement ! )
This subtitle contains all of the enforcement statutes of the IRC , e.g. filing requirements , penalties for failure to file and tax evasion , grants of court jurisdiction over liens , levies and seizures , summons enforcement and so on .
In other words , the IRC is a big pile of Code without any teeth ; as such , it can impose no legal obligations upon anyone , not even people with dentures !
23 .
What federal courts are authorized to prosecute income tax crimes ?
This question must be addressed in view of the Answer to Question 22 above .
Although it may appear that certain statutes in the IRC grant original jurisdiction to federal district courts , to institute prosecutions of income tax crimes , none of the statutes found in subtitle F has ever taken effect .
For this reason , those statutes do not authorize the federal courts to do anything at all .
As always , appearances can be very deceiving .
Remember the Wizard of Oz or the mad tea party of Alice in Wonderland ?
On the other hand , the federal criminal Code at Title 18 , U.S.C. , does grant general authority to the District Courts of the United States ( “ DCUS ” ) to prosecute violations of the statutes found in that Code .
See 18 U.S.C. 3231 .
It is very important to appreciate the fact that these courts are not the same as the United States District Courts ( “ USDC ” ) .
The DCUS are constitutional courts that originate in Article III of the U.S. Constitution .
The USDC are territorial tribunals , or legislative courts , that originate in Article IV , Section 3 , Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution , also known as the Territory Clause .
This author ’s OPENING BRIEF to the Eighth Circuit on behalf of the Defendant in USA v. Gilbertson cites numerous court cases that have already clarified the all important distinction between these two classes of federal district courts .
For example , in Balzac v. Porto Rico , 258 U.S. 298 at 312 ( 1922 ) , the high Court held that the USDC belongs in the federal Territories .
This author ’s OPENING BRIEF to the Ninth Circuit in Mitchell v. AOL Time Warner , Inc. et al. develops this theme in even greater detail ; begin reading at section “ 7( e ) ” .
The USDC , as such , appear to lack any lawful authorities to prosecute income tax crimes .
The USDC are legislative tribunals where summary proceedings dominate .
For example , under the federal statute at 28 U.S.C. 1292 , the U.S. Courts of Appeal have no appellate jurisdiction to review interlocutory orders issued by the USDC .
Further details on this point are available in the Press Release entitled “ Private Attorney General Cracks Title 28 of the United States Code ” and dated November 26 , 2001 A.D .
24 .
Are federal judges required to pay income taxes on their pay , and what are the real implications if they do pay taxes on their pay ?
Answer : No. Federal judges who are appointed to preside on the District Courts of the United States –- the Article III constitutional courts –- are immune from any taxation of their pay , by constitutional mandate .
The fact that all federal judges are currently paying taxes on their pay is proof of undue influence by the IRS , posing as a duly authorized agency of the Executive Branch .
See Evans v. Gore , 253 U.S. 245 ( 1920 ) .
Even if the IRS were a lawful bureau or department within the U.S. Department of the Treasury ( which they are NOT ) , the existence of undue influence by the Executive Branch would violate the fundamental principle of Separation of Powers .
This principle , in theory , keeps the 3 branches of the federal government confined to their respective areas , and prevents any one branch from usurping the lawful powers that rightly belong to the other two branches .
The Separation of Powers principle is succinctly defined in Williams v. United States , 289 U.S. 553 ( 1933 ) ; however , in that decision the Supreme Court erred by defining “ Party ” to mean only Plaintiffs in Article III , contrary to the definition of “ Party ” that is found in Bouvier ’s Law Dictionary ( 1856 ) .
The federal judiciary , contemplated by the organic U.S. Constitution , was intended to be independent and unbiased .
These two qualities are the essence , or sine qua non of judicial power , i.e. without which there is nothing .
Undue influence obviously violates these two qualities .
See Evans v. Gore supra .
In Lord v. Kelley , 240 F.Supp. 167 , 169 ( 1965 ) , the federal judge in that case was honest enough to admit , in his published opinion , that federal judges routinely rule in favor of the IRS , because they fear the retaliation that might result from ruling against the IRS .
There you have it , from the horse ’s mouth !
In front of a class of law students at the University of Arizona in January of 1997 , Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist openly admitted that all federal judges are currently paying taxes on their judicial pay .
This writer was an eyewitness to that statement by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court -– the highest Court in the land .
Thus , all federal judges are now material witnesses to the practice of concealing the Withholding Exemption Certificate from them , when they were first hired as “ employees ” of the federal judiciary .
As material witnesses , they are thereby disqualified from presiding on all federal income tax cases .
25 . Can federal grand juries issue valid indictments against illegal tax protesters ?
Answer : No. Federal grand juries cannot issue valid indictments against illegal tax protesters .
Protest has never been illegal in America , because the First Amendment guarantees our fundamental Right to express our objections to any government actions , in written and in spoken words .
Strictly speaking , the term “ illegal ” cannot modify the noun “ protesters ” because to do so would constitute a violation of the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights , one of the most magnificent constitutional provisions ever written .
Accordingly , for the term “ illegal tax protester ” to survive this obvious constitutional challenge , the term “ illegal ” must modify the noun “ tax ” .
An illegal tax protester is , therefore , someone who is protesting an illegal tax .
Such an act of protest is protected by the First Amendment , and can not be a crime .
Protest is also recognized and honored by the Uniform Commercial Code ; the phrases “ under protest ” and “ without prejudice ” are sufficient to reserve all of one ’s fundamental Rights at law .
See U.C.C. 1-308 ( UCCA 1308 in California ) .
By the way , the federal U.C.C. is also municipal law .
See the Answer to Question 19 above , and 77 Stat. 630 , P.L. 88‑243 , December 30 , 1963 ( one month after President John F. Kennedy was murdered ) .
26 . Do IRS agents ever tamper with federal grand juries , and how is this routinely done ?
Answer : Yes .
IRS agents routinely tamper with federal grand juries , most often by misrepresenting themselves , under oath , as lawful employees and “ Special Agents ” of the federal government , and by misrepresenting the provisions of subtitle F as having any legal force or effect .
Such false representations of fact violate Section 43 ( a ) of the Lanham Act , uncodified at 15 U.S.C. 1125 ( a ) .
( Title 15 of the United States Code has not been enacted into positive law either . )
They tamper with grand juries by acting as if “ income ” is everything that “ comes in ” , when there is no such definition anywhere in the IRC .
Such false descriptions of fact also violate Section 43 ( a ) of the Lanham Act .
They tamper with grand juries by presenting documentary evidence which they had no authority to acquire , in the first instance , such as bank records .
Bank signature cards do not constitute competent waivers of their customers ’ fundamental Rights to privacy , as secured by the Fourth Amendment .
The high standard for waivers of fundamental Rights was established by the U.S. Supreme Court in Brady v. U.S. , 397 U.S. 742 , 748 ( 1970 ) .
IRS agents tamper with grand juries by creating and maintaining the false and fraudulent pretenses that the IRC is not vague , or that the income tax provisions have any legal force or effect inside the 50 States of the Union , when those provisions do not .
These are all forms of perjury , as well , and possibly also misprision of perjury by omission , i.e. serious federal offenses .
Finally , there is ample evidence that IRS agents bribe U.S. Attorneys , federal judges , and even the Office of the President with huge kickbacks , every time a criminal indictment is issued by a federal grand jury against an illegal tax protester .
( See the Answer to Question 25 above . )
These kick ‑backs range from $ 25,000 to $ 35,000 in CASH !
They also violate the Anti-Kickback Act of 1986 , which penalizes the payment of kickbacks from federal government subcontractors .
See 41 U.S.C. 8701 et seq .
As a trust domiciled in Puerto Rico , the IRS is , without a doubt , a federal government subcontractor that is subject to this Act. See 31 U.S.C. 1321(a ) ( 62 ) .
The systematic and premeditated pattern of racketeering by IRS employees also establishes probable cause to dismantle the IRS permanently for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act , first enacted in the year 1890 A.D. See 26 Stat. 209 ( 1890 ) ( uncodified at 15 U.S.C. 1 et seq . )
27 . What is “ The Kickback Racket , ” and where can I find evidence of its existence ?
The evidence of this “ kickback racket ” was first discovered in a table of delegation orders , on a page within the Internal Revenue Manual ( “ IRM ” ) -- the internal policy and procedure manual for all IRS employees .
Subsequently , this writer submitted a lawful request , under the Freedom of Information Act , for a certified list of all payments that had ever been made under color of these delegation orders in the IRM .
Mr. Mark L. Zolton , a tax law specialist within the Internal Revenue Service , responded on IRS letterhead , transmitted via U.S. Mail , that few records existed for these “ awards ” because most of them were paid in cash !
When this evidence was properly presented to a federal judge , who had been asked to enforce a federal grand jury subpoena against a small business in Arizona , he ended up obstructing all 28 pieces of U.S.
Mail we had transmitted to that grand jury .
Obstruction of correspondence is a serious federal offense , and federal judges have no authority whatsoever to intercept U.S. Mail .
See 18 U.S.C. 1702 .
Obviously , the federal judge -- John M. Roll -- did NOT want the grand jury in that case to know anything about these kickbacks .
They found out anyway , because of the manner in which this writer defended that small business , as its Vice President for Legal Affairs .
28 . Can the IRS levy bank accounts without a valid court order ?
Answer : No .
The Fifth Amendment prohibits all deprivations of life , liberty , or property without due process of law .
Due Process of Law is another honored and well developed feature of American constitutional practice .
Put simply , it requires Notice and Hearing before any property can be seized by any federal government employees , agents , departments or agencies .
A levy against a bank account is a forced seizure of property , i.e. the funds on deposit in that account .
No such seizure can occur unless due process of law has first run its course .
This means notice , hearing , and deliberate adjudication of all the pertinent issues of law and fact .
Only after this process has run its proper or “ due ” course , can a valid court order be issued .
The holding in U.S. v. O’Dell , 160 F.2d 304 ( 6th Cir. 1947 ) , makes it very clear that the IRS can only levy a bank account after first obtaining a Warrant of Distraint , or court ORDER .
And , of course , no court ORDER could ever be obtained unless all affected Parties had first enjoyed their “ day in court . ”
29 .
Do federal income tax revenues pay for any government services and , if so , which government services are funded by federal income taxes ?
Answer : No .
The money trail is very difficult to follow , in this instance , because the IRS is technically a trust with a domicile in Puerto Rico .
See 31 U.S.C. 1321(a ) ( 62 ) .
As such , their records are protected by laws which guarantee the privacy of trust records within that territorial jurisdiction , provided that the trust is not also violating the Sherman Antitrust Act .
They are technically not an “ agency ” of the federal government , as that term is defined in the Freedom of Information Act and in the Administrative Procedures Act .
The governments of the federal territories are expressly ex cluded from the definition of “ agency ” in those Acts of Congress .
See 5 U.S.C. 551( 1 ) ( C ) .
( See also the Answer to Question 5 above . )
All evidence indicates that they are a money laundry , extortion racket , and conspiracy to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity , in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1951 and 1961 et seq .
They appear to be laundering huge sums of money into foreign banks , mostly in Europe , and quite possibly into the Vatican .
See the national policy on money laundering at 31 U.S.C. 5341 .
The final report of the Grace Commission , convened under President Ronald Reagan , quietly admitted that none of the funds they collect from federal income taxes goes to pay for any federal government services .
The Grace Commission found that those funds were being used to pay for interest on the federal debt , and income transfer payments to beneficiaries of entitlement programs like federal pension plans .
30 .
How can the Freedom of Information Act ( “ FOIA ” ) help me to answer other key tax questions ?
The availability of correct information about federal government operations is fundamental to maintaining the freedom of the American People .
The Freedom of Information Act ( “ FOIA ” ) , at 5 U.S.C. 552 et seq. , was intended to make government documents available with a minimal amount of effort by the People .
As long as a document is not protected by one of the reasonable exemptions itemized in the FOIA , a requester need only submit a brief letter to the agency having custody of the requested document ( s ) .
If the requested document is not produced within 20 working days ( excluding weekends and federal holidays ) , the requester need only prepare a single appeal letter .
If the requested document is not produced within another 20 working days after the date of the appeal letter , the requester is automatically allowed to petition a District Court of the United States ( Article III DCUS , not the Article IV USDC ) -- to compel production of the requested document , and judicially to enjoin the improper withholding of same .
See 5 U.S.C. 552(a ) ( 4 ) ( B ) .
The general rule is that statutes conferring original jurisdiction on federal district courts must be strictly construed .
This writer has pioneered the application of the FOIA to request certified copies of statutes and regulations which should exist , but do not exist .
A typical request anyone can make , to which the U.S. Treasury has now fallen totally silent , is for a certified copy of all statutes which create a specific liability for taxes imposed by subtitle A of the IRC .
For example , see the FOIA request that this writer prepared for author Lynne Meredith .
Of course , by now we already know the answer to this question , before asking it .
( Good lawyers always know the answers to their questions , before asking them . )
It should also be clear that such a FOIA request should not be directed to the IRS , because they are not an “ agency ” as that term is defined at 5 U.S.C. 551( 1 ) ( C ) .
Address it instead to the Disclosure Officer , Disclosure Services , Room 1054 - MT , U.S. Department of the Treasury , Washington 20220 , District of Columbia , USA .
This is the format for “ foreign ” addresses , as explained in USPS Publication # 221 .
As James Madison once wrote , “ A popular government without popular information or the means of acquiring it , is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy or perhaps both .
Knowledge will forever govern ignorance , and a people who mean to be their own Governors , must arm themselves with the power knowledge gives . "
31 . Where can I find more information , and still protect my privacy ?
There are many civic organizations throughout America who have dedicated their precious time and energy to acquire and disseminate widely these documented truths about the Internal Revenue Service and the Internal Revenue Code .
The Internet ’s World Wide Web ( “ www ” ) is perhaps the best single source of information ( and disinformation ) about the IRS , and the major problems now confirmed in the IRC and in the mountains of related policies , procedures , practices , customs , rules , regulations , forms and schedules .
Learn to become a sophisticated consumer of information , and the knowledge you seek will be yours to keep and share -- with those you love and endeavor to free from this terrible plague that persists in America .
Good luck , and may God bless your earnest endeavors to ensure the blessings of Liberty for ourselves and our Posterity , as stated in the Preamble to the U.S. Constitution and in the Declaration of Independence .

The thinnest superconductor yet is a layer of copper oxide material less than a nanometre thick .
The feat suggests a new possible route to faster electronic components .
Making superconductors super - skinny raises the prospect of being able to switch them on and off using electric fields , says Ivan Bozovic at Brookhaven National Laboratories in Upton , New York .
That could allow them to be used in electronics , not just for carrying current from place to place .
“ Static electric fields cannot penetrate more than 1 nanometre into good conductors , ” explains Bozovic , whose team carried out the new study .
So a very thin superconductor indeed is needed to use electric fields in this way .
Rough experiments
Physicists have long disagreed whether it is even possible for superconductivity to exist in such tight spaces , he says .
Many have attempted to build very thin films from copper oxide - based materials called cuprates to find an answer .
But the roughness of the resulting films hampers their potential superconductive properties .
Advertisement
“ Our approach is different , ” says Bozovic .
His team created thicker films , but built them one atomic layer at a time .
They grew six layers of insulating lanthanum copper oxide , and above them six layers of metallic lanthanum - strontium copper oxide .
The way electrons leak between the two copper oxides spontaneously creates a superconducting layer somewhere within the stack , able to operate at the relatively high temperature of 32 kelvin ( - 241 °C ) – most superconductors work at even lower temperatures .
Superconductor in a haystack
The team made many versions of the superconducting layer cake with superconductor - suppressing zinc in different layers .
They were able to control the growth of each layer so finely that they could pinpoint the layer that was hiding the superconductivity .
Bozovic ’s team found that when they tainted the second lanthanum copper oxide layer in the stack , the critical temperature at which superconductivity could occur dropped from 32 kelvin to 18 kelvin – no such temperature drop was seen if any other layer was doped with zinc .
That proves that all of the “ high - temperature ” superconductivity traffic in the film takes place in a single copper oxide layer , says Bozovic .
Many thought high - temperature superconductivity would be unstable in a single copper oxide plane , “ now we know that ’s not the case ” .
The thin superconductor relies on other layers in the structure to feed it electrons .
But Bozovic says that in principle the same effect is possible in a single layer of the material if electric fields are used .
That could produce high - temperature superconductivity in a single copper - oxide layer just 0.66 nanometres thick .
Tour de force
Thomas Lemberger , a physicist at Ohio State University in Columbus who was not involved in the study , says that the work is a “ tour de force demonstration ” of precision atom handling and growth techniques .
Lemberger says it will be interesting to see if the new techniques can be applied to other materials .
“ If these growth techniques and device architectures could be ported to cuprates with higher [ operating superconductivity ] temperatures , then the impact could be tremendous . ”
Bozovic says his team will next try to fabricate a superconducting field - effect transistor using their cuprate material .
Although others have built such devices , they worked only at temperatures close to absolute zero .
He will also explore whether similar effects can be recorded in materials that have not previously been shown to be superconducting : “ that would really stir the research community ” .

Investor and philanthropist George Soros forecast in Budapest on Friday that China would emerge as a big winner of the global financial crisis .
Soros called on Chinese leaders to " rise to the occasion " and take an active role in the creation of a new multilateral financial order urgently required to reinvent the " broken international financial system . "
Soros also warned that " the worst financial crisis since WWII " may not be over .
The Hungarian - born billionaire sounded a pessimistic note throughout the week and said that those who believe the global economy is stabilizing are wrong .
In the last a week - long series of lectures on capitalism and the global financial crisis at the Central European University in the Hungarian capital , Soros spoke of disarray in the international financial system and confusion in the political arena .
Soros urged greater international cooperation and called for a reorganization of the world order to prevent a total breakdown .
" The total freedom of financial capital to move around internationally has proved to be a source of instability and needs to be curbed .
A new grand bargain is required , " he said , referring to the Bretton Woods conference at the end of WWII which led to the establishment of institutions such as the International Monetary Fund .
" Global markets need global regulations , but the regulations that are currently in force are rooted in the principle of national sovereignty .
A new multilateral system needs to be invented that would serve the interests of both the United States and China and of course the rest of the world , " he said .
" Such an institution could then decide how to treat financial institutions that are too big to fail and would consider new rules to control capital movements , " Soros said .
The reorganization of the prevailing world order should also extend beyond the financial system and involve the United Nations , especially membership of the Security Council , Soros argues , if progress is to be made in resolving issues like global warming and nuclear proliferation .
" The process needs to be initiated by the United States but China and other developing countries ought to participate in it as equals .
They are reluctant members of the Bretton Woods institutions which are dominated by countries that are no longer dominant .
The rising powers need to be present at the creation of the new order to ensure that they will be active members of it .
Hopefully the Chinese leadership will rise to the occasion .
It is no exaggeration to say that the future of the world depends on it . "
Soros believes in the long - term the United States stands to lose the most from the recent turmoil and China is poised to emerge as the greatest winner .
" In the United States , the crisis was an internally - generated event leading to the collapse of the financial system , while China was largely insulated from the financial crisis although there was an external shock to exports .
The new world order that will eventually emerge will not be dominated by the United States to the same extent as the old one .
China may be able to take its place to some extent , " Soros said .
It is also in China 's interests , however , to submit to a new multilateral system , according to Soros .
" In order to continue rising China must make itself more acceptable to the world , move towards a more open society , combining an increased measure of individual freedom with the rule of law . "
By all appearances , Rebecca Kuzelka used her home to operate a child day - care business on a quiet , tree - lined street in Lake Elsinore .
But a different picture of the 55 - year - old mother emerged after her home was rocked by an explosion late Wednesday night .
On Thursday morning , deputies arrested Kuzelka and her son Grey Kuzelka , 21 , on suspicion of using their home to make bombs and grow marijuana .
Another son , Benjamin Kuzelka , 23 , injured his hand in the explosion and was hospitalized .
Authorities said he would be arrested when he is released .
Around 11:30 p.m. Wednesday night , the Riverside County Sheriff ’s Department said , Benjamin Kuzelka was making an explosive device when it accidentally detonated , injuring his hand .

About 20 minutes later , the department said , Kuzelka showed up at a local hospital saying that he had accidentally shot himself .
“ His injuries were inconsistent with a gunshot wound and doctors called the police , ” said Deputy Melissa Nieburger , a department spokeswoman .
Deputies went to the Kuzelka home on a cul - de-sac in the 30500 block of Audelo Street .
Property records list Rebecca Kuzelka as the sole owner of the house , which was built in 1983 .
Inside the home , Nieburger said , deputies found materials used to make explosives and a sophisticated indoor marijuana growing room .
Authorities did not say how many marijuana plants were found in the home or disclose the type of explosive materials that were discovered .

A law enforcement source told The Times that substances found at the home were similar to acetone peroxide , or TATP , the type of powerful explosive used in the 2007 London subway terrorist bombings .
There was no evidence that the Lake Elsinore incident was related to terrorism , the source said .
Riverside County deputies , FBI investigators and agents with the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives took part in the investigation .
Authorities also detonated some of the explosives at the home .
“ It was really loud .
I thought it was thunder and was starting to storm , ” said Alma Coronado , who lives on the same street .
“ The windows started shaking . ”
Nieburger said deputies had not determined how many children Rebecca Kuzelka cared for at her home .

No children were present at the time of the explosion , authorities said .
Rebecca and Grey Kuzelka were booked on charges of manufacturing of explosives , cultivating marijuana and felony child endangerment , Nieburger said .

In the wake of Randy Couture 's defeat at the hands of PRIDE legend Antonio Rodrigo " Minotauro " Nogueira , there are a few topics of interest circulating among MMA fans as to what might happen next within the upper-echelon of the UFC 's heavyweight division .
Most notably , will the UFC remain steadfast on the idea of giving Cain Velasquez a shot at the winner between Brock Lesnar and Shane Carwin ?
Did Nogueira 's performance at UFC 102 help him raise his stock in potentially squeezing into title contention ?
Was Nogueira 's performance an improvement over his performance against Mir because he was injury - free , or is Frank Mir simply that much improved ?
To answer these questions , one would need to gauge how impressive Nogueira 's performance was on Saturday night .
After all , the UFC brass would still consider the younger , more explosive athletes in the division above an older fighter unless that older fighter happened to show spurts of his former self .
The latter is what would describe Nogueira 's performance against Randy Couture , and it was spectacular to watch for those of us who have seen the dominant Nogueira during his PRIDE reign .
What exactly was phenomenal about this bout ?
Most notably , Nogueira was much more nimble on his feet , and his boxing was as crisp as we 've seen it in the cage .
His length on the floor was used very effectively , and his Brazilian jiu - jitsu expertise worked to nullify anything Couture could muster on the floor while also putting himself into prime position to punish Couture .
Of course , a dominating performance can also have a strange effect on fan opinions .
Specifically , some fans have began to wonder whether it was Couture 's age finally catching up with him .
I would n't cling to that reasoning .
I would , however , believe that Nogueira was severely hindered by a staph infection and knee injury leading up to his bout with Frank Mir .
While Mir has already stated that he's " disheartened " at Joe Rogan 's comments during the UFC 102 main event regarding his bout with Nogueira and the injuries Nogueira sustained leading up to the fight , Rogan had a point and Mir needs to be reasonable .
A lot of fans would rather argue that all fighters show up hurt to fights , but as evident in his performance against Couture vs. his performance against Mir -- there is a significant difference in the challenge that Nogueira 's opponents actually face when he 's healthy .
An injury - free Nogueira was the sole reason why he was so dominating in his victory , and it'd be a tough sell for anyone to try to convince me that it was because Frank Mir improved in his striking game substantially .
While I believe Mir looked much better standing , it was evident that there were problems for Nogueira .
No head movement , a stumble in his step , and an almost lethargic trance to his movements could only signify a tired Nogueira who did n't get the training he needed and likely had something significantly wrong .
Nogueira should have pulled out of the fight , but the warrior inside him just would n't let fans down .
Now that Nogueira is back to getting the training he deserves and showing the fans a dominating performance against a very tough Randy Couture , what 's next for him ?
Nogueira 's future at the top really depends on how well he can maintain his current state of health .
Barring staph infection , knee injuries , cuts , and any other injury , I think the UFC should definitely slot Nogueira into a title contention role following the Carwin vs. Lesnar fight .
If Lesnar loses , push Nogueira into a title shot against Shane Carwin .
If Lesnar wins , put Nogueira into the title fight immediately .
This will allow Cain Velasquez to continue working to become a complete fighter , and it'll give him more time to build up the name that he could potentially become down the road for the UFC .
If Nogueira and Lesnar do meet in a championship title fight , can Nogueira actually contend with the much larger and stronger Lesnar ?
Nogueira contends that it 'll likely need to be a war of attrition in which he sticks and moves to avoid Lesnar 's power .
He 'll eventually tire out the behemoth on the feet , and in patented Nogueira form -- submit the giant in the late rounds .
Seems like a lot of wishful thinking on the Brazilian 's part , does n't it ?
While that gameplan could work , Nogueira seems to be forgetting one key element that Couture has publicly stated will always be a significant problem for his opponents , Lesnar 's reach .
If Nogueira intends to stand on the outside landing shots , he 'll undoubtedly need to wade in Lesnar 's reach .
One blast from one of his massive meathooks could spell disaster , so the chances of defeating Lesnar standing become slim .
Of course , Lesnar may simply overpower Nogueira on the ground and devastate him in quick fashion .
We wo n't really know the huge strength difference until the fight happens , but one thing is for certain -- Nogueira will want to stay as far away from Lesnar as he can .
Can he do it ?
Does the Brazilian submission master have one more David vs. Goliath match - up in him ?

“ I am disappointed in President Obama ’s decision to waive the “ revolving door ” provisions of the executive order for Mr. Bill Lynn , his nominee to serve as deputy secretary of defense , ” McCain said .
Lynn 's appointment still not settled
The Obama administration Friday waived its ethics rules to ease the nomination of former Raytheon lobbyist William Lynn as deputy defense secretary , but the matter is nowhere near settled .
And President Barack Obama ’s former campaign rival , Sen. John McCain ( Ariz . ) , could be the stopper .

Lynn ’s appointment to the No. 2 post at the Pentagon ran afoul of Obama ’s ethics pledge to bar lobbyists entering his administration from working on issues related to their former employers .
But the administration changed the rules to ease Lynn ’s nomination on Friday .
Noting the waiver “ removes an obstacle ” to the nomination , Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin ( D - Mich . ) said he looks “ forward to prompt consideration by the Senate . ”
Levin said the committee would insist that Lynn remove himself from any decisions regarding defense contractor Raytheon for the next year “ unless specifically authorized to participate by an appropriate ethics official . ”
But McCain , who eased debate about Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s nomination for secretary of state , still has his sights set on Lynn .
“ I am disappointed in President Obama ’s decision to waive the “ revolving door ” provisions of the executive order for Mr. Bill Lynn , his nominee to serve as deputy secretary of defense , ” McCain said .
“ While I applaud the president ’s action to implement new , more stringent ethical rules , I had hoped he would not find it necessary to waive them so soon . ”
McCain also said he wanted to ask Lynn to clarify what decisions would require him to step aside .
A committee vote on Lynn ’s nomination is not scheduled , but it meets again Tuesday , when Defense Secretary Robert Gates will testify .
The latest maneuvering over Lynn came amid growing calls for Lynn to withdraw .
On Thursday , the Project on Government Oversight asked Obama to withdraw the nomination .
And on Friday , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , the Government Accountability Project and Public Citizen signed a letter to Levin and McCain , the committee ’s ranking Republican .
Before the president ’s ethics policy was issued , Lynn ’s nomination would n’t have been questioned , the groups said .
But the president ’s new ethics rules changed all that , leading watchdog groups to “ believe that Mr. Lynn simply could not effectively serve as the deputy secretary of defense . ”
Stefan Passantino , a partner at the McKenna , Long & Aldridge law firm who has represented former House Speakers Rep. Dennis Hastert ( R - Ill . ) and Newt Gingrich ( R - Ga. ) , assessed the situation matter of factly .
“ Very often in Washington and in politics there are efforts to – make grand pronouncements reflecting a grand change in policy , ” Passantino said .
“ It ’s the common phenomenon of the law of good intentions running headlong into the law of unintended consequences . ”
A spectre is haunting Europe , but this time it is not the spectre of revolt by the popular masses , or even one of yet another wave of bank bailouts .
No , the spectre which is currently stalking the corridors of Europe ’s most prestigous institutions is one of a Spanish economy which stays on a flatline while Europe ’s other economies , one by one , start to struggle back to life .
And the main reason that this particular ghostly image is giving everyone so many sleepless nights is because Europe ’s current institutional structures , and especially the monetary policy tools available at the ECB are scarcely prepared for such a nighmare eventuality .
France Is Recovering , And The Rebound Is Robust
First it was just a rumour , then it was a possibility , and now it has become a reality – some of Europeâ€™s economies are springing back into life .
But only some .
It all began quietly , with a barely noticeable 0.3 % quarterly growth in French and German GDP in the second three months of this year .
France and Germany will have maintained their modest growth into the third quarter , while Italy has now joined them , leaving only Spain among the Eurozone big four , registering yet another quarter contraction , and , more importantly , showing no evident sign that an early return to normal activity is anywhere near to the horizon .
In fact Spanish gross domestic product fell 0.4 percent quarter on quarter in the third quarter following a 1.1 percent drop between April and June , according to the Bank of Spain monthly bulletin .
Spain ’s GDP also contracted 4.1 percent year on year in the quarter , after a contraction of 4.2 percent in the second three months .
‘ This is the least pronounced contraction since the beginning of the recession … and this improvement is linked to state - backed measures with a temporary effect , ’ the bank said .
To this government stimulus effect , I would also add the net trade effect which is being felt as a result of the strong fall in imports , and the consequent closing of the current account deficit .
With imports falling faster than exports ( on an annual basis ) the net impact is positive growth in the headline GDP number , and the Spanish CA deficit was closing very rapidly indeed in the third quarter ( see chart below ) .
The impact of the stimulus package can also be seen in the seasonally adjusted unemployment numbers supplied to Eurostat by the Spanish Statistics Office ( INE ) .
Unemployment ( which hit 19.3 % in September – see chart below ) has been rising continuously since mid 2007 , but the sharpest increases were registered during the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 .
It is very hard to see any real difference in the trend rate of increase between the second and third quarters of 2009 , and we should expect this trend job attrition rate to continue until it once more accelerates under the impact of either the government being unable to continue funding the stimulus , or the banking sector having a financial crisis ( possibly induced by someone being forced into trying to sell some of the housing units they are accumulating only to discover that there are no buyers , since the market is effectively dead ) .
Life , Unfortunately For Spain , Is Elsewhere
But for all our preoccupations growth in 2009 is now no longer the issue .
All eyes are gradually moving towards the outlook for 2010 , and it is here that those little red lights have suddenly started flashing over at the European Central Bank .
And the problem is a real and growing one , since according to a series of reports which have been published during the last week , while activity in the export dependent German economy remained very fragile , the French one has really starting to hum .
The first sign of this came on Tuesday , with the initial reading for the October Purchasing Manager Index which showed that while the Eurozone economy in general entered the fourth quarter on a strong note , with growth accelerating in both manufacturing and services sectors , the private sector in France started to earn alpha grades by clocking up a third successive month of accelerating growth , leaving us with the impression that France is now seeing its steepest output expansion in nearly three years .
Then on Wednesday the ECB presented its monthly bank lending data , which showed that lending to the euro area private sector shrank by an annualised 0.3 percent in September , the first such contraction since the series began in 1992 .
But looking a little more closely at a lending activity on a country by country basis , we find that while lending continues to contract in Spain , in France the credit cycle has turned , and indeed lending to households is now once more rising steadily ( see chart below ) , indeed it never fell below an annual 4 % rate of increase and the annualised quarterly growth rate in lending has been rising since the end of the first quarter .
That is to say , credit is once more starting to flow freely round the French economy , while here in Spain banks continue to accumulate reserves , lending generously to the government , while money for struggling small companies and for young people looking to buy homes is hard to find .
What is more , if we look at the chart below ( which was prepared by Dominique Barbet and Martine Borde for PNB Paribas ) we will see that the stock of unsold new homes â€ “ which was in any event never very high in France , maybe 100,000 in the spring â€ “ is down by 20 % as sales steadily pick up again , while here in Spain we continue to play a guessing game to decide just how many ( more than a million surely ) such properties there are here , and the number is growing , not declining , since real new sales to private individuals ( as opposed to newly completed properties contracted two years or so ago , or exchanges between developers and banks ) are almost non existent at this point .
Everyone knows prices will fall further , and are waiting for them to go down .
Then on Friday we had the key piece of information , which confirmed what many of us already suspected , since Markit PMI data for October retail sales made plain the presence of very divergent trends across the Eurozone , with ever more robust growth in France contrasting with falling sales in Germany and Italy .
As Jack Kennedy , economist at survey organisers Markit Economics said â€ œWhile the sense of growing optimism should be treated with some caution â€ “ it appears the increase in sales was also supported by widespread discounting and the continuation of the governmentâ€™s car scrappage scheme â€ “ the outperformance of France relative to Germany and Italy offers further evidence that it is France that is leading the Eurozone recovery.â€ 
And here , with this very outperformance comes the problem , since the ECB policy rate will be set to target average eurozone inflation , which will certainly be lower than inflation in France , and possibly significantly lower .
Which means the ECB policy rate will be below the one which the French economy will , in reality , need .
Between 2000 and 2008 the structural dynamics of the Eurosystem were different from now .
Spain was the “ exceptional student ” , with above - average growth , and inflation which was consistently over the Eurozone average , and for long periods above the ECB policy rate .
This had the consequence , of course , that French inflation was nearly always below the average .
Now things have changed .
We are coming out of recession with a eurozone divided into three groups .
French growth is becoming robust , while Germany and Italy are dependent on exports and just keeping their head above water .
Spain , on the other hand , fails to recover and continues to contract .
This is what makes the current situation critical , since starting in 2010 France will have an inflation rate over the EU average , and in all probability over the ECB interest rate .
Which means that if something is n’t done , and soon , to force the situation in Spain , and produce a recovery , France will have negative interest real rates during a sharp economic rebound , with all the risks that that implies .
Only last Wednesday Norway became the first western European country to raise interest rates since the start of the financial crisis after its central bank reported finding â€œsigns of renewed growthâ€ in the global economy .
Central bankers from across the global , from Washington , to Sydney , to Delhi and to Oslo are all now busily telling us they are going to take increasing account of future accelerations in asset prices in an attempt to avoid repeating policy mistakes that are presumed to have inflated two speculative bubbles in a decade â€ “ and left the entire Spanish economy in a lamentable state .
If France had its own monetary policy I have no doubt La Banque de France would be itching to follow the Norges Bank and raise rates , but there is one small problem , La Banque de France has no capacity to decide on monetary policy in this way , and herein lies the heart of what is now Europe and the ECBâ€™s greatest dilemma .

Abmahnungen für alte PR - Bilder von Sahra Wagenknecht Peter Mühlbauer
Nachdem die Linkspartei einer Fotografin kein zusätzliches Honorar zahlen wollte , will man nun Geld von Bloggern eintreiben
Dass das Abmahnen von Werken ein weitaus einträglicheres Geschäft sein kann als das Verkaufen , das ist nicht erst seit den von der Firma Digi Rights Solutions GmbH für ihre potentiellen Kunden angestellten Vergleichsrechnungen zwischen den Erträgen aus legalen und illegale Downloads bekannt .
Das Pärchen , das mit " Marions Kochbuch " Fotos von Leberkäs und anderen Speisen anbot , machte bereits vor Jahren einer größeren Öffentlichkeit klar , dass sich in Deutschland ausgesprochen fragwürdige neue Nutzungsformen des Urheberrechts etabliert haben und rapide weiter ausbreiten .
Wie der Ruhrbarone - Blogger David Schraven nun berichtet kam zu diesen Modellen vor einigen Wochen ein neues hinzu : Sein Blog wurde zusammen mit der Paderzeitung , dem Bund Soziales Zentrum Deutschland ( BSOZD ) und Xtranews wegen der Verwendung eines Portraits der Linkspartei - Abgeordneten Sahra Wagenknecht abgemahnt .
Ungewöhnlich an den verschickten Schreiben ist , dass sich die Empfänger per Unterlassungserklärung dazu verpflichten sollten , " Schadensersatz " in ungenannter Höhe zu leisten .
Dabei handelt es sich beim Streitgegenstand wohlgemerkt nicht um eine Fotografie , die irgendwo im Netz gefunden wurde .
Nein :
Sie wurde von der Linkspartei elf Jahre lang für Autogrammkarten und Wahlplakate verwendet , Presseerklärungen beigelegt , und explizit als " Pressefoto " gekennzeichnet zum Download bereitgestellt .
Entsprechend häufig findet sie sich im Web .
Aus diesem Grund sehen die Ruhrbarone - Macher David Schraven und Stefan Laurin auch keinen Anlass , den Forderungen des Anwalts nachzukommen .
Nachdem sie das Bild gelöscht haben , besteht kein Anlass zum Erlass einer einstweiligen Verfügung - und weil die behauptete Rechtsverletzung bereits lange zurückliegt , kann kaum mit Eilbedürftigkeit argumentiert werden .
Auch Peter Ritsche vom BSOZD wies die Forderung nach Zahlung von " Schadensersatz " in ungenannte Höhe und einem " Anwaltshonorar " in Höhe von 775,64 Euro zurück .
Einem möglichen Prozess , bei dem ihn der Urheberrechtsexperte Dr. Ralf Petring vertreten würde , sieht er nach eigenen Angaben " gelassen entgegen " .
Thomas Rodenbücher von Xtranews lässt es ebenfalls auf ein Gerichtsverfahren ankommen .
Der abmahnende Anwalt Ronald Schmidt kommt aus der Berliner Kanzlei Haupt und war für Telepolis bisher nicht erreichbar .
Dem Ruhrbarone - Autor David Schraven sagte er , dass ein Recht zur Verwendung des Fotos zur Werbezwecken nur für den Wahlkampf 1998 gegolten hätte .
Belege darüber lagen der Abmahnung allerdings nicht bei .
Angeblich stellte Schmidt seit Mai Forderungen in Höhe von bis zu 20.000 Euro an die PDS - Nachfolger , die darauf jedoch nicht eingingen , weshalb er nun Blogs abmahnen würde .
Diese könnten ja seine Forderungen begleichen und anschließend die Partei auf Erstattung verklagen .
Von Schraven darauf angesprochen , ob er die Blogger mit seinem Vorgehen erpressen oder auf die Linkspartei " hetzen " wolle , meinte Schmidt angeblich , er werde " auf diesem Niveau " nicht mit ihm diskutieren .
Ein sich ausweitender Schaden scheint für die Linke allerdings zweifellos gegeben : Vielerorts heißt es nach dem Bekanntwerden des Vorfalls , man wolle in Zukunft keine Fotos mehr von ihr benutzen - und auch entsprechend weniger über sie schreiben , sondern stattdessen mehr über die Piratenpartei , der Abmahnungen ein zentrales Anliegen sind .
Bei der Linkspartei ist dies bisher nicht der Fall .
Die kulturpolitische Sprecherin der Bundestagsfraktion , Lukrezia Jochimsen , spricht sich sogar ganz explizit gegen Bagatelleregelungen bei Urheberrechtsverletzungen aus , weil diese den " Respekt " vor dem " Geistigen Eigentum " mindern würden .
Linkspartei -Pressesprecherin Alrun Nüßlein konnte zwar telefonisch erreicht werden , teilte aber lediglich mit , sie sei " im Urlaub " und könne keine Stellungnahme abgeben .
Der von ihr als Vertreter genannte Hendrik Thalheim meinte , die Bundestagsfraktion habe keine Abmahnungen verschickt , womit die Sache für ihn erledigt sei .
Den Ruhrbaronen hatte der Linken - Landesverbandssprecher Ralf Michalowsky die Auskunft gegeben , das Blog würde " aus gutem Grund nicht [ im ] Mailverteiler " stehen und man frage sich , wie sie an die Pressemitteilungen gelangt seien .
Die jedoch sind auch auf der Linken - Website zu finden , wo jeder das Material abrufen kann .
Weiter sagte man Schraven , dass die Fotografin Helga Paris , die das Bild anfertigte , bereits bezahlt worden wäre : 1.400 Deutsche Mark erhielt sie angeblich für das Werk , hinter dem ein unbefangener Beobachter keine wochenlange Arbeit vermuten würde .
Sollte die Fotografin der PDS tatsächlich die Negative gegen ein durchaus nicht unangemessen niedrig erscheinendes Honorar überlassen haben und konnten diese dort 11 Jahre lang unbeanstandet verwendet werden , spricht einiges dafür , dass Paris die nun als fehlend bemängelten Rechte vollständig abgab .
Dies würde auch erklären , warum ihr Anwalt nicht gegen die mit einer Rechtsabteilung bestückte Partei vorgeht , sondern gegen Blogger , die sich Prozessaufwendungen zeitlich wie finanziell schlechter leisten können und Abmahnungen deshalb häufig zähneknirschend zahlen - auch wenn sie vermuten oder sogar genau wissen , dass sie im Recht sind .

NEW YORK – Despite Nintendo's emphasis on accessible gaming for newbies , the upcoming New Super Mario Bros .
Wii will be a challenge , says Shigeru Miyamoto .
" I think what we 've created this time is in fact pretty difficult , " said the legendary game designer , who added that attempting to create a game that would bring in new gamers but still " satisfy the needs of longtime Mario fans " was a taxing task for the development team at Nintendo .
In a Manhattan hotel on Thursday evening , Miyamoto showed off the fruits of the team 's labor .
Speaking through a translator with a group of journalists including Wired.com , he gave a demonstration of the new Mario , which will be released on Nov. 15 .
The full transcript of the event , including a roundtable Q&A session , is below .
Among other topics , Miyamoto talks about why the game does n't include online multiplayer , whether its helpful Super Guide system could be applied to the next Wii Zelda game , the possibility of user - generated Mario levels and the real reason why Princess Peach is n't a playable character in New Super Mario Bros .
Wii .
Shigeru Miyamoto : I 'd like to take advantage of what limited time we have .
So I wo n't be answering any questions about Zelda ( laughs ) .
Miyamoto on Wii Fit Plus
Just to give a little bit of background on Wii Fit Plus , I think it can be said possibly for * Wii Fit Plus* , but for any kind of exercise – most people tend to start very enthusiastically , but then find they have a hard time continuing to maintain it and keep it regularly .
Even myself , when I work out at the gym , I always find that the first five minutes of the workout feels very long .
But as you get in your rhythm and keep at it , before you know it , forty minutes or an hour has passed .
And of course , I 'm sure there are times when you go home at the end of the day and you think , " Man , I 'd like to work out , but I 've only got 15 minutes , and I do n't even know where to start or what to try to squeeze in . "
With some of these thoughts in mind , we tried to think of different ways we can make * Wii Fit * a little bit more convenient and easier for people to use .
Even with the original Wii Fit , we tried to streamline the experience as much as possible , even going so far as to build in a * Wii Fit * channel that would reside on your Wii so that you can go in and just weigh yourself anytime you wanted very quickly .
But even then , the original Wii Fit still took time :
You had to start it up , it took time to choose the individual activities from the menu , so we wanted to try and improve that experience .
We looked at some other areas that we could improve in the software as well .
We consulted even with university professors to get some of their feedback on how the software could be used .
We included a new system for estimating calories that 's based on the metabolic equivalent .
And then by calculating the estimated number of calories that you 're burning when you 're working out , we 're also able to equate certain calorie amounts to certain foods , and people can get an idea of what they 've burned off during the workout .
So it gives you a good idea of how much exercise it takes to burn off a piece of cake .
With * Wii Fit Plus , * we added some more sportslike elements to it , including the golf game that takes into account the balance and movement of your body as you swing your Wii remote golf club on the balance board .
And for that , we also consulted with professional golf teams .
And in the process of creating Wii Fit Plus , because it is a game , we also included a few new exercises and yoga activities as well as fun , new balance games such as the ones that have you flapping your arms to fly .
Of course , in my house , we consider our dog a member of the family , so while it was n't possible to weigh your dog in the previous version , when you saw all the members of your family line up on that main title screen , it always left me kind of sad that there was n't a dog there to represent my dog , so we added that feature .
Also , cats too .
But there wo n't be a Nintencats ( laughs ) .
The idea behind it was n't so much to create an entire new experience , it was really more about finding ways to improve what had been done with * Wii Fit * but also improve the streamlined experience itself , rather than releasing it as a full sequel .
Instead , we looked at it as an upgrade version for people who had already bought the original * Wii Fit * and decided to offer it at a very low price .
That 's all I wanted to share with you about * Wii Fit , * and now we can move on to Mario .
Miyamoto on New Super Mario Bros .
Wii :
Of course , I talked about *
Wii Fit and how we gave a lot of consideration to how a device like that might be used in a living room setting .
We actually did the same thing for New Super Mario Bros .
Wii .
* The premise was that because it 's going to be on Wii console , and it's a console for the most part that resides in the living room that everybody in the house interacts with .
We needed to design the game in a way that would be appropriate for that .
Now of course the game itself stems from the original Mario Bros. , which is the design on my T - shirt today , and interestingly enough , that game was the original concept was that the Mario Bros.
games would be games that people always played together .
But of course , the Super Mario Bros. series turned into more of a single - player game , and with the launch of the DS hardware and the broad audience of that hardware drew in , one of the things that we tried to achieve with New Super Mario Bros .
on the DS was a side - scrolling * Mario * game that had a balance of level difficulty that would be easy for some of the newer gamers that first joined video games on the DS hardware , but would still satisfy the needs of longtime * Mario * fans .
But we found in making that game that doing that was actually difficult .
In fact , I remember at the roundtable at E3 this year , somebody asked , " Is * New Super Mario Bros .
Wii * going to be as easy as * Super Mario Bros. * was on DS ? "
But I think what we 've created this time is in fact pretty difficult .
Of course because it has multiplayer , it has some new facets in the sense that more advanced gamers can take care of novice gamers that might be playing with them and carry them through the level .
We 've also introduced a guide system that we 'll be showing ( later in the presentation ) .
We feel that this time around , we 've really managed to create a gameplay system that people at very disparate skill levels can easily play together and enjoy .
At E3 we did a simple introduction of the features in * New Super Mario Bros. Wii. *
So to do kind of a more detailed introduction to the game :
It 's a full * Mario * game with a complete story mode that starts at World 1 and goes to World 8 .
And you can play the story mode single - player all the way through from beginning to end , and at any point along the way , you can add players from the world map and have up to four players cooperate to complete the levels .
And beyond that , there are two dedicated multiplayer modes , one of which is free - for - all , which lets you select the stages from story mode in a menu - based system with images from each stage so you can easily find the stage you like .
And then there 's also a coin battle mode which is a competitive multiplayer mode , in which you 're actually competing for points and you 're getting ranked based on how many points you 've collected .
The free - for - all mode has kind of a similar feel to something like Mario Kart where you just happen to have four people over and you want to sit down and play a quick match in your favorite level , and so you can use that to jump in .
And the levels that you cleared in the story mode unlock as you work your way through the story mode .
I would say that they all become available in free - for - all mode .
The coin battle mode is a different structure .
In the free - for - all mode you earn points and collect points , and the points you earn are based on things you stomp and things like that .
Coin battle is based strictly on the number of coins that you get .
So it 's very close to the original concept of the original Mario Bros .
The thing that I think is very interesting about the free - for - all mode is that you can play the same level over and over again , and your experience in that level can vary dramatically depending on which group of people you happen to be playing with .
Of course , in the process of creating a game , we 'll often bring people in to test it out and get their feedback , and we did that for both single - player mode and multiplayer mode .
And in both cases , people would play the game , fill out the survey , and in both cases everybody said , " Wow , the game is really fun . "
But what we noticed in watching people play the game , is when people were playing alone , they had a very serious look on their face , and they were working very hard trying to figure out their way through the level .
And it was a very big challenge for them .
And as soon as we had multiple people playing the game , their expressions changed dramatically , and all of sudden , they had smiles on their faces , they were talking and jabbering back and forth and having a lot of fun playing the game that way .
Miyamoto demonstrates the map screen of New Super Mario Bros .
Wii
So we 're about to go into World 1 - 4 .
Similar to the system in Mario 3 , before we enter the level , you can use an item to power up the players .
So here we 're going to use the penguin suit because this is an underwater course and the penguin suit is actually well - suited to underwater levels .
It helps you swim much easier .
Here we have the ice flower .
The penguin suit can also shoot ice balls .
Both the ice flower and penguin suit create these ice blocks that float up along the top of the water and you then use as platforms .
You can also use the ice blocks to get you to areas you could n't otherwise reach .
As you can see the game 's not easy .
So we 'll drop out of this level here ...
That was a very bad demo .
So obviously you can see if you 're very good at the game , you can play at a very high skill level , and if you 're not very good at the game , you give bad demos .
( laughs )
Super Guide
So this is World 1 - 1 , but what you see here is the Super Guide block .
As I mentioned before , there is a help mode in the game called Super Guide .
And what happens is , after you die eight times in a level , this block will appear ( at the beginning of the level ) .
So you 're playing at home , and maybe you 're not as experienced in Mario games as some people , and you die many times in a level , this block will appear and you can choose to activate the Super Guide .
So the walkthrough is after you die eight times in one level , and then when activated , you see a video of Luigi running through the level that you 're on .
This is World 1 - 1 , so in this case , the Super Guide is really acting as kind the most basic instruction manual for how to play the game .
So here it shows you you can hit the block 10 times to get 10 coins and five more will pop out .
It also shows that the shells can be used to pick up coins .
Here it shows you how to slide down the slope and find some hidden items .
And at any point in watching the video , you can also pause the game and take control .
So now I am in control of Luigi .
What the Super Guide is n't showing is the secret areas or how to get the star coins and things like that .
It 's really just showing the most basic way for novice players to try to get through each level .
The other elements you still have to find yourself .
So then on your own , you can explore some of these other hidden areas .
So after , say , you 've let the entire video play , it will give you the option to then clear the level on your own or if you just wanted to use the video to get past the hardest parts , then you can use that and simply continue on to the next level .
Then you can see that there 's a little Toad icon here .
In these levels , there 's actually a Toad here in the level and you can try to carry him through the level , so there are additional bonuses beyond simply playing the game itself .
I mentioned that if you die eight times in one level , the Super Guide block will appear , I found that when I play and when it does appear , I somehow feel regretful and guilty that I let that happen .
( laughs )
So I 've found that when that happens , it kind of inspires me : " I 've already done this bad , now I definitely have to do this level on my own . "
People who clear every level without ever having a Super Guide block appear will get a little something special on the title screen of the game .
There are different stars that you can receive on the title screen depending on what you 've done in the game , and that 's one of them .
As long as we 're talking about things that you can unlock :
As you go through the game there are three star coins in every level .
As you collect the star points , you can then use the star coins to unlock additional movies that are also created using a system similar to the Super Guide system .
These are called Hint Movies .
And these Hint Movies will show the highest level of gameplay that our own internal testers and developers have been able to achieve in New Super Mario Bros .
Wii .
And they show things like super skills and infinite one - ups and secret goals as well as the locations of star coins and things like that .
So we actually have a video that 's pieced together from these Hint Movies showing some of the super play of our own testers and developers that we'd like to show .
( Miyamoto narrates as the movie plays )
This is Mini -Mario .
As you can see , Mini -Mario is spinning through the level without touching the ground .
This one is two players never stopping ( jumping on countless Bullet Bills ) .
They make it look like it 's so easy .
( laughs )
So the super players on our test team put a lot of these together .
The idea is , when you go through and you unlock all of these Hint Movies , they 'll give you ideas about what you might want to try in the game , and might inspire you to become a super player yourself .
And now we 're going to show you one of my personal favorites .
This is a level that features Yoshi .
As you can see here , Luigi is pretty much doing nothing and the other three players are supporting him in his effort to do nothing but reach the end of the level .
Luigi somehow manages to get all the special items .
( laughs )
You can also see he started with four lives and now he has five already .
As you can see , there are a lot of different ways you can play Super Mario Bros Wii .
The American version of New Super Mario Bros .
Coin Battle Mode
Coin Battle does use the levels from the Story mode as well , but it also has five dedicated levels that are exclusive to that mode .
In Coin Battle , the levels from the story mode do have different coin placement .
Elsewhere in the game , if you 've played a bunch , you may have encountered these outlined coins that you have to pass through the outline once before the coin appears .
The Coin Battle mode uses those quite a bit , which means that being first and running through the level is n't necessarily the best thing because oftentimes you 'll run through them all and the person behind you will get them .
So you can do Coin Battle in all 80 levels of the game , but you also have these five dedicated levels only in the Coin Battle mode .
I think it's a* Mario * game that offers a variety of different ways to play it , and I think it 's one for any skill level so hopefully all of you will be able to get a chance to spend some time with it and enjoy it .
This is the packaging that we 're showing here today for the first time .
As you can see , it 's the first all - red Wii case .
And the American version has a nice special foil stamp over the Wii logo .
In Japan , it 's just white ( laughs ) .
We do have this nice special box for you so we hope you all take advantage of it , and rush out and buy the game .
Q&A
Leigh Alexander , Gamasutra :
So we have a couple of decades of evolution and iteration on the Mario series , but this is the first one in as long as I can remember that looks so much like the original .
So I wanted to know why you thought it was important to the series ' roots and develop a Mario game that was a modern one and that looks like the ones that I grew up with .
__Miyamoto : __That 's probably two things , and one is we wanted the game to really appeal to and be accessible to as wide an audience as possible .
And the second was because we wanted to make it multiplayer , we really felt that the original concept for * Mario Bros .
* was the one best suited to do that .
Jamin Brophy - Warren , Wall Street Journal :
When I played this at E3 , I played with a guy who was really mean the entire time .
He kept jumping on my head as I jumped over pits and over enemies .
I wanted to know , were you ever frustrated when you played the game with people who did n't play the game the " fair " way ?
Miyamoto : I did n't really encounter any frustrating experiences like that because I found that even in levels that were particularly difficult , when somebody did that to me , then I could just float along in the bubble and basically let them guide me through the level .
Particularly , if someone 's a novice player , they can still get to see the level that way and maybe get out of the bubble at the end , and essentially finish the level .
So it did n't really frustrate me all that much .
Andrew Yoon , Joystiq :
So multiplayer is obviously very important in this , but there 's no online multiplayer at all .
I was wondering if ... do you have an interest in pursuing the Internet in any way in gameplay or something new in the future ?
Miyamoto :
Well , of course , we have made games like Smash Bros. and Mario Kart , we do have an interest in ... taking advantage of network devices .
I think that particularly with this kind of a Mario game , we really wanted to focus on the living room experience .
We could have made an online multiplayer * Mario * game , but if you do that , the effort and resources you devote to putting a game like that online will then result in you essentially balancing out the resources .
That means you 're going to have to sacrifice something somewhere else in the game in order to include an element like that .
This time , we really wanted to focus on the living room element and people playing together .
As I mentioned before , from our focus testing we found that when people were playing alone , they were very serious , and when they were playing together in the same room , they all had smiles on their faces and were talking back and forth .
We felt that this type of experience was just better suited to a same room , face - to - face multiplayer experience , rather than over the Internet .
That being said , of course , in the future there 's definitely a possibility for exploring what can be done with remote connected gameplay .
Craig Harris , IGN : Is there any particular reason why you went the retail route for * New Super Mario Bros .
Wii * and not a digital download on WiiWare ?
Miyamoto :
My perspective right now is that the business overall is still very much a package - based business .
And personally , for me , I 'm the kind of person who likes to have a physical object rather than a digital product .
I prefer to have something physical that I can hold in my hand , particularly when it's a nice red package like this .
( laughs )
Chris Grant , Joystiq : The Star system you mentioned ... it sounds a lot like what the other guys are doing with Achievements and Trophies .
So a ) do you think they 're similar , and b ) do you have any interest in platform - wide Achievements or Trophies or Stars on Wii and what do you think of that kind of Achievement system in general ?
Miyamoto :
The first thing I have to say is that I 'm not particularly well - versed in the Xbox 360 Achievement system , as I spend most of my time working on my own games .
I do n't have a lot of time to look at what other people are doing .
In this particular case , I mean the idea of playing the game in a particular way and having that result in kind of a special prize or something that rewards you , is something that we 've been doing for years with the * Mario* games .
So this to me just felt like an extension of that .
I do n't necessarily think that we would require people to apply that system to every game that is made , but it just seems like something we 've been doing for the last 15 or 20 years .
N'Gai Croal , Fast Company :
Where were you when you heard Captain Lou Albano passed away and what was your reaction ?
Miyamoto :
You 're the one who just told me ( group laughs ) .
Following the Q&A , journalists played
Chris Buffa , AOL GameDaily :
So it always seems like you have your hand in so many projects at once .
How do you make sure that all the stuff gets done on time , and what are some of your work philosophies , but also bad habits ?
Miyamoto :
As far as what I do to make sure that titles do n't get behind schedule , essentially , all my titles end up getting behind schedule at some point so there 's really nothing I can say about that ( laughs ) .
But what I can say that we do with our development is ... as the technologies advance , the graphics have become obviously much more beautiful than they used to be .
And the sound in games is much more advanced than it used to be .
And both of those are elements that require a great deal of resources to create .
I think a lot of times people will try to put all of the graphics in and put all of the sound into a game , and then evaluate the game at that point .
What we really try to focus on is the framework or the skeleton of the game .
If there are elements that absolutely have to have sound in order for us to make a determination as to whether or not they affect the gameplay elements , we will include the sound in those elements .
If there are elements that absolutely have to have the graphics , we will include those graphics , but we wo n't complete the sound or the graphics for the entire game .
Instead , what we do is we look strictly at the skeleton framework of what the interactive experience is .
And it's when we run into issues with the specific framework or the specific skeleton that forms the core of the game .
When we find that that 's not going to be a compelling experience , that 's when I tend to upend the tea table .
And so that generally happens before all of the effort has been put in on the graphics and the sound .
That 's the one thing that we do that I feel is important to help us keep on track .
And then I generally get very deeply involved in individual projects in the later stages as they 're really refining the level design and polishing the game .
And in terms of my bad habits in development , I would say that it 's probably commonly considered within Nintendo that my bad habit , even when the programmers are telling me , " We can't change the program anymore , we have to stop , " I keep telling them to make changes to make things better ( laughs ) .
So my job is really to seduce the programmers into doing what I want them to do ( laughs ) .
Joystiq : I do n't know if you 've had a chance to play LittleBigPlanet , but lots of people make * Mario* levels in that game .
So there 's an obvious interest for users to make their own * Mario * levels .
Do you see maybe opening up a creation tool to the community in the future ?
Miyamoto :
That is an area that I have a lot of interest in and I think that the side - scrolling Mario games in particular are very well - suited for that type of thing .
So of course the Mario vs. Donkey Kong series is one that 's made in North America by ( Nintendo Software Technology ) , but it 's one I 've been involved in .
And from early on , we did have a lot of discussions about how enable that type of level creation .
And of course , more recently on the DSi we have * Flipnote Studio* , which is another utility or tool type of software that lets users create and share with others .
And I think that those types of interactive experiences are going to continue to broaden and we 'll see a lot more user - generated content moving forward .
And I 've always had an interest in those types of creative tools so I 'd definitely be open to that sometime in the future .
Chris Plante , UGO :
The game has many references to a lot of the previous * Mario* games .
The coin collect mode actually reminds me of the GameBoy Color Super Mario Bros .
Deluxe , the King Koopa design from the SNES and the coin collect mode that we saw from the original Mario Bros .
I was curious if this was sort of a Best of Mario or Mario's Greatest Hits for you , and also if there are references that you have n't shown yet that you 'd like to talk about .
Miyamoto :
We 've actually collected a lot of different elements from a lot of different * Mario * games and one of the things that we like to do is – obviously , there are a lot of fans out there that have a lot of favorite elements in Mario games , and we want to try and make them happy and bring back some of the favorites from the past .
But I do n't know everything that we have and have n't shown at this point , so it 's hard for me to think as to whether or not there are any more in there that we can share .
But as you pointed out , the Coin Battle mode is definitely an homage back to the original two - player Mario Bros.
game , and there are a lot of elements that we 've brought together from the past games .
The main feature , of course , this time is the multiplayer and trying to really use that while taking advantage of some of the older features and really having the multiplayer element play them up in new ways .
I guess there are two things , one that I can talk about and one that I can't go into detail on .
One of the five Coin Battle stages is kind of a parody slash almost alternate reality , I guess , of the original Mario 1 - 1 world .
If you 've played a Mario game and you think you know what that World will look like , when you play it in the coin battle game , you will be very surprised .
And then another one , I 'm not supposed to talk about , is the final boss at the end of World 8 , I think is something that will feel fresh and new but at the same time feel very much like a parody of a past game .
James Brightman , IndustryGamers : I was wondering , obviously everyone expects this game to do well here , but the Japanese video game industry has been on the decline in the past couple of years .
Does that concern you at all ?
And what do you think the main problem is for the Japanese market ?
Miyamoto : I think it 's not simply a matter of nothing is selling in Japan anymore , particularly if you look at *
New Super Mario Bros. * on the DS .
I think we sold through about five million copies of that game in the Japanese market alone , and in fact , the Japanese sell - through had been stronger than the sell - through in both North America and Europe until very recently .
And that was part of the factor of how strong the DS business was in Japan at that time .
I think another really good example that 's really more recent is * Dragon Quest IX * on the DS in Japan , which probably at this point has already sold through , I would guess , more than three million in a short period of time .
So I think what we 're seeing in the Japanese market is not that the market as a whole is suffering .
We 're still seeing that high - quality titles are still doing very well .
But I think perhaps what 's changed is , while in the past other titles would perform adequately , now some of the other titles are maybe not performing as well .
Scott Stein , C|NET : As you said , this is the first time you 've , for a home console , explored side - scrolling * Mario * game after some 3 - D work that you 've done .
You had some ideas of things that you wanted to incorporate , but were there any revelations or surprises that you did n't expect in approaching that type of game design again ?
Miyamoto :
It 's kind of hard for me to remember , but one of the big surprises was probably the multiplayer .
And particularly , we found in focus testing that there are players out there who when they 're playing multiplayer * Mario * with other people , can have a really good time without really doing much of anything .
I can't think of any other examples right now .

Wired.com :
What do you say to people who think the Super Guide is sort of cheating , and do you think the Super Guide can be applied to different types of Nintendo games , like * Zelda * for instance ?
Miyamoto : I think that a lot of times people will buy a video game and if they can play through the end , they 'll play through the end but some people will buy a strategy guide or go online .
And what we 've done here is essentially try to include some of those features within the game itself , but I think with a feature like this , we were able to create it for * New Super Mario Bros .
Wii* because from the outset , we intended to try to develop this type of system and include it in this game .
Depending on what the priorities are for other titles , it may or may not be included .
We can't really promise if it 's going to be a part of every game moving forward .
But at the same time , I also think that there are some types of gameplay that are suited to a system like Super Guide that can potentially help people through the game .
And there are some types of gameplay that really are n't .
So we 'll probably evaluate each title individually and try to determine which ones are best suited for the system .
And of course , even just using a game like *
Legend of Zelda * as an example of trying to apply a system like this , it brings up a Pandora 's Box of questions in terms of , do we show people how to solve the puzzles ?
How much of the puzzle do we show them solved in order to help them understand the puzzle ?
Or are there puzzles in the game where they have to show the entire solution to in order for some people to understand it ?
So it can be a difficult system to apply to some games .
But we do see some value in it , and we 'll look at different titles individually to see how it can be applied .
Nick Chester , Destructoid : Something like * Wii Fit * is very successful , but when it was first introduced , I think people were scratching their heads , and ultimately it was this huge success .
But were there any products that you 've designed internally at Nintendo that you released and were surprised by the reaction , whether it be negative or positive ?
Miyamoto : I do n't really remember if there 's anything that truly surprised me with the reactions , but one thing I do think that there will still be some possibility with is Wii Music .
Chester :
You think in the future you may do something to iterate on that to maybe make it more successful than it was ?
Miyamoto : I think that the development team members on * Wii Music * were maybe a little bit shocked by the reaction and hoped that it would get a better response than it did .
So I think if we were to do anything it would be a matter of getting back together with them and trying to understand what their expectations were and where the gap was between their expectations and what the resulting product was .
And we 've talked about it , but it is n't anything that 's concrete at this point .
The thing that 's interesting about Wii Music is that there are people who are very versed in music and they play the game , and the evaluation of it very high , but at the same time there are a lot of people who play it and they do n't have a very good opinion of it .
So the gap between the positives and the negatives seems to be pretty big , which is interesting .
Jason Cipriano , mtvU : Mario 64 pretty much revolutionized 3 - D gaming and changed the direction of many games that came after it .
Do you think that there 's been sort of a 2 - D renaissance lately , particularly on the Wii , led by * New Super Mario Bros .*?
And if so , do you think it 's the developers working within the capabilities of the Wii or is it driven by the players who want a 2 - D style game ?
Miyamoto : I do n't think everything necessarily needs to be in 3 - D , or that just because we 're seeing more 2 - D games now ( that ) everything 's necessarily going to suddenly shift and go back to 2 - D. Instead , I think maybe what 's going on is people are realizing the benefits of a 3 - D game , and I think at the same time , I think people are remembering what the benefits of a 2 - D game were .
And in particular , with a game like * New Super Mario Bros .
Wii* , I think when you 're looking at the multiplayer in this game , the multiplayer platforming I think is much better suited to a 2 - D environment than a 3 - D one .
I think that people probably going forward , at least on the development side , look at what their objectives of their games are and make the decisions based on the experience they have now and what the benefits are of each style .
But I think to really make the decision to go 2 - D , you have to have the courage to not be so attached to the visual appearance of the game .
And really be kind of pursuing more the gameplay experience .
Because if you 're concerned about how the game will be viewed because of its visual appearance , then obviously everybody 's going to go more into 3 - D and a more graphically impressive type of project .
So you do have to have the courage to determine what your priorities are and where you want to put your focus .
Elise Vogel , Crispy Gamer :
The words that come up when you talk about this game and also with Wii Music and Wii Fit are " interactive experience , " as opposed to just a traditional game , the response of people playing in the room together as opposed to the different gameplay elements that are creating that experience .
And I 'm wondering if the games are maybe being received differently because we have a different perception of what games or interactive experiences should be , and if you created this game with the experience of people all together in a room in mind , and brought it to Super Mario Bros .
or if you thought , " I 've got * Super Mario Bros .
* and I want to create this experience " ?
It 's a complicated question .
Miyamoto :
It is a complicated question .
I think that probably a good way to describe it is particularly with this title , ( we ) asked ourselves : Understanding the Wii hardware and who interacts with the Wii hardware , what type of a Mario game should we make for the Wii console ?
And the answer to that question :
We have our ideas of what a Wii game should be .
And when it came to the * Mario * universe , we really had two answers .
One was Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 , and the other one was * New Super Mario Bros .
Wii* .
We had a team in Tokyo and a team in Kyoto that both started working on these games , and obviously , the two games have very different visions , in terms of what they are , and what they were from the outset .
But ultimately , they 're both different answers to the question of " What should a Mario game be on the Wii console ? "
Tom Holoien , Nintendo Power :
What elements would you say a Mario game has to have whether it 's 2 - D or 3 - D , and for you personally , what makes a * Mario * game a Mario game besides the characters ?
Miyamoto :
So to me , what 's really important about a Mario game is that it be simple to control and easy to understand .
And that when you as the player is playing the game , the physics in the game are understandable to you , so that when you hold the controller , you play it in a way that you understand what you 're supposed to do , you understand the environment , and then you begin to unleash your own gameplay creativity .
You try different things .
The response that you get from the environment into what you attempted to do in the world feels natural to you , and ultimately the game itself becomes kind of a back and forth between us the developers in trying to expect what types of creative things you might try to do as a player and you the player in terms of the response that you 're expecting to get in the game .
And to me , a Mario game is really unleashing the player 's creativity within the world that you 've created .
As we showed you in the game , there 's this ice flower and the penguin suit and both of those shoot ice balls .
And so , in developing the game , it 's easy to say , " Okay , we want the ice balls to freeze enemies . "
But as soon as you make that decision , a number of different questions come up .
If you freeze the enemy , what happens to it then ?
If the enemy is in the air , does the ice hang in the air or does it fall out of the air ?
If it falls out of the air , what happens when it hits the ground ?
Does it rest on the ground ?
How long should it take before it falls out of the air after you 've frozen it ?
If it 's sitting in the air , can we jump on it ?
Should you be able to jump on it before it falls ?
When it falls from a certain height , should it just land or should it break ?
When you 're in the water and you freeze an enemy , as we showed in the demo today , the expectation is that , well you 've just turned something into ice , does n't ice float ?
Should n't ice float up ?
And then that brings the question , if the ice floats , how high does it float ?
Does it float all the way to the top ?
If it floats to the top , can Mario stand on it ?
If he can stand on it , can he slip ?
Can he slip when he's on that ice or does he grip that ice ?
And what happens when he jumps off the ice ?
It opens up a lot of different questions , and to me , what 's important about a Mario game is that the expectation that the user has in response to the action that they 've done is something that we 're able to answer .
We 're able to create the world in a way that it feels real , based on what the user would expect out of that type of world and that type of action .
Brightman :
Three years ago when the Wii launched , HDTV penetration was not that high and now we have , probably in both Japan and America , higher ownership rates of HDTVs .
Do you feel that your games would benefit from HD graphics or that gamers want to see their games in HD ?
Miyamoto : I do n't think there 's anything wrong with pretty graphics .
If I 'm a consumer and I have a TV that has nice graphics at home , I would want to be able to play my games with nice graphics too .
And I think that , of course , as we 've seen the penetration rates increase , we 're going to see video games and Nintendo 's games move along in step with the progression of technology .
But what I do n't think is necessarily true is that the graphics are something that are going to make the gameplay experience itself better .
While I do n't have anything against pretty graphics , I also think that we 're certainly going to focus on the gameplay and take advantage of the technology as it comes out .
But right now , this is what we offer .
Wired.com :
Why is n't Princess Peach a playable character in New Super Mario Bros .
Wii ?
Miyamoto :
Well , originally I thought it would be nice to have Princess Peach in there as a playable character , but in fact , the Toad characters have a physique that 's a little bit closer to Mario and Luigi .
And in particular if we had one character out of the four that wore a dress , we would have to have a special programming to handle how the skirt is handled in the gameplay ( laughs ) .
And that 's the only reason that Princess Peach is not there .
Of course , if we had Wario in there , we 'd have to program him to fart .

Different ways of seeing stats
Instead of seeking to justify policies on economic grounds , why do n't politicians make " moral cases " , or even " romantic cases " for their arguments , asks Michael Blastland in his regular column .
What we need are huge dormitories , child factories , basically , so that the economies of scale in child production can be fully realised .
Feeding and cleaning of the children could be performed in shifts by full - time staff , probably low - paid migrant workers , as would discipline with the use of a single naughty step 50ft wide , monitored by CCTV .
An observation tower here and there would mean huge savings in the cost of supervision .
And fewer toys would be required because they could be easily circulated .
All told , the business case for streamlining the early years care of children is overwhelming .
In fact , I have calculated potential savings to the nation of £ 43bn a year .
' And this section explains your contract of employment '
" The business case for " like " the economic case for " is one of those phrases that seems to ooze from every nook and cranny of argument these days .
This begins rationally enough .
Counting the cost of what you want to do is often sensible , and also - sometimes surprisingly - moral : saving money might mean you can do more of the good things .
But is it also possible to get carried away ?
The interesting question is why people would .
Why the dominance of the business case rather than any other , particularly in those areas where this craze seems biggest , in social policy .
Has politics lost confidence in other forms of argument ?
" Never mind that it 's the right thing to do , does it , or can it be made to appear that it saves cash ? "
Some recent examples : the economic case against divorce ,
the business case for flexible working ,
the cost - to - the - NHS case against smoking
All of these are suspect , by which I mean that the business case might - it's often hard to tell - actually be the opposite of that claimed .
The economics of divorce - the costs to the nation of broken homes etc - were recently offered as a good reason for encouraging couples to stay together .
Damaged children , the extra crime they might commit , the cost of benefits and so on , was reckoned to burden every taxpayer by between £ 680 and £ 820 a year .
But what if that calculation is wrong and family breakdown in some way profitable ?
Does that mean you junk your support for marriage ?
Counting these costs is an extremely imprecise exercise subject overwhelmingly to assumptions and decisions about what to include in the calculation .
Divorce economics
There might , for example , be substantial economic additions to GDP from separation , perhaps from a tendency for more people to go out to work to support an increased number of households .
Is that in the calculation ?
So does the business case work out , perversely , in favour of family break - down ?
The question , perhaps , is whether we should care about the business or economic case on divorce .
Maybe we should find some better arguments than money to describe the value of marriage .
A net contributor in GDP terms
The same goes for smoking , which to avoid confusion is something I have to point out that I am happy to see less of .
Treating smokers costs the NHS in England £ 2.7bn a year , compared with £ 1.7bn a decade ago , it was said recently .
Except that there 's strong evidence that the best financial value to the nation is if smokers really go for it , feed the Inland Revenue 's coffers with excise duty , get lung cancer and die quickly at 65 before they cost us a packet in social care in old age .
Does that mean we should encourage smoking ?
Hardly .
But it might mean we should get another argument , for example that a smoking habit can be smelly and dirty , that other people do n't like it , that it 's about the worst thing you can do for your health short of running under a bus , and that maybe other people who love you care about you not killing yourself early and you should think about their interests too .
Maybe you 'll find none of those persuasive , but maybe health is also a value that sometimes has nothing to do with money .
The business case for flexible working is uncertain , though this has n't stopped people making it .
It too rests on assumptions and guesswork and can easily be tilted the other way .
Perhaps the question is whether the case for flexible working is not that it 's necessarily good for the business bottom - line but that it 's good for people 's lives .
These might or might not be the same thing .
Here speaks someone who uses a lot of numbers : sometimes , you can have too many .
A selection of your comments appears below .
It is a sad fact that money has become more important than people , the planet , nature and , in fact , anything else in the universe .
We pay those who work in the city far more than we pay nurses and doctors and among the lowest paid are carers .
That is why it is always the business case that gets put forward .
Money should be just a means of exchanging goods and services but it has taken on a life and importance of its own .
This is a totally false construct .

There is a business case for abusing and taking advantage of poor people in poor countries with poor education .
There is a moral case for helping poor people in poor countries with poor education so they develop their own businesses .
Unfortunately , the latter means helping the said poor people to develop their understanding of a business case so they can go on and abuse or exploit other people .
Hmmm ....
Nick , London I agree very much with the sentiment behind this article .
In particular I feel strongly that the ' business case ' is in conflict with our attitudes to adopting ' green ' technology or practices .
The counter argument often made is whether or not a matter is cost effective .
There is a danger that a preoccupation with cost will prevent the adoption of some green issues / technologies ( such as micro- energy generation ) which ought to be adopted whether or not they are cost effective .
Graham , Essex Nice to see someone finally talking some sense about how things are justified , although in the case of smoking , it seemed to be my moral duty to keep smoking while it provided more revenue to the country than if I quit .
When it changed , I quit .
It would be nice to see more issues argued on whether it 's the right thing to do , rather than whether it will make a financial return .
Maybe if we all focussed on whether a choice will make us happy rather than rich then we'd all live in a nicer world .
Tom , Much Hadham , UK Money is a universal value .
Morals are relative .
I have no moral problem with the Iraqis hanging Saddam Hussein .
My moral code says he was an evil man and deserved it .
Many disagree .
What can't be argued with is that the war in Iraq cost us many billions of pounds .
Peter , Notts Read Zen and the art of Motorcycle Maintenance .
The use of the " classical view " by politicians is undeniably because they think this makes their case far more plausible and " reasonable " but they are , as ever , missing the point .
Andy Watt , Reading , UK Yes , yes , yes !
I have been saying it for years let them smoke and boost the pension pot ... by not claiming any !
Several thousand NHS ' stop smoking ' workers ' let go ' would save another packet !
Colin Watts , Poole UK
The sad fact is , that smokers are a net contributor to the NHS .
The amount of tax revenue generated by smokers far outweighs the cost of treating smoking related complaints .
On this basis should non-smokers be compelled to pay for insurance to gain access to the NHS .
Furthermore the cost of treating alcohol related injuries appear to be sidelined and play second fiddle to the war on smokers .
Nick Abraham , St Albans , UK
There is no logical business case against smoking .
The government takes a huge amount of revenue from smokers .
Large amounts of pub's have closed as people are drinking at home where they can smoke .
This leads to unemployment from the pubs , their suppliers and distributors .
We are continuously reminded of the dangers of smoking , but the government has never released the figures of alcohol related incidents , financial costings to the NHS , the police etc .
The list goes on , as could I
Mark S , Morecambe Great argument has been presented here .
It makes me think ... Is it right to go to war ?
Is there money to make out of it ?
What can represent more of the human kind failure to spend their time and money on earth than a war ?
Still , we buy it .
The problem is , we are keen on wrapping our decisions up on moral paper , and then it sells .
In a way , it feels great to think you are saving the world somehow , even if you are not , or even if you are actually making it worse .
The money argument is only used when everything else is not enough .
Still , it is not the great ' mover ' of human intervention , the great incentives are , in a nutshell , love , hate and ignorance .

The Government has scrapped a controversial change to the student loan scheme that would have forced university students working in their holidays to make repayments .
The move follows a public backlash against the proposal , which was one of several changes suggested by the Inland Revenue Department to simplify the management of loan repayments .
Borrowers earning more than $ 19,084 a year must make repayments , but the changes would have extended the threshold to those on a weekly wage of more than $ 367 .
Revenue Minister Peter Dunne said public consultation showed the change was unpopular .
" There were several hundred written responses on the proposed changes and those that chose to comment on the issue were pretty strongly opposed to it .
" The maximum amount we might be asking students to repay might be $ 500 over the holiday period , but that 's still a hell of a lot of money for students .
They may well end up paying off the loan but borrowing more to recover . "
New Zealand Union of Students ' Associations co-president Jordan King said the Government had seen sense .
" This would have really penalised the high percentage of students who use the holiday time to get the income they need for the rest of the year . "
Victoria University student president Jasmine Freemantle said students would have been forced to make repayments on their loans when they could not afford to .
The change would have seen the threshold at which people must begin repayments shifted from an annual figure to one based on a weekly , fortnightly or monthly pay cycle .
Sanford Wallace accessed Facebook members ' accounts without their permission , and sent out fake messages and wall postings , Facebook says .
( ( Dan Loh / Associated Press ) )
A U.S. court has ordered a Las Vegas man to pay Facebook $ 711 million US in damages for spreading spam messages on the social networking site .
Sanford Wallace accessed Facebook members ' accounts without their permission , and sent out fake messages and wall postings , the company said on its website on Friday .
" We won another battle in the fight against spam , " the company said in a statement .
Wallace was successfully sued last year , also for spreading spam , by MySpace , which won a $ 230 - million judgment .
He was also fined $ 4 million in 2006 by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for spreading pop-up ads online .
Facebook said it does n't expect to get any money out of Wallace , who is bankrupt , but added that he could face jail time .
" Most notably , the judge referred Wallace to the U.S. Attorney 's Office with a request that Wallace be prosecuted for criminal contempt , which means that in addition to the judgment , he now faces possible jail time , " the company said in its statement .
" We will continue to pursue damages against other spammers . "
So you think Windows XP is an old timer ?
These OSes from the distant past just wo n't quit .
Now this is good tech news in its purest form :
After eight years of development , a new operating system called Haiku has been released in alpha form .
It ’s an open - source reconstruction of BeOS , the mean , lean , multimedia - savvy OS which I really liked when I reviewed it for PC World , um , eleven years ago .
( If I recall correctly , I compared it with Windows 98 and an early version of Red Hat Linux . )
It ’s certainly a happier development than we ’re accustomed to hearing about BeOS , a product which failed to become the next - generation Mac OS back in the 1990s and was then sold to Palm for a measly $ 11 million , whereupon it pretty much vanished except for the occasional legal aftershock .
Still , for an operating system that never succeeded in the first place , BeOS has been remarkably …successful .
It ’s still embedded in at least one professional audio product , is the subject of multiple news sites and blogs , and boasts an impressive array of applications .
It may not have changed the world , but it was both useful and loved .
And even if Haiku is a quixotic project , it gives BeOS a new lease on life .
The Haiku release got me thinking about other once - signficant OSes , and what happened to them .
Herewith , some quick updates on a few major ones from the 1970s and 1980s .
Remarkably enough , they have n’t been done in by disinterested owners , obsolete technology , and legal wrangling –they ’re all still around in one form or another , and it ’s entirely possible that some of them will outlive us all .
CP /M ( born 1973 )
You could argue that Digital Research ’s pioneering desktop OS lives on in spirit every time anyone boots up Windows : Microsoft ’s operating system is the successor to MS - DOS , which started out as a hasty knockoff of CP / M .
As for bona - fide DR CP/M ?
Well , it ’s apparently still available in new / old - stock form from this company for fifteen bucks a copy , although I ’m not sure if anyone runs it today for any reason other than nerdy nostalgia .
But CP / M never really went away–it evolved into DOS PLUS , which then morphed into DR DOS , which one - time owner Caldera open - sourced as OpenDOS .
Both DR DOS and OpenDOS are still with us .
VMS ( born 1977 )
I do n’t think I ’ve ever laid eyes on a Digital VAX minicomputer in my life , but when I was first getting into computers , they were the gold standard of industrial - strength computing , in large part due to VMS , the OS they ran .
( VMS architect Dave Cutler went on to spearhead Windows NT , and is currently working on Microsoft ’s Azure cloud - computing platform . )
VAXes VAXen were so popular that they not only survived the end of the minicomputer era , but also the merger of Digital into Compaq and of Compaq into HP – the last ones rolled off assembly lines in this decade .
After multiple migrations by VMS to new platforms , HP is still selling computers that run the OS , which is now known as OpenVMS .
MS - DOS ( born 1981 )
You think Microsoft is having trouble ridding itself of Windows XP ?
DOS , an OS that dates from early in the first Reagan administration , is still very much alive , quietly in use at businesses running an array of vertical and embedded applications .
Microsoft supposedly killed it in 2001 , but if you subscribe to its TechNet service for IT types , you can download DOS 6.0 and 6.22 to this day .
( The company surely would n’t offer it unless there were folks out there who still needed it . )
Then there ’s FreeDOS , the DOS - compatible open - source OS that you can even get preinstalled on certain HP systems .
Prediction : Long after there ’s not a single soul left running Windows 7 , there will be someone , somewhere happily using DOS .
Commodore KERNAL / BASIC 2.0 ( born 1982 )
Like many early home computers –including my beloved TRS - 80 – the legendary Commodore 64 was so architecturally rudimentary that its BASIC programming language more or less doubled as its operating system , sitting on top of some low - level software called KERNAL .
Until recently , I would have declared KERNAL and BASIC to be officially defunct .
But they ’re not only still around , but causing controversy !
Developer Manomio created a properly licensed C64 emulator for the iPhone , letting you put Commodore ’s 27 - year - old OS in your pocket .
But Apple told it that having Commodore BASIC on the iPhone was too dangerous , which led Manomio to submit a version with BASIC disabled –except you could turn it on again if you knew how .
That led Apple to yank the app , which remains unavailable as I write this .
Commodore founder Jack Tramiel liked to compare his competition with Apple and other companies to war ; I hope he ’s watching this somewhere and deriving pleasure from the dust - up .
AmigaOS ( born 1985 )
Ever have one of those dreams in which you discover that a long - deceased relative is alive and well , and you ’re simultaneously happy and creeped out ?
That ’s sort of how I feel about the current status of the Amiga operating system , of which I was a wild - eyed disciple from late 1987 until early 1991 .
Commodore folded more than fifteen years ago ; its various assets have kept on changing hands ever since .
I do n’t claim to fully understand the convoluted post - Commodore history and legal status of AmigaOS , or why people are still running it in late 2009 .
But Wikipedia says that AmigaOS 4.1 was released last year , and that a “ quick fix ” ( read : service pack ) came out just last June .
All I know for sure is that this version wo n’t run on my Amiga 500 … and that I ’ll shed a silent tear if AmigaOS ever ceases to exist .
OS / 2 ( born 1987 )
“ They make the Amiga users look sane . ”
That ’s how my first boss in the computer magazine business cheerfully described OS / 2 aficionados , back when it had failed to become the dominant next - generation OS that everyone expected it would be .
I think we ’re finally at the point where there ’s nobody out there stubbornly running OS / 2 , grumbling about Windows , and insisting that the world will eventually come to see IBM ’s OS for the gem that it is .
( Actually , I take that back . )
But OS / 2 is n’t dead–it ’s apparently still kicking around in some embedded systems and supported , grudgingly and for a fee , by Big Blue .
And Serenity Systems ’ eComStation 2.0 , an authorized OS / 2 variant , is still kicking –in fact , a silver version of release 2.0 came out just a couple of weeks ago .
EPOC ( born 1989 )
Some of you are probably sick of hearing me wax rhapsodic over the Psion Series 5 , an amazing PDA from the 1990s which would still be amazing in some respects if it were re-released today .
Much of its amazingness came from EPOC , the mobile operating system which it and earlier Psions ran .
For reasons I still do n’t fully understand , Psion got out of the PDA business early in this century and spun off its software operations into a company called Symbian , which concentrated on OSes for cell phones .
Eventually , Symbian ended up being acquired by Nokia , and its OS has gone open source and continues development .
There are still glimmers of the Psion genius in Symbian - based phones such as Nokia ’s N97 , but overall , the OS not only failed to keep up with the times but actually lost some of the clever interface touches that made Psion ’s products so wonderful .
I was so emotionally attached to EPOC that it hurts to type this , but I ’ve come to the conclusion that Nokia should probably put Symbian out to pasture and adopt Google Android as its primary phone OS .
I could go on–Microsoft ’s MSX , which I thought never caught on in the first place , is still sort of extant–but I ’ll end this here .
Except to ask you this :
Which other OSes of yore are worth remembering , celebrating , and maybe even using ?

Harvard professor Edward Glaeser keeps dumping cold water on the dreams of anyone hoping for high speed rail .
In the fourth installment of a series looking at the economics of high speed trains at the Economix blog , Glaeser argues " rail ’s potential reshaping of the American economy " is overblown .
Supporters of high speed trains , point to evidence of fast trains transforming slow towns .
Glaeser cites Ciudad Real a town outside of Madrid in Spain , that 's been lifted by high speed trains .
Well , the United States is not Spain , Glaeser says .
High speed trains will not save dying towns like Buffalo , Detroit and Cleveland .
Here , Glaeser presents his least convincing work in the series .
It seems obvious that Buffalo , which would still be a 2.5 hour train ride to New York City , would n't be transformed by high speed rail .
What about somewhere closer , like Philadelphia ?
Glaeser says it 's still not happening :
Philadelphia is the more natural beneficiary of high - speed rail access to Manhattan ; there are already people who live in Philadelphia and commute to New York .
Yet even in this most propitious setting , the coming of Acela seems to have had little impact on the population decline of Philadelphia or growth of Wilmington .
Perhaps the absence of any trend break in population growth around 2000 just reflects the incremental nature of the Acela investment , but there is little here to bring confidence that rail lines revitalize cities .
We 've looked closely at the Philadelphia to New York Acela .
It 's a joke .
The trip takes about an hour and a half , and costs between $ 90 at the low end , to $ 280 at the high end for a round trip ticket .
There 's no discounted monthly passes either .
The bus will shuttle you between the cities in 2 hours , and a roundtrip ticket costs $ 20 .
The prohibitive cost of the Acela makes it impossible for rationalizing a move to Philadelphia and commuting to New York on economic grounds .
If a truly high speed rail line were set up between the two cities , and the commute only took 45 minutes to 1 hour , and the tickets were more reasonably priced , $ 1,000 - $ 1,200 a month , we think Philadelphia really becomes the sixth borough of New York , as the New York Times called it in 2005 ( to the consternation of Philadelphians ) .
Let 's say we are right , and Philly gets a little boom from the high speed rail , does it even matter ?
Not according to Glaeser , who says " I do n’t see why is it in the national interest to disperse economic activity from Manhattan to Buffalo or Philadelphia .
I have long argued that the economic case for directing economic aid to declining regions is weak . "

Caricature of royal family that graced building in east London for eight years is removed by council
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
Council officials have painted over a Banksy graffito sketch from which a reworked version was derived as the cover artwork for the 2003 single Crazy Beat by the band Blur .
The artwork – a cartoon of the royal family waving from a balcony – had been left untouched on the side of a block of flats in Stoke Newington , east London , for eight years before Hackney council intervened last week .
Officials removed the sketch by Banksy – whose works have sold for hundreds of thousands of pounds – as his largest exhibition to date , in Bristol , prepared to close .
The exhibition has attracted over 300,000 visitors since 13 June , raising £ 45,000 in museum donations , and is estimated to have been worth £ 10 m to the local economy .
Banksy vs Bristol Museum featured more than 100 works of art .
The notoriously secretive artist was reported to have been secretly adding new installations to the exhibition by night .
A Stoke Newington blogger known only as Kris broke the news of the artwork 's removal .
She reported that council workers said they had told their employers about the importance of the artwork .
" We knew it was a Banksy , love .
It 's a Stoke Newington landmark ; we know that .
We told them , but they would n't listen , " wrote Kris .
The owner of the building , Sophie Attrill , told the Hackney Gazette that she was devastated when she saw the wall being painted .
" I looked out the window and saw what they were doing , so I ran downstairs and I told them to stop , " said Attrill .
Hackney council said it tried to contact Attrill before ordering the artwork to be painted over , but notices asking her to remove or cover up the piece had not reached her address due to the Land Registry having the incorrect contact details .
Alan Laing , the Hackney council cabinet member for neighbourhoods , said the council removed all graffiti regardless of artistic value .
" Hackney council does not make a judgment call on whether graffiti is art or not , our task is to keep Hackney 's streets clean .
We made four attempts to contact the owner of the property to inform her of our intention to remove the graffiti , " said Laing .
" We are now speaking with her about how to resolve the issue . "
It 's not the first time Banksy has had his street art removed by authorities .
In October last year Westminster city council removed a mural from Newman Street in central London after the deputy council leader , Robert Davis , said keeping it would be " condoning " graffiti .
In 2007 a piece showing a monkey preparing to blow up a bunch of bananas at Waterloo station in London was painted over by staff .
• This article was amended on Friday 4 September 2009 .
The original implied that the Hackney graffito was identical to that used on the Blur cover .
And the photograph that accompanied our original webpage article did not show a Banksy work .
This has been corrected .
" I am optimistic by nature , " Meza said as he left the talks at a Tegucigalpa hotel to brief Zelaya at the Brazilian embassy , where the deposed president has taken refuge since his surprise return last month .
This article discusses the Bixby publication The Impact of Population Growth on Tomorrow ’s World a special theme issue of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B .
Excerpt :
“ Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B— a journal from the Royal Society whose motto is “ Take nobody ’s word for it ” — wades into these treacherous waters this week with a special issue , “ The Impact of Population Growth on Tomorrow ’s World . ”
As Roger Short of the University of Melbourne writes in the introduction , “ The inexorable increase in human numbers is exhausting conventional energy supplies , accelerating environmental pollution and global warming , and providing an increasing number of failed states where civil unrest prevails , ” among other faults .
And he goes so far as to call for a halt to future population growth .
Then again , ask other contributors to the special issue , is population growth even a problem ?
After all , as various nations have developed , birth rates have fallen — in some cases so much so that populations are shrinking — thanks , in large part , to empowering women to control their reproduction .
Or so argue public health scientists Martha Campbell and Kathleen Beford of the University of California , Berkeley in the special issue .
Yet , this demographic transition does not hold everywhere .
And , as political scientist Bradley Thayer of Baylor University argues in the same issue , national population bombs trigger war , especially of the internecine civil variety , as well as terrorism as “ youth bulges ” in Middle Eastern countries leave large masses of young men without economic prospects .
In fact , notes Steven Sinding of the Gutmacher Institute in Manchester , Vt. , controlling population growth can actually help individuals and families escape poverty .
Witness the exceptional economic rise of China in recent decades , in part helped along by the controversial One Child Policy instituted by Mao Zedong .
And family planning has proven effective in the past , from Thailand to Iran , yet funding for such programs has dwindled in recent years .
Partially as a result , developing countries in eastern Africa — Kenya , Tanzania , Uganda and Zimbabwe — have seen their populations begin to increase rapidly again in recent years .
Lurking behind all this is a potential crisis in the very resource that has enabled this unprecedented expansion of human numbers : fossil fuels .
Thanks to growing population and dwindling supplies , fossil fuel production per capita may peak by mid-century — ending the two centuries of unlimited growth in energy production that is at the root of modern civilization , consultant Richard Nehring writes in the journal . ”

Is birth control the answer
The Starbucks counter may resemble a CD store , but Carly Simon does not feel like the coffee conglomerate did enough for her recent album .
So she 's taking them to court and bringing in a big legal gun - super lawyer David Boies .
Simon signed with Starbucks label Hear Music , but five days before the release of her 2008 album , " This Kind of Love , " Starbucks " scaled back its involvement in the music business , " according to the New York Times .
Simon now alleges that her poor album sales were a result of Starbucks ' " mismanagement . "
Simon went the quaint route at first , spending months handwriting notes to Starbucks chief executive Howard Shultz ( “ Howard , Fraud is the creation of Faith / And then the betrayal .
Carly . ” ) , but now she 's made the dispute official .
NYT : On Friday Mr. Boies filed a lawsuit in California seeking $ 5 million to $ 10 million from Starbucks , alleging “ concealment of material facts , ” “ tortious interference ” with Ms. Simon ’s contract , and “ unlawful , unfair and fraudulent business practices . ”
Ms. Simon ’s complaints seem more about feelings than tortious interference .
She sounds like a woman who has been hurt and is taking that hurt as personally as she always has .
“ I refuse to go gently , ” she said .
Starbucks has not seen the complaint yet , but issued a statement saying it filled its obligations to Simon that her CD suffered from poor sales at other retailers as well .
Today saw the final artwork drop for the Karmic Koala - and what an update it 's been !
What ’s new ?
Take a look below !
Updated Human - theme
The default theme for Ubuntu has changed !
Finally !
Gone are the orange titlebars and scroll bars , and a sleek brown is in their place .
A theme somewhat echoing that of Ubuntu 5.10 Breezy Badger !
For anyone noticing any issues or discrepancies with the newly polished design – bear in mind the artwork team rushed it out of the door so it could make today 's Artwork deadline .
I hear it ’s by no means the final product so expect some more refinements !
New Wallpapers
Although the default wallpaper for Karmic Koala is yet to drop ( based on past releases , it ’ll appear in the RC ) , today 's ArtworkDrop did bring some much needed wallpaper - based eyecandy in the form of a ( very Windows 7 like ) ‘ wallpaper pack ’ called ‘ Cosmos ’ .
‘ Cosmo's ’ is a set of 8 or so photos from the Hubble telescope that automatically change every 15 minutes .
You ’ll also notice that on all ‘ Appearance ’ windows there is now a hyperlink to “ get more online ” .
This link takes you to the official Gnome artwork site which , sadly , is home to some of the most artistically challenged artwork available online !
Eek !
New Default Icon Set
Today ’s other big news was the fact that Ubuntu has a shiny new default icon theme !
‘ Humanity ’ is a updated , modern refresh of the previous default ‘ Human ’ Icon theme .
It keeps the warm orange tones , but adds some gloss and style to the proceedings and shakes off some of its processors ‘ cartoonish ’ quality .
[ Humanity Folder Icons ]
New shutdown artwork
Say hello to the final thing you see when shutting down or rebooting -
It ’s the minimalistic new logout screen !
A gorgeously understated design that simply fades away after a few seconds .

Put It All Together …
This is not good .
Not good at all .
Lots could go wrong on this one .
Cops .
Beaten and robbed .
Stranded .
Definitely the worst ride yet .
Should n't have gotten in this van .
I glance over at Ethan .
He 's looking straight ahead .
Even his pet rat , Echinacea , is still .
I roll another cigarette and inhale deeply .
We 're sitting in the middle of a large maroon van driven by a balding Latino guy named " Blue " who has been in and out of prison for the last few decades , mostly for armed robbery .
In the passenger seat is his hustling partner , L.A. , named after his city of choice , where he also did time .
Both have jailhouse neck tattoos .
I suspect L.A. carries a gun under his big Tupac shirt .
In the back of the van is Courtney , Blue 's girlfriend .
She 's wrestling with two of their boys — one of them a long - lashed kid with a killer smile , the other still in a baby seat .
Courtney 's pregnant with Blue 's third child .
The kids scream and yell , and she screams and yells back .
Blue has a habit of calling his child " nigga . "
For the last two hours , we 've been riding in this van while they hit every Wal - Mart between Orlando and Kissimmee , stealing merchandise and then returning it ( without a receipt ) at the next Wal - Mart for gift cards .
Then they take the gift cards , use some of it for gas at the Wal - Mart filling stations , and take the balance in cash .
That 's been their hustle for the last four years .
Why they decided to pick us up at a gas station outside Orlando is anybody 's guess .
Maybe they wanted us to help .
Maybe we were the decoys if the cops showed up .
Maybe they liked our company .
No , not that last one .
We made it clear we were n't going to help them , but once inside the van we were pretty much in for the long haul .
Just get us to Tampa , I said .
We 've been on the road for four days .
Ethan needs a shower and I need a real bed .
Blue and L.A. talk in hushed tones over the gospel rap blaring through the car speakers .
" Naw , man , they 've been loyal , " I hear L.A. mutter .
Is he talking about us ?
" Well , you wanted an interesting ride , right ? " Ethan says softly .
Yeah , but this was n't exactly what I bargained for when I agreed to hitchhike across Florida with a traveler kid named Ethan Clarkson and his pet rat .
Then again , what did I expect ?
The act of sharing transportation has been around as long as there has been transport to share .
Even the Bible has a story about a hitchhiker : the apostle Philip , who takes a ride from an Ethiopian eunuch on a horse in the New Testament .
In the United States , hitchhiking took hold during the Great Depression when a generation traveled by thumb and by train looking for work on farms and factories .
But it was Jack Kerouac 's traveling opus , On The Road , published 50 years ago this year , that romanticized hitchhiking for the masses .
Hitchhiking went from being just an alternative for the poor and carless to a form of adventure , or even a political statement , for counterculture types and societal dropouts .
And for countless authors and screenwriters , the idea of riding with a stranger on the open road has conjured up oddball characters , enlightening encounters and , of course , rides from hell .
Urban legends of rape and murder still hover around the act of hitchhiking , the result of the media hype surrounding a few grisly incidents in the 1970s and ' 80s , and , of course , paranoia - inducing horror movies like The Hitcher .
Such are the warnings I heard when I announced my plan to travel Florida by thumb .
Hitchhiking in the '60s was OK , people told me .
But in 2007 ?
No way .
There are crazies out there .
Yet 50 years after Neal Cassady and Devon Smith ( who held the Guinness Book of World Records title for most miles hitched until 1985 ) , a new generation of disaffected youth has taken up the mantle of thumbing for free rides .
Blending a distrust of suburban respectability with a love of punk rock and radical politics , these new " traveler kids " regularly traverse the country .
Through touring punk bands and radical organizations like Food Not Bombs , they 've formed a tightly connected subculture , offering fellow travelers places to stay , free food and camaraderie .
They 've written far - circulated books like Evasion , the story of a punk who steals and scams his way across the country , and have begun websites like www.couchsurfing.com and www.digihitch.com.
About a month ago , one of those traveler kids ended up on my couch .
Clarkson , a 25 - year - old photographer from Iowa , claims to have traveled 28 states in 16 months , covering nearly 15,000 miles via hitchhiking and train - hopping .
Stuck in St. Petersburg after his would - be host left town , Clarkson , a friend of a friend , found his way to my pad with his friendly , cream - colored rat , Echinacea , telling stories about his days hanging with Detroit punks , squatting abandoned high schools in New Orleans and bumming around Brooklyn with an anarchist rabbi named Shalom .
The tales would be hard to believe if not for his photos .
" I think traveling is the most effective way I can build a portfolio and see the country , " he says about his decision to leave home in March 2006 .
" I spent 24 years in one state .
I had gotten everything out of Iowa that I could possibly get .
I think traveling is the most amazing thing I 've done so far . "
The college - educated artist began posting his travel photos on a personal website , www.starvingiguanas.com, partly for himself and partly for his worried family and friends back home .
" It 's kind of like a political statement , too , " he adds .
" I 'm not going to drive a car , I 'm not going to work and pay your taxes .
I 'm going to be totally free . "
The more Clarkson talked , the harder the traveling bug bit me .
I 'd done a few cross-country trips by car and bus , but never anything as risky as hitchhiking .
So , while sipping whiskey at a neighborhood bar , I proposed an idea to him :
Take me with you hitchhiking for a weekend .
He agreed on the spot .
Two weeks later , we packed our bags for a free ride through the heart of Florida .
Water bottle : check .
State ID : check .
Sharpie marker for signs : check .
Extra pair of socks : check .
Blanket and tarp : check .
Map : check .
Half a roll of toilet paper : check .
Knife : check .
I throw on a pair of jeans and thin blue shirt .
Clarkson wears the same drab cargo shorts and stained white T - shirt he 's worn for weeks .
It 's been raining since sunrise , and we 're hurrying to make up the lost time .
Clarkson does n't give me any hitchhiking tips except for rule No. 1 : Never leave your pack .
No matter if we 're at a rest stop and you just have use the bathroom .
No matter if it offends the driver .
A hitchhiker never leaves his or her pack .
" Without your pack , " he warns , " You are pretty much naked on the side of the road . "
Around noon , we make it to the headquarters of Creative Loafing newspaper in Tampa .
A classified rep gives us our first ride , to Bearss Avenue off I -275 .
As soon as she speeds away , we realize the mistake .
" This is a bad spot , " Clarkson says .
No truck stop .
Barely enough space on the shoulder for a car to pull over .
No cardboard sign .
" This is a real bad spot . "
Undeterred , we get on the grassy median by the on- ramp heading north and do what countless others have done before us : stick out our thumbs .
I feel a little silly .
The stares from passing drivers add to my discomfort .
A Pasco sheriff 's deputy drives by .
So do at least two dozen cars .
Then , without warning , a black Tacoma truck pulls over .
We jog toward it .
" Hop in , " a strong - jawed man with a blond military crewcut tells us .
" Where you heading ? "
" Gainesville , " we answer .
Our Good Samaritan turns out to be Link , a 36 - year - old property manager and Marine who fought in the first Gulf War and has just returned from three tours in Iraq .
A stark black tattoo of an AK - 47 with the phrase " Death before dishonor " in Sunni Arabic marks his forearm .
In his spare time , he traps alligators .
" I usually do n't pick up hitchhikers , " Link says , a refrain we 'll hear several times on the trip , " but you guys do n't look like killers . "
He shoots us a grin .
Link drove supply trucks from Kuwait through the Sunni Triangle .
He was discharged this year after he drove over an IED .
" Everything in the back of the truck came into the cab , " he recalls .
" And I was n't carrying anything special .
Just food and water . "
Link carries on about Iraq for the next several miles .
He talks about the unguarded weapons at U.S. bases , the infidelity of significant others back home , the nightmares .
" You 're lucky there is n't a draft , " he continues .
" You do n't want to go to Iraq , man . "
Link turns up Hank Williams Jr. as we pull into an Ocala truck stop .
This is our stop .
At the next on - ramp , I 'm more confident , standing in front of Clarkson and smiling as I stick my thumb toward the road .
I 'm having fun : the adventure , the characters , the adrenaline that shoots through you when someone stops .
I could do this all day ; Clarkson says we might have to .
Thirty minutes crawl by .
A sheriff passes but does n't stop .
Hitchhiking is legal , according to Florida state law , although people are prohibited from walking on interstate highways and must stay on the on -ramp shoulders .
However , some cities and towns have their own ordinances , and that 's where you get into trouble .
" Usually they 're pretty cool , " Clarkson says about law enforcement .
Some officers will even give hitchhikers rides to the next county " just so you 're out of their hair .
I 've gone several counties in a row that way . "
He takes out a harmonica and I share my dirty hitchhiking secret :
Once , as a teenager , I mocked a hitchhiker with a thumbs - up while driving by laughing .
Clarkson shakes his head .
" That 's the worst thing you can do , " he lectures me .
" And the least original . "
Sure enough , in the next few minutes , a group of teenagers give us the thumbs - up as they speed onto the interstate .
Karma .
A few more cars blow past before a green Ford pickup truck pulls onto the shoulder .
The driver , a wrinkled fellow with a mullet , points to the back of the truck .
We jump into the dusty pickup bed , wedge ourselves next to a generator and toolbox , and head down the road .
" These rides are nice sometimes , " Clarkson says .
" You do n't have to talk .
You can just rest . "
Which is good : I 'm still exhausted from trying to entertain our first ride .
" Stories , " Clarkson says .
" That 's all we have to offer these people . "
Our kindhearted hillbilly hauls us right to the University of Florida campus .
Clarkson , during one of his earlier trips through Florida , met a group of traveler kids staying near campus .
He figures we can talk our way onto a couch and maybe into a party , but when we reach the ramshackle shotgun house , his friends are n't there .
Ironically , they 're traveling themselves .
We spend the next three hours at the local Checkers .
Clarkson calls his mother .
Once darkness falls on the summer - weary college town , he uses his Slingshot Organizer — a kind of national guidebook to anarchist - friendly people and places — to find Wayward Council , a DIY punk - rock venue .
On this night , they 're hosting four touring bands .
Outside the club , I chat up the organizers while punked - out college girls surround Clarkson , intrigued by his rat .
A street kid with a mohawk and thick Southern accent sits by us .
Clarkson distances himself .
" Heroin addict , " he whispers .
" I can talk to 10 travel kids , and I 'm guaranteed that one of them , if not four of them , will know someone I know , " he says .
" There are a lot of travel kids .
Even in the last six months , I 've seen more than I used to .
Not all of them are cool .
A lot of them are escaping something . "
After the show ends , we find a vacant lot surrounded by oak trees and lay out our tarps .
I use my backpack as a pillow .
Sleep comes quickly .
The trip is starting to feel less like hitchhiking than just being homeless .
As the sun rises atop the trees , we roll up the tarps and head to Waldo Road .
Ten miles down is the Waldo Flea Market , an open - air bazaar featuring 1,000 of Central Florida 's finest dealers of junk , Clarkson insists .
We 're barely on the road 10 minutes with our thumbs out and a crude cardboard sign announcing our destination before a Jeep carrying two Hare Krishnas stops .
The driver says something about karma and remains silent .
" I 've had cars that pick me up , and they do n't talk , " Clarkson says later , " and that makes me nervous . "
When we reach the flea market , I feel like I 've reached Conrad 's " Heart of Darkness . "
Savages with mullets of all sizes peruse the tables of collectible guns , knives and " Bible Bread . "
At one booth , a man resembling Yosemite Sam drags a small black puppy he 's affectionately named " Nigger " across the floor .
But the most unsettling part of the collection is in a large tent at the edge of the property : Redneck Country features all the Confederate flag stickers , shirts and tank tops any Central Florida yokel could want .
And , at the back of the tent , a vast collection of Klu Klux Klan and Nazi - themed memorabilia lines the wall .
A country song about lynching blares over the speakers .
Suddenly , Waldo does n't seem like such a great place for two young hitchhikers .
Or a reporter .
Clarkson quickly spots two teenagers on their way out of an antique booth who agree to give us a 30 - mile ride in their Honda Civic up U.S. 301 .
Our rescuers , 18 - year - old David and 19 - year - old Britney , live in the small town of Keystone .
David , a large guy with a mop of brown hair , plays guitar and myriad other instruments ( " There is n't that many people to play with in Keystone , " he says ) , and Britney enjoys getting intricate gothic tattoos .
They do n't mind the rat running around their car .
" It tends to be poor people that pick you up or people who used to hitch , " Clarkson says .
" Old hippies .
People who have ever been on the side of the road and wished someone would stop . "
He thinks for a minute and adds , " Or it 's the people who are bored . "
That seems to fit David and Britney ; they decide to take us an extra 20 miles .
( " We have nothing else to do , " David says . )
They drop us off at the intersection of U.S. 301 and State Road 100 , which will lead us straight to the east coast .
Almost immediately , a Brooklynite named Jensen gives us a lift .
Returning to Jacksonville after a construction job in Gainesville , Jensen ran out of gas a few miles back and had to pawn his tools for the gas money home .
" You can rob me if you want , " he says , looking back at me .
" But I got no money .
It would n't bother me , though , if you did . "
Jensen drives as I imagine Neal Cassady must have : swerving maniacally , yet fully in control .
He 's going at least 30 miles over the speed limit , and he always seems to be looking at us , not the road .
Jensen talks rapidly about the million dollars he earned through investments in his early 20s and how he squandered it all on cars and cocaine .
He 's an animal lover but vaguely racist .
When we pass a black hitchhiker , he smiles : " Sorry , brother . "
He takes us only 20 miles and promises to come back for us , but after he speeds off , our thumbs attract another kind driver .
Amy , a single mom and community - college student , pulls her blue Chevy truck over and motions for us to hop in the back .
She 's going right into Daytona Beach for a ride with an ambulance .
( " It 's for school , " she says . )
Once we 're settled in , she hands us two Capri Suns .
An hour later , we reach the beach and run toward the Atlantic Ocean in our boxers .
It 's our first bath in two days .
But our celebration soon ends .
Rain clouds from the west move in quickly , and within the hour we 're under a Kangaroo gas station awning while the skies pour their fury on us .
This is n't going to be an easy night .
Where are we going to sleep ?
That 's when we meet the Pirate .
Dressed in a pair of tattered shorts , his stringy blond hair poking out of a bandanna , John looks the part of a pirate .
Faced with no other choice , we take him up on his offer of a motel room .
At least until the rain stops .
" I got into some money lately and I 'm visitin ' my daughter this week , " he begins in a thick Rhode Island accent .
" I do that three or fo ' times a yea ' .
I got two guys f'om the pawk stayin ' wit me already and some girls are supposed to come by , but you can hang out as long as you want . "
I 'm a little suspicious ; Clarkson is giddy .
" I love being adopted , " he says .
Inside , the Pirate introduces us to the Irishman , a homeless Vietnam vet of Irish descent , and the Caveman , so named because the unkempt black beard that covers his face reminds the Pirate of a certain Geico commercial .
The Pirate found his vagrant friends after work one day and offered them a place to stay out of the rain .
He was supposed to return with girls and rum , his new friends admonish him .
Instead he brought back stinky hitchhikers .
While the three men pass a bottle of whiskey , Clarkson shares his cross-country adventures .
The Pirate and the Caveman think he 's crazy for hitchhiking , but the Irishman understands .
The vet tells us he 's been to every state and over 20 countries .
He urges Clarkson to continue his travels .
One by one , the men pass out .
Clarkson and I decide to crash on their floor .
Tonight , we 'll stay dry .
The next morning , we bid farewell to our new friends and spend the morning on the beach .
By noon , we walk seven miles to the I - 4 on ramp , confident we 'll make it to Tampa before nightfall .
Hitchhiking rule No. 2 : No guarantees .
We leave Daytona Beach with a couple on their way to the Orlando airport .
But much to our chagrin , they drop us off in the suburban hell of Altamonte Springs .
All the buildings look the same .
So do the cars .
And everyone stares at us like they 've never seen hitchhikers .
Within 15 minutes , two Altamonte Springs police officers yell at us from their patrol cars to get off the on-ramp .
As we walk down the road , four more police cars pass us slowly .
I secure us a ride at a gas station with a man heading just two exits up to a more desolate , wooded area outside Orlando , but our bad luck continues for two hours .
My thumb actually starts to cramp .
Seven different cars give us the mocking thumbs - up .
I hate Orlando .
As the sun dips behind the trees , we call it a night .
People do n't pick up hitchhikers at night , Clarkson says .
Exhausted , we make camp in a group of bushes in front of a Motel 6 a few miles up the road .
I watch a hooker get out of a truck .
I force myself to sleep .
When I return with coffee the next morning , sheriffs ' deputies have Clarkson surrounded .
One questions me while another searches my backpack .
Clarkson , according to the authorities , fits the description of a drug dealer .
But after the cops run our licenses , he 's let go — just in time for a huge thunderstorm .
We spend the morning under an overpass .
When the rain dies down to a sprinkle , we head to a gas station to ask about the nearest truck stop .
Maybe we 'll have more luck on the other side of the city .
It 's already 2 p.m. , and I 'm beginning to think we 'll be stuck in Orlando forever .
That 's when the van of thieves pulls up next to us , offering a ride to Tampa .
We have 40 miles behind us when a Wal - Mart employee , suspicious of Blue , refuses to return his merchandise .
He walks back to the car , his face red and puffy .
" Motherfuckers , " he mutters .
" They got some uppity Wal - Marts around here .
We need to go back to Orlando . "
I protest .
But Blue dismisses me .
" I know a few stores in the ghetto that 'll take this stuff , " he says .
" Then we 'll be on our way to Tampa . "
The kids in the back start screaming again .
Blue turns up the gospel rap .
After hitting the second Wal - Mart in Orlando , Blue hands us a gift card , telling us to grab some food and cigarettes for the ride into Tampa .
" We 'll be back before you 're finished , " he says .
" We have to make a deal with this guy and he can't see you . "
I look at Clarkson and nod .
I open the van door , step out and then glance back .
Never leave your pack .
I reach in and hoist it on my back .
Clarkson follows my lead .
" Why you taking that ? " L.A. asks , but I do n't answer and close the door .
The van never comes back for us .
The gift card is empty .
" That 's the worst ride I 've ever had , " Clarkson says .
Worse than the heroin addict that shot up in front of you ?
" Yep . "
Worse than the guy who propositioned you with a 10 - inch silicone dildo ?
" Him , too . "
I take out our map .
The closest highway is the Florida Turnpike , more than 10 miles away .
I - 4 is even farther .
The sun is setting .
We 're stuck in another Orlando suburb .
I have to be at my desk tomorrow , and there 's no way I 'm spending another night in the bushes .
I break down and call my roommate to come get us .
I 'm a weekend warrior .
Traveler kids hate those .
Sitting on the bench , Clarkson recaps our adventure .
" What do you think , " he asks , " about hitchhiking ? "
" Well … " I think for a minute .
" It 's better than the Greyhound . "
When I see my roommate 's car , I step to the curb and stick my thumb out .
" Where ya heading ? " she asks .
" Tampa . "
" Hop in . "

A U.S. wind turbine manufacturer has announced a $ 5.4 - million deal to begin production in Windsor , Ont .
Michigan - based WindTronics will produce small residential and commercial turbines at the former Innovatech Seating Systems plant on Sprucewood Avenue on the city 's west side .
It will also conduct research and development .
The Ontario government will contribute $ 2.7 million to help WindTronics establish its Windsor operations .
WindTronics will invest the balance .
The company hopes to create 174 jobs at the plant by 2012 , but WindTronics president Reg Adams said there will also be " work in the installation process . "
" It takes two people a day to install a turbine , " he said .
" For every couple of hundred of jobs we create here , it takes about a thousand jobs in the field . "
A much - needed investment
The announcement is good news for Windsor , whose struggling automotive industry has helped contribute to an unemployment rate of 14.8 per cent , the highest in the country among cities .
It 's a sign people " believe in our city , " said Ontario Economic Development Minister Sandra Pupatello , who 's also the MPP for Windsor West .
" We 're looking to turn the page and look at new opportunities and grabbing them , " she said .
" To see people arriving here and looking at great opportunities in our community , it 's about time . "
WindTronics expects to be producing " about 5,000 turbines " a month by May 2010 , Adams said , with additional expectations of producing 10,000 a month by June or July .
" We currently , right now , have requests from 68 countries for the product , " he said .
" So it 's a very exciting project . "
Built for houses , towers
The Windsor plant will produce the WT6000 Honeywell Wind Turbine , which measures 1.8 metres in diameter and weighs 77 kilograms .
It can be installed on the roofs of houses and industrial buildings , as well as towers and barns .
It can produce 2,000 kilowatts of energy per year , or what WindTronics estimates is up to 18 per cent of the electricity used by the average home .
WindTronics 's project is the first in what Pupatello and Ontario 's minister of finance , Windsor - Tecumseh MPP Dwight Duncan , hope will be a long list of " green economy investments . "
" Our skilled and productive workforce and business environment , which we continue to make more competitive , are helping the province to attract innovative and growing businesses like WindTronics , " Duncan said in a press release .
yarr , excuse me manners and excuse me princess [ Oct. 21st , 2009 | 09:30 pm ]

Let 's see what we 've got here :
- " Excuuse me , princess ! " is really unpopular , given its ease in typing : people either write the phrase with The Canonical Number of Letters U ( that is , 1 ) , or write it with more .
I believe this reflects a tension between dictionary spelling and how the word is said : if you 're going to break the rules , people break them in a way that 's clear and unambiguously not a typo !
- There is a marked preference for 41 letters u : " excuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu uuuuuse me , princess ! " has 3,770 results , while the results around it have tons fewer .
That 's that bump near the end of the graph !
Clearly there is a connection here with the amount of time the average person is willing to hold down their " u " key before losing interest and seeing what the other keys do
- It took 50 letters u ( " excuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuse me , princess ! " ) to get 0 results .
I was going to stop there , but then I made the mistake of checking 51 letters u , which had a few hits , as did 52 .
It was at 67 letters u ( " excuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuse me , princess ! " ) that my Google search box was mostly the letter " u " and I realized that there is no upper limit on how many letters u could appear .
It 's letters u all the way down , you guys !
So I stopped and wished I 'd written a script to do this instead , but I really thought we 'd peter out before 67 .

Finding permanent housing for Los Angeles County ’s homeless rather than allowing them to continue living on the streets could save taxpayer money , according to a study released Tuesday by the United Way of Greater Los Angeles .
The four - year study followed four homeless people while they lived on the streets and later as they found stable housing .
Researchers concluded that taxpayers could save $ 20,000 a year per person using public services .
There were an estimated 73,000 homeless in the county last year .
Elise Buik , president and chief executive of the local United Way , said the study also looked at other cities that have reduced homelessness and found that permanent housing was the key .
“ We always need to be very prudent with our public dollars , and for legislators to see this is a cost - effective model helps build the case that this is an effective model , ” Buik said .

The study followed four chronically homeless people : a 52 - year - old white woman , a 58 - year - old white man , a 32 - year - old Latino man and a 61 - year - old black man .
It took into account drug abuse , physical health , mental health , criminal justice and housing .
Once placed in stable housing , each became less dependent on public services .
Emergency room visits went from 19 among all of them to one , and rehab stints went from six to none , according to the study .

Miami Dolphins quarterback Chad Pennington has been initially diagnosed with a torn capsule in his throwing shoulder and the Dolphins expect him to miss the rest of the season , sources familiar with the injury he suffered Sunday told ESPN senior NFL analyst Chris Mortensen .
Pennington will seek a second opinion from orthopedic specialist Dr. James Andrews , who has performed two shoulder surgeries on the quarterback .
On Tuesday , Jeff Darlington of the Miami Herald told ESPN's " First Take " that the appointment is scheduled for Friday .
Pennington underwent tests Monday on his right shoulder , which he hurt early in the third quarter of Sunday 's 23 - 13 loss at San Diego .
He missed the rest of the game , and coach Tony Sparano said he did n't know how long Pennington will be sidelined .
" We do n't have a comment , because the evaluation process is still ongoing , " team spokesman Harvey Greene said .
Pennington has already had surgery on the same shoulder in 2004 and 2005 .
There were some heated words on the Senate floor today as Congress debated what to do about planned Medicare pay cuts for doctors .
We 'll get to the rhetoric in a minute , but first a bit of the back story .
Under current law , Medicare payment rates for doctors will fall by 21 % next year .
Nobody seems to want to let the cuts take effect , and Congress has repeatedly blocked similar pay cuts in recent years .
But permanently scrapping the planned cuts would add some $ 250 billion in federal spending over the next decade .
A Democratic bill ( S. 1776 ) being debated in the Senate this week would permanently scrap the planned cuts without addressing the higher cost .
Many Republicans favor scrapping the pay cuts , but oppose the bill because it would add to the deficit .
Count Bob Corker , a Tennessee Republican , in that group .
In a speech on the Senate floor today , Corker said , " I absolutely agree that physicians around this country do not need to take a 25 % cut . "
Corker also cited a report from The Hill that said Democratic leaders offered the AMA and other doctors ' groups a deal : The Democrats would block the Medicare pay cuts , if the doctors ' groups would back Democrats ' broader health - care bill .
Do you think Congress should vote on bills without reading them ?
How about voting on bills that do n’t even exist yet , except in fragments ?
The Senate Finance Committee is poised to vote on a massive health care reform bill on Tuesday allegedly authored by Sen. Max Baucus ( D - Mont . ) .
A glaring , outrageous , unreported fact is that the bill ’s actual text has been kept secret .
No one actually knows what ’s in it – not even the senators who will be told to vote for it .
Perhaps the Nobel committee will award President Obama another prize to share with Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi , for “ imagination in medical financing . ”
Bits and pieces are leaking out , but entire sections will be added later .
That ’s what happened with the House version .
Nobody read the bill , and 75 “ phantom ” amendments were added after the vote .
A similar maneuver happened in the Senate when a key committee approved another version of a sweeping health care bill in July without seeing the text .
Actual language was unveiled months later in September .
In short , senators will follow recent precedent and be voting on something that does not even exist yet .
Even the Congressional Budget Office , which issued a report this week saying the Baucus plan would cost under $ 900 billion instead of more than a trillion , was operating without actual text .
When the CBO crunched the detailed , 1,018 - page House version this summer , it reported that it would cost far more than President Obama claimed .
Obama then broke precedent and summoned the CBO director to the White House for a “ talk . ”
Now the CBO says the Senate bill will cost less .
They think .
They hope .
They speculate .
What ’s more , CNSNews.com reports that an aide to Sen .
Harry Reid said that current debates may be irrelevant because an entirely different version might be inserted into an unrelated House tax bill , HR 1586 .
That ’s the measure that levies a 90 percent tax on bonuses given to executives of firms that receive bailout money .
Among other things , this could be a way of getting around the constitutional requirement that all tax bills originate in the House .
Sen .
Reid continues to insist that he wants a “ public option ” that would lead to a “ single - payer ” system , which means the end of private insurance and the dawn of socialized medicine .
Just ask Barney Frank .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said this week that she has the votes necessary to ram through a bill with “ the public option ” as soon as it comes back to her chamber .
“ The real bill will be another 1,000 - page , trillion dollar experiment ... that vastly expands the role of the federal government in the personal health care decisions of every American , ” Sen. Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) warned .
House Majority Leader Steny
Hoyer would not rule out the possibility that the House would vote for identical Senate language , thus avoiding having the bill go to conference for scrutiny and debate and getting it quickly to President Obama ’s desk .
Stunned by the August town halls , Tea parties and the massive Sept. 12 taxpayer rally in Washington , liberals know the window is closing on their plan to nationalize one - sixth of America ’s economy and put our health care decisions in the hands of government bureaucrats .
So they are working in the dark to ram this through before most Americans find out .
Even with all the subterfuge , some details have slipped out :
-- Do what we say , not what we do -- Congress has exempted itself from mandatory coverage provisions that they want to impose on their fellow citizens .
-- Taxing through higher deduction requirements —
Dick Morris has been warning everyone that the seven - and - a- half percent trigger to deduct medical expenses on your federal tax return will be bumped to ten percent .
That would shake billions out of people ’s pockets who have had to spend significant money on health care , and will be an effective violation of the Obama campaign promise not to raise taxes on Americans making less than $ 250,000 .
-- Taxing Class
II medical devices , such as breast pumps , pacemakers , ventilators , wheelchairs and needles .
Call this the “ mommy tax . ”
-- Different tax rates for people in different states .
The Wall Street Journal ’s Kimberly Strassel reports : “ Majority Leader Harry Reid … worked out a deal by which the federal government will pay all of his home state ’s additional Medicaid expenses for the next five years .
Under the majority leader ’s very special formula , only three other states – Oregon , Rhode Island and Michigan – qualify for this perk . ”
This means that Americans in other states would subsidize constituents of Harry Reid and some of his political friends .
A dozen Democratic governors have come out against the Medicaid mandate as a budget buster , but Reid is covering his own political interests – with your money .
Are you angry yet ?
Rep. Michelle Bachmann ( R - Minn . ) took to the floor of the House during the earlier spendathon and said the nation is in the grip of “ gangster government , ” in which powerful interests are raiding the treasury to ensure their own continued power .
The health care “ reform ” bill is more of the same , but even more dangerous .
This is about the government ’s power of life and death over our families , not just our wallets .
The liberal “ mainstream ” media are providing cover for all this .
None is asking to see the health bill language .
You have to go to places like the Media Research Center ’s Newsbusters blog , where Brent Bozell exposed the Reid plan .
The Left will get away with all this unless Americans speak out now and let them know in no uncertain terms that this is unacceptable and tyrannical .
America needs to speak with a loud , single demand of our rulers in Washington :
“ Show me the bill ! ”

Rules drawn up to regulate homeopathic medicines are not underpinned by scientific evidence , according to government documents
The House of Commons science and technology committee is a wonderful thing .
The attendees - overwhelmingly Labour and Lib Dems as it happens - identify serious issues and call on the best minds in the country to come and give evidence .
This is pulled together and after some serious debate , the committee publishes concrete recommendations .
This is how things should be done .
One of the committee 's recent drives has been to quiz government about its use of scientific evidence in policy making .
They do n't have a great record on this , but I can't think of a previous government that has .
Earlier today , the committee released the government 's responses to its latest round of " evidence checks " - in which the committee sensibly badgers departments to reveal the scientific evidence they consulted before tackling various issues .
The responses include government 's justification - or not - for policies to improve literacy , the teaching of pseudoscience at universities and licensing homeopathic medicines .
You can see the whole lot here .
The first few pages of the report cover homeopathy , in particular the scientific evidence used by the government to decide which homeopathic medicines to licence .
It begins by explaining :
" Because homeopathic products have a long and established traditional use in the UK , the licensing regime functions primarily to ensure that they are both safe and of suitable quality .
It also functions to provide improved and consistent product information for consumers . "
Except how it is supposed to work .
The response , from the Department of Health , lists three elements that make up the UK's licensing regime , including the National Rules Scheme , which our Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency brought in three years ago .
On this , the department is clear :
" No scientific evidence was examined in drawing up the National Rules Scheme ... "
Some of the other responses are more heartening , but I wo n't go through all of them in detail here .
One more I will mention is the committee 's request to the Department of Business , Innovation and Skills , for information on the government 's position on universities offering BSc and MSc degrees for courses that are blatantly pseudoscientific .
The DBIS response begins :
" The government does not find it helpful to define pseudoscience . "
And goes on to say , essentially , that universities can run whatever courses they like , no matter the quality .
It 's a good start for the committee and refreshing to see the government being called to account on the evidence that underpins its actions .
Pirates !
French presidency makes 400 unauthorized copies of DVD
The French satirical investigative journalism weekly “ Le Canard Enchaîné ” reveals that our holier - than - thou presidency is in fact a pirate ’s lair .
In a stunning display of hypocrisy , the presidential audiovisual services produced 400 unauthorized copies of the 52 minutes documentary “ A visage découvert : Nicolas Sarkozy “ .
The editor , Galaxie Press had only shipped 50 copies , but the propaganda plan required more so the Elysee went to work , going as far as modifying the cover and replacing the Galaxie Presse name and logos with “ Service audiovisuel de la présidence de la République ” .
Is n’t is deliciously ironic that the same executive power is the main force behind the latest disgusting bungled piece of French legislation regulating and controlling the usage of the Internet in order to enforce the compliance to the copyright law ?
It is even more appalling that we are dealing with repeat offenders : last spring , while the Hadopi law was discussed , U.S. music duo MGMT received € 30,000 as a settlement for a copyright infringement by French President Nicolas Sarkozy ’s party who used one of its songs at a political rally without permission .
Those who led the charge against Internet users are not the most respectful of copyright .
Hadopi is also known as the “ three strikes ” law because it after a certain number of warnings a copyright infringer ’s Internet access would be cut off .
Hadopi has just been adopted .
Nicolas – one more of those antics and your Internet access is toast !

EVE Online Windows and Mac players duel in space , while Dust 514 Xbox and PlayStation players slug it out on the ground , and the latter informs the former in Icelandic developer CCP 's surprise GDC Europe announcement breaking this morning across the pond .
You read right : Dust 514 ( EVE buffs , explain the name please ? ) is a " first-person-shooter-massively-multiplayer-online-real - time - strategy - MMO " ( one sec , catching my breath ) designed for consoles , and it 's linked with EVE Online , CCP 's sophisticated science fiction space - trading game .
Linked , according to CCP , in that Dust " becomes an input " for the computer - based MMO and " dictates " aspects of its content .
Imagine snapping the locks off planetary abstraction in EVE and you 've got the gist of Dust 514 .
Now you 'll be able to visit the planets in the EVE Online universe and see what the fuss is all about up close and personal .
According to CCP , you assume the role of a marine doing , well , what marines do best in conflict zones .
The backstory involves something to do with cloned soldiers , and we 'll see more teasers in an upcoming EVE book .
You knew there were books about EVE , right ?
The first just arrived in the US on August 4th .
Dust 514 , how grim you look .
( Click to enlarge )
Remember the 1990s ?
When we speculated about the day an MMO might combine the AT - AT and Snowspeeder planet - side fighting on Hoth in Star Wars The Empire Strikes Back with dueling high above the planet in X - Wings and Tie-Fighters ?
Looks like that day may finally be here .
So it 's not Star Wars .
So what .
Between you and me , EVE Online is better .
According to CCP CEO Hilmar Veigar Petursson ( quoted by Develop ) :
There are ways in which these communities will meld in time .
Our hope is that alliances will start to form and we will have social structures that spills over from the console game to the PC one .
Or you might be able to control parts of the universe with both games .
So while one fleet does the flying , the troops do the dying .
I mention Xbox and PlayStation gamers in the intro-- both seem likely -- but know that CCP 's only saying " consoles " at this point .
Dust 514 for the Wii ?
Hey , anything 's possible .
Further details will be revealed at CCP ’s annual Fanfest event October 1 - 3 , 2009 in Reykjavik , Iceland .
No word on release timeframes yet .
Looking a bit Halo 3 : ODST , no ?
( Click to enlarge . )
CCP says Dust 514 has been in development at the company 's Shanghai studio for the past three years .
Props to CCP for keeping it under their hats this long then .
Surprises in a rumor - riddled industry are actually kind of nice .
Oh , and Sony ... take notes .

ColorOfChange announced today that three advertisers have said that they are dropping Beck :
Three companies who run ads during Glenn Beck — NexisLexis - owned Lawyers.com , Procter & Gamble and Progressive Insurance — today distanced themselves from Beck .
LexisNexis has pulled its advertising from Beck and says it has no plans to advertise on the program in the future .
Both Procter & Gamble and Progressive Insurance called the Beck advertising placements an error that they would correct .
The decision by the three companies comes as over 45,000 ColorofChange.org members call on advertisers to pull their ads from Glenn Beck after the controversial news host called President Obama a “ racist ” who “ has a deep - seated hatred for white people ” on “ Fox & Friends ” last week .
MEXICO CITY  “ Piece of cake , ” the three police officers might have thought when they spied the rental car with five American tourists driving down the main drag of Cancún ’s hotel zone .
They pulled the car over and told the driver , Scott Fischbach , that he was going about a mile an hour over the speed limit , recalled his wife , Michelle L. Fischbach .
One of the officers cupped his hands and asked Mr. Fischbach to blow into them .
“ This was their Breathalyzer , ” Mrs. Fischbach said , recounting her astonishment on the last night of her vacation with her husband , his sister and brother - in - law and their daughter .
“ They tried very hard , but Scott does n’t drink . ”
The police took his driver ’s license and told him they would take him to jail unless he came up with $ 300 , she said .
The patrol car escorted the family back to the hotel , where she says the group came up with the money .
The officers declined to write a receipt .

Michael Schumacher has backed Jenson Button to convert his 14 - point lead into a first world championship title .
The German , who retired from Formula 1 at the end of the 2006 season , believes that with Red Bull drivers Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel now over 25 points behind and Button having a cushion over team - mate Rubens Barrichello , the 29 - year - old is clear favourite .
" Looking at the situation , I would pretty much expect Jenson to fix this title , " Schumacher told the Race of Champions podcast .
" It 's very hard to take it away , particularly knowing the problems and the reliability issues they have had at Red Bull .
" The mileage Sebastian has left in his hands as well [ is a problem ] , so it 's going to be tough to challenge and the points difference is too much . "
Despite Vettel 's title challenge fading , Schumacher believes that his 22 - year - old compatriot can become a multiple world champion - although he added that comparisons with his own career are worthless .
" He has all the ingredients to do so , " said Schumacher of Vettel 's chances of winning multiple titles .
" I myself never wanted to be compared with anybody else because I wanted to be myself and so he wants to .
I think everybody should respect that . "
Schumacher would not comment on whether the abandonment of his comeback with Ferrari earlier this year means that any chance of a return to F1 has now gone .
" I do n't need to say yes and I do n't need to say no , " said Schumacher .

About 400 employees at AIG Financial Products shared more than $ 168 million between December 2008 and March 2009 , after AIG received bailout money from the government , the newspaper reported .
That included a cash retention bonus of $ 7,700 for a kitchen assistant , $ 700 for a “ file administrator , ” according to the FT .
Senior executives took home bonuses of up to $ 4 million .
The financial products unit is scheduled to be awarded another $ 198 million in retention bonuses next March , but the Treasury Department ’s “ pay czar ” Kenneth Feinberg wants that reduced .
Feinberg has not specified the amount of reduction and it ’s unclear whether he can compel AIG to lower the bonuses , Reuters reported .
The deal will help to create jobs , according to the EU The European Union and South Korea have signed a trade deal that could be worth up to 19bn euros ( $ 28 bn ; £ 17bn ) to European exporters .
The deal would remove most of the trade tariffs between the two partners .
It would " create opportunities for European companies in services , manufacturing and agriculture , " said EU Trade Commissioner Catherine Ashton .
The EU said it was " the most important free trade agreement ever negotiated [ with ] a third country " .
' Substantial commitments ' Baroness Ashton told the BBC : " At the time of economic downturn , it 's even more important that we find new opportunities to be able to sell goods .
" Korea imports about 25bn euros from the EU and 6bn euros of services each year - this is a really good opportunity , lowering barriers to enable markets to grow . "

She added that the deal would help fight the economic downturn and create new jobs .
The deal would see the removal of 1.6bn euros of duties for exporters to Korea .
The EU said telecommunications , environmental , legal , financial and shipping companies would see some of the greatest benefits , with Korea making " substantial commitments " to liberalise these sectors .
But the deal was not universally hailed as a positive breakthrough .
Ivan Hodac , secretary general of the European Automobile Manufacturers ' Association ( EAMA ) , said the agreement benefited South Korea , but not the EU .
He said a major cause for concern was allowing Korean manufacturers to reclaim duties paid on cheap imports from neighbouring countries - so - called duty drawback .
EU manufacturers could not do the same , the EAMA said .
He also argued that there was nothing to stop South Korea implementing new regulations to restrict access to its markets .
" It creates unfair competition - the European market will be totally open , but the Korean market will not be open for us , " he argued .
The agreement is expected to come into force in the second half of next year , once it has been ratified by the European Parliament .
Trade between the EU and Korea was worth about 65bn euros in 2008 .

A convicted murderer faces execution in Texas after jurors consulted the Bible while deliberating on his sentence .
Amnesty International has appealed to the state to commute the sentence on Khristian Oliver , 32 , who is due to die on November 5 .
He was sentenced to death in 1999 for murdering a man whose home Oliver was burgling .
The victim was shot in the face and beaten with his own rifle .
It later emerged that while deciding whether he should be given the death penalty , jurors consulted the Bible .
Four jury members admitted that several copies had been in the jury room and that highlighted passages were passed around .
At one point , a juror reportedly read aloud from a copy , including the passage : " And if he smite him with an instrument of iron , so that he die , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death . "
Defence lawyers argued in appeals that jurors had been improperly influenced by the Bibles but the trial judge rejected the claim , a decision upheld by a Texas appeals court .
The US constitution calls for the separation of state and religion .
In 2005 , the state supreme court in Colorado overturned a death penalty on a convicted murderer because jurors had consulted the Bible while deliberating over his sentence .
Commuting Robert Harlan 's sentence to life imprisonment without parole , the court ruled that the Bible constituted an " improper outside influence " and a reliance on what it called a " higher authority " .
However , a federal appeals court ruled last year that while the Bible should not have been allowed into the deliberation room at Oliver 's trial , there was no clear evidence to indicate they had influenced the jurors ' decision .
In April this year , the US Supreme Court refused to hear Oliver 's appeal .
Kate Allen , Amnesty International 's UK director , said Oliver 's trial was a " travesty " .
" Religious texts provide consolation and spiritual guidance for billions of people the world over , but this use of the Bible to decide life or death in a capital trial is deeply , deeply troubling , " she said .

Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley said today that all the medical marijuana dispensaries in the county are operating illegally , and that " they are going to be prosecuted . "
There are hundreds of dispensaries throughout the county , including as many as 800 in the city of Los Angeles , according to the city attorney 's office .
They operate under a 1996 voter initiative that allowed marijuana to be used for medicinal purposes , and a subsequent state law that provided for collective cultivation .
Based on a state Supreme Court decision last year , Cooley and City Attorney Carmen Trutanich have concluded that over - the - counter sales are illegal .
Most if not all of the dispensaries in the state operate on that basis .

And all the crises and reforms ( real reforms , too ) so occupied the people that they did not see the slow motion underneath , of the whole process of government growing remoter and remoter …
The dictatorship , and the whole process of its coming into being , was above all diverting .
It provided an excuse not to think for people who did not want to think anyway .

The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies , one , perhaps , of the Right and the other of the Left , is a foolish idea acceptable only to doctrinaire and academic thinkers .
Instead , the two parties should be almost identical , so that the American people can ‘ throw the rascals out ’ at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy .

Reporting from College Station , Texas –
In a glowing tribute to a Republican predecessor , President Obama on Friday praised President George H.W. Bush as an example of someone who eschewed “ a life of comfort and privilege ” and instead devoted himself to public service — inside government and out .
During an evening speech to honor the public service institute that Bush founded two decades ago , Obama called for cooperation between Republicans and Democrats .
The former president , he said , proved that “ the R or D next to your name is irrelevant ” in challenging times .
“ You might not always know it from watching the cable news shows or listening to folks on the radio , ” Obama said , but “ I think we ’re standing in one of those moments . ”
For his part , Bush reflected on Obama — the man who succeeded his son , President George W. Bush — as someone who at their initial meeting showed greater concern for Hurricane Katrina evacuees than for the television cameras .
“ He came without fanfare , ” Bush said of Obama ’s 2005 visit to the region .
“ He was someone I could quickly see was genuinely concerned about helping others . ”
They were joined onstage Friday in the Texas A&M University auditorium by Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates , who also served in the previous administration and was CIA director under the elder Bush .
The event presented a slightly odd situation , given that Obama ’s administration has at times broadcast a rejection of policies and ideas under George W. Bush .
On Thursday , Obama had fielded tough questions in New Orleans about the federal response in the four years since Katrina .
And he was not subtle in pointing to the failings of the younger Bush ’s administration .
Friends of George H.W. Bush said that he has a genuine regard for Obama and that he came up with the idea six months ago of inviting the president to come to this college town to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Points of Light Institute .
The former president is said to be unhappy with the Bush - bashing in Washington , but one former advisor said George H.W. Bush does n’t hold it against Obama .
“ Politics is politics , ” said Ron Kaufman , a former White House political director .
“ But some things are bigger than that .
He , like other Americans , would like to see the president be successful . ”
Nevertheless , in the heart of Republican country , Obama inspired some protests and criticism .
Outside the auditorium Friday , a crowd of more than 100 chanted and waved signs , including one about the Obama administration ’s spending and one about the national debt .
Inside , Bush had put together a polite and enthusiastic crowd .
The former president , who celebrated his 85th birthday in June with a parachute jump , walked gingerly with a cane .
But he spoke in an unwavering voice of his admiration for Obama .
The evening was devoted to lauding the work of the Points of Light Institute , the name of which comes from a speech Bush gave envisioning the combined effect of individuals in public service .
Obama called on the audience of mostly college students to find time in their lives for service , even when it is n’t convenient or easy .
If the senior Bush could serve in combat missions overseas , Obama said , then “ you can keep going when your service project gets tough . ”
“ He did n’t call for one blinding light shining from Washington , ” Obama said .
“ He did n’t just call for a few bright lights from the biggest nonprofits .
. . .
He called for a vast galaxy of people and institutions working to solve problems in their own backyard . ”

A woman convicted of killing her husband by tying him to their bed and stabbing him almost 200 times will get a new punishment phase because of ineffective assistance of counsel in her trial , an appeals court ruled Wednesday .
The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled that Susan Wright deserves another opportunity to convince a jury that she deserves a lenient sentence .
Her attorney , Brian Wice , said jurors should have heard from certain witnesses , including Jeffrey Wright 's former fiance and an expert on battered women syndrome .
If her attorneys can convince a new jury that Wright killed in “ sudden passion ” her punishment would be capped at 20 years .
If jurors decide against sudden passion , she could face a maximum sentence of life in prison .
Wright 's trial entered courthouse lore when then - prosecutor Kelly Siegler tied her co-counsel to a bed in the courtroom , climbed on him and acted out the stabbing .
Siegler 's “ overzealous ” dramatics were unfair to Wright , her former attorney , Neal Davis , said .
“ Because Kelly Siegler 's antics devolved into some cheap made - for - TV movie , Susan was deprived of a fair trial .
That 's just the reality . ”
Siegler , who left the Harris County District Attorney 's office after a failed bid in the district attorney 's race last year , stood by the conviction Wednesday .
“ What exactly is overzealous about re-enacting the murder just as the defendant committed it with the very same weapon she used to slaughter Jeffrey in their bed ? ”
Siegler wrote in response to questions from the Houston Chronicle .
“ The point of the re-enactment was to freeze in the minds of the jurors how cold - bloodedly , cruelly and methodically Susan Wright murdered the father of her babies . ”
Wright was convicted of murder in March 2004 and sentenced to 25 years for killing Jeffrey Wright , 34 , at the couple 's northwest Harris County home Jan. 13 , 2003 .
He suffered 193 stab wounds , according to medical examiners .
Siegler noted that the appellate court faulted Davis for ineffective assistance in the brief ruling .
The panel did not discuss why it found him ineffective .
Davis said the reasons behind the reversal did not matter to him .
“ I'm ecstatic , ” Davis said .
“ I 'm very happy she will have a new sentencing hearing and , hopefully , obtain some justice . ”
A new punishment phase typically involves retrying most of the guilt - innocence evidence , as well as punishment phase evidence .
Davis said he hoped the district attorney 's office would negotiate a plea agreement instead of going through a retrial .
The Harris County District Attorney 's
Office is reviewing the case to decide whether to re-try the punishment phase , said Roe Wilson , the chief of the office 's post - conviction writs division .
“ It 's fair to say that , at this point , we anticipate a new punishment phase , ” Wilson said .
“ But , ultimately , it 's the district attorney 's decision . ”

This debate drives me bonkers because it ’s so ham - handed .
Many of us do not want more bureaucracy controlling our lives ; we also do not want to support those who do not have their acts together .
Why ?
Natural selection benefits us and makes a better world for our kids — after all , natural selection got humans this smart in the first place .
We do n’t want some 90 IQ idiot criminal ruining life for people with 120 IQs and good moral character .
But then people demand a bureaucratic solution , claiming that ( a ) we owe it to all people who happen to be human and ( b ) bureaucratic well - intentioned solutions are a good answer .
They then point to the post office and medicare / medicaid , forgetting that the post office is quasi - commercialized and market - regulated , and medicare / medicaid are not socialized medicine but reimbursement programs .
I propose a middle option that gives both sides what they desire :
Have our government , pooling the resources we ’ve handed to it through taxes , purchase a health care plan for its employees — all American citizens .
Then let us buy it at the reduced rate available , and let the private market regulate it , because although neither free enterprise nor government regulation are ideal , free enterprise reacts more quickly .
This would satisfy both sides .
The vastness of government is used to reduce the cost of health care , and yet , it is also purchased so that the irresponsible and disorganized who spend their money on wine and entertainment instead of necessities manage to hopefully kill themselves off .
In the meantime , let ’s talk about problems with health care :
Overloaded hospitals : forced to take everyone who shows up , they have long wait times , unless you ’ve paid extra to have expedited health care in the form of a physician who can check you in directly .
Incompetent doctors : many of these people are doctors because of the monetary reward , and demonstrate little competence .
Incompetent nurses : believe it or not , a nurse is your primary caregiver in a hospital or doctor ’s office .
Many of these are oblivious , lazy and under -educated .
Nosocomial infections : hospitals are breeding grounds for disease .
Maybe a redesign would help .
See below .
Poor design of hospitals : these are austere , mechanical places .
Announcements ring out constantly .
Every 45 minutes , someone comes by to do another small task like take temperature or apply pills .
It ’s nearly impossible to get rest .
Bad diagnostic skills : physicians find a niche , and get used to seeing the same ten causes and solutions , and so anything outside of that is bungled .
Maybe rotate them , like we do active duty military personnel ?
No sacralization : by trapping doctors in this debate , we ’re alienated them behind mountains of paperwork , bureaucratic rules and poverty , when we really need them to be developing empathy for patients and improved skills .
Just a few thoughts while this debate rages on .
At the end of the day , it ’s not about socialized medicine … it ’s about the liberal worldview ( people first , even incompetents ) versus the conservative one ( ideals first , natural selection ) and for that reason , no one on either side is actually thinking about health care itself .

For decades , climate scientists have worked to identify and measure key substances -- notably greenhouse gases and aerosol particles -- that affect Earth 's climate .
And they 've been aided by ever more sophisticated computer models that make estimating the relative impact of each type of pollutant more reliable .
Yet the complexity of nature -- and the models used to quantify it -- continues to serve up surprises .
The most recent ?
Certain gases that cause warming are so closely linked with the production of aerosols that the emissions of one type of pollutant can indirectly affect the quantity of the other .
And for two key gases that cause warming , these so - called " gas-aerosol interactions " can amplify their impact .
" We 've known for years that methane and carbon monoxide have a warming effect , " said Drew Shindell , a climate scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS ) in New York and lead author of a study published this week in Science .
" But our new findings suggest these gases have a significantly more powerful warming impact than previously thought . "
Mixing a Chemical Soup
When vehicles , factories , landfills , and livestock emit methane and carbon monoxide into the atmosphere , they are doing more than just increasing their atmospheric concentrations .
The release of these gases also have indirect effects on a variety of other atmospheric constituents , including reducing the production of particles called aerosols that can influence both the climate and the air quality .
These two gases , as well as others , are part of a complicated cascade of chemical reactions that features competition with aerosols for highly reactive molecules that cleanse the air of pollutants .
Aerosols can have either a warming or cooling effect , depending on their composition , but the two aerosol types that Shindell modeled -- sulfates and nitrates -- scatter incoming light and affect clouds in ways that cool Earth .
They are also related to the formation of acid rain and can cause respiratory distress and other health problems for those who breathe them .

Human activity is a major source of sulfate aerosols , but smokestacks do n't emit sulfate particles directly .
Rather , coal power production and other industrial processes release sulfur dioxide -- the same gas that billows from volcanoes -- that later reacts with atmospheric molecules called hydroxyl radicals to produce sulfates as a byproduct .
Hydroxyl is so reactive scientists consider it an atmospheric " detergent " or " scrubber " because it cleanses the atmosphere of many types of pollution .
In the chemical soup of the lower atmosphere , however , sulfur dioxide is n't the only substance interacting with hydroxyl .
Similar reactions influence the creation of nitrate aerosols .
And hydroxyls drive long chains of reactions involving other common gases , including ozone .
Methane and carbon monoxide use up hydroxyl that would otherwise produce sulfate , thereby reducing the concentration of sulfate aerosols .
It 's a seemingly minor change , but it makes a difference to the climate .
" More methane means less hydroxyl , less sulfate , and more warming , " Shindell explained .
His team 's modeling experiment , one of the first to rigorously quantify the impact of gas - aerosol interactions on both climate and air quality , showed that increases in global methane emissions have caused a 26 percent decrease in hydroxyl and an 11 percent decrease in the number concentration of sulfate particles .
Reducing sulfate unmasks methane 's warming by 20 to 40 percent over current estimates , but also helps reduce negative health effects from sulfate aerosols .
In comparison , the model calculated that global carbon monoxide emissions have caused a 13 percent reduction in hydroxyl and 9 percent reduction in sulfate aerosols .

Nitrogen oxides -- pollutants produced largely by power plants , trucks , and cars -- led to overall cooling when their effects on aerosol particles are included , said Nadine Unger , another coauthor on the paper and a climate scientist at GISS .
That 's noteworthy because nitrogen oxides have primarily been associated with ozone formation and warming in the past .
A New Approach
To determine the climate impact of particular greenhouse gases , scientists have traditionally relied on surface stations and satellites to measure the concentration of each gas in the air .
Then , they have extrapolated such measurements to arrive at a global estimate .
The drawback to that " abundance - based approach , " explained Gavin Schmidt , another GISS climate scientist and coauthor of the study , is that it does n't account for the constant interactions that occur between various atmospheric constituents .
Nor is it easy to parse out whether pollutants have human or natural origins .
" You get a much more accurate picture of how human emissions are impacting the climate -- and how policy makers might effectively counteract climate change -- if you look at what 's emitted at the surface rather than what ends up in the atmosphere , " said Shindell , who used this " emissions - based " approach as the groundwork for this modeling project .
However , the abundance - based approach serves as the foundation of key international climate treaties , such as the Kyoto Protocol or the carbon dioxide cap - and - trade plans being discussed among policymakers .
Such treaties underestimate the contributions of methane and carbon monoxide to global warming , Shindell said .
Unpacking the Implications
According to Shindell , the new findings underscore the importance of devising multi-pronged strategies to address climate change rather than focusing exclusively on carbon dioxide .
" Our calculations suggest that all the non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases together have a net impact that rivals the warming caused by carbon dioxide . "
In particular , the study reinforces the idea that proposals to reduce methane may be an easier place for policy makers to start climate change agreements .
" Since we already know how to capture methane from animals , landfills , and sewage treatment plants at fairly low cost , targeting methane makes sense , " said Michael MacCracken , chief scientist for the Climate Institute in Washington , D.C .
This research also provides regulators insight into how certain pollution mitigation strategies might simultaneously affect climate and air quality .
Reductions of carbon monoxide , for example , would have positive effects for both climate and the public 's health , while reducing nitrogen oxide could have a positive impact on health but a negative impact on the climate .
" The bottom line is that the chemistry of the atmosphere can get hideously complicated , " said Schmidt .
" Sorting out what affects climate and what affects air quality is n't simple , but we 're making progress . "
Leszek Kolakowski , an exiled Polish philosopher who turned against his Marxist beliefs and became an intellectual leader of Poland ’s democracy movement , died Friday at a hospital in Oxford , England .
He was 81 .
The cause was “ a sudden , short disease , ” according to a death announcement by the family in the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper , the Associated Press reported .
Kolakowski , who had lived and taught mainly at Oxford since his expulsion from Poland as a dissident in 1968 , was the author of more than 30 books , of which the most influential was “ Main Currents of Marxism ” ( 1978 ) .
The massive , three - volume work is considered the definitive history and critique of Marxism , which he branded “ the greatest fantasy of the 20th century . ”
“ We have lost a man who rendered remarkable services in the cause of a free and democratic Poland , ” the speaker of Poland ’s parliament , Bronislaw Komorowski , told deputies who observed a minute of silence for Kolakowski .
The recipient of a MacArthur fellowship award in 1983 , the Jefferson Lecture award from the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1986 and the $ 1 - million Kluge Prize from the Library of Congress in 2003 , Kolakowski was also an essayist , playwright and historian of religion whose writing was praised by critics for its lucid , accessible style .
“ Very rarely can one identify a deep , reflective thinker who has had such a wide range of inquiry and demonstrable importance to major political events in his own time , ” James H. Billington , the librarian of Congress , said when Kolakowski was announced as the first Kluge Prize winner .
Born in Radom , Poland , on Oct. 23 , 1927 , Kolakowski grew up in Lodz under German occupation and went to underground schools .
“ I remember the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto , ” he wrote in a 1978 essay , “ Genocide and Ideology , ” and he knew Poles who risked their lives trying to rescue Jews .
After the war , he joined the Communist Party .
He earned a doctorate from the University of Warsaw in 1953 and joined its faculty in 1959 .
The orthodox Marxist became progressively disenchanted in postwar Poland .
The disillusionment began with a three - month sojourn in Moscow in 1950 that awakened him to the intellectual and cultural poverty of Soviet life .
His calls for a more democratic version of socialism led him into conflicts with censors , causing him to be expelled from the Communist Party in 1966 ; he was removed from his teaching post two years later .
Placed on an index of forbidden authors , he was virtually expunged from Polish intellectual life for two decades .
In exile he taught at a number of universities in the West , including UC Berkeley , McGill University in Montreal , the University of Chicago and Oxford ’s All Souls College .
From Oxford he provided intellectual sustenance in the 1980s to leaders of Poland ’s Solidarity movement , who described him as an “ awakener of human hopes . ”
A contrarian by nature , he was appalled by the chaos of Berkeley in the late 1960s , terming the student movement “ simply barbaric . ”
English historian E.P. Thompson and other critics on the left considered him politically incorrect , to which he issued a rejoinder , titled “ My Correct Views on Everything ” ( 1973 ) .
Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski said Monday that Kolakowski ’s body would be returned to the country and buried with military honors .

Everyone who follows
Intel as it makes the case for low - power , ultramobile x86 knows that the company has two code phrases that it employs in varying forms in its pitch : Intel processors support the " full Internet experience , " and they support the complete " IA installed base . "
The first of these ( the full Internet experience ) is code for " Adobe Flash , " and the second ( IA installed base ) is code for " Windows . "
However , recent news out of Computex challenges the relevance of both of these pro-x86 arguments .
First up is the joint announcement by Adobe and NVIDIA that Adobe is optimizing Flash to run on Tegra and take advantage of NVIDIA 's mobile GPUs .
The previously announced Flash port to ARM , along with the related open screen project , had already put Intel on notice that their " full Internet experience " talking point has a very limited shelf life , and the fact that Adobe is optimizing for GPU acceleration on Tegra further seals its fate .
But the Flash announcement is n't all roses for NVIDIA .
Flash probably needs to be optimized for GPU acceleration , given that Tegra 's ARM11 core looks pretty weak compared to Atom for regular , general - purpose workloads ( this includes browsing Flash - enabled sites ) .
This weakness also means that , while Tegra can be put into a netbook , it 's not quite ideal , and even with the GPU optimization Atom - based netbooks may still boast a better Flash experience than the Tegra - based competition .
ARM / Android vs. Wintel in the netbook market
Also coming out of COMPUTEX this year is a growing chorus of buzz around Android as a netbook OS , buzz that 's mostly stoked by Qualcomm 's display of a very thin , Snapdragon - based ASUS EeePC prototype running android , and by Acer 's announcement that it will release an Android - based netbook ( allegedly based on Atom ) in the third quarter of this year .
It seems likely that a number of vendors will be jumping on the Android / netbook bandwagon , and if that happens , this will almost certainly eat into Windows XP 's netbook marketshare .
By extension , this would weaken the usefulness of the " it runs Windows " part of Intel 's case for Atom .
But that does n't mean that Atom 's netbook appeal is eliminated entirely .
I pointed out above that Tegra does n't look so hot vs .
Atom as a general - purpose computing processor , and I suspect this is true of Snapdragon as well ( though I can't find a block diagram of the latter 's core ) .
ARM 's Cortex
A9 will be a different story altogether , and will compete directly with Atom in raw performance on general - purpose code .
But until A9 comes out , ARM - based netbook makers are going to be forced to run OSes designed to maximize the scarce execution resources of mobile phones .
This is why Android is being floated as a netbook OS , despite the fact that , as we previously �explained in some detail , it 's pretty unsuited for this purpose .
But if Android netbooks ( or " smartbooks , " as the ARM coalition is calling them ) gain traction with users as a bare - bones , all - day - battery - life alternative to Windows / Atom - based netbooks , OEMs can later transition to a more robust distro like Ubuntu , which will eventually run Android apps , and which has an ARM port .
As I said in the previous article on Tegra , Intel 's Atom and its successors will remain the hardware of choice for the very sizable number of people who need a low - cost Windows netbook .
But for everyone who does n't need to run Windows , or for customers in developing countries who do n't want to pay the Microsoft tax , Flash - enabled , ARM may be the netbook CPU architecture of choice .
When I was in Australia visiting Ephox ’s awesome engineering team recently , it was suggested that we should be seriously looking at using Scala for some or all of the server side development we have coming up .
The key benefit that was described to me was based on productivity – I certainly think that has merit but I ’m somewhat more interested in it being a potential solution to the new cross platform problem .
Options like JRuby and Jython are also a possibility in this space , but Scala fits more nicely into a Java programmers mind - set and is designed with the JVM in mind , so while it pushes a lot of boundaries , ultimately it fits with the JVM and Java very nicely .
So I read through the O’Reilly Programming Scala book on the plane ride home , then jumped in and built a small but real - world project with Scala and integrated it into a Java servlet project .
I think it ’s given me a pretty good grounding in what Scala can do , the benefits it brings and the general state of play .
The Language
The Scala language is fantastic .
Easy to learn if you have a solid programming background and just a smidgeon of functional programming knowledge .
I ’ve always been on the fence between compile time and runtime typing , but I think Scala strikes the perfect balance .
It ’s strictly typed at compile time , but uses a lot of inference so you do n’t have to constantly declare types .
I quickly came to find that there are two places where it ’s incredibly handy to always specify types :
Parameters .
Scala requires it anyway , but it is vital documentation for anyone who wants to call that method .
Return types .
Not usually required by Scala , but by being explicit you can catch quite a lot of weird errors that crop up and isolate them to the right method .
If you leave the return type as inferred , the compile error you get usually comes out on the caller of a method and can be somewhat confusing .
The most common error here is effectively not returning something or returning two different types by accident ( usually because you expected a different return type from a method you called ) .
This is n’t hard and fast – short , simple methods are usually best left inferred .
Having closures is definitely handy , but the benefit is n’t really in closures themselves .
What really makes a difference is the libraries designed to be used with closures , and the functional programming style that comes naturally in Scala .
Looking back at the code I ’ve written , the structure really looks like something that would make sense as a mathematical equation – each method does one thing , consistently and without side - effects .
More importantly though , the breakdown of methods that results winds up being quite logical and helps reusability a lot .
I find that getting the split points for methods right in Java is much harder and requires more conscious thought .
Traits – wow do I ever love these things .
The first key benefit I found for them was unit testing .
In Java , one class would tend to be responsible for loading and processing it ’s data .
In Scala , traits make it so easy for the class to declare an abstract variable for the data and just provide the processing .
Traits then step in to provide the loading part and provide a concrete implementation of the variable .
It becomes obvious to have a LoadFromDatabase trait , a HardCodedString trait or a LoadFromFile trait – now where the data comes from is clearly separated .
In tests you just use a HardCodedString trait and there ’s no need for Mocks or Stubs .
Interestingly , there is a wonderful synergy between traits and JNDI .
Traits ca n’t accept constructor arguments and even if they could it ’s ideal to just declare that you want a new Widget ( ) with DatabaseLoading and have it just work .
JNDI gives you that ability – the DatabaseLoading trait just grabs the datasource from JNDI and there ’s no need to tunnel parameters through to it like you would otherwise .
I ’m also a big fan of the uniform access principle that Scala uses .
Essentially , from the caller ’s perspective , there is no visible difference between accessing a public variable and accessing a public method .
So you can have a base class that declares an abstract variable , then implement it with a concrete method in a subclass and visa - versa .
It ’s an incredibly simple concept that gives a lot of flexibility and avoids a ton of boilerplate code .
The Tools
This is the weak point of Scala , but it shows some promise .
Testing Libraries
There are actually quite a few testing libraries in Scala – all of them somewhat difficult to get working inside an IDE or Ant build , but all quite solid and stable if you use their test runners .
The xUnit equivalent is ScalaTest , I never got it working with Ant or Eclipse so gave up and moved on to Specs .
I love it .
The Aussie dev team recently switched from CamelCase test method names to using underscores for readability , but Specs takes that a few steps further by letting you use strings .
For example :
“ Administrator users ” should { “ have a password at least 8 characters long ” in { … code goes here … } “ be in the admin group ” in { … code goes here … } }
The test output is really easy to read using the Specs runner , but it gets much less readable when using JUnit to run the tests via ant .
You can avoid the outer ‘ should ’ block which helps readability in JUnit but it ’s still not great .
Fortunately , IntelliJ has support for Specs directly and lays things out pretty well , plus the normal runner is n’t bad .
Standard Toolchain
The Scala distribution comes with a good set of tools .
A scala command for executing scripts and scalac for compiling classes are the main two .
Both work really nicely and the scala tool is particular good for experimenting with things – especially when you ’re trying to learn the type inference system .
The single biggest drawback is that scalac can’t compile Java code , so you can either have Scala code depending on Java code or Java code depending on Scala code , but ca n’t do both easily .
This is n’t all bad , as it really encourages you to break the project down into independent libraries and reduce coupling but it would be nice to more easily mix languages .
IDEs
Wow , these are terrible .
The Eclipse plugin is incredibly buggy and is practically unusable .
NetBeans seemed to work well but is very short on features .
IntelliJ has a good set of features but has overall stability issues since you need to use an early access build of the IDE – the plugin itself seems quite stable .
IntelliJ also has some support for Specs and ScalaTest rather than having to run them through JUnit which is quite nice , but it did n’t seem able to just find all the tests in my project and run them – it was limited to one package at a time .
Getting Scala working in IntelliJ is an absolute nightmare and you ’ll spend forever searching Google for answers .
There are magic libraries you need to put in place and very cryptic error messages if you do n’t have them – at least it ’s a once off .
Once the Scala plugin works with a released version of IntelliJ I think that will be the winner , otherwise I may have to deal with NetBeans .
Java Libraries
They work really nicely , except that Scala does n’t use the normal java.util Collections framework .
Scala has it ’s own collections framework with equivalents and they are dramatically better but it does make it difficult to inter-operate with Java libraries that use Java Collections .
Fortunately , Scala provides wrappers for the Java Collection types to make them act like Scala collections , but it does n’t have wrappers for going the other way .
It ’s definitely not the end of the world , but does make you think a bit more about where the Java to Scala leap should be – sometimes writing a few key classes in Java can make things dramatically easier .
Judicious use of implicit conversions , a scary but powerful feature of Scala , can be a big help too .
I do like the ability to specify values in Scala as @ BeanProperty and have the compiler automatically generate JavaBean compliant getters and setters ( or just getters if it ’s a read - only value as is common in Scala ) .
There can also be problems with tools that manipulate bytecode since the bytecode Scala generates is compliant with the JVM specs , but often quite different to what javac would product .
The Performance
I ca n’t tell the difference between Java code and Scala code .
That ’s roughly what other people are saying too .
There are an awful lot of classes that come out of Scala code because of all the closures and traits and the like so it ’s not going to work if you are tight on space such as in applets .
Server side where processes are long - running and JAR size is n’t a critical concern , it will work perfectly .
I would guess , that there are a very large number of short - lived objects being created and discarded with Scala due to the use of implicit conversions and all those closures , but garbage collectors are so heavily optimised for that use case that I ca n’t see any evidence that it makes a difference and the performance testing I ’ve read about bears that out .
The Scala compiler implements tail - recursive optimisation and even supports an annotation so that you can mark a method as tail - recursive and get a compile error if it ’s not .
In terms of scalability – Scala advocates claim that functional programming and immutable data structures that are heavily used in Scala are a key tool , if not the solution , for scalability .
I do n’t know and do n’t really care – the applications I ’m likely to write will fit nicely into the “ scale by handling many requests at once ” model rather than having to break up the work of each individual request over multiple threads .
The problem will come in the database or web server level , not my application code .
I ’m watching Tim Bray ’s Concur. next series with interest though .
Overall
Scala is very much a tool I ’m glad to now have in my toolkit .
It ’s not yet ready for prime time purely because of the poor IDE support , but it is excruciatingly close .
I can see me advocating it ’s use in Ephox quite heavily if it deploys to .NET smoothly as the cross - deployment is a massive benefit and would be worth the pain of sorting out the tooling , but it would be hard to justify if that is n’t viable yet – especially given the potential for Ruby or Python to work on both J2EE and .NET .
I do n’t think it will be long before the Scala toolsets catch up and it becomes an extremely compelling option for Java server - side development .
COVID - 19 is the excuse for an unprecedented abrogation of fundamental human rights , the imposition of an anti-social “ new normal , ” increased misery and suicide worldwide , global economic devastation , international travel bans and an alarming increase in police state behaviour .
The whole thing is a scam – there is an abundance of research to show this ‘ deadly virus ’ is not very deadly at all .
Well over 99 % of people who become infected with COVID - 19 will not die , and most wo n’t even develop symptoms .
In fact , many of you reading this have probably already had COVID - 19 and shaken it off without even realizing it .
The American Flu Charade News Media Maintains Undeserved Public Confidence In Flu Vaccination Program — Millions Of Doses Of Flu Vaccine May Go Unused This Season
by Bill Sardi
Recently by Bill Sardi : Most Americans Dying From Flu-Related Illness Are Likely To Exhibit NutritionalDeficiencies
With a Consumer Reports poll showing nearly 2/3rds of U.S. parents will hold off on having their children vaccinated with the H1N1 late - 2009 season flu vaccine , health authorities are likely to resort to scare tactics as they have in past years to induce parents into having their children vaccinated .
You ca n’t cry wolf every year .
The Consumer Reports telephone survey shows 50 % of U.S. parents are delaying their decision to have their children vaccinated and another 14 % will forego vaccination altogether .
Anticipate millions of unused doses of vaccine
There may be hundreds of millions of doses of unused vaccine if the public holds to their guns on no flu vaccination .
The U.S. government has ordered 250 million doses of the H1N1 late - 2009 flu strain vaccine from five suppliers : MedImmune , a unit of AstraZeneca , Sanofi- Aventis ( France ) , Australia ’s CSL , GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis .
In past years the CDC ordered over 100 million doses of the seasonal flu vaccine .
Recognizing resistance to flu vaccination , flu shots are not just being offered at clinics this year .
There is coercion at schools , hospitals and workplaces to undergo flu vaccination .
The military must take the vaccine .
Reported cases of the flu are likely to be on the upswing as human immunity declines with the seasonal tilt of the Earth away from the sun in northern latitudes , thus reducing intensity of vitamin D- producing solar ultraviolet - B radiation .
Despite doing the obvious — promoting vitamin D supplements — vaccines are forced onto the public .
Nasal vaccines will accelerate spread of the flu
The first flu vaccines in use will be nasally - administered Flumist ® which utilizes " live " viruses .
Flumist® - vaccinated individuals will shed viruses for 5 days following inoculation and are likely to spread the virus to family members .
This will predictably accelerate infection rates .
Look for health authorities to liken an upsurge in flu cases to the late - season return of the 1918 Spanish flu rather than viral shedding from the nasal - instilled vaccine .
It is not difficult to see how rapidly the flu will spread with Flumist® .
For example , breast - feeding infants are at risk for flu infection should their mothers receive Flumist® .
Older siblings in grade school are likely to be inoculated with Flumist® and bring the virus home and spread it to their mothers who are breast - feeding their infant children .
Young grade school students are likely to be administered nasal Flumist and subject senior - aged teachers , who are at higher risk for flu - related mortality , to an avoidable risk .
Individuals considered high - risk , such as asthmatics and individuals taking immune - suppressing drugs , should also avoid contact with individuals who receive Flumist® .
Any individual receiving Flumist® should not visit a hospitalized patient within 5 days of inoculation .
But hospitals post no warning about this .
The Flumist® is not recommended for adults over age 50 , and senior adults living in a home with others who have received Flumist® are at greater risk to become infected , though no warning is issued over this .
Vaccines unapproved for the very young
According to package inserts , none of the current vaccines approved by the FDA have been tested for use among pregnant females or in children below the age of 2 for Medimmune Flumist® , or for injectable vaccines , not below age 18 for CSL ( Australia ) vaccine ; not below age 4 for Novartis ( UK - USA ) vaccine ; not below 6 months of age for Sanofi Pasteur ( France ) vaccine .
However , these vaccines are being widely promoted for use among pregnant women and very young infants .
Assessing the real flu threat
Public confidence in the nation ’s flu vaccination program exists only because the news media chooses to parrot the many falsehoods offered by the National Institutes of Health , the Centers for Disease Control , the FDA and the vaccine industry .
For example , no one in the news media confronts the mistaken claim that the late - 2009 season H1N1 flu has produced a " pattern similar to that seen in the deadly 1918 flu pandemic . "
As virologist Vincent Racaniello PhD , Higgins Professor in the Department of Microbiology at Columbia University ’s College of Physicians and Surgeons , says : " There is no evidence that mutation led to the emergence of a u2018 more virulent ’ virus that caused more severe disease in the fall of 1918 .
The only virus available to study was reconstructed from material obtained in November 1918 .
The first influenza virus was not isolated until 1933 .
The idea that a more virulent virus emerged in the fall has nevertheless become firmly established — without any scientific evidence to support the hypothesis . "
See here for more information .
It is this contrived idea that the Spanish flu could reappear , that the current flu in circulation could reassort or mutate into a deadlier flu virus resembling the 1918 Spanish flu , which is driving the public ’s fear over this year ’s flu season .
The vast majority of the flu- related deaths in 1918 were caused by bacterial pneumonia , not the flu .
Many of these subjects are reported to have had TB , not the flu .
[ Journal Infectious Disease 2008 Oct 1 ; 198(7):962—70 ]
Far more people die of lung tuberculosis than the flu .
If the $ 9 billion being spent to ramp up for the 2009 — 10 flu season were spent on TB eradication , far more lives would be saved .
This lends further evidence that the current flu hysteria is driven by commercial interests , not protection of human life or promotion of public health .
How do you kill a virus ?
Another falsehood that is often repeated to give false assurance that flu vaccines are safe is that injected vaccines are comprised of " killed viruses . "
But given that assurance , health authorities go right ahead and administer live flu virus via nasal instillation to young children , which causes viral shedding for 5 days and accelerates spread of the disease .
Furthermore , there is no such thing as a " live " or " killed " flu virus .
As Dr. Racaniello says : " Viruses are not living , so they can not be killed . "
Viruses require a host cell to replicate .
Viruses are inactivated by use of heat , UV radiation or treatment with chemicals such as formalin .
[ Virology Blog , Vincent Racaniello PhD ]
It is possible for some vaccine vials in a batch to harbor " active " viruses if the " inactivator " has not been completely employed .
So - called " hot lots " of vaccines are never reported to the public .
Technically , a " hot lot " is a vaccine lot that receives 10 or more reports of adverse reactions and / or two reports of seizures as well as one or two reports of death .
Need for age - matched vaccines
Another obvious problem is that it appears flu vaccines , if employed at all , should be designed for age groups , since some generations have been exposed to flu viruses and maintain immunity while others have not .
Examine the following chart which compares the age groups infected by the seasonal 2007 — 08 flu and the novel late - 2009 season H1N1 flu .
Typically the aged incur higher rates of flu infection .
But the late - 2009 season H1N1 flu virus is about five times less infective among adults over age 65 than the 2007— 08 flu .
Young - to - middle aged adults are more likely to become infected this year ( 2009 — 10 ) .
Usually the very young and the very old comprise most of the cases of the flu .
Not this year .
This means millions of Americans get flu shots with no potential health benefit and only risks for side effects .
Why would anyone consider receiving this vaccine ?
In another misdirection , the Centers for Disease Control continues to advise the public to undergo vaccination for the seasonal flu in addition to the novel H1N1 late - 2009 season triple reassortant flu .
However , according to the CDC ’s own website , 99 % of all influenza A viruses currently in circulation ( late September 2009 ) are the late - 2009 H1N1 viruses .
The seasonal flu strains have virtually disappeared .
Seasonal flu shots would be superfluous and even problematic .
Dr. Racaniello asks : " Why would anyone consider receiving this vaccine ? "
Yet this is being promoted by the CDC and this recommendation is being parroted by the news media .
Positive spin on flu vaccination program is maintained by news media
The news media is aiding and abetting the flu hysteria , dramatizing every flu - related death even when there has been no laboratory confirmation that the H1N1 flu strain was involved , and serves as a free publicity agent for vaccine makers .
Behind the scenes there must be mumblings to news reporters they are not to print or air negative reports that would cause the public to lose confidence in the nation ’s vaccination program .
An ABC News report cites US health officials as saying low vaccination rates " could have dire consequences , " despite the fact this flu outbreak has produced fewer deaths than the typical seasonal flu and did not result in abnormal mortality as it swept through South America during its summer flu season there .
Complicity between vaccine makers , public health authorities and the news media maintains undeserved public confidence in a flu vaccination program that often only offers side effects and no disease prevention or reduction in mortality .
The news media is filled with legions of biology - trained reporters or even MDs .
They surely must be aware of the following information about the ineffectiveness of flu vaccines .
Instead , we see these health reporters rolling up their sleeves on television to receive a flu shot .
Lack of evidence of effectiveness
While older adults are at the greatest risk for dying from the flu , surprisingly there is only one randomized controlled study among older persons ( 60 years and up ) which reported a 33 % reduction in flu - like illness and a 56 % reduction in circulating viral count .
But this means the vaccine was ineffective in most people in regard to preventing symptoms .
[ Journal American Medical Assn 1994 ; 272:1661 — 1665 ]
Centers for Disease Control officials concede the ability of flu vaccines to generate sufficient antibodies and effectively reduce symptoms and prevent death is only about 30 — 50 % among currently licensed vaccines .
[ Current Topics Microbiology Immunology 2009 ; 333:413—29 ]
Data collected over 33 flu seasons shows flu vaccination reduced the death rate substantially less than expected .
[ Journal American Medical Assn 2003 ; 289 : 179— 86 ; Archives Internal Medicine 2005 ; 165 : 265—72 ]
But news reporters must put a positive face on flu vaccination , despite evidence to the contrary .
Mismatched vaccines
Another major problem is that the flu viruses in the vaccines often do not match the flu viruses in circulation in the population .
[ Vaccine 2008 ; 26 ( Supplement 4 ) : D5 — D9 ]
For example , in 2007 the trivalent flu vaccine ( contained 3 strains of the flu ) was only 40 % protective due to mismatched flu strains .
[ Cleve Clin J Med. 2008 Dec ; 75( 12):865—70 ]
The percentage of viruses that were matched to vaccine strains was 5 % ( 3 of 62 ) in 2004 — 2005 , 5 % ( 2 of 42 ) in 2005 — 2006 , and 91 % ( 85 of 93 ) in 2006 — 2007 .
[ J Infect Dis. 2009 Jan 15 ; 199( 2):159—67 ]
In the 8 years spanning 1998 — 2005 , flu vaccine mismatch occurred in 4 of those years including both the 2003 — 04 and 2004— 05 consecutive seasons .
The nation had no protection beyond natural immunity in many recent flu seasons .
Due to flu strain mismatch , 84 % of the vaccinees over 75 years of age who received the flu vaccine in 1997 — 98 were not protected against infection .
[ J. Medical Virology 61:94—99 , 2000 ]
The public is never alerted to this .
A major review encompassing 64 published studies which evaluated the ability of flu vaccines to reduce symptoms or viral count showed overall effectiveness of just 23 % during seasons when the flu strain in the vaccine matched the virus in circulation within the population .
Effectiveness did not differ from years when vaccines were mismatched .
[ Lancet 2005 ; 366:1165 — 1174 ]
Vaccination rate
Just how far the doctor - reporter - vaccine maker triumvirate will go in promoting useless and problematic vaccines is yet to be determined .
While public health authorities are claiming they will have enough flu vaccine to inoculate a majority of the US population , and have established a goal for a 70 % vaccination rate , researchers in Japan says over - vaccination may induce genetic pressure that will produce a more virulent flu strain which can result in an epidemic that is much more severe and infects more people than before a vaccination program .
In their drive to sell vaccines they are placing the public ’s health at risk .
[ PLoS One .
2009 ; 4(3):e4915 ]
It ’s possible for a vaccination program to eradicate a dominant and more prevalent strain of the flu that is sensitive to the vaccine , leaving a less prevalent but vaccine - resistant form which will overtake the population and result in greater morbidity and mortality .
[ J Theoretical Biology 2009 Jul 21 ; 259( 2) :219 — 28 ]
The mindless drive to vaccinate the masses may end up being mass manslaughter .
Doctors circle their wagons
With all that has been said here about the shortcomings of the flu vaccination program , physicians , particularly pediatricians , have taken a dogmatic and arrogant stance regarding vaccination .
In a survey of members of the American Academy of Pediatrics , almost 40 % said they would not provide care to a family that refuses all vaccines and 28 % said they would not provide care to families that even refused selected vaccines .
[ New England Journal Medicine 2009 ; 360 : 1981 — 88 ]
This should be deemed patient abandonment .
Look for growing public discontent over the flu vaccination program .
Reasons Why Flu Shots Are n’t Always Effective
Type of vaccine : " live " attenuated virus is more effective than " killed " viruses
Dosage and adjuvants : Lower dosage means greater use of adjuvants to spike antibody production .
Very young children need two shots , one to prime the immune system and the other to produce sufficient antibodies .
Age : Very young and very old do n’t develop sufficient antibodies and may require priming with 1 shot and then a subsequent shot .
Match with flu strain in circulation : often not matched
Season : Fall and winter are the peak seasons for the flu due to falling natural immunity .
Vaccination during summer may appear to produce a better result due to natural immunity .
Vaccine resistance : flu strain in circulation may be resistant to the vaccine
The Best of Bill Sardi
At least 19 people have died , more are reported to have been swept out to sea , and whole villages have been wiped out after a powerful 8.3 - magnitude earthquake sent tsunami waves smashing into the coast of Samoa this morning .
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre has now downgraded its Pacific - wide warning .
New Zealand had been bracing for the tsunami to hit its east coast but there have been no reports of damage from the impact so far .
The tsunami was generated by a magnitude - 8.3 earthquake which struck 190 kilometres southwest of American Samoa .
At least 14 people have been reported dead in American Samoa and at least five in Samoa .
There were reports that three children died in Samoa as the tsunami flattened houses and swept away cars .
There are also fears for the fate of the island communities between Samoa and New Zealand , with three - metre waves reported from the area .
A reporter for Radio Polynesia told Radio New Zealand that villages were " wiped out " by the tsunami and people had been reported missing .
The Samoan capital Apia has been evacuated and thousands of people have been moved to higher ground .
Neighbouring American Samoa has also been severely damaged by the ' quake and tsunami and it is expected casualties will be high .
A spokesman for New Zealand 's Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully says the minister 's office has received reports of five people dead in Samoa and " many more washed out to sea " .
The general manager of Southseas Broadcasting , Joey Cummings , said cars were swept out to sea and the water reached the second floor of the Pago Plaza building in the American Samoa capital Pago Pago .
Vincent Ilui from the village of Leone in American Samoa says the tsunami struck so quickly some people were drenched when they arrived on higher ground .
" Currently it 's been announced on the radio , from the emergency operating centre ... that there 's been 14 reported deaths so far and six of them are here in my village , " he said .
Olga Keil , a journalist working in Samoa , described the damage .
" We 've got reports from the south - eastern side of the main island , where houses have been completely flattened , vehicles have been swept out to sea , boulders that have fallen of the mountain along the coastal areas , " she said .
" But mainly a lot of houses in the villages on the coastal areas have been flattened by the waves . "
Parliamentary Secretary for International Development Assistance Bob McMullan says a number of Australians have been injured but they have all received appropriate treatment and are stable .
" All of them have been able to contact their own families directly and none of them have said to the High Commission they need any special or extra assistance , " he said .
" The reports from Australians suggest it was a very frightening event for people , both the extent of the earthquake and the impact of the tsunami , and we are now having to make very rapid contact with everybody . "
Australian Nick Rees told ABC News Breakfast that his parents had called him to tell him the tsunami had hit the southern side of the main Samoan island , completely destroying their hotel .
" They 've lost everything they have ... [ but ] they 're alive and they 're OK , my dad has broken some ribs , " he said , adding that some people were missing from the hotel .
Mr Rees said he thought the guests had very little warning .
" There were people from their hotel missing ...
I 'm assuming if dad 's injured and there are people missing it was pretty quick , " he said .
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said waves 1.57 metres tall hit American Samoa , while 0.7 metre waves were recorded in Samoa .
New Zealanders have been told to expect waves making first landfall on the country 's east coast , including East Cape and the city of Gisborne , soon .
NZ 's minister of civil defence has warned people to get off the country 's beaches .
A brief statement issued by the Joint Australian Tsunami Warning Centre , operated by the Bureau of Meteorology and Geoscience Australia , said no Australian territory would be hit by the tsunami .
But senior meteorologist Tony Leggett says the New South Wales and Southern Queensland coastline could experience some unusual currents later this morning .
DFAT says Australians who are concerned about friends or relatives in the region can call a special hotline on 1300 555 135 .
Russell Hunter , a journalist with the Samoa Observer , says the quake lasted a minute - and - a - half .
" There does n't seem to be any damage around the capital .
We are told there have been deaths on other side of the island as a result of the following tsunami - so far we are told three children in a small village on the other side of the island , " he said .
Australian Miyako Armitage was working out in the gym of an Apia Hotel in Samoa when the earthquake hit .
" I thought that the men were rattling the weights a little bit too loudly , but it turned out to be quite a big earthquake , " she said .
" So we ran out , as we stood around in the middle of the road we saw the building swaying quite a lot .
That was quite scary . "
The USA 's Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre had earlier issued a tsunami warning for a large swathe of the South Pacific including Fiji , New Zealand and Tonga after the US Geological Survey ( USGS ) reported a 7.9 magnitude quake .
The centre later said an 8.3 magnitude quake had been recorded at a depth of 33 kilometres .
It was not immediately clear if this was the same quake and the USGS 's website did not provide exact details of its location .
In its preliminary earthquake report , the US Geological Survey put the epicentre 204 kilometres south - south - west of Samoa 's capital Apia and at a depth of 85 kilometres .
The USGS said the region was struck by a 5.6 magnitude quake about 20 minutes after the first .

Profound discoveries and insights on the frontiers of science do not burst out of thin air but often arise from incremental processes of weaving together analogies , images , and simulations in a constrained fashion .
In cutting - edge science , problems are often ill - defined and experimental data are limited .
To develop an understanding of the system under investigation , scientists build real - world models and make predictions with them .
The models are tentative at first , but over time they are revised and refined , and can lead the community to novel problem solutions .
Models , thus , play a big role in the creative thinking processes of scientists .
Dr. Nancy J. Nersessian has studied the cognitive processes that underlie scientific creativity by observing scientists at work in their laboratories .
She says , “ Solving problems at the frontiers of science involves complex cognitive processes .
In reasoning with models , part of the process occurs in the mind and part in the real - world manipulation of the model .
The problem is not solved by the scientist alone , but by the scientist – model combination .
This is a highly creative cognitive process . ”
Her research is published in an upcoming issue of Topics in Cognitive Science .
Her study of the working methods of scientists helps in understanding how class and instructional laboratory settings can be improved to foster creativity , and how new teaching methods can be developed based on this understanding .
These methods will allow science students to master model - based reasoning approaches to problem solving and open the field to many more who do not think of themselves as traditional “ scientists . ”

Amazing pictures of the polar bear who took an interest in the menu on Arctic ship
A group of wildlife enthusiasts were looking forward to their lunch during an expedition to the Arctic island of Svalbard .
But they soon discovered a hungry polar bear was also rather keen to try their cauliflower soup .
The giant predator poked his head through the open porthole into the kitchen of the ship , which had weighed anchor so the passengers could enjoy the fabulous icy landscape .
Anybody home ?
A polar bear pokes his head through the ship 's kitchen window during a lunch stop by Svalbard
Polar bears are the largest land based carnivores and treat all animals as potential prey Defeated :
The polar bear wanders away after failing to secure a quick and easy lunch
Peckish :
The bear gets a whiff of the cauliflower soup cooking in the galley
He stayed by the boat for another couple of hours and even stood on his hind legs to better investigate any scavenging potential .
The incredible shots were taken by wildlife photographer Andy Rouse , who led an expedition on the M/S Stockholm .
' We saw 40 polar bears , had an incredible walrus encounter and saw the most beautiful pack ice that you could ever wish to encounter , ' he wrote on his blog .
' Truly Svalbard is a wonderful wilderness . '
Polar bears are the largest living land carnivores and males can grow up to 10ft in length and weigh up to 1,700 lbs .
They are extremely dangerous as they assume anything they encounter to be potential prey .
The bears primarily eat seals , which they kill by crushing their heads with their jaws .
But they will also target any unfortunate humans if they are hungry .
Polar bears are very well adapted to their environment .
The adults are strong swimmers using their front paws to propel themselves and their back legs to steer .
They have a layer of fat to keep them insulated from the freezing temperatures and their paw pads have rough surfaces that stop them slipping on the ice .
There are around 20,000 polar bears in the wild .
However , scientists predict that , if current warming trends continue in the Arctic , two - thirds of the world 's polar bears could disappear by 2050 .
Tony Blair 's former chief adviser on the EU has misgivings about the ex-prime minister becoming President of Europe , as the campaign to overturn his bid gathers pace .
Sir Stephen
Wall – one of the key architects of the post of EU president – said a high - profile figure such as Mr Blair was " not necessarily a very good idea " and cast doubt on his ability to build consensus among EU leaders .
A figure from a smaller state would send a " unifying signal " , he added .
The surprise intervention came amid growing signs that a President Blair would not be welcomed by ordinary citizens of Europe , despite their leaders showing support .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Research by The Independent on Sunday suggests a democratic discrepancy between voters and national leaders – who wield the votes for the new president .
The findings are supported by a European - wide petition to stop Mr Blair taking the post , which comes with a string of perks .
Nearly 38,000 people have signed the petition , yet he remains a favourite with bookmakers and with a growing number of EU leaders .
After the IoS asked readers ' opinions last week , hundreds responded – and those saying No to Mr Blair outnumbered Yes by 20 to 1 .
His role in the Iraq war was the main complaint .
As the process for choosing a European Council president draws to a close later this year , Mr Blair is expected to appear before the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq war .
Comments from readers and petitioners suggest that Mr Blair appears to have misjudged the public anger that still exists over Iraq .
Last night sources close to the former prime minister claimed he remained focused on his job as Middle East envoy and was " really enjoying his new life " .
The EU president , a role created by the Lisbon Treaty , will be decided before the end of this year , with only Vaclav Klaus , the Czech president , yet to ratify the charter .
Despite voters ' opposition , EU leaders appear to be inching towards acclamation of Mr Blair at a meeting in Brussels in December .
Yet Sir Stephen , who criticised Mr Blair over Iraq , said in an interview with the journal European Voice that the ex-PM would not be suitable if the post was designed for consensus - building in the 27 - nation bloc .
Sir Stephen was the UK's permanent representative to the EU between 1995 and 2000 , before working as Mr Blair 's European adviser until 2004 .
During his time at No 10 , Sir Stephen helped devise the posts of president and European foreign affairs representative .
Asked about the possibility of a high - profile figure such as Mr Blair as president , Sir Stephen said : " [ That ] is not necessarily a very good idea . "
On whether he thought the first president should be from a smaller member state , he said : " I think that it would help a lot as a signal .
As a unifying signal , it should be thought about . "
He added that the disadvantage of appointing such a personality was that they would be " trampling on what should be done by the high representative " .

He said if Mr Blair were appointed " you do have someone who is seen as someone who counts and can articulate his vision " .
But he added : " The powers are very constrained .
If the president of the United States did phone a President Tony Blair to ask for something , then Blair could only respond that he would ' consult 27 governments and see what we can do ' . "
Some 18,845 Britons have signed the petition .
The rest are made up of 2,882 Belgians , 2,777 French , 1,538 Austrians , 1,417 from Spain and 1,409 from Germany .
Others are from the Netherlands , Portugal , Greece , Italy and Ireland .
A poll last week found 47 per cent of Britons were opposed to Mr Blair , with 35 per cent in favour .
But Gordon Brown has backed him for the job , and leaders in Spain , Italy and Denmark are said to be in favour .
France 's Nicolas Sarkozy has , so far , been indecisive .
Meanwhile , the Czech president , Vaclav Klaus , in an interview yesterday , suggested he was softening his hardline opposition to signing the treaty .
He told the newspaper Lidove Noviny that despite his continued opposition , it was too late to stop it .

Drug company finds cure for Attention Surplus Disorder
( ACPA - Washington , DC )
Does your boss regularly compliment you for meeting deadlines ?
Do loved ones express delight every time you remember another birthday , anniversary or special occasion ?
Are you organized ?
Are you planning to upgrade your sedan to a BMW ?
If you find yourself answering YES to these questions , you might be suffering from ASD , Attention Surplus Disorder .
ASD , a new disorder , was recently discovered by researchers at the drug company Novartis .
" We were doing ADHD drug research , " explained Frank Denton , Head of Marketing , " and we discovered that for every patient who suffered from ADHD , there are four others suffering from ASD . "
Take the case of Sara Johnston , 26 , of Pleasanton , California .
" I was always an A - student and I graduated with a 3.9 GPA .
I 've had two promotions in my first eighteen months at Oracle .
I thought it was focus and dedication that got me there , but instead all this time I was sick !!
I had no idea , I 'm going on medication right away . "
Joyce Rifkin of Overland Park , Kansas , said she was going to get a prescription for her twin teenage boys Josh and Ryan .
They have been excelling in sports and studies at Blue Valley West High and appear to have many of the symptoms of ASD .
" My boys are doing so well and if they need extra medication , I 'm going to get it for them .
They need every advantage they can get . "
A drug company salesman said , " Many adults have struggled for years with untreated ASD .
They tried to treat individual symptoms , like calmness , equanimity and living in the suburbs , but these do n't respond to standard medicines . "
Fortunately , pharmaceutical giant Novartis has a new drug that treats ASD .
" Doctors recommend that you should take two pills in the morning and one in the evening .
More if your symptoms are severe , " explained Head of Sales , John Hunt .
" Side effects include missed deadlines , impulsive behavior , disorganization , procrastination and forgetfulness .
If these symptoms become severe , you need to start a course of Ritalin . "

LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- Kanye
West may be able to take time off to think about his life after all now that his concert tour has been canceled .
Kanye
West has canceled his " Fame Kills " tour with Lady Gaga .
It was announced two weeks ago .
Concert promoter Live Nation said Thursday that West 's concert tour with Lady Gaga , titled " Fame Kills , " has been canceled just two weeks after it was announced .
The reason for the cancellation was not revealed .
West told NBC's Jay Leno last month , before the tour was officially announced , that he planned " to take some time off " in the aftermath of his MTV Awards show embarrassment .
The three - month , 34 - show tour across the United States and Canada was to start next month .
Tickets went on sale last week .
Live Nation said people who bought tickets could get refunds at the point of purchase .
Tickets purchased online and on the phone will be refunded automatically , the promoter said .
West caused a ruckus at the MTV Awards last month when he put down his bottle of cognac , jumped on the MTV Music Video Awards stage and grabbed the microphone from singer Taylor Swift as she was giving an acceptance speech .
West , who apologized the next day on " The Jay Leno Show , " seemed to blame his erratic behavior on the lack of time he had to grieve his mother 's death two years ago .
" I deal with hurt and , you know , so many , you know , celebrities , they never take the time off , and I 've never taken the time off to really , you know , I just , music after music and tour after tour on tour , " West told Leno .
CNN 's Denise Quan contributed to this report .

We thought cash for clunkers was the ultimate waste of taxpayer money , but as usual we were too optimistic .
Thanks to the federal tax credit to buy high - mileage cars that was part of President Obama 's stimulus plan , Uncle Sam is now paying Americans to buy that great necessity of modern life , the golf cart .
In South Carolina , sales of these carts have been soaring as dealerships alert customers to Uncle Sam 's giveaway .
" The Golf Cart Man " in the Villages of Lady Lake , Florida is running a banner online ad that declares : " GET A FREE GOLF CART .
Or make $ 2,000 doing absolutely nothing ! "
Golf Cart Man is referring to his offer in which you can buy the cart for $ 8,000 , get a $ 5,300 tax credit off your 2009 income tax , lease it back for $ 100 a month for 27 months , at which point Golf Cart Man will buy back the cart for $ 2,000 .
" This means you own a free Golf Cart or made $ 2,000 cash doing absolutely nothing !!! "

Say you have a number that you want to map into the interval .
Draw the upper half of the unit circle centered at the origin .
Start moving from left to right along the circle until you find the spot with a tangent of slope .
Use the - coordinate of this point .
To map that interval onto my HUD , subtract your calculated - coordinate from two and use the result as the radius from the center of the HUD .
Here is the Lisp source code .
It depends on Zach ’s Vecto library .

Two victims of Bernard L. Madoff ’s huge Ponzi scheme sued the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday , saying that the agency ’s failure to detect the fraud years ago contributed to their financial losses .
Echoing complaints that other victims have made for months , the two plaintiffs argued in the lawsuit that they would not have fallen prey to the fraud if the government had “ simply done its job ” and if the commission had not “ closed its eyes to Madoff ’s obvious crimes . ”
The lawsuit , filed in federal court in Manhattan , is aimed at forcing the commission to repay $ 2.4 million lost by the two plaintiffs 
Phyllis Molchatsky , a disabled retiree , and Stephen Schneider , a doctor nearing retirement , both residents of New York .
They had previously demanded compensation through administrative complaints to the commission , which have been denied .
“ Based on our initial understanding , we believe there is no merit to the complaint , ” said John Heine , a spokesman for the commission .

Prostate cancer pathogen may be behind the disease once dubbed ' yuppie flu ' .
A study on chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) has linked the mysterious and controversial disease to a recently discovered retrovirus .
Just last month researchers found the same virus to be associated with aggressive prostate tumours .
Chronic fatigue syndrome is seen as a serious but poorly defined disease .
PUNCHSTOCK
CFS is marked by debilitating exhaustion and often an array of other symptoms , including memory and concentration problems and painful muscles and joints .
The underlying cause of the disease is unknown ; it is diagnosed only when other physical and psychiatric diseases have been excluded .
Though the disease 's nebulous nature originally drew scepticism from both doctors and the general public , most of the medical community now perceives it as a serious — if poorly defined — disease .
Now Judy Mikovits of the Whittemore Peterson Institute for Neuro - Immune Disease in Reno , Nevada , and her colleagues think they have discovered a potential pathogenic link to CFS .
In patients with the disease from different parts of the United States , 67 % were infected with a retrovirus known as XMRV .
Less than 4 % of controls carried the virus .
" I can't wait to be able to tell my patients , " says Mikovits , who is also the vice president of drug development for Genyous Biomed in Henderson , Nevada .
" It 's going to knock their socks off .
They 've had such a stigma .
People have just assumed they were just complainers who did n't handle stress well . "
Prostate puzzle
CFS researchers have long had their eyes on retroviruses .
A number of the symptoms , including fatigue and cognitive dysfunction , can occur when the immune system is dealing with a viral infection , and the disease is often preceded by a flu - like illness .
Although a number of retroviruses have been hypothesized to play a role in CFS , none has ever been confirmed .
About three years ago Robert Silverman , a biologist at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Ohio and a coauthor of the new study , discovered a previously unknown retrovirus , XMRV , while searching for a pathogen that might contribute to prostate cancer .
The retrovirus was very similar to MLV , a group of viruses that can cause cancer and neurological and immunological diseases in mice .
Silverman found XMRV in a subset of prostate tumours , and more recent research found a stronger correlation between XMRV and aggressive prostate tumours 1,2 .

Mikovits asked Silverman to analyze the blood samples of 101 CFS patients and 218 healthy controls .
The authors detected XMRV DNA in the immune cells of 67 % of the CFS patients but in only 3.7 % of healthy controls .
The authors also showed that the virus was able to spread from infected immune cells to cultured prostate cancer cells and that the virus 's DNA sequence was more than 99 % similar to the sequence of the virus associated with prostate cancer .
The findings were published in Science3 .
" It 's scary , " says Mikovits .
" But it 's cool .
Hopefully this will finally make people change their attitudes to this disease . "
Mikovits believes the association may be even stronger than the present work indicates .
DNA sequencing only picks up active infections , she says , so she wants to study CFS exposure to the virus more broadly .
In an unpublished investigation , she and her colleagues analyzed blood cells in about 330 CFS patients and found that more than 95 % expressed antibodies to XMRV , whereas about 4 % of healthy controls did .
Controversial connection
Although Mikovits acknowledges that it 's premature to suggest a causal link between XMRV and CFS , she thinks it makes sense .
Chronic XMRV infection in immune cells could cause them to churn out inflammatory cytokines , which are observed in some CFS patients , she says .
Mikovits also points out that the MLV coat protein can disrupt red blood cells in mice , leading to low blood oxygen levels .
William Reeves , principal investigator for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) 's CFS public health research programme , says the findings are " unexpected and surprising " and that it is " almost unheard of to find an association of this magnitude between an infectious agent and a well - defined chronic disease , much less an illness like CFS " .
But Reeves is cautious .
" Until the work is independently verified , the report represents a single pilot study , " he says .
According to Reeves , the CDC is already trying to replicate these findings .
He also notes that CFS is a heterogeneous disease and likely arises from a combination of many factors .
XMRV presents its own puzzle .
John Coffin , a virologist at Tufts University in Boston who has studied MLV , points out that the virus 's prevalence in healthy controls " is , in some ways , an equally striking result " .
" It 's highly preliminary , but if it 's in fact representative , then there are 10 million Americans with this infection , which is very similar to MLV and is now linked to two important diseases , " says Coffin .
" There 's a lot we do n't know , including whether XMRV causes disease , but that 's always the case when the first paper , like this one , comes out . "

Nokia is preparing to launch the N900 , a new mobile device built on the company 's Linux - based Maemo operating system .
Although the N900 is the technical and spiritual successor of Nokia 's Internet Tablet products , it deviates substantially from its tablet roots and offers capabilities that push it into the smartphone market .
This is an important transitional step in Nokia 's long - term roadmap for Maemo .
At the Maemo Summit last week in Amsterdam , Nokia 's Maemo devices vice president Ari Jaaksi provided insight into where the N900 fits in Nokia 's Linux strategy and explained how the transition from tablet to smartphone will help boost the product 's mainstream appeal .
The Maemo project emerged in 2005 as a humble experiment .
The aim , says Jaaksi , was to determine if Nokia could build a viable open source platform for mobile devices .
Although the idea seemed radical at the time , he remarked , open source has rapidly become a pervasive part of Nokia 's culture and technical vision .
When Maemo was first conceived , Nokia formulated a five - step Linux plan that would culminate with the delivery of a mass market device for a mainstream audience .
Maemo 5 and the N900 represent the fourth step of Nokia 's plan .
According to Jaaksi , the next iteration of the platform will fulfill step number five and take Maemo into the mainstream .
Jaaksi regards the N900 as an important milestone due its inclusion of cellular connectivity .
The original design philosophy behind the tablet , he explained , was heavily influenced by the theory that WiFi ( and eventually WiMax ) would eventually achieve sufficient ubiquity to make a stand - alone tablet device practical .
As we pointed out in our initial review , the tablet was also designed to complement conventional 3G - connected cell phones on the assumption that users would find value in a companion device with a bigger screen and a more desktop - like browsing experience .
The tablet concept is not as compelling today in the mobile market where the iPhone and other modern smartphones are boosting expectations .
Consumers increasingly demand desktop - like browsing on their phone itself and do n't want a secondary handheld device .
Nokia 's tablets , like the rest of the MID class , exist within the awkward space between cell phones and netbooks .
That space is shrinking into oblivion as products on both sides of the divide become better .
Nokia 's answer is to turn the tablet into a smartphone .
This transition , however , required Nokia to rethink some of the tradeoffs that were made in previous Maemo - based devices .
Jaaksi argues that there is a complex relationship between device size and cellular connectivity .
A device with phone capabilities has to be easily pocketable and comfortable to use in one hand .
To achieve that , Nokia had to scale down the form factor and sacrifice one of the most compelling assets of its previous models — the large screen size .
The 4.13 - inch display of the N800 and N810 is dropped in favor of a 3.5 - inch screen on the N900 , but the WVGA resolution is retained .
Despite the shrinkage , screen readability is still very good .
Jaaksi seems confident that the phone form factor and the new tradeoffs will add up to a product that has more mainstream appeal .
In a humorous moment , he revealed that he has always secretly hated the " Internet Tablet " branding .
" A tablet is something you eat when you are sick , " he quipped .
Although he thinks that the N900 will resonate better with average consumers than the previous Maemo - based devices , he still firmly asserts that it is not quite a mainstream smartphone .
He was impressed by the amount of attention that the N900 received following its online launch , but he worries that consumers might not fully understand the product 's target market .
He discussed what he views as several key weaknesses in the N900 that he hopes to address in updates and future versions .
One of the most noteworthy limitations is that the platform is heavily designed around the landscape orientation .
The only major application that is designed for portrait orientation is the dialer .
Support for portrait orientation in the device 's Web browser will be rolled out to N900 users in a software update around the holiday season , he said , and future versions of the platform will have more pervasive support for changing the orientation .
Two areas where he feels that the N900 really delivers a top - notch user experience are calendaring and e-mail .
The introduction of calendar support in the N900 is noteworthy because previous Maemo devices have not included that capability .
The N900 is a big step forward for Nokia and for the Linux smartphone ecosystem .
The device delivers a relatively modern user experience , and it demonstrates how desktop Linux technologies can be adapted to work on handheld computers .
As Jaaksi points out , however , there is still work to do before Maemo is ready to take on the giants of the mainstream smartphone market .
On the heels of breaking up an alleged bomb terror plot , New York is planning to place high - tech security cameras , license plate readers , and " weapons sensors " in midtown Manhattan .
Office workers and tourists – and possible terrorists – will have cameras watching their every move as they visit Macy's , shop for diamonds at Tiffany & Co. , or gawk in Times Square .
The apparatus , paid for by some $ 24 million in Department of Homeland Security funding , will expand a similar effort already underway in lower Manhattan where cameras focus on the Federal Reserve , the New York Stock Exchange , and the Brooklyn Bridge .
Mayor Michael Bloomberg , announcing the program Sunday , said the goal is to detect terrorism threats and deter pre-operational surveillance .
Sensors will try to detect chemical , biological , and radiological threats .
But some terrorism experts have questioned whether a camera network will deter terrorists .
They also say that sensors are known to give off " false positives . "
Meanwhile , civil rights organizations are concerned that the project will be another encroachment on civil liberties .
" The fear is [ that ] the NYPD without any oversight or public scrutiny is creating a massive surveillance system , when we do n't know if this is the best use of $ 125 million designed to keep us safe , " says Donna Lieberman , executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union ( NYCLU ) .
The NYCLU has filed two lawsuits to try to get more public information about the program .
In March , New York Police Department ( NYPD ) commissioner Raymond Kelly indicated in testimony before the City Council that 1,000 police officers are involved in anti-terrorism work daily , and that he hoped to add 500 more cameras to the 500 already installed .
But there did not appear to be any discussion at the hearing about whether the effort is worthwhile or what kind of civil rights safeguards might be needed .
" There are legitimate arguments on all sides here , " says Frank Cilluffo , head of George Washington University 's Homeland Security Policy Institute in Washington .
" What I would like to see is a broader discussion that brings in the average citizen . "
Probably the largest use of security cameras is in London , which has put what it terms a " Ring of Steel " of thousands of security cameras all around the city .
But some security experts question their effectiveness .
" They wo n't stop any terrorist , " says Bruce Schneier , chief security technology officer at BT ( formerly British Telecom ) and a widely - published author on security .
" None of them is going to look at a camera and say ' I better go get a real job . ' "
The only time cameras reduce crime is in parking lots and laundromats , Mr. Schneier says .
" It only makes sense if the tactics and targets are few , but there are billions of targets ranging from shopping malls to restaurants and dozens of tactics , " he adds .
However , Brian Jackson , associate director of the Homeland Security Research Program at the Rand Institute in Washington , says the cameras create " the possibility for prevention " of an attack .
He says cameras add a level of concern for the terrorists .
" Surveillance is one ingredient that gives the terrorists more opportunities to make a mistake and be discovered , " says Mr. Jackson .
As for using sensors that detect biological and radiological weapons , Mr. Cilluffo says they often give off false positives or false negatives .
" They tend to be only successful in events that can easily be contained like the State of the Union address or conventions , " he says .
" Once they are in a more dynamic environment , I 'm not sure where the science is on that . "
But the science of cameras is progressing fast , raising the possibility of even more " Big Brother " - like scenarios .
" Cameras are everywhere and you can see them , " says Schneier , " In ten years , you wo n't even be able to see them . "

The Pentagon already employs legions of elite hackers trained in cyberwarfare .
But they mostly play defense , and that 's what Naval Postgraduate School professor John Arquilla wants to change .
He 'd like the US military 's coders to team up with network specialists abroad to form a global geek squad .
Together , they could launch preemptive online strikes to head off real - world battles .
Armies ( even guerrilla armies ) are so dependent on digital communications these days that a well - placed network hit could hobble their forces .
Do these cyberattacks right — and openly — and the belligerents will think twice before starting trouble .
Arquilla calls his plan " a nonlethal way to deter lethal conflict . "
Sure , it 's risky .
A misinterpreted or misattributed attack could inflame tensions .
Or you might fritz the good guys and civilians by mistake .
But Arquilla says this " kinder , gentler deterrence " is better than threatening to strangle an adversary 's economy or reduce its cities to radioactive cinders .
Here are three scenarios in which preemptive cyberattacks could prevent bloodshed .
Scenario : Defusing South Asia
Situation : Pakistan and India are massing armies on their shared border .
Solution :
Take out the command - and - control networks on both sides before these nuclear - armed foes can go to war for a fifth time .
In the 1951 film The Day the Earth Stood Still , Arquilla notes , a benevolent alien shuts down the machines of Earth 's superpowers before they can spread nukes to other planets .
Here , US - led hackers play the ET role to put the conflict on ice .
Scenario : Disconnecting al Qaeda
Situation : Intelligence sources report that al Qaeda is about to launch another 9/11 .
Solution : Track down militants online and let them know we 're watching .
Spy agencies already eavesdrop on al Qaeda 's networks and occasionally take down its Web sites .
But to really disrupt increasingly Web - dependent terror groups , you have to convince them they 're not safe anywhere on the Net .
Set up online honeypots — like a fake jihadist discussion forum — to lure in and bust wannabe Osamas .
And even if you break up terror cells by other means , give public credit to your online spadework .
A little fudging is acceptable if it keeps killers from clicking for the cause .
Scenario : Restraining Russia
Situation : Russia is mobilizing its troops for another showdown with Georgia .
Solution : Deploy a US - led or NATO - sponsored cyberdeterrent squad to disrupt the Russian military 's communication networks , forcing the Kremlin to delay an attack on the former Soviet republic .
The intervention would buy time for diplomacy to work .
Arquilla says , " I like the idea of cyberdeterrence being used against anyone who would start a war " — even , he muses , the US .

Glenn Beck has been called a lot of things of late — “ provocateur , ” “ hero , ” “ rodeo clown , ” and “ dad ” are just a few .
But few would argue that he ’s nothing if not a master at hyperbole .
During yesterday ’s radio program , Beck satisfied Godwin ’s Law and then some by comparing the recent White House criticism of Fox News to the persecution of the Jews in Nazi Germany .
Too much ?
In a rambling , extemporaneous analogy , Beck seemingly equated the White House with fascist dictators , though regular viewers of his Fox News program will know that ’s not really news .
But never before has he portrayed the Fox News Channel as persecuted subjects like Holocaust Jews .
That is , until yesterday .
Beck went so far as to reference the “ First They Came ” poem by German Pastor Martin Niemöller , which includes the line “ Then they came for the Jews , and I did not speak out — because I was not a Jew . ”
Beck ’s specific quote on his radio show yesterday ( October 13th ) :
These news organizations do n’t have any idea who they are in bed with right now .
Let me speak to the good journalists that are out there , because I believe there are a few journalists who are at NBC , or are at ABC or CBS .
Or CNN .
I know decent journalists over at CNN .
Ask yourself this question :
When they are done with Fox and you decide to speak out on something … the old , “ first they came for the Jews and I was n’t Jewish . ”
When you have a question and you believe that something should be asked … they ’re a… totally fine with you right now .
They have no problem with you .
When they ’re done with Fox and talk radio , do you really think they are going to leave you alone if you want to ask a tough question ?
Do you really think that a man that has never had to stand against tough questions , and has as much power as he does …
Do you really believe that after he takes out the number one news network … do you really think that this man is not then going to turn on you ?
That you , in your little organization , are going to cause him any hesitation at all not to take you out ?
If you believe that , you should open up a history book .
Because you ’ve missed the point of many brutal dictators .
You miss the point of how they always start .
Niemöller wrote his poem about the inactivity of German intellectuals following the Nazi rise to power and the purging of the Nazis ’ chosen targets , group after group .
In Beck ’s analogy , the ranks of journalists who are ignoring White House criticisms of Fox News and talk radio occupy a similar position , appearing to be not only complicit in their persecution , but next on the White House ’s list of victims .
Whether or not you believe in that road map , the glib analogy borders on offensive ; but then , that ’s Beck ’s game .
Full text of “ First They Came ” :
First they came for the communists , and I did not speak out — because I was not a communist ;
Then they came for the socialists , and I did not speak out — because I was not a socialist ;
Then they came for the trade unionists , and I did not speak out — because I was not a trade unionist ;
Then they came for the Jews , and I did not speak out — because I was not a Jew ;
Then they came for me — and there was no one left to speak out for me .
Does Fox News really belong on that list ?

A Warren man who pulled up a 12 - foot - long Great White Shark with his crab pot last August has been cited for unlawful possession .
Jason W. Robinson , 32 , was issued a non-criminal citation by Oregon State Police Fish & Wildlife division for the Aug. 8 incident at Depoe Bay , according to a police news release .
He is scheduled to appear in Lincoln County Circuit Court on Oct. 8 .
A trooper on duty had heard about the shark catch that day and contacted the boat 's occupants .
He saw the shark had already been gutted , which Robinson said was to prepare it for eating , a press release said .
" Our investigation indicated there was no obvious self - initiated attempt by Mr. Robinson to contact any authorities after he caught the shark before bringing it to the port .
If our trooper was n't at the right place at the right time then we believe he would have unlawfully kept the shark for his own personal interests , " said Captain Walt Markee , director of the Fish & Wildlife division .
Oregon regulations prohibit the possession of Great White Sharks and Basking Sharks , and require that the sharks be immediately released unharmed .
Anyone that discovers a dead Great White Shark or a Basking Shark is urged to call the Oregon State Police at 800-452-7888 .

I 'm in my late 20's .
Halloween is my favorite holiday of the year , and my favorite thing to do is to see other people 's costumes who love the holiday , which is generally kids and families ( not as into the Halloween parties where everyone either has an ironic non-costume , or is a sexy _______ and drinks a lot ) .
I trick or treat every year .
Usually , my boyfriend and I put dozens of hours into our costumes , and we always get tons of compliments on how great our costumes were .
They are always interesting , handmade , family friendly costumes ( not scary or sexy ) .
But I 'm now in my mid-20s , verging on late 20s .
I have n't ever thought there was a problem with me trick or treating as an adult as long as you a ) let the kids go first , always and b ) have a really neat costume but my Mom tells me every year that I 'm too old to be trick or treating .
No one has ever said this to us while we were out and about , and no one has ever seemed to be uncomfortable with us trick or treating ( which I 've always assumed had to do with us having cool costumes ) .
I told her I 'd poll a rather outspoken online community about it this year .
What do you guys think ?
PS - We 're in L.A. and do n't have any friends who like Halloween .
We 've tried going to parties , but we not really into drinking or super loud music .
I 'm sure there are awesome parties that we'd love , but we have n't found them , or other people who are as into Halloween as we are .
Trick or treating always seems to be the highlight of my month .
Our home is not on a street with much kid traffic at the holidays , so if we stay home , we see maybe 4 trick or treaters .
Halloween 's my favorite holiday , and I love trick - or - treating .
Problem : my Mom just told me I 'm too old .
The Democratic Party agenda tends to be a mixture of socialism and corporatism , whereas Republicans probably emphasize corporatism and socialism .
Obama ’s health care plan has always been a hybrid , as most interventionist polices are in a mixed economy .
Perhaps in the longterm he wants to move toward as fully socialist a system as possible , but it is hard to know .
We do know that the president would rather push something significant through than nothing .
We also know that he has to play a game where corporate interests who want a captive market through mandated health care are happy , but so too are the progressive true believers in social democracy on the far left .
Will he be able to do it ?
It appears as though Obama may be backing off the “ public option “ — a socialist health “ insurance ” scheme to “ compete ” with private enterprise — as the central element of the proposal .
Although some progressives and Democrats claim they would not support a program without a “ public option , ” Obama may be able to win them over with health - care co-ops , which would operate as non-profits with subsidies and support from the state .
Despite the Democrats ’ insistence that all opposition to the plan is coming from big industry ( unless it ’s rooted in “ racism ” ) , Big Health is actually largely behind Obama ’s general move toward more intervention .
The drug companies are taking out many millions of dollars in advertising in support of Obamacare .
The connection between big business and more regulation and government involvement should be no surprise .
When Bush expanded Medicare , the drug companies of course cheered .
( While some of his partisans denied that this was a bothersome element in the prescription drug program . )
When the dust settles , I expect if a bill passes , it will involve massive intervention on behalf of the state with just enough to satisfy the biggest players in industry as well as enough bureaucratic expansion to please the left .
What will be sold as a “ compromise ” will actually be , in some respects ( though perhaps not all respects ) , the worst of all worlds : A further solidification of fascism in the health care sector .
This means that any further disasters , reduced quality , shortages or climbing health care costs will continue to be blamed on the market and there will be another round of calls for more socialization a few years down the line .
If we want true health care reform — and many opponents of the plan are doing a disservice by defending our very flawed system as “ the best health care plan in the world ” or a paragon of capitalism — we must see dramatic moves toward the free market .
This would mean , among other things , eliminating the licensing of health care professionals , deregulating the insurance industry , undoing the unholy link between insurance and employment created by the tax code ( while perhaps allowing pure tax credits for any health care expenditures — I see tax credits as a tricky issue ) , abolishing or greatly scaling back the Food and Drug Administration , which drives up prescription costs and has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans , rethinking the patent system for health care services and , ultimately , scrapping Medicare .
On the last one , I ’d favor immediate abolition as a matter of principle , but here ’s a gradualist reform I could live with :
Get rid of the illusion of government - backed old - age medical insurance of any kind .
It ’s a pay - as - you - go program , so it should be treated as one .
The Medicare tax should be eliminated ( not replaced by government savings accounts ) and recipients of Medicare should be , in the transition , paid for out of the general fund .
This would at least be honest accounting .
Medicare is a welfare redistribution plan , not an insurance plan of any sort , and it must be treated as one .
No one paying into the system would be under the illusion that the government will care for them years down the road .
To lessen the burden and shrink the government ’s involvement , perhaps those receiving Medicare would be free to opt out of it in return for a huge reduction in their federal taxes .
Any legitimate reform will discernably take away the government ’s power over something significant and will scale back its size and involvement .
That is the only antedote to our health care troubles , and the only true alternative to more socialism and fascism in American medicine .

UNCHARTED 2 Demo Ended – More Chances to Win the Fortune Hunter Edition
At the height of World War II on April 6th , 1943 , the British Ambassador to Moscow , Sir Archibald Clark Kerr , wrote a letter to Foreign Office minister Lord Reginald Pembroke in an effort to simply brighten up his day–a letter which has since become a classic piece of correspondence for reasons that will soon become obvious .
The letter is indeed hilarious , and proof , if it were needed , that name­ - based punnery and mild xenophobia did a roaring trade long before the Internet was fired up .
( This letter , along with 124 other fascinating pieces of correspondence , can be found in the bestselling book , Letters of Note . )

MOSCOW Lord Pembroke
The Foreign Office
London 6th April 1943 My Dear Reggie ,
In these dark days man tends to look for little shafts of light that spill from Heaven .
My days are probably darker than yours , and I need , my God I do , all the light I can get .
But I am a decent fellow , and I do not want to be mean and selfish about what little brightness is shed upon me from time to time .
So I propose to share with you a tiny flash that has illuminated my sombre life and tell you that God has given me a new Turkish colleague whose card tells me that he is called Mustapha Kunt .
We all feel like that , Reggie , now and then , especially when Spring is upon us , but few of us would care to put it on our cards .
It takes a Turk to do that .
( Signed ) Sir Archibald Clerk Kerr ,
H.M. Ambassador .
In the past we gave you a list of ten myths about the Romans .
Today , to complement that list we are giving you ten facts .
Roman society existed in one of the most fascinating periods of history .
Many of the aspects of Roman life continue on to the present day and we certainly have a lot to thank them for in terms of culture and law and , of course , our calendar .
This list looks at ten aspects of Roman life that are particularly interesting and ( hopefully ) not especially well known .
10 Church and State
While it is well known that the Romans worshipped many gods , there was , in fact , an official state god .
This god was named Sol Invictus ( the unconquered sun ) and was created by the emperor Aurelian in 274 AD and continued , overshadowing other cults in importance , until the abolition of paganism under Theodosius I ( on February 27 , 390 ) .
The Romans held a festival on December 25 of Dies Natalis Solis Invicti , “ the birthday of the unconquered sun . ”
December 25 was the date after the winter solstice , with the first detectable lengthening of daylight hours .
There was also a festival on December 19 .
Though many Oriental cults were practiced informally among the Roman legions from the mid-second century , only that of Sol Invictus was officially accepted and prescribed for the army .
Emperors up to Constantine I portrayed Sol Invictus on their official coinage and Constantine decreed ( March 7 , 321 ) dies Solis — day of the sun , “ Sunday ” — as the Roman day of rest .
9 Dwellings
Just like today , Romans lived in a variety of different dwellings depending on class .
The rich had villas ( our rich have McMansions ) , and the poor lived in small apartments over shops – just as many city - dwellers do today .
Roofs were not allowed to be higher than 17 meters ( during the reign of Hadrian ) due to the danger of collapse , and most apartments had windows .
Water would be brought in from outside and residents would have to go out to public latrines to use the toilet .
Because of the danger of fire , the Romans living in these apartments were not allowed to cook – so they would eat out or buy food in from takeaway shops ( called thermopolium ) .
It is amazing to see how these aspects of life have barely changed – our homes may look different , but in many ways we are the same as the Romans .
8 Underwear
The closest thing Romans had to underwear was a subligaculumIt could come either in the form of a pair of shorts , or in the form of a simple loincloth wrapped around the lower body .
It could be worn both by men and women .
In particular , it was part of the dress of gladiators , athletes , and of actors on the stage .
The subligaculum could be worn under a tunic but men who were standing for public office would sometimes just wear the subligaculum and nothing else .
Roman Women also sometimes wore a band of cloth or leather around their upper body .
( strophium or mamillare ) as can be seen in the picture above .
7 Education
Education was very important to the Ancient Romans .
The rich people in Ancient Rome put a great deal of faith in education .
While the poor in Ancient Rome did not receive a formal education , many still learned to read and write .
Children from rich families , however , were well schooled and were taught by a private tutor at home or went to what we would recognise as schools .
In general , schools as we would recognise them , were for boys only .
Also , Roman schools were rarely an individual building but an extension of a shop – separated from the crowd by a mere curtain !
Learning in Roman schools was based on fear .
Boys were beaten for the slightest offence as a belief existed that a boy would learn correctly and accurately if he feared being caned if he got something wrong .
For boys who continued to get things wrong , some schools had a policy of having pupils held down by two slaves while his tutor beat him with a leather whip .

6 Historic Irony
At the time of the first Christians , St Peter , the first Bishop of Rome ( and thus first Pope ) was put to death by being crucified upside - down in the Circus of Nero – a large open - air venue used for public events .
His body was buried there .
A mere 200 years later , the Roman Emperor Constantine I legalized Christianity and donated the Circus of Nero to the Church for what is now known as Old St Peter ’s Basilica .
It took only 30 years to build and survived until 1506 when it was demolished by Pope Julius II in order to make way for the Basilica which stands in its place today and remains the seat of the Papacy .
The irony of the fact that the seat of the oldest and largest Christian population in the world stands on the spot where the first attempts were made to destroy the new religion is obvious .
Given the temporal power the Church wielded ( and still does to a certain degree , though more through influence now ) , one could say that the Roman Empire is still at the heart of Western society .
5 Average Diet
A different lifestyle also meant that the eating habits of the Ancient Romans were different to ours today .
Breakfast ( the Romans called this jentaculum ) was taken in the master ’s bedroom and usually consisted of a slice of bread or a wheat pancake eaten with dates and honey .
Wine was also drunk .
Lunch ( the Romans called this prandium ) was eaten at about 11.00 a.m. and consisted of a light meal of bread , cheese and possibly some meat .
In many senses , everything was geared up towards the main meal of the day – cena .
This was eaten in the late afternoon or early evening .
If the master of the house had no guests , cena might take about one hour .
If he did have guests , then this meal might take as long as four hours .
A light supper was usually eaten just before the Romans went to bed , consisting of bread and fruit .
The Romans were usually not big meat eaters and a lot of their normal meals involved vegetables , herbs and spices together with a wheat meal that looked like porridge .
Petronius described a luxurious dinner thus :
“ We were invited to take our seats .
Immediately , Egyptian slaves came in and poured ice water over our hands .
The starters were served .
On a large tray stood a donkey made of bronze .
On its back were two baskets , one holding green olives , and the other black .
On either side were dormice , dipped in honey and rolled in poppy seed .
nearby , on a silver grill , piping hot , lay small sausages .
As for wine , we were fairly swimming in it . ”
For those keen to try some home - cooked Roman food , here is a recipe for dormice :
Stuff the dormice with minced pork or the meat of other dormice chopped up with herbs , pepper and pine nuts .
Sew up the dormice and cook in a small oven .

Before you jump up and down about the idea of eating mouse - like rodents , you should know that they are still a popular food in Slovenia .
Pictured above is an edible dormouse and a Slovenian stew made from them .
4 Guard Dogs
Not only did the Romans use guard dogs to guard their houses , they also used “ beware of the dog ” signs .
Petronius in his Satyricon mentions them : “ There on the left as one entered …was a huge dog with a chain round its neck .
It was painted on the wall and over it , in big capitals , was written : Beware of the Dog . ”
One wonders whether we will one day discover a sign for chariots which says “ infantia in carrus ” ( my appalling translation of “ baby on board ” . )
Pictured above is an authentic “ beware of dog ” ( cave canem ) mosaic from Pompeii .
3 Sewers
The Romans were a very clean people , taking regular communal baths .
They had two main supplies of water – high quality water for drinking and lower quality water for bathing .
In 600 BC , the King of Rome , Tarquinius Priscus , decided to have a sewer system built under the city .
It was created mainly by semi - forced laborers .
The system , which outflowed into the Tiber river , was so effective that it remains in use today ( though it is now connected to the modern sewerage system ) .
It continues to be the main sewer for the famous amphitheater .
It was so successful in fact , that it was imitated throughout the Roman Empire .
2 Pecunia non Olet
Pecunia non olet means “ money does not smell ” .
This phrase was coined as a result of the urine tax levied by the Roman emperors Nero and Vespasian in the 1st century upon the collection of urine .
The lower classes of Roman society urinated into pots which were emptied into cesspools .
The liquid was then collected from public latrines , where it served as the valuable raw material for a number of chemical processes : it was used in tanning , and also by launderers as a source of ammonia to clean and whiten woollen togas .
There are even isolated reports of it being used as a teeth whitener ( supposedly originating in what is now Spain ) .
When Vespasian ’s son , Titus , complained about the disgusting nature of the tax , his father showed him a gold coin and uttered the famous quote .
This phrase is still used today to show that the value of money is not tainted by its origins .
Vespasian ’s name still attaches to public urinals in France ( vespasiennes ) , Italy ( vespasiani ) , and Romania ( vespasiene ) .
1 Catullus XVI
Gaius Valerius Catullus ( ca. 84 BC – ca. 54 BC ) was a Roman poet of the 1st century BC .
His surviving works are still read widely , and continue to influence poetry and other forms of art .
Now the Romans were extremely fond of poetry , humor , and obscenity .
In fact , so obsessed were they with obscenity that the Latin language contains many very specific sexual terms .
For example , cinaede is the term used to describe a person who is being anally penetrated and pedacabo is the the term for the person doing the penetrating .
The verb irrumare means “ to insert one ’s penis into another person ’s mouth for suckling ” .
So how does this relate to Catullus ?
It turns out that he wrote one of the most obscene pieces of poetry ever .
It was considered so bad that a full English translation did not exist until the 20th century .
Here is the translation :
I ’m gonna fuck you guys up the ass and shove my cock down your throats ,
yes , you , Aurelius –you fucking cocksucker–and you too , Furius , you faggot !
Just because my verses are tender does n’t mean
that I ’ve gone all soft .
Sure , a poet should focus
on writing poetry and not on sex ; but does that
mean they ca n’t write about sex ?
If a poem is
in good taste , well - written and erotic ,
it can give massive boners to hairy old men ,
not just to horny teenagers .
You think I ’m a sissy
just because I write about thousands of kisses ?
I ’m gonna fuck you guys up the ass and shove my cock down your throats !
It definitely sounds nicer in the Latin !

An estimated 7,000 languages are being spoken around the world .
But that number is expected to shrink rapidly in the coming decades .
What is lost when a language dies ?
In 1992 a prominent US linguist stunned the academic world by predicting that by the year 2100 , 90 % of the world 's languages would have ceased to exist .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Far from inspiring the world to act , the issue is still on the margins , according to prominent French linguist Claude Hagege .
" Most people are not at all interested in the death of languages , " he says .
" If we are not cautious about the way English is progressing it may eventually kill most other languages . "
According to Ethnologue , a US organisation owned by Christian group SIL International that compiles a global database of languages , 473 languages are currently classified as endangered .
The death in 2008 of Chief Marie Smith Jones signalled her language 's death Among the ranks are the two known speakers of Lipan Apache alive in the US , four speakers of Totoro in Colombia and the single Bikya speaker in Cameroon .
" It is difficult to provide an accurate count , " says Ethnologue editor Paul Lewis .
" But we are at a tipping point .
From here on we are going to increasingly see the number of languages going down . "
What is lost ?
As globalisation sweeps around the world , it is perhaps natural that small communities come out of their isolation and seek interaction with the wider world .
The number of languages may be an unhappy casualty , but why fight the tide ?
WAR OF WORDS 6 % of the world 's languages are spoken by 94 % of the world 's population
The remaining 94 % of languages are spoken by only 6 % of the population
The largest single language by population is Mandarin ( 845 million speakers ) followed by Spanish ( 329 million speakers ) and English ( 328 million speakers ) .
133 languages are spoken by fewer than 10 people SOURCE : Ethnologue " What we lose is essentially an enormous cultural heritage , the way of expressing the relationship with nature , with the world , between themselves in the framework of their families , their kin people , " says Mr Hagege .
" It 's also the way they express their humour , their love , their life .
It is a testimony of human communities which is extremely precious , because it expresses what other communities than ours in the modern industrialized world are able to express . "
For linguists like Claude Hagege , languages are not simply a collection of words .
They are living , breathing organisms holding the connections and associations that define a culture .
When a language becomes extinct , the culture in which it lived is lost too .
Cross words
The value of language as a cultural artefact is difficult to dispute , but is it actually realistic to ask small communities to retain their culture ?
One linguist , Professor Salikoko Mufwene , of the University of Chicago , has argued that the social and economic conditions among some groups of speakers " have changed to points of no return " .
The story of Babel bestowed great power on societies with one language
As cultures evolve , he argues , groups often naturally shift their language use .
Asking them to hold onto languages they no longer want is more for the linguists ' sake than for the communities themselves .
Ethnologue editor Paul Lewis , however , argues that the stakes are much higher .
Because of the close links between language and identity , if people begin to think of their language as useless , they see their identity as such as well .
This leads to social disruption , depression , suicide and drug use , he says .
And as parents no longer transmit language to their children , the connection between children and grandparents is broken and traditional values are lost .
" There is a social and cultural ache that remains , where people for generations realize they have lost something , " he says .
What no - one disputes is that the demise of languages is not always the fault of worldwide languages like our own .
An increasing number of communities are giving up their language by their own choice , says Claude Hagege .
Many believe that their languages have no future and that their children will not acquire a professional qualification if they teach them tribal languages .
" We can do nothing when the abandonment of a language corresponds to the will of a population , " he says .
Babbling away Perhaps all is not lost for those who want the smaller languages to survive .
As the revival of Welsh in the UK and Maori in New Zealand suggest , a language can be brought back from the brink .
Hebrew was successfully revived from a written to a living language Hebrew , says Claude Hagege , was a dead language at the beginning of the 19th century .
It existed as a scholarly written language , but there was no way to say " I love you " and " pass the salt " - the French linguists ' criteria for detecting life .
But with the " strong will " of Israeli Jews , he says , the language was brought back into everyday use .
Now it is undeniably a living breathing language once more .
Closer to home , Cornish intellectuals , inspired by the reintroduction of Hebrew , succeeded in bringing the seemingly dead Cornish language back into use in the 20th Century .
In 2002 the government recognised it as a living minority language .

But for many dwindling languages on the periphery of global culture , supported by little but a few campaigning linguists , the size of the challenge can seem insurmountable .
" You 've got smallest , weakest , least resourced communities trying to address the problem .
And the larger communities are largely unaware of it , " says Ethnologue editor Paul Lewis .
" We would spend an awful lot of money to preserve a very old building , because it is part of our heritage .
These languages and cultures are equally part of our heritage and merit preservation . "
Do you think the world 's languages should be preserved ?
Are you a member of a community trying to keep your language alive ?
Here are a selection of your comments .
Each language is a seed - bed for poetic expression - that can capture some thing beyond mere communication .
Every time a language is lost the " genetic basis " for such poetry is less rich .
Gavin Brelstaff , Alghero , Sardinia
At least we have come a long way from the times when languages were repressed and forbidden in favor of the language of the dominant polical or colonial power .
But I believe that the matter of preserving declining languages should best be left to private iniative among those who have a personal interest in seeing them preserved .
Paul Kachur , Oberheimbach , Germany I 'm a sociolinguist specializing in endangered languages and language planning .
I'm Italian and in my country over 40 historical languages are spoken , but most of them are endangered , particularly those which are are known as ' dialects ' .
This applies to the area where I was born as well , Milan .
Milanese ( which is as different from Italian as , say , Spanish is ) is highly endangered and nothing is being done to promote it .
In Brunei , too , where I live and work ( I'm a lecturer at the local university ) , at least 9 out of the 11 local minority languages are endangered , some only slightly ( like Iban for example ) , some severely ( like Belait ) .
Here , too , nothing is being done to preserve them ...
Paolo Coluzzi , Bandar Seri Begawan , Brunei Darussalam
I believe that all languages are unique and helps to identfy who we are as a people and as an individual .
It is unfortunate that most languages are on the verge of dying but thats the price of progress .
Namron , Barbados
The flip side of the revival of Hebrew , which the article does n't mention , is the probably imminent demise of Yiddish and Ladino ( Judaeo - Spanish ) , two previously vibrant Jewish languages ( New York City once had seven Yiddish newspapers ! ) .
The movement to transform Hebrew from a liturgical language into the national language of Israel had as much to do with 19th - century Zionist romanticism as anything else .
Yiddish and Ladino were considered ghetto languages by Zionist intellectuals , and so not only not worthy of preservation , but deserving of oblivion .
Early Jewish immigrants to Palestine and later Israel , for example , were encouraged to discard their " ghetto " names and take Hebrew ones ; the speaking of languages other than Hebrew ( but especially Yiddish ) was actively discouraged .
So is the result the triumphant revival of a dead language , or the loss of a thousand years of the Jewish experience in Europe ?
MD , Canterbury , UK
The utility of a single global language , spoken by everyone as their mother tongue , would surely outweigh any loss of cultural heritage .
The proliferation of Scots Gaelic bilingual signs in areas without Gaelic speakers ( Aberdeenshire ? ! ) is eccentric to say the least .
Let languages die their natural deaths - there are plenty left .
Danny McShane , Aberdeen Native Irish speaker and I have almost lost it .
Government spending millions promoting same .
Very difficult against TV and reading almost exclusively English .
Endangered languages should be archived and let go .
Charles Mc Fadden , London England
Its sad when a language dies out , but it is unavoidable is n't it ?
If not by suddenly no longer being used , it will happen simply due to the language changing slowly over time .
The ' English ' that exists today is very different from a thousand years ago and from what will be in a thousand years .
History is littered with languages which no longer exist .
Nik , London , U.K
Absolutely ; language is intrinsicly linked between culture and ethnisity .
Preserving the language is preserving the history and identity of a specific people .
My own language is closely linked with Illyrian and I can make out some ancient etruscan , messapian , macedonian , thracian , and egyptian words and phrases because of it .
It is absolutely amazing that my langugae was able to survive the influx of greek and slavic / mongolian invasion .
Anne Gillette , New York I have studied languages reconstructed completely from written records , and know first - hand the enormous scholarly value in preserving languages .
But languages are not here for our intellectual amusement .
The economic and social benefits of fewer languages to the living world are clear - that 's why it 's happening .
People should not be made to feel guilty about releasing past traditions , linguistic or otherwise .
They do not live in a museum .
Rather than diminishing a person 's sense of self - worth by telling them that they are bad for giving up old traditions , maybe they should be lauded for not being trapped in the past , and shown their intrinsic value as human beings regardless of the culture in which they partake !
Scott , San Francisco , USA
When a language dies , a way of thinking dies with it .
Some Native American languages have completely different concepts of past and present embedded in their language .
Russian verbs offer a variety of ways to express actions , that Hebrew does n't have , but Hebrew has a way of expressing actions that a person does for others that does n't exist in Russian .
Romance languages have well - defined ways to express things that should happen , but not necessarily do - a trait not found in every language .
This list could go on forever .
Amir E. Aharoni , Jerusalem , Israel I think that the reduction in the number of languages spoken is also a great way to help unify the world and the human race in general .
How can we expect cultures to keep peace between each other when they cannot understand each other ?
Having one , or a few global languages will make things much more convenient and seamless .
Also languages isolate communities .
Which are most likely to be economically weak .
' Our heritage ' is only history , and history will never and can never be more important than the present or the future .
Parsa , UK
No , languages naturally evolve , Professor Salikoko Mufwene is absolutely right when he says that asking groups to hold onto languages they no longer want is more for the linguists ' sake than for the communities themselves .
Communities are best served by a language which can be used to communicate intelligibly with the greatest number of people .
It would seem to me that the fewer the number of languages , the fewer the chances for misunderstanding one another .
The revival of dead or minority languages such as those mentioned in the article is an affectation at best and insular at worst .
Even if people no longer communicated with one another using these minor languages that does not mean that knowledge of these minor languages would be gone .
After all , no one now speaks Latin , but the language itself is not lost .
Alex McCallum , Airdrie , Scotland
Most of the problems in the world stem from a lack of communications .
If we all spoke English then these problems might disapear .
It may be sad to lose other languages , but we must strive for one universal language .
Ray Dorrity , Lymington , Hampshire
When a language disappears , the knowledge and thought that has been stored in the language through generations of use , disappears with it .
With the growth of powerful and widespread world languages , such as English , Chinese and Spanish , it will be necessary to take steps to protect linguistic diversity , in order to ensure the survival of smaller languages .
Shouvik Datta , Orpington , Kent , United Kingdom
If we as human beings can all communicate in the same tongue , then maybe we will start to treat the whole polulation od the world equally and that can be no bad thing !
David Evans , Frinton on Sea , Essex
Not only is the death of languages a natural thing , it 's also a good thing .
' Whereof one cannot speak , thereof one must be silent ' wrote Wittgenstein .
By that he meant if you can't describe an object or a concept in a language , then you can't think about it or engage with it .
Concepts of parliamentary democracy , the liberal economy or multicultural societies cannot be expressed in Mayan or Navajo or even Latin .
It 's one of the reasons they 're dead while English - speaking societies thrive and prosper around from the world .
Alex Clarke , Brora , Highlands
I grew up speaking a German dialect , and did n't speak English until I went to school .
My father always asked us if we were richer having two dollars or one dollar .
He said the same was true of language .
Eugenia Bostwick , Pinckney , Mi , USA A good proverb : A house divided against itself cannot stand .
The Earth is the home of humans , plants , animals , various forms of life .
Right now we humans have divide this home of ours ' into divided nations , languages , religions , etc .
In this time and age we need unity more than divisions .
What is the point of having hundreds of languages that will make it difficult for people from different places to communicate .
A Lwin , Geneva , Switzerland Every word has stories woven through it .
When we lose a language , we lose so many words and stories .
I 'd like them to be remembered somehow .
Steve Rpe , Woodinville , USA Languages that are dying out should just be catalogued for the interests of linguists , but communities should n't be forced to use it , and at the very most it should be taught to the next generation as a secondary language , much like Welsh is in Wales .

DESPITE an increase in entertainment choices , watching television remains as popular as ever , according to data from the OECD 's Communications Outlook report .
American households watch the box for over eight hours a day on average , twice as long as anyone else .
Viewing has fallen in some countries .
Turks reportedly watched an hour 's less television per day in 2007 than they did only two years earlier , when the country was America 's nearest rival as couch - potato king .

What Is Mole Day ?
Avogadro's number is the number of particles in a mole of a substance .
Mole Day is an unofficial chemistry holiday celebrated on a date that relates to Avogadro 's number , which is approximately 6.02 x 1023 .
The purpose of Mole Day is to foster an interest in chemistry .
When Is Mole Day ?
In the US , this is usually October 23rd between 6:02 am and 6:02 pm. ( 6:02 10/23 ) .
Alternate observance dates for Mole Day are June 2 ( 6/02 in MM - DD format ) and February 6 ( 6/02 in DD - MM format ) from 10:23 am to 10:23 pm .
Mole Day Activities
Whenever you choose to celebrate it , Mole Day is a great day to think about chemistry in general and the mole in particular .
Here are some Mole Day activities for you :
Determine how much aluminum foil you would need to make a 0.5 mole aluminum sculpture ( of a mole , if you like ) .
Weigh out the foil and get creative .
Write your own mole joke .
Examples of mole jokes include :
Where did Avogadro stay on his vacation ?
A mole - tel .
Make up a song about the mole .
You should get bonus points if you make a video and upload it to YouTube .
Determine how much water is in one mole of water .
Can you drink that amount ?
Experimentally determine Avogadro 's number .
How Did Mole Day Get Started ?
Mole Day traces its origins to an article that appeared in The Science Teacher magazine in the early 1980s about a high school chemistry teacher 's reasons for celebrating the day .
The idea for Mole Day took root .
The National Mole Day Foundation was formed on May 15 , 1991 .
The American Chemical Society plans National Chemistry Week so that Mole Day falls within the week .
Today Mole Day is celebrated around the world .

is a small application directly derived from GeeXLab .
It ’s a ready to use PyOpenGL platform .
What does it mean ?
Simply that you can code OpenGL instructions and very quickly see the result without the compilation step .
PyOpenGL_LAB already includes the PyOpenGL package so you do n’t have to worry about it .
Like GeeXLab , PyOpenGL_LAB only requires a proper Python 2.6.3 installation .
You can download PyOpenGL_LAB here ( only a direct left - click allows the download ) :
[ download#93#image ]
Unzip PyOpenGL_LAB somewhere and launch PyOpenGL_LAB.exe .
You should see something like this :
In this image you can see 10,000 lines rendered with an OpenGL display list .
I found the original OpenGL code here
PyOpenGL_LAB has 2 important files : PyOpenGL_LAB_Init.py and PyOpenGL_LAB_Rendering.py .
PyOpenGL_LAB_Init.py is the initialization file .
For example , this file contains the number of lines to be drawn .
You can of course add OpenGL commands into this file .
PyOpenGL_LAB_Init.py is executed only once .
PyOpenGL_LAB_Rendering .py contains immediate mode commands and this script is executed every frame .
Immediate mode means you talk directly with the renderer ( or GPU ) via two methods : OpenGL commands or HYP_Renderer library .
HYP_Renderer can be seen like a wrapper over OpenGL commands .
Some functions of HYP_Renderer lib can be directly written in OpenGL like HYP_Renderer .
SetPointSize ( ) but others like HYP_Renderer .
ApplyCurrentViewMatrix ( ) are a bit more complex so they are really useful .
Here is the code of PyOpenGL_LAB_Rendering.py :
HYP_Camera.ApplyToRenderer(gMainCameraId ) " " " ============================
Add your rendering code below : ============================ " " " glScalef ( 15.0 , 15.0 , 15.0 ) if useDisplayList : glCallList( listId ) else : random.seed ( 10 ) glBegin( GL_LINES ) i = 0. for i in range ( gNumLines ) : i+=.1 t = random.uniform ( 0,3 ) x = math.sin(i+t*. 14 ) y = math.sin(i*.2+t*.114 ) z = math.cos(i*.12+t*.114 ) ** 2 glColor3 f( x , y- x , z*.1 ) glVertex3 f( x , y, z ) glEnd ( )
HYP_Camera.ApplyToRenderer ( ) applies camera transformation ( projection and view matrices as well as viewport ) to the renderer .
This is cool : you ’re not going to bother with camera settings if the purpose of your test is not camera management .
The rest of the code draws the random lines : either using a display list or with direct calls to glBegin( GL_LINES ) and glVertex3f ( very slow ! ) .
The OpenGL rendering context and swap buffer are managed by GeeXLab engine so forget them !
Once you ’ve finished your modifications , press CTRL+R in GeeXLab to reload PyOpenGL_LAB main file .
Just for fun , I did some benchmarks and here are the results :

According to the latest quarterly assessment of partisanship by the Gallup Poll , just 34 percent of Americans are Democrats and only 28 percent are Republicans .
This represents slightly less partisanship than Gallup found in 1992 , when the Ross Perot presidential candidacy racked up almost 19 percent of the popular vote .
That year , 34 percent of Americans were Democrats and 29 percent Republicans .
ADVERTISEMENT
Even more interesting than the Gallup organization ’s counting of partisans is their overlooked question regarding the need for a third party .
Since 2003 , Gallup has periodically asked Americans whether the two parties “ do an adequate job of representing the American public ” or whether they do such a poor job that “ a third major party is needed . ”
The percentage backing a third party has fluctuated between 40 percent and 58 percent .
That ’s a sizable dissent from the classic notion that we are a two - party political system .
This deeply ingrained and persistent dissent from the two - party monopoly may be the best explanation that realignment is n’t occurring , despite Obama ’s popularity .
There are other impediments , too .
Theories of realignment almost always hinge on either there being a realigning issue or the movement of a particular segment of voters to a new party .
Lately , there has been no issue that cuts across party lines in a manner to disrupt traditional partisan loyalties .
Since the South shifted to the Republicans , signaling the last realignment , nothing much has happened to change the partisan picture .
The only other harbinger of realignment can be the rise of third parties and independent candidacies that might eventually morph into a party .
The latter is such a long shot , of course , that it almost never happens .
So we are left with episodic independent candidacies that perpetuate dealignment , one race at a time .
The most interesting independent candidacies these days are a factor in blocking any chances for a Democratic realignment .
Independent candidates running for governor in several Northeastern states are taking votes mostly away from Democrat front - runners .
But Republicans could also suffer from dealignment .
I ’m already thinking that Ron Paul is hatching various alternative schemes that could make 2012 another 1992 , when Ross Perot ’s insurgent campaign cost George H.W. Bush his reelection .
Recently , Paul installed one of his high priestesses , Debra Medina , in the Texas gubernatorial race , adding to the field that is already too crowded with Rick Perry and Kay Bailey Hutchison .
So why would Paul do this ?
He may be currying favor with Rick Perry .
Perry probably benefits by having another female in the race , to rob a few feminist votes from Hutchison .
So if Perry prevails because of Paul ’s sidekick , the Texas governor will owe the doctor favors in case he runs for president in 2012 as a Republican .
But who knows ?
Perry , the secessionist , could join Dr. Paul in an even more probable scenario .
My better guess is that the Medina candidacy is a Paul stunt to justify his leaving the Republican Party in 2011 to run a Perot - style campaign for president .
When Paul gets nothing and Hutchison wins , Dr. Paul will snort that this proves again that the Republicans are not sufficiently conservative , providing him with the moral justification to head out on his own .
In many ways , this makes a lot more sense than Paul running as a Republican .

Target Crater Cabeus
Image Credit : NMSU / MSFC Tortugas Observatory
Explanation : About 100 kilometers from the Moon 's South Pole , 100 kilometer wide crater Cabeus is the target for two LCROSS mission spacecraft on course to impact the Moon tomorrow .
The shadowed crater is strongly foreshortened in this mosaic , a representative view of the region for earthbound telescopes .
The impacts are intended to create billowing debris plumes extending into the sunlight above the crater walls , that could reveal signs of water .
First to impact will be the mission 's Centaur upper stage rocket at 11:30 UT ( 7:30 am EDT ) .
The instrumented LCROSS mothership will image the impact and then fly through the resulting debris plume analyzing the material blasted from the crater floor .
Four minutes after the first impact , the LCROSS mothership itself will crash into Cabeus .
The plumes are expected to be visible in telescopes about 10 inches in diameter or larger , with the timing favoring Moon watchers in western North America and the Pacific .
NASA also plans to broadcast live footage from the LCROSS mission on NASA TV starting at 6:15 am EDT / 3:15 am PDT on October 9 .
( CNN ) -- Filmmaker Roman Polanski has been arrested on an arrest warrant stemming from a decades - old sex charge , Swiss police said Sunday .
Roman Polanski attends a film premiere in Paris , France , in June 2009 .
The Academy Award - winning director pleaded guilty in 1977 to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor , acknowledging he had sex with a 13 - year - old girl , but fled the United States before he could be sentenced .
U.S. authorities issued a warrant for his arrest in 1978 .
He was taken into custody trying to enter Switzerland on Saturday , Zurich police said .
Polanski , 76 , has lived in France for decades to avoid being arrested if he enters the U.S.
He declined to collect his Academy Award for Best Director in person when he won it for " The Pianist " in 2003 .
He was en route to the Zurich Film Festival , which is holding a tribute to him , when he was arrested by Swiss authorities , the festival said .
Polanski was nominated for best director Oscars for " Tess " and " Chinatown , " and for best writing for " Rosemary 's Baby , " which he also directed .
" Roman Polanski , who is one of the greatest film directors of all time , would have been honored for his life 's work in Zurich today , " the film festival said in a statement .
" However yesterday , on Saturday , he was taken into custody while attempting to enter Switzerland due to a request by U.S. authorities in connection with an arrest warrant from 1978 . "
The Swiss Justice Ministry said Polanski was put " in provisional detention . "
But whether he can be extradited to the United States " can be established only after the extradition process judicially has been finalised , " a ministry spokesman said in an e-mail .
" It is possible to appeal at the federal penal court of justice against an arrest warrant in view to extradition as well as against an extradition decision , " the spokesman wrote .
" Their decisions can be taken further to the federal court of justice . "
Polanski was accused of plying a 13 - year - old girl with champagne and a sliver of a quaalude tablet and performing various sex acts , including intercourse , with her during a photo shoot at actor Jack Nicholson 's house .
He was 43 at the time .
Nicholson was not at home , but his girlfriend at the time , actress Anjelica Huston , was .
According to a probation report contained in the filing , Huston described the victim as " sullen . "
" She appeared to be one of those kind of little chicks between -- could be any age up to 25 .
She did not look like a 13 - year - old scared little thing , " Huston said .
She added that Polanski did not strike her as the type of man who would force himself on a young girl .
" I do n't think he 's a bad man , " she said in the report .
" I think he 's an unhappy man . "
Polanski pleaded guilty to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor .
There have been repeated attempts to settle the case over the years , but the sticking point has always been Polanski's refusal to return to attend hearings .
Prosecutors have consistently argued that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a man to go free who " drugged and raped a 13 - year - old child . "
Polanski's lawyers tried earlier this year to have the charges thrown out , but a Los Angeles judge rejected the request .
In doing so , Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza left the door open to reconsider his ruling if Polanski shows up in court .
Espinoza also appeared to acknowledge problems with the way Polanski's case was handled years ago .
According to court documents , Polanski , his lawyer and the prosecutor thought they 'd worked out a deal that would spare Polanski from prison and let the young victim avoid a public trial .
But the original judge in the case , who is now dead , first sent the director to maximum - security prison for 42 days while he underwent psychological testing .
Then , on the eve of his sentencing , the judge told attorneys he was inclined to send Polanski back to prison for another 48 days .
Polanski fled the United States for France , where he was born .
In the February hearing , Espinoza mentioned a documentary film that depicts backroom deals between prosecutors and a media - obsessed judge who was worried his public image would suffer if he did n't send Polanski to prison .
" It 's hard to contest some of the behavior in the documentary was misconduct , " said Espinoza .
But he declined to dismiss the case entirely .
Legal experts said such a ruling would have been extremely rare .
Polanski's victim is among those calling for the case to be tossed out .
Samantha Geimer filed court papers in January saying , " I am no longer a 13 - year - old child .
I have dealt with the difficulties of being a victim , have surmounted and surpassed them with one exception .
" Every time this case is brought to the attention of the Court , great focus is made of me , my family , my mother and others .
That attention is not pleasant to experience and is not worth maintaining over some irrelevant legal nicety , the continuation of the case . "
Geimer , now 45 , married and a mother of three , sued Polanski and received an undisclosed settlement .
She long ago came forward and made her identity public -- mainly , she said , because she was disturbed by how the criminal case had been handled .
Following Espinoza 's ruling earlier this year , Geimer 's lawyer , Larry Silver , said he was disappointed and that Espinoza " did not get to the merits and consider the clear proof of both judicial and prosecutorial corruption . "
He argued in court that had " Mr. Polanski been treated fairly " his client would not still be suffering because of publicity almost 32 years after the crime .
Polanski was arrested two days after one of his wife 's killers died .
The director 's pregnant wife , actress Sharon Tate , and four others were butchered by members of the Manson " family " in August 1969 .
Polanski was filming in Europe at the time .
By her own admission , Susan Atkins held the eight - months - pregnant Tate down as she pleaded for mercy , stabbing the 26 - year - old actress 16 times .
Atkins , 61 , died Thursday .
She had been suffering from terminal brain cancer .
CNN 's Frederik Pleitgen and Ann O'Neill contributed to this report .
All About Sexual Offenses • Roman Polanski
With the complete series boxset ( way overpriced ) and the season 4.5 DVD coming out next week I was thinking about the whole series and how I view the series after knowing what happens in the series finale .
From an objective standpoint , the finale and the whole fourth season frankly does not make much sense .
Everything the survivors have done are actually in the hands of a god that works in mysterious ways .
There 's random , benevolent angels that had previously seemed useless or just plain batty .
In fact , they are the ones who saved humanity .
Kara Thrace ?
She used to be the hotshot pilot , but now she 's some kind of divine being sent down to guide humans to a home .
I do n't know what Ronald Moore was thinking , but it seemed like he wanted something grand , something out of control of the puny mortals , but it 's clear from the miniseries and the first few seasons , that was never the intent of the show .
As much as I like shows with a solid , understandable plot , not once did I think the draw of BSG was just the storyline .
When I think of shows , the first thing I think about are the characters , and BSG does not disappoint .
There is a vast array of complex characters that continually develop and the acting is top - notch .
From President Roslin , the Adamas , Starbuck , the Agathons , BSG is one of the few shows that has such a wide variety of cast that it explores with depth .
Now I 'll admit that the fourth season does take the wild turn that people like , except this one was out of the blue , and did n't really fit with the whole theme of the story .
Yes there are enough huge plotholes for the Galactica and all the Raptors and Vipers to fly through , but I never minded .
As clear as day , The X - Files is my all - time favorite show , yet the whole alien storyline has no beginning , middle , or end .
Instead it is piece of information pilled on top of more information .
There is 9 seasons of build - up and no conclusion other than the rare resolution to some issue .
I continue to watch Lost even though there are lots of things that wo n't be explained .
Not everyone can be a J. Michael Straczynski ( Babylon 5 ) , so I 'm fine with whatever Ron Moore , Chris Carter , or J.J. Abrams throws at me .
I do n't expect a TV show with 22 episode seasons to have a perfect storyline or even a well - envisioned one .
A few story arcs with continuity is fine with me .
I wo n't fault BSG for a finale about divine intervention , but the rest of the show was amazing and much better than the original , and that 's all I can ask for .
A SAXON brooch and skull uncovered by a metal detecting enthusiast may point to a 1,500 - year - old royal grave hidden beneath a farmer ’s fields .
The Home Office has ordered the exhumation of an early sixth century skeleton found in West Hanney , near Wantage , on Sunday to allow archaeologists to investigate the size of the burial site .
The quality of the Saxon jewellery found pinned to the body has already been compared to treasure found at the Sutton Hoo burial site in Suffolk in 1939 ( see panel ) , now on display at the British Museum .
Anni Byard , Oxfordshire County Council ’s finds liaison officer , said the brooch was likely to have belonged to royalty , or somebody of considerable wealth .
She said : “ It ’s an important find with the burial still intact .
“ Finds like this do n’t come along very often . ”
Chris Bayston , 56 , from Yorkshire , picked up a signal at a weekend metal detecting rally at the farm , which is not being named to protect the site .
Digging down 13 inches , he found a copper alloy brooch , covered in gold and studded with garnets and coral .
Alongside it was the skull .
Mr Bayston , who has been metal detecting for 14 years , said : “ I lifted a shovel load of muck out and as I threw it down I saw the brooch .
“ I poked a hole open and saw the bones , and that ’s when I thought , ‘ Christ , I better stop — I ’ve hit a serious find . ’
“ I can not get my head around it yet .
It ’s a dream come true really , just unbelievable .
They may be able to learn a lot from this . ”
Rally organisers immediately realised they had uncovered a find of national significance , and called police to protect the discovery overnight .
Professional archaeologists began excavating the site yesterday , exhuming the body and sifting the mud for jewels which may have come detached from the brooch .
It is not yet known how long it will take to complete the operation .
Rally organiser Peter Welch , of the Weekend Wanderers Detecting Club , said : “ This is the biggest find I ’ve had in over 20 years .
“ It could be a Saxon princess or queen , but we will need more excavation to find out .
“ The brooch shows some very skilful workmanship , on a par with the Sutton Hoo burial . ”

As demonstrations have evolved with the help of text messages and online social networks , so too has the response of law enforcement .
On Thursday , F.B.I. agents descended on a house in Jackson Heights , Queens , and spent 16 hours searching it .
The most likely reason for the raid : a man who lived there had helped coordinate communications among protesters at the Group of 20 summit in Pittsburgh .
The man , Elliot Madison , 41 , a social worker who has described himself as an anarchist , had been arrested in Pittsburgh on Sept. 24 and charged with hindering apprehension or prosecution , criminal use of a communication facility and possession of instruments of crime .
The Pennsylvania State Police said he was found in a hotel room with computers and police scanners while using the social - networking site Twitter to spread information about police movements .
He has denied wrongdoing .
American protesters first made widespread use of mass text messages in New York , during the 2004 Republican National Convention , when hundreds of people used a system called TXTmob to share information .
Messages , sent as events unfolded , allowed demonstrators and others to react quickly to word of arrests , police mobilizations and roving rallies .
Mass texting has since become a valued tool among protesters , particularly at large - scale demonstrations .
The other day Tim O’Reilly tweeted about this New York Times article .
Entitled – Chicago ’s Loss : Is Passport Control to Blame ?
– the piece struck a chord with me since my last two efforts to cross into the United States from Canada have been dramatically unpleasant experiences .
Turns out that others – including IOC selection committee members – feel the same way :
Among the toughest questions posed to the Chicago bid team this week in Copenhagen was one that raised the issue of what kind of welcome foreigners would get from airport officials when they arrived in this country to attend the Games .
Syed Shahid Ali , an I.O.C. member from Pakistan , in the question - and - answer session following Chicago ’s official presentation , pointed out that entering the United States can be “ a rather harrowing experience . ”
Harrowing indeed !
I crossed the border two weeks ago on my way to French Lick , Indiana , to attend a bio-informatics conference .
I was n’t paid to attend , and had been invited by the founders of OpenMRS to whom I occasionally volunteer some advice and just think are all around great guys who I ’d do pretty much anything for .
Is a conference work or pleasure ?
Not really either , but to be safe , I said work .
Big mistake .
The border security officer said he did n’t care if I was not getting paid , work is work ( do n’t even bother trying to explain to him what an open source community is ) and he was inclined to red flag my passport and take away my TN ( work ) visa .
It was a terrifying experience ( and frankly , on the scale of what people can be accused or suspected of at the border economic issues are important but relatively less concerning than political or criminal ones – although do n’t underestimate the fear generated by seeing part of ones livelihood flash before ones eyes ) .
All this is made worse by the fact that there is , effectively , no appeals process .
Yes , maybe you can talk to somebody higher up , but the will likely take hours ( long after your flight is to depart in 90 minutes ) or even days ( once the conference or event you intended to attend or speak at has long since ended ) .
You are at the mercy of the person you ’re in front of .
All this may sound unfortunate but it has significant implications , political and economic implications .
International travel to the United States is down 10 % in the first quarter of 2009 – a big part of this is likely related to the economy , but I suspect that fewer and fewer people are choosing the United States as a destination .
But vacationers are minor in comparison to the impact on innovation and economic development .
Today , it is harder and harder for the best minds in the world to work for American companies and to do graduate work at American universities .
This means America ’s elite will interact less and less with leading thinkers from elsewhere and its companies will have to rely on American talent , and not international talent , to succeed .
Already the cracks are showing .
Google has employees who are forced to work in Canada since they can’t work in the United States .
And Microsoft recently opened a software development facility in Vancouver because US immigration laws made it too difficult to bring in top talent .
Indeed , I ’m increasingly persuaded that the new convention centre in Vancouver was a smart investment .
If you are hosting a conference with Americans and internationals in attendance there is no way you are going to host it in the United States .
Do Americans understand what is going on ?
Probably not .
While some of the above articles have appeared in the news section of the newspaper the Olympic story appeared in the Travel section – hardly the place to raise a red flag for politicians .
At least the President seems to now understand that it is an issue :
President Obama , who was there as part of the 10 - person team , assured Mr. Ali that all visitors would be made to feel welcome .
“ One of the legacies I want to see is a reminder that America at its best is open to the world , ” he said . ”
I hope he ’s successful since the consequences of the status quo will be ugly for the United States .
A closed border is like a closed mind – over time you become less receptive to new ideas or information and begin to atrophy .
Introduction
Alright , today we will learn how to make a vertical menu .
It looks something like a lava lamp menu ( Simple Lava Lamp Menu Tutorial ) because it has an icon following the hovered item .
It 's a pretty simple menu , but with a little bit of jQuery script , we will able to make it even more eye - catching .
1. HTML
As usual , from all my previous tutorials , I always like to keep HTML clean .
Well , it 's a good practise so that other can read your code easily .
We use a list for the menu and a div with block and png ( fix the png transparent image ) classes for the moving object .
Image above illustrates the structure of the html .
Class . block is floating above UL list within the #menu .
< div id =" menu " > < ul > < li > < a href= " # " >
Item 01</a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Item 02</a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Item 03</a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Item 04</a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Item 05</a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Item 05</a></li> </ul > < div class= " block png " ></div> </div >
2. CSS
I have something new in CSS - quick CSS PNG fix !
Credit to Komodomedia for the script .
It 's really easy to implement .
What you need to do is , if you have a div or an image with transparent PNG image , assign the .PNG class to it and it will fix the ie6 issue .
Yes , IE6 issue , it has a lot more issues .
If you want to know more about it , read this article for the bugs and fixes -
Right , I have put comments in the following CSS code to explain its purposes .
# menu { font - family : verdana ; font - size : 12 px ; position : relative ; margin: 0 auto ; width : 200 px ; } #menu ul { /* remove list style */ list - style : none ; padding : 0 ; margin:0 ; /* set the layer position */ position : relative ; z - index : 5 ; } #menu li { /* set the styles */ background : #ccc url ( bg.gif ) no-repeat 0 0 ; padding : 5 px ; margin : 2 px ; cursor : pointer ; border : 1 px solid #ccc ; } #menu li.hover { /* on hover , change it to this image */ background - image:url ( bg_hover.gif ) ! important ; } #menu li a { text - decoration : none ; color : #888 ; } #menu . block { /* allow javascript to move the block */ position : absolute ; top:0 ; /* set the left position */ left : 150 px ; /* display above the #menu */ z - index : 10 ; /* the image and the size */ background : transparent url( arrow.png ) no-repeat top right ; width :39 px ; padding : 4 px ; cursor : pointer ; } /* fast png fix */ * html .png { position : relative ; behavior : expression ( ( this.runtimeStyle.behavior= " none " ) &&( this.pngSet?this.pngSet=true:( this.nodeName == " IMG " && this.src.toLowerCase ( ).indexOf ( '.png ') >-1?( this.runtimeStyle.backgroundImage = " none " , this.runtimeStyle.filter = " progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader(src= ' " + this.src + " ' , sizing Method= ' image ' ) " , this.src = " transparent.gif " ) :( this .origBg = this .origBg? this.origBg : this.currentStyle.backgroundImage.toString ().replace ( 'url ( " ' , '' ) .replace ( ' " ) ' , '' ) , this.runtimeStyle.filter = " progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader(src= ' " + this.origBg + " ' , sizing Method=' crop ' ) " , this.runtimeStyle.backgroundImage = " none " ) ) , this.pngSet=true ) ) ; }
3. Javascript
In the javascript section , once it 's loaded , it grab the height of the menu and assign it to the block class and after that , move the block to the selected list item .
All the list items are being assigned to hover event , hence , if mouse hover is detected , it will get the top position of the list item and move the block toward it .
$ ( document ) . ready ( function ( ) { // Set the height of the block $ ( ' # menu .block ' ) .
height ( $ ( ' # menu li ' ) .
height ( ) ) ; // go to the default selected item topval = $ ( ' #menu .selected ' ) .position ( ) [ ' top ' ] ; $ ( ' # menu .block ' ) .stop ( ) .animate ( {top : topval} , {easing : '' , duration :500} ) ; $ ( ' # menu li' ) . hover ( function ( ) { // get the top position topval = $ ( this ) .position ( ) [ ' top ' ] ; // animate the block // you can add easing to it $ ( ' # menu .block ' ) .stop ( ) .animate ( {top : topval} , {easing : '' , duration :500} ) ; // add the hover effect to menu item $ ( this ) .addClass ( ' hover ' ) ; } , function ( ) { // remove the hover effect $ ( this ) .removeClass ( ' hover ' ) ; } ) ; } ) ;

In the past weeks the Pirate Bay has been ripped , copied and rebuilt by avid file - sharers , guaranteeing that the site 's legacy will be preserved no matter what .
The people behind the Kiosk of Piracy take this trend to a whole new level as they have created an offline copy of the site which is open to the public .
When The Pirate Bay team announced they were selling the site , many BitTorrent fans feared that one of the largest collection of torrents would vanish forever .
To prevent this from happening several people started collecting TPB torrents which they distributed to the public , while others used them to rebuild the site elsewhere on the Internet .
However , the Pirate Bay ‘ spirit ’ does n’t end at the borders of the Internet .
To prove this , the people behind the Kiosk of Piracy installed a copy of the site on a local WiFi network that is open to the public but not actually connected to the Internet .
“ The Kiosk is not connected to the Internet in any way , but the interested public is invited to use the service in a WiFi-radius around it , ” the people behind the project write on their weblog .
The Kiosk of Piracy located in Weimar , Germany
Even in a worst case scenario where anti-piracy outfits manage to shut down the Internet because it assists in copyright infringement , people will still be able to trade files .
As the Kiosk of Piracy people explain :
“ With our newest project , we are joining the work of the dear people and groups which managed to duplicate the contents of The Pirate Bay on other places in the Net .
We want to show in a very physical way that the Internet is neither a machine nor controllable in any way – it is just a system of agreements which work in any circumstances .
We do n’t need the Internet – the magic can happen anywhere . ”

The downside is that this old fashioned file - sharing network will cause some logistical problems , unless you live in Weimar , Germany .
But then again , everyone can setup a similar system in his or her backyard by using some old hardware .
For those interested in visiting the Kiosk of Piracy , a map of the exact location is available below .

At least 10 bodies - believed to be those of a kidnapped Colombian football team - have been found across the border in Venezuela .
The bodies , with multiple gunshot wounds , were found in Tachira .
One of the team is reported to have survived .
State authorities say they suspect a left - wing Colombian guerrilla group , the ELN , is to blame for the deaths .
The team , kidnapped two weeks ago , was known as Los Maniceros or Peanut Men , as they sold nuts along the border .
The Venezuelan authorities say they are still investigating whether the bodies are those of the kidnapped team members .
But local authorities in Tachira and several local newspapers are already reporting that the footballers have been killed .
The most senior official in Tachira state , Leomagno Flores , blamed the violence on the armed wing of the ELN , a group led by a man known El Payaso or the Clown .
He said it had been confirmed by the only survivor of the attack .
There is no clear motive for the violence although there is some speculation that it relates to enforced recruitment to their army .

Intel brought its mainstream desktop CPU lineup into the Nehalem era today with the launch of the Core i7 860 and 870 , and the Core i5 750 .
Also launched today is the P55 chipset , which implements a new system architecture that represents a significant break with Intel 's past .
In this short article , we 'll take a brief look at each , in turn .
In previous articles we 've covered Nehalem 's microarchitectural improvements to the Core 2 Duo lineage , so we wo n't recap that here .
What is worth repeating , though , is that Nehalem is Intel 's first x86 design to feature an on - die memory controller .
This significantly changes the system topology , but in a direction that AMD already went way back in 2003 .
Processor Number Base Clock Speed ( GHz ) Max Turbo Frequency ( GHz ) Cores / Threads Cache 1K Unit Price SMT TDP Core i7-870 2.93 3.6 4/8 8MB $ 562 Y 95W Core i7-860 2.80 3.46 4/8 8MB $ 284 Y 95 W Core i5-750 2.66 3.2 4/4 8MB $ 196 N 95 W
The Core i5 / i7 parts that were launched today are quad - core , with the i7 having two - way SMT for a total of eight threads per socket .
The table above gives a general breakdown of the relevant features of the three new parts .
An annotated floor plan of Lynnfield .
Source : Intel
The floor plan above shows the main blocks in Nehalem , and if you 've followed previous Nehalem launches ( most notably Bloomfield ) then you may be able to spot what 's missing : there is no QuickPath Interconnect ( QPI ) interface .
Instead , in a significant twist that differentiates Intel 's new PC system architecture from even AMD 's offerings , there is now a PCIe interface that enables the GPU to attach directly to the processor socket .
This latter move was made in anticipation of two things : 1 ) the GPU will migrate right into the processor socket at a later point when Intel releases a CPU with an on - die GPU integrated into it , and 2 ) for a discrete GPU , Intel hopes you 'll use Larrabee .
To understand what all of this means , let 's look at a few diagrams .
The P55's new system architecture
Below is a diagram of a standard Core 2 Duo system , and it represents the general layout of an Intel system up until Nehalem or an AMD system up until the Opteron .
A typical pre-Nehalem Intel system .
In the diagram above , the core logic chipset consists of two primary chips :
Memory controller hub ( MCH ) :
The memory controller hub , also called a " northbridge , " links the CPU and GPU with main memory .
I/O controller hub ( ICH ) :
The I/O controller hub , also called the " southbridge , " links the MCH to peripherals and mass storage .
The ICH typically hosts the USB and other expansion ports , mass storage interfaces , network interfaces , and the like .
As the GPU gained in size and importance , the standard PC system essentially took on a kind of hacked - together non-uniform memory architecture ( NUMA ) topology , with two main pools of DRAM ( main memory and graphics memory ) attached to the two main processors ( the CPU and the GPU ) .
As the amount of graphics memory increased to the point where the GPU became a second system on a daughtercard , this topology began to get more and more unbalanced and inefficient in its use of memory and bandwidth .
In 2003 , AMD made the obvious improvement by moving the memory controller hub up to the CPU socket , so that main memory could attach directly to the CPU the way that GDDR had been directly attached to the GPU for some time .
You can see the results below , and , give or take an I / O bridge chip or so , this is basically how AMD single - socket systems have looked since the memory controller went on - die .
A typical AMD single - socket system
You can see from the diagram that , with the memory controller moved onto the processor die , the northbridge has become a kind of " graphics hub " — it hosts the discrete GPU via some PCIe graphics lanes , and it typically has an integrated graphics processor ( IGP ) along with the requisite display ports .
The ICH is still there , doing pretty much the same job it always did .
Today 's P55 launch jumps from the first diagram above to the diagram below in a single move .
Intel 's P55 platform
Intel 's P55 can be seen as an evolution of the AMD topology shown previously , with the graphics hub and memory hub functionality all moved right onto the processor die .
Because the northbridge is completely gone , the southbridge / ICH has been rechristened the " platform controller hub , " and it's now the only chip in the core logic " chipset " ( aside from the BIOS , which is also typically included in the chipset count ) .
The PCH is connected to the processor socket by the relatively low - bandwidth ( 2GB /s ) DMI bus that used to connect the MCH to the ICH .
Disk I/O , network traffic , and other types of I/O will have to share this link .
This should n't be a problem for single - socket systems , though .
So with the advent of the P55 , Intel 's core logic has gone from a two - chip to a one - chip implementation , pushing ahead of the comparable AMD platform .
In theory , this very tight , direct coupling of the GPU + GDDR and CPU + DRAM systems should make for a performance boost vs. both earlier topologies .
It 's " in theory , " because Tech Report 's Core i5 / i7 benches show some surprising results that indicate that all is n't right with the new platform under Windows 7 , and that ( contrary to the stated conclusion ) gamers are better off with the older Core 2 Duo systems .
Take a look at the last benchmark on this page , which shows that the minute you boost the image quality settings to begin stressing the GPU instead of the CPU , Nehalem loses its advantage and actually underperforms the older systems .
This effect holds in both the i5 and the i7 , so it can't be an issue with SMT .
Something is screwy with Windows 7 , the drivers , or something on Intel 's end , but our money is on Windows 7 .
This is actually the most interesting benchmark result I 've seen today , and I 'm hoping that Scott and others will follow up on it and different combinations of OSes and games to isolate the issue .
Conclusions
The launch of Core i5 / i7 and the P55 represent a major step forward for Intel 's desktop line , and they bring Nehalem 's performance dominance of AMD 's offerings onto the mainstream desktop .
Intel is now well - positioned against both NVIDIA and AMD / ATI , since the former will soon be squeezed out of the high - volume Intel IGP market entirely ( when the GPU goes on - die ) and the latter is increasingly forced back into the bargain niche that it had so successfully escaped with the launch of the K8 .
Scientists at the University of Leeds have proved that acid in the atmosphere breaks down large particles of iron found in dust into small and extremely soluble iron nanoparticles , which are more readily used by plankton .
This is an important finding because lack of iron can be a limiting factor for plankton growth in the ocean - especially in the southern oceans and parts of the eastern Pacific .
Addition of such iron nanoparticles would trigger increased absorption of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
" This could be a very important discovery because there 's only a very small amount of soluble iron in the ocean and if plankton use the iron nanoparticles formed in clouds then the whole flux of bioavailable iron to the oceans needs to be revised , " says Dr Zongbo Shi , lead author of the research from the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds .
Water droplets in clouds generally form around dust and other particles .
When clouds evaporate , as they often do naturally , the surface of the particle can become very acidic .
This is especially true where the air is polluted .
Paradoxically , scientists suggest that large scale industry in countries like China could be combating global warming to some extent by creating more bioavailable iron in the oceans , and therefore increasing carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere .
" Man made pollution adds more acid to the atmosphere and therefore may encourage the formation of more iron nanoparticles , " says Dr Shi .
Scientists carried out the research by simulating clouds in the laboratory to which they added Saharan dust samples .
They were then able to mimic natural conditions in order to monitor the chemical processes happening in the system .
The laboratory experiments have been confirmed in natural samples where such cloud processing is known to have occurred .
The findings highlight the complexity of the pattern of natural iron delivery to the oceans , throwing new light on recent high profile plans to add iron to the southern oceans artificially to stimulate plankton growth .
" This process is happening in clouds all over the world , but there are particularly interesting consequences for the oceans .
What we have uncovered is a previously unknown source of bioavailable iron that is being delivered to the Earth 's surface in precipitation , " says Professor Michael Krom , the principal investigator of the research , also at the University of Leeds .
The research was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council .
Obama tops Bush in troop buildup
14 October 2009
The combined US troop deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan have now reached a higher level than existed at any time under the presidency of George W. Bush .
This surge past the record set by its predecessor marks another grim milestone in the Obama administration ’s escalation of American militarism .
In addition to the 21,000 US soldiers and Marines that Obama ordered deployed to Afghanistan as part of the escalation he unveiled last March , another 13,000 “ support ” troops are being quietly sent to the country with no official announcement , the Washington Post reported Tuesday .
This stealth buildup is a replay of the methods used by the Bush administration in its Iraq surge , when it announced the deployment of an additional 20,000 combat troops while saying nothing about the 8,000 support troops sent with them .
In neither case was the failure to declare the full number an oversight .
Obama , like Bush before him , recognizes that the military interventions he oversees are deeply unpopular with the majority of the American people .
According to the troop numbers provided by the Post , there are now 65,000 US troops in Afghanistan , with another 124,000 still in Iraq , for a total of 189,000 American military personnel waging two colonial - style wars and occupations .
At the height of the Bush administration ’s 2007 “ surge ” in Iraq , there were 26,000 US troops in Afghanistan and 160,000 in Iraq , for a total of 186,000 .
There is every indication that the policies being pursued by the Obama White House will send these numbers significantly higher .
Over the weekend , military officials revealed to the media that the proposal for increased troop levels in Afghanistan submitted by the American commander there , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , included a high - end figure of 80,000 — in addition to the 68,000 that are to be deployed by the end of this year .
The New York Times , echoing official sources , commented that this highest request was “ highly unlikely to be considered seriously by the White House . ”
While this may well be true — for now — the leaking of the number serves a definite political purpose , making Obama ’s ultimate agreement to a smaller surge — still involving tens of thousands of additional troops in Afghanistan — seem like a reasonable compromise between the White House and the Pentagon .
While visiting Britain this week , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stressed the US commitment to continuing the Afghanistan war .
“ We are not changing our strategy , our strategy remains to achieve the goal of disrupting , dismantling and defeating Al Qaeda and its extremist allies , and denying them safe haven and the capacity to strike us here in London , or New York or anywhere else , ” she said in a radio interview .
“ One should never doubt our commitment or our leadership , we intend to pursue the goal , ” Clinton continued .
“ We will not rest until we do defeat Al Qaeda . ”
Clinton ’s remarks make clear that the Obama administration , while dropping the term “ war on terrorism ” coined by the Bush White House , continues to embrace the methods underlying this terminology — in particular , the attempt to terrorize the American people into accepting US wars of conquest and aggression .
The claim that 68,000 US troops — with tens of thousands more likely to follow — are in Afghanistan to fight Al Qaeda and prevent another 9/11 is a transparent pretext .
Top US security and military officials have concurred that there are a grand total of approximately 100 individuals affiliated with Al Qaeda presently in Afghanistan , without any means of carrying out an attack on another country .
If and when McChrystal ’s request for additional troops is met , there will be 1,000 or more US soldiers and Marines in Afghanistan for every Al Qaeda member .
The target of the military escalation is not Al Qaeda , but rather the people of Afghanistan .
Washington is attempting to suppress growing popular resistance to the occupation and is prepared to sacrifice the lives of untold numbers of Afghans , as well as those of hundreds if not thousands more US soldiers , to that end .
The defeat of “ terrorism ” is no more the strategic aim pursued by Washington in Afghanistan than it is in Iraq .
US military might has been unleashed in both countries to assert the hegemony of American imperialism over Central Asia and the Persian Gulf , which are the two largest sources of the world ’s energy supplies .
The potential costs of this venture are immense .
A report prepared by the Pentagon last January describes the stated US goal of achieving a stable client state in Afghanistan as an operation that “ will last , at a minimum , decades . ”
Appearing on NBC’s “ Meet the Press ” Sunday , Gen. Barry McCaffrey ( ret. ) was slightly more optimistic , saying that it would take “ 10 years of $ 5 billion a month , ” in addition to major fighting .
In Iraq , meanwhile , there is no reason to believe that the stated deadline for pulling US troops out by 2012 will be met .
On the contrary , the instability and continued resistance created by the American occupation and the destruction of Iraqi society will be used as a justification for continuing the occupation and asserting US control over the country ’s oil fields .
And the threat that the US interventions will provoke new and potentially far bloodier conflicts is growing , as evidenced by the mounting crisis in Pakistan and increasing tensions throughout the Indian subcontinent flowing from the war in Afghanistan .
The debate that is now taking place in the Obama White House is over committing generations of young Americans to endless wars and occupations .
Under conditions in which resources are being denied for desperately needed jobs and basic social services , even more social wealth will be diverted to build up the US military .
Expanding the ranks of the Army is necessary if any significant escalation of the war in Afghanistan is to be sustained .
The military is stretched to the breaking point by the two occupations .
Even if Obama approves 40,000 more troops , nowhere near that number are immediately available .
While the American political establishment is no doubt counting on a double - digit unemployment rate driving jobless youth into the military , there is growing objective pressure for the reintroduction of conscription , with youth once again drafted to fight in colonial wars .
Millions of people voted for Barack Obama last November in the vain hope that his election would reverse the escalation of militarism initiated under Bush .
Their votes , like the growing popular sentiment against the Afghan war , have been disregarded as the Obama administration continues this escalation in the interest of the financial oligarchy that it serves .

Mordechai Vanunu , Israel ’s nuclear whistle blower , was jailed in 1986 for publishing photographs of Israel ’s nuclear bomb factory at Dimona .
Olenka Frenkiel reveals the extent of Israel ’s nuclear gagging .
The Sunday Times Revelations hit the press in October 1986 .
Vanunu has spent 17 years in jail , a11 of which were in a minute solitary confinement cell – and he has just had his appeal for parole denied .
He will stay in jail until 2004 , when his term is expected to end .
Sunday Times journalist Peter Hounam heard rumours in 1986 that an Israeli whistleblower was offering proof of what the world had long suspected .
His revelations confirmed that Israel was building advanced nuclear weapons .
After the Sunday Times published this scoop , Vanunu was kidnapped in London by Mossad agents and illegally smuggled back to Israel .
He was tried in secret and convicted of treason and spying .
Population growth is a massive climate change issue .
There , I ’ve said it .
Our species has grown too successful ( in terms of population ) for its habitat .
We do not have enough natural resources for people to live sustainably in the coming decades .
Most people do not live sustainably now – if we are not burning fossil fuels in the West , we are sucking our groundwater dry or eating the last bluefin tunafish .
In the developing world , the remaining rainforests are being chopped or burned , again with the groundwater , and so on .
Too many people .
This past week , Jairam Ramesh , India ’s environment minister complained that American diplomats were trying to get the population issue into Copenhagen ’s negotiations .
He said : “ Influential American thinktanks are asking why should we reward profligate reproductive behaviour ?
Why should we reward India which is adding 14 million people every year ? ”
Good , and about time .
If we are serious about dealing with climate change then we need to discuss how the world is to deal with all the issues , including population .
But , let ’s not forget that while India , China and Bangladesh continue with their destructive swell , things are n’t looking that rosy closer to home .
The US population , a substantial 306 million , is projected to grow by 46 % by 2050 , according to its national census bureau – the global average is 38 % .
Climate predictions for the States are pretty scary : dustbowl scenarios worse than in The Grapes of Wrath , water shortages , increased hurricane intensity …
Couple that with the enormous socioeconomic inequalities already prevalent in the country , and climate change will have a terrible impact on millions of people there .
So , let ’s talk about population : if it ’s not a homegrown increase in your country , then it ’ll sure as hell become an immigration increase as the world warms and our species ’ habitat becomes scarcer .
What happens if you eat one of those silica gel packets that come in the pepperoni you ordered online , your Jimmy Choos , or your new leather coat ?
We ’re not sure why you would , but if you ’ve eaten one by mistake , you ’ll likely be fine .
According to Mike Yudizky , a recently retired paramedic and the public health educator at the North Texas Poison Control Center , “ It ’s nothing more than a type of sand .
Despite the big - time warnings , it ’s completely nontoxic . ”
Even if you were to eat a shoebox full of packets , the only result would be “ an upset tummy .
But the same would happen if you drank too much water . ”
The grains of what looks like clear caviar in the tiny packets are a desiccant .
That is , they absorb moisture .
You find them in food products that will have a longer shelf life if they stay dry .
That could include pepperoni , dried nuts and fruits , or vitamins .
So why do the packets include warnings , occasionally including a skull and crossbones ?
To avoid product liability cases , says Yudizky .
The packets are “ harmful if swallowed by an infant or pet , as they could choke or aspirate on the silicon gel packet , ” explains Michelle Musallam , a certified physician ’s assistant in Dallas , Texas .
In some cases , the stuff is coated with a moisture indicator such as cobalt ( II ) chloride , a toxic substance that may be carcinogenic .
But Yudizky says even that would n’t be a problem because of the incredibly small amount involved .
The abandoned puppy was named Bambi because of her special little walk
A disabled 12 - week - old puppy found abandoned at a landfill site in Sussex has been taken in by an animal warden and needs a new home .
Lewes District Council 's Tracey Hills , who rescued her from the Newhaven site , said it was immediately clear there was something wrong because of her walk .
She said the puppy was thought to have cerebella - hypoplasia , which causes jerky and unco-ordinated movement .
The Jack Russell cross was named Bambi because of her " special little walk " .
Ms Hills said : " Her disability wo n't stop her from living a normal happy life that she deserves .
She just needs special considerations and commitment .
" She is just like any other normal puppy , and just wants to play and have lots of cuddles . "
PHILIP Gordon , the Obama administration 's point man on Europe , is that most unusual of senior American officials : one prepared to speak frankly in public to foreigners .
In my experience , State Department officials have a habit of being relentlessly on message while on foreign tours , which makes it a bit hit and miss for working hacks trying to decide whether to attend one of their speeches or briefings .
So it was with slight trepidation that I headed to a speech by Mr Gordon , the assistant secretary of state for European affairs , this morning .
The speech was ok , nothing special , as it turned out .
Then someone asked one of the standard Brussels euro- questions : would you prefer it if Europe spoke with one voice .
Mr Gordon 's reply started off cautiously .
It is up to you Europeans to decide if you want to be united , he said .
Then an unexpected candour descended .
“ We want to see a strong and united Europe , speaking with one voice .
In the best of all possible worlds , that one voice will be saying what we want to hear … .
If it is not saying what we want to hear , then we would rather that voice was less united .
For the foreseeable future we will have to have relations with the EU and with nations .
You go to the place that can deliver ... [ For example ] on trade , we deal with the EU , as the EU is the decider . ”
Later , he was asked if he felt Europe needed to think more strategically .
Absolutely , he replied :
“ We want to see Europe thinking more strategically , because we think if they do think more strategically , they 'll think more like Americans . ”
At one point , I thought that Elmar Brok , a peppery German MEP who was chairing the meeting , would explode .
At the end of the session , Mr Brok gave his guest a stern lecture , telling him that if the American strategy was to encourage disunity when it suited it , it risked delaying forever the stronger , more united Europe America says it wants .
I think Mr Brok should lighten up .
Mr Gordon was only saying what American officials have surely thought for years .
Honesty is not everything in diplomacy , but it makes a refreshing change .

Karima Yousafzai jumps behind the wheel of her 1994 Toyota Corolla and heads into traffic , deftly negotiating around wannabe motocross champions , oblivious pushcart peddlers , a roadside herd of sheep and several contenders for the crazy - driver - of - the - year award .
She takes little notice of the looks directed her way .
“ I ’ve stopped caring about the stares men give you , ” the 43 - year - old university professor says .
“ I just ignore them . ”
A female driver in Afghanistan is something of a rare bird .
In the first six months of the fiscal year that began April 1 , the number of driving permits issued to women in the Kabul area was up fourfold .
That sounds great until you consider that officials issued just 180 licenses to women in the last 18 months , compared with 27,985 for men .

Men own the roads of Afghanistan , and many of them want it to stay that way .
They say it is un-Islamic and culturally offensive for women to get behind the wheel .
Yousafzai , who teaches the Koran for a living , disagrees .
The holy book makes no mention of internal combustion engines , automatic transmissions or driving restrictions on women , she says .
“ When men say women are n’t capable of driving , my response is , ‘ I ’ll challenge you any time , ’ ” says Yousafzai , wearing a head scarf and dark glasses .
Afghanistan , a male - dominated Muslim society , has often discouraged women from participating in public life .
That includes driving , especially from 1996 to 2001 , when the fundamentalist Taliban government all but outlawed it .
It is “ against Afghan traditions and has a negative impact on the environment , ” the Taliban declared in May 2001 .
Advertisement
After the Taliban was ousted at the end of that year , President Hamid Karzai pledged to respect women ’s rights .
There was an initial jump in the number of female drivers , but tradition dies hard , and Karzai ’s promise has faltered .
--
Men commonly contend that women should n’t be subjected to the unpredictable Afghan traffic and that their security could be compromised , given all the violence .
“ Imagine if a woman had an accident , ” says Abdul Habib , a 20 - year - old student , strolling with two male friends .
“ Hundreds of men would gather around and curse at her .
Then I ’m sure she would cry .

“ After that she ’d probably call her brother or husband for help , ” he adds , to the amusement of his friends .
Freshta Nahad , 21 , a Kabul University economics student , sees little humor in such jibes .
“ If men obeyed the law , ” she says , “ we would n’t have so many problems . ”
“ Security ’s a problem all over Afghanistan , ” says Fatima Maisjadi , 17 , a carpet weaver who has driven a few times off - road with her family .
“ Why blame it on women ? ”
At the Mamozai Driving Academy in the basement of a Kabul shopping center , founder and instructor Summer Gul Khan runs students through a tutorial in a grubby room with road sign posters and disemboweled car parts .

“ Carburetor , drive shaft , engine block , ” says the instructor , tapping each component with a stick .
Mamozai was the country ’s first private school to offer driving classes to women , nearly a decade ago .
During its first two years , under Taliban rule , there were just two female students .
Both worked for charity organizations and would remove their burkas while in the classroom , then dive back under the all - encompassing garment before driving , peering through the small eye - slit to see the road .
Now 20 % of his several thousand students each year are women , Khan says , although few of them drive regularly after getting their licenses .
“ Their families are n’t comfortable letting them , ” he says .
“ Maybe they ’ll only do it in emergencies , or for short trips . ”

Khan , who charges $ 70 for the course , thinks Afghan women and men are equally suited to driving .
The problem is that society does n’t offer women much encouragement or opportunity to practice , so they often lack confidence .
Many of the men who bad - mouth them are illiterate and feel threatened by women ’s ( slowly ) rising status , fearing that they will take away their driving jobs one day , he says .
Policeman Mohammad Usman Nawabi , 53 , says women are better at driving than men because they drive defensively .
“ Some of these guys seem to think they ’re doing loop - the - loops in an airplane , ” he says .
During Soviet occupation , women were encouraged to drive , at least in Kabul , the capital .
Safer Ali , 70 , a snack cart owner , says that in subsequent years , the main cities filled up with conservative migrants from the countryside who bridled at even limited freedoms for women .

Zubaida Akbar , 19 , a student and government employee , has been driving for less than a month .
She does n’t have a license .
“ Getting a license is n’t easy , ” she says .
“ You either have to know someone or pay money . ”
She started driving anyway , she says , because it was such a hassle to have a male relative drive her every evening to her visual arts classes .
“ These roads are terrible , ” she notes , negotiating a 5 - inch pothole .
Advertisement
“ As you can see , I ’m still learning to park , ” she says as a three - point turn morphs into at least a five - point .
She ’d learn a lot more quickly if male drivers would stop doing stupid things that tear at her confidence , she says .
Many
Afghans are afflicted with road rage these days , which mirrors the stress and violence in their everyday lives .
When they see her at the wheel , some men race past her , then slam on their brakes in some version of “ chicken . ”
“ Sometimes I give them the finger , ” she says , a gesture she learned from foreign friends .
“ Of course , I should just try and ignore them , but we ’re all human . ”
Advertisement
Akbar says she nonetheless worries that if she gets into an accident , or if a soldier or policeman stops her on a lonely road and sexually harasses her , she ’ll be blamed .
“ They automatically say it ’s the woman ’s fault , even when it ’s not , ” she says , heading around a traffic circle twice after getting some bad directions from her cousin .
“ Women here are defined by men .
We do n’t even know who we are sometimes because they make all the decisions for us . ”
At the same time , the independence and self - esteem that come with driving are mostly worth the aggravation , women say .
“ It ’s made me so proud , ” says Yousafzai , who two years ago had long arguments with her husband and father before they relented and allowed her to drive .
“ I was over - the - moon happy when I got my license , and I still am now . ”

The US military on Friday canceled plans to send a 3,500 - strong Army brigade to Iraq because of improving security conditions there , possibly freeing up troops for the war in Afghanistan .
The 1st Infantry Brigade Combat Team from the 10th Mountain Division based in Fort Drum , New York , had been scheduled to relieve another combat brigade in Iraq in January but will not deploy , the Defense Department said in a statement .

With the US commander in Afghanistan asking for major reinforcements , the move could provide another brigade for the troubled mission if President Barack Obama decides to approve the troop request .
“ The decision was based on a thorough assessment of the security environment in Iraq and reflects the continued improvement in the ability of the Iraqi Security Forces to safeguard Iraqi citizens and institutions , ” the statement said .
The brigade “ will return to the Army ’s pool of available combat forces , ” it said .
The US commander in Iraq , General Ray Odierno , has said he wants to retain a larger force in the country to maintain security for elections due in January before a planned drawdown of forces down to 50,000 by the end of August 2010 .
About 119,000 US troops are currently stationed in Iraq , down from about 140,000 at the beginning of the year .

Defense Secretary Robert Gates said last month that if Obama approves a troop buildup in Afghanistan , the first reinforcements would not arrive on the ground until January .
US troop levels are to reach 68,000 in Afghanistan by the end of the year .
Rubber is an important source of revenue for Liberia
An investigation by the government in Liberia has concluded that the Firestone Rubber Plantation Company has polluted local water sources .
The three - month investigation found that a plant south - east of the capital Monrovia was responsible for high levels of orthophosphate in creeks .
The report called on Firestone to improve its waste treatment facility .
Firestone said it believed it fully complied with environmental law and its waste water was not harmful to health .
Sample testing
The Firestone plant is about 48 km ( 30 miles ) south - east of Monrovia and the creeks are a water source for tens of thousands of villagers .
Many residents had said they could no longer use the water .
The BBC's Jonathan Paye - Layleh in Monrovia says residents in the town of Kpanyah town had been complaining of developing skin rashes on venturing into affected creeks .
The investigation team included government ministries , Firestone representatives and local residents .
Water samples were collected and tested at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon .
Testing was also carried out in Liberia .
The tests confirmed high levels of orthophosphate .
The report called on the management of Firestone to adhere to the Environmental Protection and Management Law .
Firestone said it believed it was in full compliance with the law and with its environmental commitments to the government and that it " strongly disagreed with any characterisation to the contrary " .
It said an external consultant had found the plant 's waste water was not harmful .
Firestone said that phosphate was also not harmful to human health but that it would work to address any elevated levels .
It said it believed its water treatment system was working as designed and intended .
So , Edge Rails is still chugging right along .
There are new and interesting fixes , changes , and refactors going on all of the time .
So , lets take a look at just a few that ’ve gone in since the last post ( it ’s been a while , I know , I ’m sorry ! ) .
ActionView and Helpers
XSS escaping is now enabled by default .
This means that if you want to explicitly output HTML to your views , you ’ll probably have to mark it as html_safe !
before sending it through .
< %= 'my < a href = " http://www.rubyonrails.org ">safe</a> string '.html_safe ! %>
Many of the built - in helpers have been updated for this change and if you see an issues with the Rails helpers being incorrectly sanitized , you should create a new ticket .
distance_of_time_in_words has gained ‘ over ’ , ‘ about ’ , and ‘ almost ’ keywords , thanks to Jay Pignata and John Trupiano .
This provides you with an improved level of granularity when approximating the amount time passed .
So , instead of just “ 2 years ago ” , it can now also report “ almost 2 years ago , ” “ about 2 years ago , ” and “ over 2 years ago , ” depending on the proximity to being exactly 2 years old .
assert_equal " almost 2 years " , distance_of_time_in_words( from , to + 2.years - 3.months + 1.day ) assert_equal " about 2 years " , distance_of_time_in_words ( from , to + 2.years + 3.months - 1.day ) assert_equal " over 2 years " , distance_of_time_in_words ( from , to + 2.years + 3.months + 1.day ) assert_equal " over 2 years " , distance_of_time_in_words ( from , to + 2.years + 9.months - 1.day ) assert_equal " almost 3 years " , distance_of_time_in_words ( from , to + 2.years + 9.months + 1.day )
The HTML form helper , fields_for - generally used for nesting additional model forms - now allows for explicit collections to be used , thanks to Andrew France .
So , instead of just including all of your blog .
posts , you should have it only display your published blog .
posts , for example .
Or :
<% form_for @person , :url => { :action => " update " } do |person_form| %> ... <% person_form.fields_for : projects , @active_projects do | project_fields| %>
Name : <%= project_fields.text_field : name %> <% end %> <% end %>
API Change for content_tag_for :
The third argument - being the optional CSS prefix - will now also affect the generated CSS class .
This prefix will now be appended to the generated element ’s CLASS attribute .
< %= content_tag_for ( :li , @post , : published ) %> # => < li id =" published_post_123 " class= " published_post " >...</li>
ActiveResource and ActiveRecord
Taryn East has added update_attribute (s ) methods to ActiveResource .
These methods act very similarly to the ActiveRecord methods we already know and love .
Building or creating an object through a has_one association that contains conditionals will now automatically append those conditions to the newly created object , thanks to Luciano Panaro .
class Blog has_author : commit_author , :class_name => ' Author ' , : conditions => {: name => " Luciano Panaro " } end @blog.build_commit_author # =>
#< Author name : " Luciano Panaro " ... >
Pratik Naik added a new option to ActiveRecord ’s accepts_nested_attributes_for to : limit the number of records that are allowed to be processed .
Also , while we ’re covering accepts_nested_attributes_for , José Valim as renamed the _delete option to _destroy to better follow what is actually occurring .
A deprecation warning has been added to _delete , for the time being .
Jacob Burkhart updated the new autosave option in Rails 2.3 to allow for an :autosave => false , which will disallow saving of associated objects , even when they are new_record ?
s.
Some Internals
Previously , CDATA elements could be ignored when converting from XML to a Hash , so now , thanks to John Pignata , Hash # from_xml will now properly parse and include CDATA elements values .
Josh Peek has relocated global exception handling into ActionDispatch : : Rescue .
So , this is now being handled at the Rack middleware level .
And finally , Yehuda Katz and Carl Lerche began work on a Rails : : Application object to better encapsulate some of the application start up and configuration details .
Also , a good bit of initialization has now gone on to move into this new object .

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
War with Iran is now inevitable .
The only question is :
Will it happen sooner or later ?
Tehran ’s recent missile tests and war games suggest that the apocalyptic mullahs have reached the same conclusion .
Iran is on the march .
Their medium - range Shahab - 3 and Sajjil missiles can reach Israel , the entire Middle East and parts of Europe .
Tehran is slowing expanding its regional sphere of influence .
It has backed insurgency groups in Iraq , which have killed U.S. soldiers .
It sponsors Hamas and Hezbollah .
It has transformed Syria into a political vassal .
It has forged an alliance with Hugo Chavez ’s Venezuela .
It has purchased key air defense systems from Vladimir Putin ’s Russia .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is a Holocaust - denier and virulent anti-Semite .
He is a Persian Nazi strongman who vows to wipe Israel “ off the map . ”
He is a revolutionary Shi’ite .
He believes the Jews must be extinguished in order to usher the coming of the Shi’ite Messiah , the so - called “ Hidden Imam . ”
For years , the fascist theocracy has invested considerable resources into developing a clandestine nuclear weapons program .
Mr. Ahmadinejad insists
Tehran only wants atomic energy for “ peaceful purposes . ”
Yet , he cannot answer one simple question :
Why does a country with the world ’s second - largest natural gas reserves and third - largest oil supply need domestic nuclear power ?
Moreover , Mr. Ahmadinejad is a congenital liar .
He repeatedly insists that Iran is a “ democracy . ”
Rather , it is a brutal police state based on rigged elections and the torture and murder of dissidents .
He claims that Iran has “ no homosexuals ” and that women are treated “ fairly . ”
In fact , the Islamist regime routinely executes gays and subjugates women .
He says Iran has “ nothing to hide ” about its nuclear program .
The West , however , recently discovered a hidden , underground facility near the holy city of Qom capable of producing highly enriched uranium for weapons - grade nuclear material .
Since establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979 , Iran has been engaged in an ideological struggle against the West .
Its two main enemies have been the United States ( “ the Great Satan ” ) and Israel ( “ the Little Satan ” ) .
From its inception , Tehran has sought to erect a world Muslim empire ; to restore medieval Islamic civilization to its former dominance .
The regime is reactionary and - in a twisted manner - even utopian .
Nuclear weapons are about more than attaining great - power status .
They are the means to achieve the final triumph of messianic Shi’ism .
Iran is on the verge of acquiring the bomb .
The mullahs have reached the point of no return .
Israel - the country that has to live in that dangerous part of the world - believes the mullahs are six to nine months away from getting it .
Hence , President Obama ’s policy of diplomatic engagement combined with possible sanctions is doomed to fail .
It is ineffective , naive and reckless .
Direct talks , like those conducted in Geneva on Thursday , only give Iran more time .
Mr. Obama is simply providing the mullahs with the cover they need to finish completing their nuclear arsenal .
Washington now has two choices : Sanction an American or Israeli military attack to destroy Iran ’s nuclear facilities or allow Tehran to go nuclear .
Either option means war .
A devastating strike would likely trigger a fierce Iranian response , including waves of suicide bombers targeting Israeli civilians and U.S. troops in Iraq .
Iranian missiles would pound Israeli and , maybe , European cities .
Vital shipping lanes in the Persian Gulf would be disrupted , driving the price of oil to more than $ 300 a barrel - plunging the West into a possible depression .
Hezbollah sleeper cells might be activated within the United States , unleashing deadly atrocities on American soil .
Yet , allowing a nuclear - armed Iran is likely to lead to an even worse regional war .
Once the ruling clerics get their hands on nukes , a military showdown with Israel is inevitable .
They will seek to destroy the Jewish state once and for all .
Jerusalem will not stand by and commit existential suicide .
It will retaliate .
The result would be a nuclear holocaust in the Middle East .
The winds of war are blowing across the Persian Gulf .
Following this summer ’s crackdown on pro-democracy protesters , the Iranian regime is weak , desperate and fracturing .
Washington should vigorously pursue a policy of internal regime change ; otherwise , Tehran will drag the Middle East into a certain conflagration that could lead to the slaughter of millions .
Instead , Mr. Obama has ruled out “ meddling in Iran ’s internal affairs . ”
His peace - at - any - cost diplomacy guarantees military conflict .
It is no longer a question of if this will happen , but when and on whose terms .
Mr. Obama is sleepwalking into disaster .
America and the Middle East will pay the price .

Stop this train !
That is the message Jerry Brown sent this week to Arne Duncan .
Secretary of Education Duncan will visit Sacramento on Thursday , to make sure the state complies with his requirements that we allow test scores to be linked to teacher pay and evaluations , and to unlimited expansion of charter schools .
California 's former governor and current Attorney General Jerry Brown sent this comment on August 28 , 2009 , in response to Arne Duncan 's Race to the Top .
I think it is worth reading .
Via eRulemaking Portal : www.regulations.gov
Re : Race to the Top Fund [ Docket ID ED - 2009 - OESE - 0006 ]
In view of the hundreds of comments that are being submitted , I am confining my own to just a few general observations .
1 . The basic assumption of your draft regulations appears to be that top down , Washington driven standardization is best .
This is a “ one size fit all ” approach that ignores the vast diversity of our federal system and the creativity inherent in local communities .
What we have at stake are the impressionable minds of the children of America .
You are not collecting data or devising standards for operating machines or establishing a credit score .
You are funding teaching interventions or changes to the learning environment that promise to make public education better , i.e. greater mastery of what it takes to become an effective citizen and a productive member of society .
In the draft you have circulated , I sense a pervasive technocratic bias and an uncritical faith in the power of social science .
2. Inherent in the command and control philosophy of your draft regulations is a belief that everyone agrees on what should be taught -- to whom and when -- and how the lowest performing schools can best be turned around .
Yet , there are so many unknowns about what produces educational success that a little humility would be in order .
A better way would be to state what educational outcomes children should reach and then permit state and local flexibility to figure out how to reach the desired outcomes .
The current draft regulations conflate what must be done with entirely too much specification about how to do it .
3. Curriculum choices are not just technical and “ evidence based ” issues , but go to the heart of deeply held beliefs and understandings of what children should learn .
California 's current curriculum standards have received high national rankings and there is no evidence that they need a radical overhaul .
4 . Your draft also specifies very specific data elements that need to be included without sufficient justification for why all these date elements are essential or how they should be utilized .
5 . You assume we know how to " turn around all the struggling low performing schools , ” when the real answers may lie outside of school .
As Oakland mayor , I directly confronted conditions that hindered education , and that were deeply rooted in the social and economic conditions of the community or were embedded in the particular attitudes and situations of the parents .
There is insufficient recognition in the draft regulations that inside and outside of school strategies must be interactive and merged .
6 . Most current state wide tests rely too much on closed end multiple choice answers and do not contain enough written and open ended responses that require students to synthesize , analyze and solve multi-dimensional problems and construct their own answers .
7 . There are huge technical and conceptual problems that remain on how to assess the specific impact of individual teachers and principals on the scores of students on annual state tests .
Test score increases and decreases can be caused by many factors in a specific year , and it is beyond the current state of the art to sort out what is the unique and independent influence of teachers and principals .
Performance pay schemes for teachers based primarily on annual test scores in other states reveal more about how not to structure performance pay rather than show what are viable ways to restructure teacher compensation .
Compensation should to be just one element of a broader approach to improving teacher effectiveness that includes initial recruitment and preparation to retention and professional development .
Having $ 4.3 billion to spend on education in this time of draconian cuts is a godsend .
We in California look forward to joining with you in promoting a real love of learning and outstanding achievement in all our public schools .
What do you think of Attorney General Brown 's stance ?
Will Duncan listen ?
Will President Obama ?
Injectable Exploit ( Defcon 17 )
Description :
This is a video of the talk titled " Injectable Exploits : Two New Tools for Pwning Web Apps and Browsers " , given my Kevin Johnson , Justin Searle and Frank DiMaggio at Defcon 17 this year .
Abstract : Injectable exploits focus on the exploitation of major web flaws during penetration tests .
Two new tools will be released that expand the foothold penetration testers can obtain through SQL injection and XSS flaws .
These tools provide greater insight into the network hosting the web application and the networks in which the users are located .
We will also discuss the live CD environment that includes both tools .
Yokoso ! is an infrastructure fingerprinting system delivered via XSS attack .
This project contains two different parts ; the fingerprints and modules for the various browser exploit frameworks .
The fingerprints identify web applications deployed in the user 's network , applications such as web administration interfaces to different IT manage systems .
The modules portion contains code to perform two basic attacks .
The first is history browsing which determines if the user has visited the sites of interest .
This reveals if the user is an administrator or power user .
The second attack module within Yokoso !
Initiates requests to map the infrastructure of the user 's network .
Laudanum is a collection of injectable files that are prebuilt to perform various attacks within a network .
These files are injected via SQL injection attacks .
The individual files are placed into scheduled jobs or the web root of database servers .
This is accomplished by exploiting SQL injection flaws within the web application .
Laudanum includes various attacks such as shells , proxy capabilities and data collection tools .
A major feature of both tools is their scope limiting capabilities .
Many similar tools lack the capability to identify target hosts before performing exploits .
Both of these tools allow a penetration tester to specify target restrictions based on external IP , internal IP , and hostname .
The final portion of the talk will cover SamuraiWTF .
SamuraiWTF is a live CD environment focused on web penetration tests .
It was released during DEFCON 16 and has had four new releases since that time .
Both Yokoso ! and Laudanum will be included on a new version of SamuraiWTF released at DEFCON this year .

A protest against a prisoner - exchange deal for the release of kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit took place before the Prime Minister 's Residence in Jerusalem Thursday , with hundreds of participants being led by members of the bereaved families of terror victims .
Efforts Continue Noam Shalit : Sarkozy said wo n't stop working until Gilad is freed Ahiya Raved and AFP After Paris meeting , father of captive Israeli soldier says French president ' working in all available channels ' to advance prisoner exchange deal with Hamas Noam Shalit : Sarkozy said wo n't stop working until Gilad is freed
One of the speakers at the protest was Yossi Mendellevich , who lost his 13 - year old boy to a terror attack on a bus in Haifa in 2003 .
He and two other bereaved parents from the city , Yossi Zur and Ron Karman , set up a tent on the scene .
" We raised public awareness towards the end of Olmert 's time in office in an effort to prevent the release of hundreds of prisoners , until he sobered and left the hot potato to Netanyahu , " Mendellevich said .
" Now it appears that the publication of the video tape this weekend in exchange for the release of 20 ' almost - murderers ' was actually a spin to gauge the public 's stability . "
He added , " We 've embarked on this campaign in order to prevent the next strategic terror attack .
The previous one was during the intifada between the years 2000 - 2005 , in which we lost our children .
The next one is expected after the release of hundreds of terrorists . "
Lieutenant - Colonel ( Res ) Dan Sion claims the rumored deal would constitute a strategic failure .
" A deal in which terrorists are released broadcasts political weakness , which endangers the lives of citizens and harms us as civilians , " he said at the protest .
" It is an ethical failure to release terrorists with blood on their hands , terrorists who were judged and are not defined as captives of war .
It 's unethical towards the families and towards the victims who will be murdered in the future . "
Sion said the terrorists released in exchange for Elhanan Tannenbaum , the Israeli businessman kidnapped by Hezbollah in 2001 , have so far been responsible for the deaths of 23 Israelis .
He added that he was not opposed to the release of Gilad Shalit , but that the state should exhaust all other options before releasing terrorists .
" The fact that there are people willing to think and talk about the prevention of the release of terrorists is important , " Sion said .

SEOUL —
By the middle of next year , Internet surfers will be allowed to use Web addresses written completely in Chinese , Arabic , Korean and other languages using non-Latin alphabets , the organization overseeing Internet domain names announced Friday in a decision that could make the Web more accessible .
In an action billed as one of the biggest changes in the Web ’s history , the board of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers — or Icann — voted Friday during its annual meeting , held in Seoul , to allow such scripts in Internet addresses .
The decision is a “ historic move toward the internationalization of the Internet , ” said Rod Beckstrom , Icann ’s president and chief executive .
“ We just made the Internet much more accessible to millions of people in regions such as Asia , the Middle East and Russia . ”
This change affects domain names — anything that comes after the dot , including .com , .cn or .jp .
Domain names have been limited to 37 characters — 26 Latin letters , 10 digits and a hyphen .
But starting next year , domain names can consist of characters in any language .
In some Web addresses , non-Latin scripts are already used in the portion before the dot .
Thus , Icann ’s decision Friday makes it possible , for the first time , to write an entire Internet address in a non-Latin alphabet .
Morrison was one of 10 to 15 teenagers in an alley in the 700 block of East 5th Street at about 5:30 p.m.
Saturday , police said .
The kitten began to walk among the teenagers , and Morrison allegedly began pelting him with pebbles , Massi said .
Morrison then picked up the cat by its fur and tried to set it on fire with a lighter , police said .
Kunowski was on the run from Poland at the time of the murder A convicted killer dubbed " the Beast " who raped and murdered a 12 - year - old girl has died in prison .
Police say Andrzej Kunowski died of heart failure on Wednesday at Frankland prison , Durham , where he was serving a life sentence .
He was jailed at the Old Bailey in 2004 for killing Katerina Koneva at her home in Hammersmith , west London , in 1997 .
Police say he has also been linked to numerous investigations , including the disappearances of two young women .
He had previously served 10 years in jail in his native Poland where he became known as " the Beast " for 27 serious sex attacks on girls and women from the age of 17 .
Police in West London say he is a suspect in the disappearances of 19 - year - old student Elizabeth Chau in 1999 and Lola Shenkoya , a 27 - year - old who vanished on her way home from work in 2000 .
Detectives say they particularly want to speak to anyone who may have shared a cell with Kunowski during his time in prison .
Kunowski's trial was told he was on the run for raping a 10 - year - old girl in Poland at the time of the murder .
Following his conviction in March 2004 , Det Ch Insp David Little said : " He is probably the most dangerous sex offender I have ever come across and certainly the most prolific . "
Katerina was strangled at her home on 22 May 1997 after she returned from school .
Her father , Trajce Konev , came face to face with an intruder when he returned home and chased him into the street .
Kunowski was charged with murdering the girl when his DNA , which was taken after he was arrested for raping a student , matched a hair found on Katerina 's cardigan .

To anyone who thought there ’s nothing worse than warmed - over Reality TV retread programming , you ’re right .
David Lyle , head of the Fox Reality Channel , broke the news to staffers today that this 4 - year - old unwatchable experiment will end operations on March 31st of next year even though it ’s currently available in nearly 50 million homes as part of the Fox Cable Networks group .
Ironically , the news comes a day after its awards bash was taped for an October 17th broadcast .
Programming and production chief Bob Boden announced earlier this year he was leaving the channel to join Hasbro .
A CAMPAIGN has been launched to win a posthumous apology for computer pioneer Alan Turing over his conviction for homosexuality .
The brilliant mathematician , who spent his key years at Manchester University , is hailed as one of the founders of modern computing .
But a conviction for homosexuality effectively ended his career .
Troubled Turing went on to commit suicide in 1954 , aged just 41 .
Now a group of admirers of the scientist - named as one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century by Time Magazine - are lobbying the government to make a posthumous apology .
Codebreaker
The Cambridge graduate was one of Britain 's best wartime codebreakers - part of the team at Bletchley Park which unravelled the secret of the Enigma code machines used by German U - boats .
Turing was awarded an OBE in 1945 for his wartime services to the Foreign Office and moved to Manchester to help work on the pioneering Mark 1 computer .
He was prosecuted for gross indecency for having sex with a man in 1952 , but escaped jail after being offered an alternative of taking an experimental hormone treatment to reduce sex drive .
However , the case effectively ended his career and Turing fell into despair .
His body was found by a cleaner at his Wilmslow home in 1954 - next to him was a half - eaten apple laced with cyanide .
It was not until 1967 that laws against gay men were lifted .
More than 500 people have now signed the petition on the 10 Downing Street website to call for an official apology ' recognize the tragic consequences of prejudice that ended his life and career ' .
Hounded
John Graham - Cumming , a leading British computer expert who launched the campaign , said : " I think that Alan Turing has n't been recognised in Britain for his enormous contribution because he died in his forties and almost certainly because he was gay .
" It is atrocious that we do n't recognise this man and the only way to do so is to apologise to him .
This man was a national treasure and we hounded him to his death .
" One of the things for people in the computing world is that he was part of the war effort but we do n't give him recognition in the same way as other heroes .
To me , he was a hero in the second world war . "
Since his death , plaques , buildings and statues have been raised in Turing 's honour .
The computing world 's equivalent of the Nobel Prize has been called the Turing Award since 1966 .
If you watch TV you ’ve no doubt seen the iDo n’t commercials .
Now these are by far not the first commercials to openly dis on Apple .
We can all remember Microsoft ’s laptop hunter commercials and then there was the more subtle ‘ there ’s a map for that ’ commercials .
This type of advertising has been around for a long time and will not be going anywhere soon .
Currently the Cell phone market is dominated by one phone , the Apple iPhone .
Anyone who has an iPhone can tell you what is wrong with it and what it does n’t hold it ’s weight on .
This is no different than any other tech gadget , as soon as the initial awe factor wears off you start to see what areas your new , fancy and possibly expensive toy falls behind in .
These areas just increase and grow wider the older something is .
The iPhone was released over two years ago , in tech years that ’s a lot , so of course there will be things that new phones can do that it can’t .
This is where Android comes into play .
If anyone is not familiar with Android yet it is the new open source , cell phone targeted , operating system designed by Google .
It was designed and developed to be as flexible as possible and being open source it also makes it cheaper to produce phones based on .
This is something that is going to be extremely popular with cell phone manufacturers as it allows them to put that extra development money into hardware to produce faster and more capable phones .
The important thing to note here about Android is it ’s flexibility and that is something the iDo n’t commercials are focusing on .
The more popular Android becomes the more developers that will be involved in producing updates for it as well as quality apps .
Because of this I believe that Android phones will last longer than your average phone and that the main reason for upgrades will be hardware advancements rather than a better set of software .
Now I have no doubt that at some point in time carriers will stop servicing certain phones with updates , but that wo n’t stop hardcore users from updating their phones manually .
Android phones are preparing to storm the fortress of the currently iPhone dominated cell phone market .
While a single Android phone will likely never be as popular as the iPhone was I do see phones based on the Android operating system taking a large majority of the market within two years .
It is no coincidence that a large number of Android phones are coming out around the same time that most iPhone owners will be coming out of their 2 year contracts .
They are aiming to take on those users who have had an iPhone and are ready for the next big thing , and that thing is Android .

RIO DE JANEIRO  Argentina enacted a controversial law on Saturday that gives the government more control over the broadcast media , handing a victory to the president and her husband , the country ’s former leader , who have blamed media coverage they call biased for many of their political woes .
After more than 19 hours of debate , the Senate approved the media bill early Saturday morning , by a vote of 44 to 24 , without modifications .
President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner had proposed the bill to replace a dictatorship - era law that allowed the concentration of media power in the hands of a few companies .
The government said the changes , which include forcing companies to shed some of their media outlets , would diversify the public airwaves .
Mrs. Kirchner signed the bill into law later in the day .
While many media experts have said the old law was outdated and in need of reform , analysts say the move by the Kirchner government seemed intended to give the executive branch significant discretion in the regulation of broadcasters .
Carlos Lauria , senior program director for the Americas at the Committee to Protect Journalists , said the new rules could restrict freedom of expression , in particular a provision that gives the president the authority to appoint most members of a new broadcast regulatory body .
If you missed Family Day last Monday , you may have missed an important opportunity to prevent your kids from smoking , drinking and using drugs .
Local governments and a national public - service ad campaign headlined by Jamie Lee Curtis and Barbara Bush told parents to eat dinner with their children on Sept. 26 , based on a study that showed frequent family dining reduced the risk of substance abuse in kids by 50 % .
" There is no more important thing a parent can do " to reduce the risk of their children using drugs , said Joseph A. Califano , Jr. , chairman and president of Columbia University 's National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse , or CASA , the group behind the study .
The report 's claim was repeated in local media reports in Arizona , Florida and Indiana , among other places .
But before the government takes its war on drugs to the family kitchen , a closer look at the study is warranted .
The study , based on a phone survey of 1,000 kids between 12 and 17 years old , and 829 parents , did n't show that family dinners cause a reduction in substance abuse .
Instead , it found that teenagers who dined frequently with parents scored 50 % lower on a substance - abuse risk assessment than did teenagers who did n't .
That alone does n't prove anything , and other factors could explain that correlation .
What 's more , the study found that other behavior actually had a greater influence on a teen 's decision to use drugs , though those findings did n't fit as easily into a TV commercial .
Finally , the claim that frequent dinners reduce risk by 50 % does n't account for age -- a key failing .
You might be unsurprised to learn that 17 - year - olds are more likely to use drugs than 12 - year - olds .
Older teens are also the ones most likely to eat dinner away from their families .
I think my friend , hal0gical , said it best when he tweeted :
finds that the advertising that sells him most usually has absolutely nothing to do w .
the actual product
Now , thinking back to commercials that stayed in my head through the years , it made sense .
Then I saw the viral video from Fruit Gushers fruit snacks .
Many viral videos like this , the Quiznos “ rats ” , the Taco Bell dog , and the Bontrust ad have stayed in my mind and had nothing really to do with the actual product being sold .
But , it ’s always awesome to see videos like this because it makes me wonder .
How much weed was being passed around the conference room of the ad agency that did this ?
CHURCHILL , Man . –" Not too soft , not too hard , " is how Joseph gently describes what he 's looking for as he pokes a slender copper pole into the frozen southern shores of the Hudson Bay – a two - hour dogsled trek from Churchill ( three bars , five restaurants , five motels , and a friendly Post Office that will stamp your passport with an inky polar bear ) .
" You have to be able to saw the snow and it still must hold together as a solid block , " he explains .
We 're trudging through deep snow and frozen aqua - coloured tide pools ( along with Joseph 's wife Mary , and puppy Melot ) in the Canadian transitional zone between tundra and boreal forest , where the view is nothing but vast expanses of blue and white ( sky and snow ) , translating into a stark , icy beauty that almost brings a frozen tear to the eye .
Joseph and Mary ( the Inuit favour Biblical names ) are guest instructors this week at the cozy Dymond Lake lodge .
This is our home base for great hospitality – fresh baked cinnamon rolls , almond - crusted Arctic char , red wine and caribou soup – plus snowshoeing and snowmobiling outings .
But , I 've got other things on my mind :
It 's minus 40 C , for one , and I am wearing seven layers of clothing , including three jackets and four pairs of pants ( a personal best . )
And for another , I 'm about to make my very first igloo .
In case you do n't already know , igloos are snow dome winter homes mostly built in the central Canadian Arctic , where snow blocks are laid around in a circle on a firm field of snow , and are used by the single hunter or small group , usually built far out on the winter sea ice for temporary shelter .
Today , the snow is quite shallow by the tidal shore so we 'll be slicing the blocks longer and shorter than would be the norm , but it 's a good spot as " the snow is warmer here , " explains Joseph .
" Because the ice is made of salt water .
It protects it .
More windproof . "
He says when he 's travelling " up north " ( he and Mary live in Repulse Bay , about 800 kilometres north of here , so Churchill is akin to a beach vacation for them ) he wears a canvas parka so that the snow sticks to it .
" When I asked my Mom to make me a traditional parka , she made it out of canvas because with the snow , it 's the best insulation . "
Which is the same logic behind this igloo we 're about to build .
While organizing the build , Joseph and Mary briefly speak Inuktitut .
" Do you mind if we speak our language for a moment ? " asks Mary .
With a suitable spot agreed on , they revert back to English and Joseph draws a perfect circle around himself with the business end of that copper pole , and we all set to work .
" Even today most hunters sleep in igloos because they hunt and travel , " says Mary .
" A small one takes about an hour to make . "
Once it 's built , modern hunters plop a Coleman stove in the middle of their snow domes , which they use to cook and stay warm .
Back at the lodge , Mary had shown me a traditional floor lamp , a saucer - shaped vessel fashioned from carved stone , filled with burning seal oil .
We start to saw out snow blocks with an all - purpose handsaw .
The blocks are as firm as cement , but a little lighter at about 10 kilogramss .
" We 'll start with 10 and will use about 30 in the end , " says Joseph .
Mary and I set to work sawing and dragging , while Joseph has the equally taxing job of lifting and constructing .
As I slice away , Mary encourages , " You 're better at this than our people ! "

I can't tell you why , exactly , but this ranks as one of the proudest moments of my life .
I 'm busting with Canadian pride and have unearthed yet another useless talent ( I also happen to be an excellent pogo - sticker . )
" My parents first met in an igloo , " Joseph reminisces .
" My grandfather arranged their marriage .
They met in the igloo but my mother 's parents did n't like my Dad so said no to the marriage .
But she disobeyed them and ran away with his dog team . "
Back then they did n't have houses at all , he explains .
" They had sod huts in the summer and igloos in the winter . "
A traditional snow knife would be made of wood and caribou antler , or way back when , whalebone .
Today , Joseph is using a small machete he bought at the co-op store in Repulse Bay .
The thickness of the snow blocks is key to making a successful igloo .
" I cut those ones too big , " confesses Mary after a brief Inuktitut tête - à - tête with Joseph .
" If the top ones are too thick the igloo will cave in . "
Together , we work our way around the circle ; the inside is sliced and sawed into blocks , leaving the hollow to become the home .
That night , we lay caribou hides down , covering the snowy floor , placing a candle in the middle .
That wee twinkle illuminates the dome like a snowball packed with fireflies .
Up through the smoke hole the Northern Lights are in full bloom , prancing across the sky like sheets of flinty gauze , their colors muted – just mellow greens and sheer whites – and are followed by a singular shooting star .
Mary loves sleeping in the igloo .
" So cozy , with the skins on the ground and the sleeping bags .
And in the morning you wake up and it's so white and pretty and your tea is right in the middle , waiting for you . "

I have hired Lennard numerous times over years to handle my cases , ranging from class B felonies to gross misdemeanors .
I was looking at 6 - 9 years of incarceration and Lennard has gotten two of my biggest cases dismissed and others reduced to practically nothing .
Every time I consulted with him , he is extremely knowledgeable , tactical , honest , caring , and straight forward .
And we have been in 4 different Courthouses around State of Washington , and in every Courthouse , he is very well - known with the judges , prosecutors , and staffs , which re-insured me that I was in very good hands .
I ’m confidently able to recommend him to my closest friends and family who are dealing with legal issues , because I know they are going to be represented by the best .
Lennard has basically helped me to receive another chance in life to start over and has helped me to learn from my mistakes and move on to being a better person .
There are no any other lawyers like him .
J. K .
The best attorney on earth !
J. S. G .
You all are very professional and effective operation and I appreciate everything you done for me .
Your staff , they are simply the best .
C. S .
Your staff has treated me with great respect and kindness .
You are very blessed to have such a wonderful group of people working for you .
They have always been very helpful and pleasant to talk with .
P. J. C .
I live on the other side of the country and had a case come up in his location .
Well I came across the best .
Started everything off from the first day , kept in contact with me every few days , and then day to day as the case came closer .
He handled it VERY professionally with outstanding knowledge of the law .
He helped me with everything I needed to do in defense of myself .
He helped me retain my civil liberties from false accusations .
I wish I did n’t need him , but so glad I had him .
J. S .
I really do appreciate your help .
The courtesy that I received from your staff I will never forget .
The professionalism in the court room was very comforting even though the process is lengthy and the charge was minor .
My case was handled by the firm with the utmost care .
Thank you !
T. P .
Lennard was recommended to me from a good friend .
This was a first time offense in my 55 yrs .
I was embarrassed and humiliated to have to go through this ever .
Lennard ’s Professionalism , Experience , Sensitivity and Respect to a client ’s needs was exceptional .
His staff was professional as well and relayed my messages to him when he was unavailable due to his busy schedule of helping another client .
Lennard always got back to me via phone or email , depending on the questions I had .
His presence in the court room definitely showed that he had respect from his peers and superiors .
I would highly recommend The Nahajski Firm .
E. A
Thanks for bringing our son ’s case to a very successful conclusion .
You and your staff were very professional and helpful .
T. M .
I would like to sincerely thank you for all of the effort you put towards my case .
I was very impressed with the professional manner in which I was represented and the profuse knowledge held by the partners of your firm .
I consider myself very lucky to have found you .
While I hope to avoid requiring your services in the future , I did very much enjoy meeting and working with you .
Thank you very much .
M. A. M .
I do not recall a moment in my life that made me as astoundingly happy as those few words uttered from the judge ’s mouth on my court appearance .
I want to thank you and your partners for the work you did for me again .
Hopefully , I will not be asking for them again , but if need be , I know now who to call .
I say that not because of the results , but because of the tremendous amount of concern , humanity ( the dog was a nice touch ) , integrity and professionalism displayed by all in your firm in your dealings with me .
D. W. M .
I spoke with Rayne Nelson , the information that I was given over the phone and all the answers to all of my questions that I had at the time was extremely remarkable .
I felt that all of the attorneys had more knowledge and experience in criminal law than any of the other attorneys that I had spoken with .
Your office was ready to give me a free person - to - person consultation needless to say : the search was over for an attorney .
A big heart - felt THANK YOU VERY MUCH .
R. R .
Just want to let you know how much we appreciate you taking the time to help us out !
Whenever we need your help it is a time of high stress for our family and you always take away a lot of the anxiety with your friendly , efficient manner and expert experience .
Thank you !
L.A .
On behalf of me , Mike and Eli we ’d like to thank - you for doing such a fine job of representing Eli .
It meant a great deal to us and you always kept us informed and we always felt we were in good hands .
Thanks again !
L.S .
I am writing to express my heartfelt thanks and appreciation to you and to Rayne for your excellent work achieving such a positive outcome in my defense against the State of Washington .
Success in this matter did not appear to me to be in the least bit a foregone conclusion , and I believe that without your legal expertise and personal dedication to my cause I would be in a far more unpleasant situation today .
Rayne was indeed brilliant at the pre-trial and your strategy and research prior to that day was obviously flawless .
I am extremely grateful for this second chance that your work has secured me .
Please thank the members of your office staff on my behalf for their professionalism and competency during my frequent communications with them .
Their efficiency and assurance was much appreciated .
G.R.F .
He won my case , and I now have no criminal history nor did I go to prison , so I ’m very glad with the outcome .
I ’ll make sure I do n’t make any mistakes , however if I ever did need a criminal defense lawyer , I would hire Lennard all over again .
R.Y .
Mr. Nahajski handled my case quickly and efficiently .
He is not only extremely competent attorney but he actually made the entire ordeal go smoothly and alleviated my stress and concern .
I truly felt that he was proactive in his approach instead of just getting to my case when he had to as so many other attorneys ’ do .
C.J .
Our case was very complicated .
It not only had Criminal but also Immigration consequences .
We are glad that we chose Len to handle our case .
He is the best criminal lawyer one can find .
He is very knowledgeable and I strongly recommend that you talk to Len if you are looking for a good lawyer to represent your case .
J.S .
When I think back to it , it occurs to me that I was very fortunate to have found you as an attorney .
You are not only an excellent attorney , but you are also a good man .
I ’m not sure how common that is in your field , but I suspect not all that common .
G.S .
Very competent and trustworthy .
Knows his business .
. . .
This was a whole new experience for me .
With Lennard ’s help , the case was dismissed .
D.S .
Mr. Nahajski was hired as my lawyer three times .
A DUI case , suspended license case , and another DUI , assault , drug and harassment case .
The possible ramifications for my actions included prison time and a felony that would follow me the rest of my life .
Lennard got me the best possible outcome for all of my cases .
No jail time .
He is professional , non-judgmental , extremely educated , and highly respected among his peers and the criminal justice system .
A.S .
Len was such a pleasure to work with .
He was patient and explained all of my options and answered all of my questions along the way .
He came up with a great strategy for my case and was there every step of the way until we had the best resolution possible .
Case dismissed !
I hope I never need a lawyer again but if I do , I know who to call .
L.N .
I am so happy that Len represented me .
He worked tirelessly , kept me in the loop at all times , and was amazing in court .
He had both short - term and long - term strategies and got my case dismissed by using his thorough understanding of the law .
He was professional and personable , and I ’d recommend him to anyone .

Chiswick in West London is considered to be one of the major centres of Greater London .
It is a beautiful area made up of green parks and pavement cafes ; many high profile people reside here .
The high road is a cosmopolitan mix of restaurants and bars , retail and shops , office space and hotels .
Wide pavements create an attractive European feel and it is often thriving with people taking a coffee break from their fast paced London life .
It has become almost fashionable to hire a Chiswick escort .
The women who work as escorts in Chiswick are so stunning and stylish that any gentleman feels honoured and privileged to be on their arm .
It 's a much more preferable way to spend your day , rather than dining or strolling alone .
Chiswick escorts know the area well and will make everything seem that bit more beautiful .
If you are meeting your Chhiswick escort during the daytime , try taking a walk in the park .
It is a romantic past time , giving you time to talk and get to know each other .
You could then sit outdoors in one of the pavement cafes is the weather permits .
If you have an evening date , there are many different styles of restaurant you could opt for .
Maybe if your escort comes from another country she could recommend her native cuisine , or indeed it may also be the case for you .
For example if you come from Greece , find a Greek restaurant in Chiswick and impress her with your culinary expertise !
If you 're lucky enough to spend time with one of the escorts Chiswick has to offer , make the most of the beautiful area , and of course make the most of the beautiful woman you are with .
It is a part of London that is really worth seeing .
As Silvio Berlusconi yesterday tried to shore up his position by declaring himself irreplaceable as Italy 's head of government , a court in Milan was told it had been " amply demonstrated " that he was guilty of bribery .
" I am , and not only in my own opinion , the best prime minister who could be found today , " he told a press conference .
" I believe there is no one in history to whom I should feel inferior .
Quite the opposite . "
The problem , he explained , was that " In absolute terms , I am the most legally persecuted man of all times , in the whole history of mankind , worldwide , because I have been subjected to more than 2,500 court hearings and I have the good luck – having worked well in the past and having accumulated an important wealth – to have been able to spend more than € 200 m in consultants and judges ... I mean in consultants and lawyers . "
His comments came as Laura Bertole , Milan 's chief prosecutor , was speaking at the opening session of an appeal launched by Berlusconi 's former legal adviser , David Mills , against his conviction for accepting a bribe from the TV magnate in the 1990s , when Berlusconi was in opposition .
Bertole , speaking two days after Berlusconi was stripped of his legal immunity , said Mills , the estranged husband of the Olympics minister , Tessa Jowell , had " first confessed , then retracted , indicating witnesses who have contradicted his words [ and ] his version of events " .
Mills , who was found guilty in February of accepting a $ 600,000 bribe ( £ 375,000 ) for distorting his evidence in Berlusconi 's favour , acknowledged in a statement to prosecutors that he later retracted that the money came from his former client .
The British lawyer subsequently identified a Neapolitan ship owner , Diego Attanasio , as the true source of the funds .
Attanasio denies Mills 's claim .
Bertole asked the judges not to agree to two requests by Mills 's lawyer : to call Berlusconi as a witness and to gather evidence from Gibraltar .
Berlusconi's counsel has said the prime minister would be available to testify if the court gave the go - ahead .
Under Italian law , defendants are allowed up to two appeals that must be held before charges are extinguished by a statute of limitations that , in this case , would come into effect next April .
The speed with which the first appeal court intends to dispatch its business is bad news , not just for Mills , but also for Berlusconi , his co-defendant until the immunity law took effect last year .
The case against the prime minister will have to be restarted and will almost certainly be " timed out " before a conclusion is reached .
But a definitive conviction of his former co-defendant would , by implication , mean Berlusconi was equally guilty of having bribed him .
On Wednesday , the constitutional court threw out a law introduced by Berlusconi 's government giving him immunity from prosecution .
After venting his spleen on those he held responsible for the decision , the prime minister yesterday turned his attention to suggestions that he might step down for the good of the country .
Italy 's main opposition group , the Democratic party , has not called for Berlusconi 's resignation , but a smaller opposition party said he should go .
Irate at the constitutional court decision , Berlusconi has lashed out at perceived antagonists including the president , Giorgio Napolitano , whom he blamed for not using his influence to sway the judges in his favour .
He also upset women , furious that he used the looks of a female opposition politician , Rosy Bindi , to insult her during a live TV discussion of the court 's decision .
A Facebook site offering support to Bindi had attracted more than 7,000 adherents by last night .
One of Berlusconi 's cabinet , the youth minister , Giorgia Meloni , disassociated herself from his comment that Bindi was " more beautiful than intelligent " .
Meloni said : " I regret Berlusconi 's remark . "

A Indian railway station which was abandoned for 42 years because of fears that it was haunted has reopened in the eastern state of West Bengal .
Locals and railway workers say they lived in fear of a female phantom who frequented Begunkodor 260 km ( 161 miles ) from the state capital , Calcutta .
In 1967 , a railway worker is said to have died days after he saw a “ woman ghost ” draped in a white sari .
Officials say the story was made up to avoid postings at the remote station .
They argue that it was primarily railway employees who expressed fears about the “ woman ghost ” at Begunkodor .
“ Soon all railway employees fled Begunkodor and trains stopped stopping there .
It made life very difficult for locals , ” said Basudeb Acharya , former chairman of the parliament ’s standing committee on railways .
Mr Acharya says employees “ cooked up the ghost story ” to avoid a posting at such a remote station .
Celebrations
Begunkodor is 43 km ( 26 miles ) from the district headquarters in Purulia , the westernmost district of West Bengal .
Purulia is home to the Santhal tribe and is also a Maoist stronghold .
On Tuesday , the Ranchi - Hatia express stopped at Begunkodor , the first train to draw into the station for 42 years .
India ’s railway minister Mamata Banerji has dismissed all reports of an apparition .
When she announced new trains for West Bengal she wanted the Ranchi - Hatia Express to stop at Begunkodor because locals had pleaded with her to reopen the station during the election campaign in May .
“ I do n’t believe in ghosts .
It is all man-made , ” Mamata Banerji is reported to have told railway officials when the new trains were being scheduled .
The reopening of the station became “ an event for local celebrations ” , according to railway commercial inspector , Dilip Kumar Ghosh .
He said people gathered in large numbers and “ danced in joy ” as the train arrived .
“ I have never seen a train stop here since I have grown up , ” said Begunkodor resident Govinda Mahato .

Ein Bundesministerium für die Wissens - und Informationsgesellschaft
Die Zukunft Deutschlands hängt von einem erfolgreichen sektoralen Wandel zur Informations - und Wissensgesellschaft ab .
Diese Erkenntnis ist zwar von der deutschen Politik vielfach in Sonntagsreden aufgegriffen worden , doch den meisten Menschen , die bereits im Informationssektor leben und arbeiten , erscheinen die Anstrengungen der Regierungen der letzen 20 Jahre als halbherzig , rückwärts gewandt und kontraproduktiv .
Die Politik in Deutschland verschläft den Wandel nicht nur , sondern behindert ihn durch bewusste und unbewusste Fehlentscheidungen .
Bewusste Fehlentscheidungen werden getroffen , weil die durch den Wandel von Marginalisierung bedrohten Wirtschafts - und Machtinteressen versuchen , den Wandel zu ihrem eigenen Vorteil und zum Schaden des Gemeinwohls aufzuhalten .
Unbewusste Fehlentscheidungen werden getroffen , weil die meisten älteren Politiker und Wirtschaftsführer das Wesen der Informationsgesellschaft nicht verstehen und nicht begreifen , wie umfassend die Transformation zur Netzwerkgesellschaft alle Lebensbereiche verändert .
Es geht dabei nicht nur um die Nutzung neuer Werkzeuge , Technologien und Medien - es geht dabei auch um einen weitgehenden Wandel der Beziehungen der Menschen untereinander , zur Wirtschaft und zum Staat .
Das Ausmass des Werte - und Strukturwandels ist mit dem Wandel von der Agrar - zur Industriegesellschaft vergleichbar .
Die transformationsbedingte Marginalisierung ganzer Wirtschaftsbereiche und sozialer Gruppen sowie die Destabilisierung sozioökonomischer und institutioneller Gefüge birgt gewaltige Konfliktpotentiale bis hin zur Gefährdung der Demokratie und Zivilgesellschaft in Deutschland und Europa .
Gleichzeitig gibt es gewaltige Chancen für die wirtschaftliche , soziale und politische Entwicklung der Gesellschaft .
Diese Chancen werden aber derzeit in anderen Ländern wie Neuseeland , Australien , Südkorea oder Estland mit ganz anderer Intensität ergriffen .
In Deutschland gerät der Wandel zunehmend ausser Kontrolle , weil es zentralen Akteuren in Wirtschaft und Politik an Antizipationsfähigkeit mangelt , und weil insbesondere in Deutschland die Fähigkeit und Bereitschaft zu Adaption nicht in ausreichendem Masse vorhanden ist .
All das zeigt sich etwa daran , welche vergleichsweise geringen staatlichen Mittel für die Transformation aufgewendet werden , und wie nachrangig sich die Informationsgesellschaft etwa in der Struktur der Bundesregierung einordnet .
Im Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie , wo sich der Grossteil der Aktivitäten um die Informationsgesellschaft konzentriert , ist das Thema eines von 58 Unterpunkten , mit denen sich das Ministerium befasst , und gerade einmal 14 von 150 Referaten widmen sich dort Fragen der Informationsgesellschaft .
Das muss sich dringend ändern - die Informationsgesellschaft muss politisch den Stellenwert erhalten , der ihrer Bedeutung für die Zukunft des Landes entspricht .
Die Piraten fordern daher die Einrichtung eines neuen Bundesministeriums für die Wissens - und Informationsgesellschaft , das dem Wandel zur Informationsgesellschaft den erforderlichen politischen Stellenwert verschafft und die Informationsgesellschaft zukunftsgewandt und nach freiheitlich - demokratischen Grundsätzen organisieren hilft .
Beispiele für verfehlte Politik im Bereich der Informationsgesellschaft
Deutschland liegt derzeit weltweit an 22 .
Stelle aller Länder bei der Versorgung mit breitbandigem Internet ; vor allem sind Regionen in den neuen Bundesländern , in Niedersachsen und in Bayern unterversorgt .
Die Politik der Bundesregierung führt auch zu einer zunehmenden " digitalen Kluft " in der Gesellschaft ; besonders sozial Schwache haben oft keinen breitbandigen Internetzugang und geeignete Endgeräte
bis 2013 wird ein hundertfacher Anstieg des weltweiten Datenverkehrs erwartet , doch Deutschland investiert pro Jahr 1,50 Euro pro Einwohner in Breitbandausbau , Neuseeland das hundertfache , Australien das tausendfache .
Die deutsche Regierung sperrt sich auch gegen die Bereitstellung von EU - Mitteln zum Breitbandausbau in Europa .
( A) DSL ist aufgrund der Asymmetrie von Up - und Downlink ein “ Vergehen gegen das Internet ” .
Im Internet ist jeder Teilnehmer Sender und Empfänger .
Die bestehende Asymmetrie bedeutet für zukünftige symmetrischere Nutzungsmuster einen schweren Nachteil und erschwert bereits heute die Nutzung und den Aufbau wichtiger Dienste , etwa zur verteilten Datensicherung
Die Art der Privatisierung der Telekom und der Netze hat den Interessen von Staat und Gesellschaft geschadet ; ausser der Deutschen Telekom hat kein anderer Anbieter nennenswerte Infrastrukturen errichtetet , und durch den Wegfall der strategischen Netzplanung wurde der Ausbau vor allem auf die wirtschaftlichen Interessen der Telekom hin optimiert , der Ausbau in ländlichen Regionen wurde vernachlässigt
Das “ moderne ” VDSL Netz verschandelt mit seinen riesigen Anschlusskästen das Stadtbild und wird in wenigen Jahren veraltet sein .
Ausserdem steht VDSL derzeit Unternehmen nicht zur Verfügung .
Der notwendige Ausbau moderner Gigabit - Infrastruktur in jedes Haus ( FTTX ) ist derzeit nicht absehbar .
Der in den 90er Jahren begonnene flächige Ausbau von Glasfasernetzen ( OPAL ) mündete aufgrund der Telekom - Privatisierung und politischer Verantwortungslosigkeit in ein Desaster , bei dem die betroffenen Teilnehmer trotz Glasfaseranschlussleitung noch immer keine breitbandigen Internetzugänge haben
Eine vollwertige Internet - Anbindung für Unternehmen ist nach wie vor überteuert und für kleine Unternehmen unerschwinglich ( ca. 1000 Euro / Monat für symmetrischen 10 Mbit - Anschluss mit Flatrate )
54 % der Deutschen befürchten , dass persönliche Informationen im Internet nicht geschützt sind
48 % der Deutschen befürchten , dass der Staat infolge der technischen Weiterentwicklungen im Bereich Computer , Telekommunikation usw .
die Bürger immer stärker überwachen wird .
Vorratsdatenspeicherung , Zensurerleichterungsgesetz , Bundestrojaner und viele andere Gesetze untergraben das Vertrauen der Bürger in staatliche Internet - Angebote
Bei E-Government , E - Participation und E - Democracy ist Deutschland noch immer ein Entwicklungsland ; Deutschland liegt an 22 .
Stelle des " 2008 e- Government Readiness Index " der UN
Das Internetangebot der öffentlich - rechtlichen Rundfunkanstalten ist vollkommen unzureichend und nutzerfeindlich .
Es ist absolut unverständlich , warum Gebührenzahler keinen Zugriff auf alle mit ihrem Geld finanzierte Sendungen haben und dennoch zusätzliche Gebühren für das Internetangebot entrichten müssen .
die deutschen Sicherheitsbehörden verfügen noch immer nicht über ein eigenes , modernes Kommunikationsnetz , das ganze Projekt ist ein einziges Trauerspiel , Polizisten müssen noch immer zum Teil über private Handies kommunizieren , und selbst dort , wo der neue digitale Behördenfunk verfügbar ist , reichen die geringen Datenraten nicht aus , um moderne Dienste auch zu nutzen
Während sich das BMI vor allem mit verfassungsrechtlich bedenklichen Datensammlungen , der Ausweitung von Abhörbefugnissen und dem Abbau von Bürgerrechten von sich reden macht , wird der länderübergreifende Katastrophenschutz sträflich vernachlässigt ; eine nationale Koordination von Sicherheitskräften im Katastrophenfall ist kaum möglich , das Lagezentrum im BMI ist ausschliesslich als Beobachtungs - und Bevölkerungsinformationszentrum konzipiert
Das Internet ist bereits heute ein wichtiges Medium zur Information der Bevölkerung und zur Koordinierung von Hilfsmassnahmen , und seine Bedeutung wird zukünftig stark zunehmen ; leider ist die Netzwerkinfrastruktur in Deutschland nicht für den Katastrophenfall ausgelegt , und es gibt kaum nennenswerte Internetdienste , die im Katastrophenfall zur Koordinierung von Hilfsmassnahmen genutzt werden können
das Einsatzführungskommando der Bundeswehr , das etwa für die Koordinierung der Auslandseinsätze zuständig ist , ist kommunikationstechnisch nur bedingt auf der Höhe der Zeit - beispielsweise gibt es keine ständige Telemetrieverbindung zu Schiffen der Bundesmarine im Einsatz , Positionsmeldungen etwa werden nur alle 2 Stunden aktualisiert ; darüberhinaus gibt es erhebliche Missstände hinsichtlich vertraulicher elektronischer Kommunikation mit verbündeten Streitkräften
Im Katastrophenfall ist damit zu rechnen , dass der Grossteil der I&K - Infrastruktur der Bundesregierung ausfällt
Die Internet - Infrastruktur in Deutschland ist in erster Linie kostenoptimiert und wenig redundant aufgebaut , die Mobilfunkinfrastruktur ebenso .
Wie grossflächige Ausfälle der jüngsten Vergangenheit zeigen , weisen beide “ Single Points of Failure ” auf , die im Katastrophenfall zu einem grossflächigen Ausfällen von Internet und Mobilfunk führen können .
Die geplante Abschaltung des wesentlich robusteren Telefonnetzes zugunsten internetbasierter Telefonie wird die Abhängigkeit des Landes vom Internet weiter erhöhen ; hier muss dringend ein gesetzlicher Rahmen geschaffen werden , der ein Funktionieren des Internets auch im Katastrophenfall gewährleistet .
Ein funktionierendes Internet kann im Katastrophenfall viele Menschenleben retten und schwere wirtschaftliche Schäden vermeiden .
Derzeit ist das Internet in Deutschland nicht katastrophensicher .
Eine weitgehende Monokultur von Microsoft - Betriebssystemen in Wirtschaft und Verwaltung hat zu einer gefährlichen Anfälligkeit unserer nationalen IT - Infrastruktur gegenüber Computerviren und anderen Schadprogrammen geführt , die schwere wirtschaftliche Schäden und Anfäligkeit für Informationskatastrophen nach sich zieht .
Eine verantwortungsvolle Politik hätte Alternativen stärker fördern müssen , insbesondere , da die staatlichen Verwaltungen hier erhebliche Mittel investieren .
Die Informationsgesellschaft in den Bundesministerien
Wir haben in Deutschland vierzehn Bundesministerien , darunter eines für Ernährung , eines für Umwelt , eines für Gesundheit , eins für Arbeit und Soziales , eines für Familie , eines für Bildung und Forschung , ein weiteres für Verkehr und Bau , und zu dem für Wirtschaft und Technologie gibt es noch eines für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit .
Dann haben wir noch die Ministerien für Inneres , Auswärtiges , Justiz , Finanzen und Verteidigung , die sich überwiegend mit dem Staat an sich beschäftigen .
Wo findet sich nun unsere Informationsgesellschaft wieder ?
Da gibt es die Abteilung VI ( 14 von 150 Referaten ) im Ministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie , die sich mit Kommunikations - und Postpolitik befasst , sowie die unterstellte Netzagentur .
Das Bundesministerium des Inneren ist verantwortlich für die Koordinierung der IT innerhalb der Bundesverwaltung ( IT - Direktor mit 7 Referaten ) sowie Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit .
( Beauftragter mit 8 Referaten )
Der IT - Direktor im BMI ist der Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für Informationstechnik , der den Rat der IT - Beauftragten aus allen Ministerien und einigen Ämtern koordiniert .
Daneben gibt es noch eine “ Deutschland - Online Staatssekretärsrunde ” des Bundes und der Länder , die die Verwaltung in Bund , Ländern und Kommunen automatisieren soll .
Ansonsten gibt es verteilt über viele andere Ministerien einzelne Referate , die sich mit Aspekten der Informationsgesellschaft beschäftigen .
Interessant ist im übrigen , dass das Bundesministerium für Umwelt und Reaktorsicherheit als einziges Bundesministerium kein Referat enthält , das im Zusammenhang der Informationsgesellschaft von besonderem Interesse wäre .
Ein neues Ministerium für die Wissens - und Informationsgesellschaft
Verschiedene Ministerien , insbesondere das Ministerium für Forschung und Bildung , zum Teil aber auch das Ministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie , bezeichnen sich gern als Zukunftsministerium .
Die Zukunft Deutschlands wird sich aber nicht im Bereich materieller Güter entscheiden , sondern über eine erfolgreiche Entwicklung des vierten Sektors , in der Gestaltung der Informationsgesellschaft .
In folgenden wird der Kern eines solchen Ministeriums skizziert , das zunächst diejenigen vorhandenen Abteilungen und Referate bündeln soll , die in diesem Bereich bereits über Kompetenzen verfügen .
( Die folgende Abteilungsstruktur spiegelt den gegenwärtigen Stand der Integration bestehender und neuer Strukturen und bedarf weiterer Konsolidierung . )
Abteilung R : Rechtliche Säulen der Informationsgesellschaft
Mit größerer Fachkenntnis als bisher sollen die rechtlichen Säulen der Informationsgesellschaft weiterentwickelt werden , die auf garantierten Kommunikationsgrundrechten und den Informationsschutzrechten basiert , die in Deutschland hoch entwickelt sind , aber dringend an die zukünftigen Anforderungen angepasst werden müssen .
Kommunikationsgrundrechte Meinungsfreiheit Informationsfreiheit Rezipientenfreiheit
Informationsschutzrechte Datenschutz Geheimschutz Recht am eigenen Bild Kommunikationsgeheimnis
Schutz des gesprochenen Worts Immaterialgüterrechte Schutz geistiger Schöpfungen und verwandte Schutzrechte Namensrechte Gewerbliche Schutzrechte
Folgende bestehenden Referate werden in die Abteilung eingegliedert :
Markenrecht ; Recht gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb ; Bekämpfung der Produktpiraterie ; Geschmacksmusterrecht ( BMJ )
Patent - und Erfinderrecht ; Gebührenrecht auf dem Gebiet des gewerblichen Rechtsschutzes ( BMJ )
Urheber - und Verlagsrecht ( BMJ )
Telekommunikations - und Postrecht ( BMWi )
Abteilung IÖI : Intelligente Öffentliche Infrastrukturen
Eine der wichtigsten Aufgaben des Ministeriums wird es sein , die Entwicklung der Infrastruktur der Informationsgesellschaft nicht allein privaten Interessen unterzuordnen , sondern Intelligente öffentliche Infrastrukturen zum Nutzen aller vorausschauend zu planen .
Die Zuständigkeiten der Abteilung lassen sich auch mit Kommunikation , Logistik , Mobilität und Netze betiteln .
Aufgaben der Referate :
Postpolitik ; Postwirtschaft ; Aufsicht BNetzA ( BMWi )
Frequenzpolitik , Elektromagnetische Verträglichkeit ( BMWi )
Luft - und Raumfahrt ( BMWi )
Verkehrstechnologien ( BMWi )

Organisation des BMWIG
Das neu zu schaffende Ministerium muss nicht nur zukunftsorientierte Themengebiete auf sich vereinen , sondern auch zeitgemäße Arbeitsstrukturen besitzen .
Größtes Hemmnis für kreatives und eigenverantwortliches Arbeiten im öffentlichen Dienst ist bei der jetzigen Ministerialstruktur der monolithische Aufbau , die starken vertikalen Hierarchien sowie ein Arbeitssystem , dass kreative und unkonventionelle Ideen und die Bereitschaft , Risiken einzugehen , nicht belohnt .
Die Arbeitsweise des Ministeriums muss nach dem Vorbild moderner , sich selbst organisierender Unternehmen strukturiert werden .
Dies bedeutet auch , dass sich die Ministerien der konsequenten und durchgängigen Nutzung neuer Medien und Arbeitstechniken nicht mehr verschließen dürfen .
Trotzdem muss die Arbeitsfähigkeit des Ministeriums zu jedem Zeitpunkt gewährleistet sein .
Die Bereitschaft der Referate , Wissen innerhalb des Hauses und mit anderen Ministerien zu teilen muss unabhängig von Parteizugehörigkeit der einzelnen Häuser hoch sein .
Effektive Ministerialarbeit hängt vor allem von gut ausgebildeten und motivierten Mitarbeitern ab .
Um dies auch in Zukunft zu gewährleisten muss sich das Ministerium früh um den potentiellen Nachwuchs durch entsprechende Förderprogramme kümmern .
Die Einstiegshürden für qualifizierte Bewerber müssen niedrig gehalten werden .
Die Ministerien müssen sich bei der Ausschreibung von Stellen allen Wissensfeldern öffnen und dürfen nicht nur für z.B. Juristen und Wirtschaftswissenschaftler ausschreiben .
Die Hierarchien müssen allgemein flacher und flexibler werden um das Potential der Mitarbeiter des Hauses voll auszuschöpfen und die Arbeitsmoral stetig hoch zu halten .
Führungskräfte müssen besonders in der Mitarbeitermotivation und - führung geschult und qualifiziert werden .
Die Mitarbeiter müssen in die Planung von Projekten und bei der Bewertung von Prioritäten mehr einbezogen werden .
Weiterhin wird der Minister eine Linie vorgeben , aber die Mitarbeiter sollen einen größeren Spielraum und mehr kreative Möglichkeiten bekommen , diese umzusetzen .
Bürokratieabbau
Insgesamt sollen bei der Umstrukturierung nicht mehr neue Stellen oder Ministerien geschaffen werden als bisher , sondern nach Möglichkeit die Zahl der Ministerien reduziert werden oder bestehende Ministerien entsprechend verkleinert werden .
Das Ministerium für Bildung und Forschung , das Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und das Bundesministerium des Innern dürften bei dem Vorschlag die grösste Zahl an Referaten oder einzelnen Mitarbeitern abgeben .
Das Bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung ( BMZ ) ist so klein , dass dessen Aufgaben problemlos von anderen Ministerien übernommen werden könnten .
Das Bundesministerium für Ernährung , Landwirtschaft und Verbraucherschutz ( BMELV ) wäre zukünftig nicht mehr für den Verbraucherschutz zuständig , eine Aufgabe , die dort ohnehin deplaziert ist und dort offenbar keinen grossen Stellenwert einnimmt .
Daher könnte das Rest - BMELV etwa mit dem Gesundheitsministerium zusammengelegt werden .
Des weiteren könnten das Ministerium für Arbeit und Soziales ( BMAS ) und das Ministerium für Familie , Senioren , Frauen und Jugend ( BMFSFJ ) zusammengefasst werden , die beide ohnehin viele Überschneidungen in ihren Aufgaben haben .
Das Bundesministerium für Justiz könnte auf seine Funktion als Verfassungsministerium reduziert werden .
Die überflüssigen Abteilungen und Referate können auf die jeweiligen Fachministerien verteilt werden .
Die Abteilung R ( Rechtspflege ) sollte ohnehin besser ausserhalb der Ministerialbürokratie in einem eigenständigen demokratischen Prozess organisiert werden , um eine grössere Unabhängigkeit der Judikative von der Exekutive zu erreichen , die in anderen demokratischen Ländern selbstverständlich ist .
Die Organisation der Justiz in Deutschland genügt derzeit nicht den Kriterien , die an Beitrittskandidaten zur europäischen Union gestellt werden .
Before we jump into this one , it ’s important to lay out a few caveats .
The first is that , in general , TTAC does n’t do recalls .
It ’s impossible to cover them with any fairness , and most of the time they ’re inconsequential or hard to verify .
The second is that TTAC really , really does n’t do sudden unintended acceleration ( SUA ) scares .
If someone tells you their throttle sticks wide open at precisely the same time as their brakes fail , they ’re either covering for their own incompetence or looking for a buck .
Period .
Now , the proliferation of computer controls may have introduced a greater possibility of simultaneous system failures than existed on old , mechanically - actuated brakes and throttles .
In fact , the recent rash of SUA complaints involving Toyota and Lexus models had me wondering if ghosts in the machine were rendering the time - tested SUA debunking test obsolete .
No such luck .
It turns out it ’s the floormats , stupid .
Toyota initially dismissed all SUA claims , but now Bloomberg reports they ’re recalling floor mats on 3.8 m Toyota and Lexus models for causing the gas pedal to stick .
How this issue was n’t caught in Toyota ’s product testing is a mystery .
The NHTSA has received 102 complaints about the mats and their role in possible SUA incidents .
And these are floormats , not lines of code controlling fuel injection .
In other words , if this was going to be an issue it should have been fairly obvious to Toyota ’s designers , testers and developers .
On the other hand , Toyota ’s dismissal of the early Tacoma SUA reports shows that the big T takes what I ’d call a healthily skeptical approach to all SUA claims .
Unfortunately , while Toyota ’s assumption that people involved in SUA claims were either stupid or ignorant was essentially correct , it neither fully explained the phenomenon nor absolved the company from guilt .
Now , a well - informed , seasoned driver can tell when a mat is interfering with pedal operation .
And he can certainly tell the difference between pedal interference and a computer going haywire .
More importantly , once the problem has been identified he can either remove or modify the mat before it interferes at a potentially dangerous moment .
The problem is that this level of competence appears to be shockingly rare in the United States , and Toyota really should have known it .
Toyota should have understood that a piece of fabric sliding out of place would lead a healthy number of Americans to believe their car was possessed by demons .
As my man Mencken put it , no one ever went broke under-estimating the intelligence of the American Public .
By Robert Samuelson - October 12 , 2009
WASHINGTON -- Every generation of Americans should live better than its predecessor .
That 's Americans ' core definition of economic " progress . "
But for today 's young , it may be a mirage .
Higher health spending , increasing energy prices and stretched governments at all levels may squeeze future disposable incomes -- what people have to spend -- and public services .
Are we condemning our children to downward mobility ?
Good question .
Considering how health spending could threaten future living standards , it ought to be center stage in the " reform " debate .
Instead , it 's ignored .
An oft - stated view is that the growth of the U.S. economy will make the young so much richer than their parents that they can afford a bigger health care sector and still enjoy large increases in their living standards .
Complaining about providing more generous health care is selfish .
This is a powerful argument ; unfortunately , it is n't true .
Look at the table below .
It portrays the U.S. economy from 1980 , with a projection for 2030 from Moody's Economy.com .
The projection assumes that the recession ends and growth revives .
Superficially , the table suggests that economic growth can easily pay for more health care .
In 2007 , the economy 's total output -- gross domestic product , our national income -- was $ 13.3 trillion .
In 2030 , it projected to $ 22.6 trillion , a huge 70 percent increase .
( All amounts are in 2005 " constant " dollars to eliminate inflation . )
Year Total GDP Per Capita GDP Per Capita Health Spending 1980 $ 5.8 trillion $ 25,700 $ 2,300 1990 $ 8 trillion $ 32,100 $ 3,900 2007 $ 13.3 trillion $ 43,900 $ 7,100 2030 $ 22.6 trillion $ 60,600 ( see below )
Surely that 's ample .
Not really .
First , the economy 's growth is projected to slow in the future , reflecting an aging population .
Lots of workers retire ; the labor force does n't expand much .
From 1980 to 2007 , GDP grew an average 3.1 percent annually .
From 2007 to 2030 , Moody 's projects 2.4 percent annually .
Next , it 's necessary to adjust for population .
In 2007 , there were 302 million Americans ; in 2030 , that 's expected to be about 375 million .
As a result , per capita GDP -- the average amount of income for every American , though ( obviously ) some receive more and some less -- grows even more slowly .
From 2007 to 2030 , it 's projected to rise from $ 43,900 to $ 60,600 .
That 's a 38 percent increase or 1.4 percent a year , down from 2 percent .
Unless controlled , rising health spending would absorb much of that gain .
The increase in per capita GDP from 2007 to 2030 is $ 16,700 .
If health spending continued to grow at past rates , it would go from $ 7,100 per person in 2007 to $ 15,300 in 2030 .
This rise of $ 8,200 is half the overall gain ( $ 16,700 ) in per capita income .
( For policy wonks : this assumes health spending grows 2 percentage points faster than GDP per capita , the 1975 - 2005 trend . )
Downward mobility is possible .
Expanding health spending would raise taxes ( to pay for government insurance ) , lower take - home pay ( to pay for employer - provided insurance ) or increase out - of - pocket medical costs .
Other drains also loom : higher energy prices to combat global warming ; higher taxes to pay for underfunded state and local government pensions and repair aging infrastructure ; higher federal taxes to cover deficits and payments to retirees ( much of which reflect health spending ) .
The pressures will undermine private living standards and other public services ( schools , police , defense ) .
The young 's future has been heavily mortgaged .
Taken together , all these demands might neutralize gains in per capita incomes , especially if the economy 's performance , burdened by higher taxes or budget deficits , deteriorated .
One study by Steven Nyce and Sylvester Schieber of Watson Wyatt Worldwide , a consulting firm , examined just health spending .
The continuation of present trends would result in " falling wages at the bottom of the earnings spectrum and very slow wage growth on up the earnings distribution .
These dismal wage outcomes would persist over at least the next couple of decades . "
To be sure , extra health care enhances our well - being .
Some care extends life and improves quality of life .
But the connections between being healthy and more health spending are loose .
The health of most people reflects personal habits and luck .
They get few benefits from high spending .
The healthiest 50 percent of Americans account for just 3 percent of annual spending , reports the Kaiser Family Foundation ; the sickest 15 percent represent nearly 75 percent .
Half of spending goes to those 55 and over , a third to those 65 and over .
Any expansion of health care tends to be a transfer from young to old .
The road to downward mobility is paved with good intentions .
The health debate has focused on insuring the uninsured and de-emphasized controlling runaway spending , much of which is ineffective .
The priorities should have been reversed .
The chance to reorder the medical - industrial complex to restrain costs and improve care has been mostly squandered .
Some call this " reform " ; no one should call it progress .

A Florida teenager has lost his bid to have the US Supreme Court decide whether students in public schools have a First Amendment right to refuse to stand and repeat the Pledge of Allegiance .
The underlying lawsuit did not challenge the content of the Pledge .
Instead , at issue was a Florida law that requires all public - school students , Grades K - 12 , to stand and repeat the Pledge , unless excused in writing by a parent .
The law was passed in 1942 and had apparently gone unchallenged until December 2005 .
That 's when Cameron Frazier , a junior , arrived for his fourth - period math class at Boynton Beach High School and informed the teacher that as a matter of conscience , he would neither stand nor recite the Pledge of Allegiance .
" You clearly have no respect .
You are so ungrateful and so un-American , " the math teacher told Cameron in front of the class .
" Do you know what 's out there fighting our war ?
That flag you refuse to show respect to . "
Cameron stood his ground .
" No , " he said .
" Our soldiers are out fighting a war .
The flag is an inanimate piece of cloth that does n't move and surely can't hold a gun . "
On Monday , the Supreme Court announced that it would not hear the case .
No reason for the decision was offered .
In seeking high - court review of the case , called Frazier v. Smith , Mr. Frazier 's lawyers had asked the justices to decide whether he and other students have a constitutional right to refuse to be compelled by the government to repeat the Pledge of Allegiance .
To resolve the case , the justices would have had to clarify a landmark 1943 ruling in which the high court declared schoolchildren in West Virginia may not be required to participate in the Pledge of Allegiance .
The issue in the Frazier case was whether the First Amendment right established in the West Virginia decision belongs to the children alone or instead extends to the children through their parents .
A federal judge in Florida agreed that the right belongs to the students and struck down the Florida law .
But a federal appeals - court panel later upheld the law on grounds that the First Amendment right belongs to parents of school - age children – not the children themselves .
The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida took up Frazier 's case .
In a brief urging the Supreme Court to hear the appeal , ACLU lawyer Randall Marshall quoted from the 1943 West Virginia decision .
" If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation , it is that no official , high or petty , can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics , nationalism , religion , or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein . "
Florida Solicitor General Scott Makar urged the high court to refuse to hear the case .
" The state , of course , recognizes that minors have constitutional rights , albeit more limited ones than adults , especially in the area of education , " Mr. Makar wrote in his brief to the court .
" The state 's clear legal position is simply that minors ' rights must be balanced against those of their parents and the interests of the government in the education context . "
In a friend - of - the court brief , two advocacy groups , the Center for Constitutional Rights and Public Good , said the appeals - court opinion in the Frazier case is a departure from a long and unbroken line of decisions .
" In upholding a Florida statute that limits students ' clearly established right to abstain from reciting the pledge of allegiance in school , the court of appeals created a new parental right to control the exercise of their children 's conscience , " Seth Mermin wrote in the brief .

' Say what you like about servicemen amputees from Iraq and Afghanistan ... "
You 'll know the joke by now , even if you did n't hear Jimmy Carr deliver it in person .
And you 'll be aware of the hullabaloo .
Yet another .
Every time a comedian does what he 's paid to do , there 's a hullaballoo .
Why do we go on with this ?
Where did we get the idea from that there 's such a thing as a joke - free zone ?
Have we not read Swift on solving Ireland 's economic problems by eating the babies of the poor ?
How funny 's that ?
Very .
Though at the time it might not have seemed so to the Irish poor in question .
But that 's the way of it with a joke .
There 's always somebody who does n't get it .

I have n't seen Jimmy Carr live .
I do n't go to comedy clubs .
Not any more .
The one time I did go , which was in the course of writing an article about comedy clubs and why I do n't go to them , I was heckled by the comedian .
" Call yourself a comedian ! " he suddenly and for no apparent reason shouted at me , and you can't in that situation start arguing with the injustice of the laughter , or stand up and say you defer to his ridicule only because he enjoys the tacit privileges of performance , otherwise you would have him for breakfast , because by that time he has had you for breakfast .
So you perspire heavily , smile the shit - eating grin of the publicly humiliated and look forward to the time you will see him sitting in your audience , while knowing all along that that will never happen because he's an illiterate clown and wo n't be coming to hear you speak about Comedy , Anathema and the Limits of the Permissible .
I knew in my bones I was going have a hard time of it at the comedy club .
People on stages pick on me .
They always have .
The first time my parents took me to a pantomime I was spotted by the Dame and made fun of .
" Call yourself a little boy ! "
Since then I have given places of public entertainment a miss , or sit so far back I can't be seen .
But still they find me .
Only recently I was eyeballed during Swan Lake by a cygnet with a piercing stare who for a horrifying moment I feared was going to call me up on to the stage .
A Tosca at Covent Garden once paused before throwing herself off the ramparts to look my way though I was hunched in an aisle seat on the back row of the Grand Circle .
I knew what she was thinking .
" Call yourself a tenor ! "
But I have other , more specific arguments with comedy clubs .
I do n't like the audiences .
They are too militarised .
They laugh to a rhythm , not at what 's funny .
As though wound up .
And they laugh as a body .
And those who laugh as a body today will march as a body tomorrow .
Furthermore – because there is a furthermore – I am envious .
I am one of those men who cannot see a platform , dais or any other raised construction without wondering why they 're not on it .
When it 's the ballet – and leaving aside what 's coming from the cygnet – I just about cope .
I am not , after all , built for ballet .
I leap fine but land badly .
My centre of gravity is in the wrong place .
But when it 's comedy I want it to be me .
I should have been a stand - up comedian .
Should in the sense that it would have been a better long - term career decision than novelist in an age when no one reads , at least as I understand reading – ie to seek out a verbal challenge greater than Katie Price throws down .
So anything I have to say about Jimmy Carr does not come without context .
Based on what I 've seen of him on television he does n't amuse me .
His shtick is to be amused by himself .
No great comedian is ever amused by himself .
Billy Connolly could have been a great comedian had he not taken to collapsing hysterically during his own routines .
The seal on David Brent 's prattishness was his laughing at his own jokes .
Then it turned out that Ricky Gervais , who created him , laughs at his own jokes too .
Self - satisfaction is an unpardonable crime in a comedian because his role is to remind us that nothing is satisfactory .
Hence the necessity of keeping a straight face .
It affirms the seriousness of his calling .
Which is to make people laugh , not because life is funny but because it is n't .
Amputee servicemen are desperately not funny .
Which does n't mean the joke is n't .
It 's easy to show people who took offence that the butt of it was not the amputated servicemen but those responsible for their injuries , the inefficient , the penny - pinching , war itself .
But that 's just the satire dealt with and satire is only a small part of comedy .
Why we laugh is a more vexatious question .
In a recent novel I recalled a sick joke from my youth .
" How many Jews can you fit into a Volkswagen Beetle ?
A thousand : two in the front , two in the back , nine hundred and ninety - six in the ashtray . "
To readers who were stupid enough to be outraged by this I explained that the person making the joke was an anti-Semite .
End of problem .
The joke was , as they say , dramatically " placed " .
But that does n't explain why I and my Jewish friends who were n't anti-Semitic enjoyed the joke when we first heard it .
Precisely because it was offensive is the answer .
Precisely because it was off - colour , cruel , heartless , in the very worst of taste .
We need relieving sometimes not just of propriety and discretion but of grief and horror .
And comedy is the place we go to get that relief .
It is n't that in comedy anything goes ; in comedy anything must go .
If you 're not being offended you might as well stay home .
But that puts a heavy burden on the comedian .
Anything goes morally , but aesthetically the rules could not be stricter .
You do n't do whimsy .
You do n't do self - satisfaction .
And you do n't do shocking just to enjoy shocking .
Curb Your Enthusiasm has suddenly become unfunny because Larry David is trying too hard to be obnoxious .
The sorts of comedy panel shows on which Jimmy Carr appears are tiresome for the same reason .
What television executives call " edgy " has already had all the edges smoothed off it .
Jimmy Carr – substitute any name you like – does n't amuse me , not because he 's offensive but because he is so pleased he is .
It 's a fine line .
But then it 's a fine business .

Thanks to public health campaigns , it seems like everyone is aware that sufficient Folic Acid prevents ' neural tube defects ' in developing infants .
As such , most governments have made folic acid supplementation of many foods mandatory to prevent these permanent birth defects .
A lesser known fact , however , is that sufficientis just as important as folic acid in the fetal development of the brain and spinal cord - yet a handful of researchers seem to be the only ones concerned about this equally important public health issue .
Supplementation of the food supply with nutrients not found naturally in those foods is so commonplace that most of us would point to milk as a good source of vitamin D , yet in nature there is no vitamin D in milk whatsoever .
Most recently , governments in several western countries have chosen to fortify bakery products with folic acid in order to prevent the spinal cord malformations that occur in infants during development when this vitamin is lacking .
Fortunately , supplementation and educationworked to reduce the incidence of the spinal cord defects known as Neural Tube Defects - or NTD's .
Yet the same research that led to the conclusion that lack of Folic Acid caused neural tube defectsled to the conclusion that insufficient Vitamin B12 , a condition known medically as Cobalamin Deficiency , is aandrisk factor for neural tube defects .
But astoundingly , this information was ignored when the decision was made to begin widespread folic acid fortification .
Vitamin B - 12 and neural tube defects : the Canadian experienceObviously , those responsible for this fortification did not read the science about the relationship between folic acid and vitamin B12 because it is well - known that supplementation with folic acid alone can actually prevent the only clinical sign of vitamin B12 deficiency that doctors look for .
This condition , called macrocytic anemia , is easily detected on routine blood tests , but folatethis sign without preventing the B12 deficiency .
Ralph Green , MD , PhD - University of California DavisThere are two other aspects of this problem that are important to note .
First of all , the ' official ' stance of most medical groups is that Vitamin B12 deficiency is ' rare ' , but studies have shown that it is actually quite common .
Since vitamin B12 is foundexclusively in animal products , those in the lowest socioeconomic classes who are unable to afford higher priced animal products are at an increased risk .
And women who have chosen , for religious or health reasons , to eat fewer meat and meat products often unknowingly put themselves at risk as well .
With huge numbers of women that fit into these categories , research points to the fact that vitamin b12 deficiency in women of childbearing age is hardly the rare phenomenon that medical groups have made it out to be .
The second aspect of this problem that is less understood is that the levels of Vitamin B12 found in the mothers of children with NTD 's were low , but wouldhave been low enough to be considered a true deficiency .
Therefore , even if their doctors had been on alert for this problem and had actually done testing for it , it still would not have been likely to be found anyway .
These unique circumstances have led research groups , including teams from The University Medical Center of Nijmegen in The Netherlands and The Institute of Nutrition and Food Technology at the University of Chile in Santiago to urge consideration of vitamin B12 fortification of foods .
In addition , American researchers Victor Herbert and Jean Bigaouette unsuccessfully petitioned the US Food and Drug Administration in 1997 for the vitamin B12 fortification of foods already fortified with folic acid
That governments chose to fortify foods with folic acid without the consideration that it may very well mask the Vitamin B12 deficiency thatcontributes to neural tube defects is obviously not based on science .
In true governmental fashion , the decision was likely based more on outcries from bakery groups that Vitamin B12 would discolor their pure white products than it was based on the welfare of unborn children .
Vitamin B12 , however , plays just as important a role in the brain and spinal cord health of the next generation as folic acid does .
But without public health campaigns teaching us of its importance , it is up to concerned individuals to get this information out to as many women as possible in order to decrease the incidence of these devastating yet entirely preventable birth defects .

About
Philosoraptor is an advice animal image macro series featuring an illustration of a Velociraptor paired with captions depicting the dinosaur as being deeply immersed in metaphysical inquiries or unraveling quirky paradoxes .
Origin
On October 8th , 2008 , the original illustration of the Philosoraptor was released and copyrighted by creator Sam Smith as a T - shirt design for sale on the online retailer Lonely Dinosaur ( shown below ) .
In an e-mail exchange with Know Your Meme , Smith revealed that the idea for " Philosoraptor " image was conceived sometime in the early of summer of 2008 .
The final image was n't created until late summer and the t- shirts went into production in August and September that year .
The image itself was a mix of several images of velociraptors I got online , which I compressed to one - color images , then mixed together .
I took the jaw off of one at the mouth , and cut it open to make the mouth look like it was hanging open .
The claw was based off an image of an eagle talon that I flattened , drew in some bits , and moved and enlarged one of them to make the raptor - like claw .
The last thing I did was nudge the eye slit over to the right like three times , and that pulled it all together - really gives him that far - away look .
It was inspired by our friend Devin , who was a philosophy major and was always hunched over his desk thinking , so we called him the philosoraptor .
We had never heard of it before at the time , but apparently the joke had been made previously on the interwebs .
On 4chan
On March 30th , 2007 , the earliest known depiction of a Philosoraptor dinosaur was posted on YTMND page titled " New species of dinosaur discovered ! " , featuring a photoshopped image of a Velociraptor from the 1993 action film Jurassic Park holding a copy of Plato 's complete works ( shown below , left ) .
On February 18th , 2009 , the earliest archived appearance of an image macro featuring the Lonely Dinosaur illustration was posted on 4 chan /b/ board .
Etymology
Although " Philosoraptor " ( combination of Philosopher and velociraptor ) appears on the original t- shirt design , the portmanteau word has been used elsewhere prior to the release of Lonely Dinosaur merchandises .
Due to the similar sounds of the two words , it is quite likely that various people arrived at the concept of a Philosoraptor independent of one another .
One of the earliest mentions of " philosoraptor " on the web can be found in a quote by a ten - year - old Hope from Kentucky , originally posted via children 's site EnchantedLearning on December 28th , 1998 :
I like the philosoraptor because it spits an acidy type of substance in its victims eyes .
I saw this dinosaur in the movie Jurassic Park and I did a report on it also .
This dinosaur is da bomb .
" Philosoraptor " has been also used as online identities on various occasions , most notably the politics - religion blog Philosoraptor , which has been active since March 2003 , and a notorious debater named " Philosoraptor " on Democratic Underground forums .
Spread
In November 2009 , Philosoraptor was added to the Advice Dog " variations " section on Encyclopedia Dramatica .
On November 26th , an entry for Philosoraptor was created on Urban Dictionary ( shown below ) .
In December that year , Sam Smith sent an e-mail to inform the Lonely Dinosaur staff that was fine with the image being used as a meme :
We 're not exactly sure who started putting text over it , and far be it from us to try and control a meme …
We put a creative commons non-commercial license on it , so all your stuff is cool and we think what you 're doing is great , but now everyone thinks that the shirt we 're selling is just something we cut and pasted off the web , which kind of sucks for us .
It 'd be cool to see if we could put our side of the story out there and see if we can find the person who first put text over it , and have a complete history of origin of the meme .
On October 25th , 2010 , the Internet humor blog Smosh published a listicle featuring 20 notable Philosoraptor examples .
On November 23rd , the Internet news blog Mary Sue posted an image gallery highlighting 50 Philosoraptor examples .
By July 2011 , Philosoraptor reached the " God Tier " on Memegenerator with over 38,000 instances and 12 different templates .
On December 29th , YouTuber Chris Schultz published an original pop song featuring lyrics inspired by Philosoraptor images ( shown below , left ) .
On August 28th , 2012 , the animeme YouTube channel uploaded several animated versions of Philosoraptor image macros ( shown below , right ) .
In October 2013 , a thread inviting users to post the best Philosoraptor jokes was submitted to the discussion site Quora .
On March 30th , 2016 , the news site Observer published an article describing the history of Philosoraptor and several other classic internet memes .

A baby has survived after his pushchair rolled onto the tracks as a train pulled into a station in Melbourne , Australia .
The train had slowed right down as it pulled into the station and the six - month - old baby suffered only a bump to his head .
CCTV of the incident was released to local media .
It shows the pram rolling off the platform while the baby 's mother looks on in horror .
Victoria state Police Sergeant Michael Ferwerda called the incident a " lucky escape " and said people should be cautious in train stations .
AT&T has escalated its attacks against Google and Google Voice , accusing the chocolate factory of double standards and demanding it be regulated like any other telco .
In a fifteen - page letter ( PDF hosted at the Washington Post ) Robert Quinn ( AT&T VP ) lays into the chocolate factory for holding an unregulated monopoly on web searching , stacking web searches in its favour and adopting a hugely hypocritical stance on the neutrality of communication networks .
The core complaint relates to the way in which Google Voice users are blocked from dialling specific numbers .
Google claims this is to avoid excessive charges , but AT&T reckons that 's decidedly un-neutral , not to mention that the operator discovered Google is blocking an eye doctor , a church , an ambulance service and a convent , amongst others .
Google reckons it 's not subject to telecommunications regulations , which require operators to connect calls to any valid number , as Google Voice is just a software application not operating as a network operator .
Not only is that obviously bollocks , as AT&T points out , but it's also in stark contrast to Google 's position on net neutrality , which says operators should be required to connect to any valid address with equal facility .
The FCC 's threatened stance on net neutrality should be applied to Google even if it's not a telecommunications company , argues AT&T .
It points out that with 71 per cent of the search market , Google is more of a " gatekeeper " of internet content than any ISP , and so should be legally required to treat all internet content equally .
AT&T backs up its claims that the search giant is not being even - handed with an example where articles supporting net neutrality featured predominantly in search results .
Google explained at the time that this was the result of " public service - type advertisements " , but AT&T reckons that is hardly fair :
" Google never explained what it means when it claims to have ' participated in its own auction ' ; all we know is that it unilaterally moved its favored political messages to the head of the queue , apparently at no cost to itself . "
No matter how vitriolic , or sustained , the attacks against Google , it 's unlikely anyone is going to have much sympathy for AT&T : the former is still cool while the latter is just that monolithic company which can't run an iPhone network . ®

Now Pidgin makes it possible for Windows / Mac / Linux : Pidgin has long been an easy way to use lots of different chat systems on your desktop .
With its 2.6 release , Pidgin ’s finally catching up to the video , audio , and file transfer offerings of Google Talk , Yahoo , and others .
The big new feature in the 2.6 releases — already at a bug- fixing 2.6.1 as this is written — is video and voice chat support over XMPP , known primarily as the Jabber / Google Talk protocol .
Unfortunately , that video and audio chat support is n’t working on Windows at the moment ( kind of a big target to miss , no ? ) , but the Pidgin team says it ’s coming soon .
In other areas , Pidgin improved its Yahoo file transfer powers , added rough support for theming , and made a whole bunch of changes .
Pdigin ’s 2.6.1 release is available as a source download at the moment , but pre-compiled versions for Windows , Linux , and Mac should be rolling out soon .

I ’ve written in the past on what the obvious trend for freethinker ’s political orientation is but the more I talk and interact with libertarians online , the more I notice a second , more passive trend which seems to be present in the political history of those people .
The Libertarian Socialist Pull .
This means the general tendency to move towards the left or , to put it a bit more practically , start giving more weight to concepts of justice , mutual aid and equality , as well as the tendency to move towards liberty which means to start demanding the right to manage all aspects of your own life without a higher authority and prioritize direct action .
The first part then expresses the empathy all humans possess for others , while the second expresses the individualism which allows each human to naturally distinguish themselves .
It is no wonder then that the more someone experiences , the more they start to notice all the aspects of our current existence which limit those expressions and if this is coupled with thinking freely about them , that is , when someone does not have any irrational beliefs which would prevent them from looking at and judging the underlying causes , ( eg “ Goddidit ” ) then it is only natural that the truth will be found and lead to some uncomfortable conclusions about all the things we ’ve considered normal until now .
This is by no means an easy process and can be as difficult as a deconversion if one is to start from a point of heavy indoctrination .
As such , it is a gradual progression , with people slowly discovering the puzzle pieces which just do n’t seem to fit right , no matter how you turn them and then discarding them , only to discover that a whole chunk of the puzzle has now become disconnected and can be discarded as well .
From what I ’ve observed , it seems that there are generally two paths towards Libertarian Socialism , one from Socialism and one from Libertarianism and which one people start walking depends on their upbringing and general circumstances and experiences .
But in broad strokes , I would say that we can talk about two types of human personality which are more susceptible to either pull : Empathetic – which is positive towards Socialism and Individualist which prioritizes Libertarianism .
Why ?
Because the personality one has will define which difficult questions the freethinker will choose to investigate first .
Where one starts in the current political spectrum is not so important but it generally also correlates to one ’s personality as well ( although of course irrational beliefs one has not yet discarded play a large role ) .
However as one asks the pointed questions and discovers that the easy answers are unfulfilling or just do not stand the light of reason so do the answers one discovers pull them more towards the Libertarian or Socialist pathways .
You ’ll notice I ’ve split these two for now because it may very well be the case that one may initially move away from the other side as the initial answers which make sense , feel like a breath of cool air among stagnating fumes , and as a result are accepted with less rigor as one strives to investigate the whole spectrum of thought these ideas originate .
In fact , I would say it ’s rare for one to move simultaneously towards socialism and libertarianism at the same time .
EDIT : I realize that there is something I probably should have mentioned as it is quite important :
What is it that causes some people to be empathetic while others to be individualistic ?
The answer to this is the material conditions one lives in .
For example , wage - workers are quite unlikely to be individualists as the constant interaction with fellow human workers and the actual experience of the dreadfulness of wage - slavery is sure to fan the flames of empathy and mutual aid as they seek to collectively improve their lot and resist against the bosses .
On the other hand , those lucky few who get to be entrepreneurs have the uncommon chance to experience liberty of action and control of one ’s own destiny which make all interventions by a state seem as a horrible violation of rights .
For them then , individualism becomes the primary basis of ethics .
It is in fact for this reason that the individualists are always so outnumbered compared to socialists as there ’s far more wage - slaves than there ’s entrepreneurs or rich people .
As a general observation , the Socialist path will usually lead one towards Social Democracy while the Libertarian path will lead someone towards Liberalism ( “ Liberalism ” and “ Libertarianism ” respectively for all you Yanks ) but sooner or later one will discover the inability of the state apparatus to perform the tasks one expects from it ( Protect public interests or Protect private property respectively for each path ) and will take anti-reformist turn to revolution or anti-statism .
Thus we end up with something like this ( Where “ | > ” symbolizes the break with reformism ) :
Empathetic : Apolitical > Social Democrat |> Socialist > Vulgar Marxist ( eg Stalinist , Maoist etc ) .
Individualistic : Apolitical > Free Market Minarchist |> Liberal > Vulgar Libertarian ( eg “ Anarcho ” - Capitalist ) .
Now it is very possible that someone will progress all the way to the far side of this path and stay there , or be brought up with such a ideology in the first place and just stay there .
But what I ’ve noticed happening more often than not , is that after the break with reformism , freethinkers reach a dead - end and start noticing the impassable barrier posed by the following fact :
You ca n’t have equality without liberty and you ca n’t have liberty without equality .
The reasons for this have been explained many times by lots of anarchists so I wo n’t go into much detail other than to say that the practical implications of it make themselves known by the actual experience of everyone who has had their rights trampled by the state ( even the “ worker ’s state ) or their lives disrupted or ruined by the capitalist bosses .
Once this is noticed , then the second part of the freethinker ’s journey begins as Libertarians and Socialists move towards their converging point .
Anarchism .
My own experience of course has not been much different .
I started profoundly apolitical but very empathetic .
As soon as I linked the huge societal and environmental issues of our time to the economic system we live in I started moving towards a State Socialist direction , taking a break with reformism once I read the arguments against the failure of the parliamentary process and finally rejecting the need for a state in socialism as something counter - productive .
On the other side , I ’ve seen and heard of many examples of Individualists , even at the extreme end of “ Anarcho ” - Capitalism coming to reject that ideology and start espousing more leftist concepts to the point of passing into the anti-capitalist camp altogether .
The best historical example of this is of course Voltairine de Cleyre while in own online circles I ’ve noticed ( among others ) Francois Tremblay and just yesterday Sean from the Skeptical Eye , both of which started from Objectivism no less .
In fact , the latter was what triggered me to write this post as it ’s something that I seem to notice almost monthly lately .
This was because we had quite clash a while back when both of us were more in our respective polar ends so when he explained that he ’s almost abandoned his pro-capitalist ideas , it was just a very powerful real - world example of what I was thinking already .
None of this of course is meant to imply that one is not a freethinker unless the progress towards Libertarian Socialism anymore than one can expect a freethinker is always right .
Of course I think people who have not yet embraced Anarchism are wrong but this is only logical , this does not mean that they are close minded .
However I do have the impression , backed by experience , that the Libertarian Socialist Pull is in fact real for freethought .
And that is a cause for hope .

HTPC is an acronym for Home Theater Personal Computer .
A computer system designed with the sole intention of being connected to a television , for entertainment purposes such as watching live TV , playing movies , surfing the Internet , games , listening to music , or viewing digital photographs .
A HTPC may also be referred to as a Media Center , which is usually the software portion of the device that combines the functions of a personal computer and media software into a single convergence device .
You have likely seen a few commercial Media Center products in stores .
Not surprisingly most of these are built on Windows Media Center software , or use proprietary software which of course inflate the overall price .
In my opinion , Open Source software can be used to build a far superior HTPC / Media Center than any commercial software product out there .
So I 've written this guide in an effort to help you save some money and point you in the right direction when building your very own HTPC / Media Center .
This article was written in 2011 and now considered historical , all links have been removed .
View our Linux HowTo section for updated content .
Hardware recommendations
Creating an Open Source HTPC / Media Center requires some hands - on assembly of standard PC hardware components .
If you 're not comfortable doing so , I would suggest having a friend help you out , or refer to one of the many tutorials available on - line .
Choosing the right hardware can also be an involved process .
Some common considerations when building a HTPC / Media Center are performance , form factor ( size ) of component , cooling , storage capacities , minimal acoustics ( noise reduction ) and how to control your center from the comfort of the couch .
In the last few months , I 've had 20 + individuals writing in to ask for recommendations on which hardware is supported and best suited for a Linux HTPC / Media Center .
So for the benefit of anyone looking for some excellent hardware recommendations , here is my list .
HTPC Case
When selecting a Home Theater PC chassis it is a good idea to first determine where it is you 'd like to physically place the case .
Most people slide the HTPC enclosure into a TV stand with of some sort , so be sure to measure and account for some additional airflow space .
The case I 've selected is a SilverStone GD02B .
This unit has ventilation holes on the back , bottom and both sides which allow for great heat dissipation in tight spaces .
With a depth of only 14 inches , it will comfortably fit inside most home theater cabinets and still accommodate a regular sized power supply , Micro - ATX motherboard form factor , or even high end graphics cards up to 11.5 inches .
Not only is the GD02 a great looking enclosure , but it has enough room to harbor future upgrades .
- Micro-ATX , DTX , Mini-ITX motherboards - Supports 11.5 inch graphic cards -
Two hard drive bays with anti-vibration mounts - Single optical drive bay - Two 80 mm fans - Aluminum front panel with USB2.0 , Firewire , Audio + MIC and card reader slot .
Motherboard
The ASUS P5QL - EM Motherboard is an Intel G43 chipset Micro - ATX motherboard supporting the latest Intel Core2 processors using socket LGA775 .
Do n't understand all that ?
That 's perfectly fine , here 's all you need to know .
ASUS engineers some of the best motherboards on the market today .
Stable , energy efficient , high - quality and full of features the P5 QL - EM is a great choice for a HTPC system .
The ASUS P5QL - EM motherboard features an integrated Intel GMA X4500 graphics processor , which has HDMI ( High - Definition Multimedia Interface ) with max resolution of 1920 x 1080 .
Yes , that 's on - board HDMI out supporting uncompressed , all digital audio and video via a single cable and is HDCP compliant allowing playback of HD DVD , Blu-ray and other content .
This alleviates the need to purchase a graphics card , bringing the over all cost of your HTPC system down and allowing a graphics card upgrade later if you so choose .
Compared to similar spec Micro - ATX motherboards , the P5QL - EM price point is an excellent value at under $ 100 .

If your home theater amp does n't have HDMI interfaces , you can purchase the optional S / PDIF out bracket for this board .
This will allow for a TOSLINK ( Optical Cable ) connection .
By default IEC958 is muted , so in order to get sound over S / PDIF you 'll need to unmute this channel by running alsamixer .
Processor
Unlike a regular personal computer or gaming rig , HTPC / Media Center systems are n't usually process intensive .
If you only want to watch regular DVD video ( unlikely ) , a 1.5GHz processor will be enough .
However , if you want to watch digital media , you 'll want at least 2.4 Ghz of processing power and 3.0 Ghz + if watching high definition 1080 p video is of interest .
Realistically you could get away with a single core budget processor , but lets not cutting corners sacrifice performance just to save a few dollars , purchase an Intel Core 2 .
Personally I have no interest in Blu - Ray , H.264 decoding or piracy in general .
But if I recall correctly , AGP cards do n't do hardware decoding , so if you 're going to get into that sort of thing you 'll want more processing power such as the Intel Core 2 Quad Q8200 Quad Core Processor .
The Intel Q8200 is a impressive entry level quad core processor at a great price point .
Having said that , here comes the part where you 'll need to make some decisions for yourself .
My suggestions are one of the following .
Intel Core 2 Duo E8400 Dual Core Processor LGA775 3.0GHZ Wolfdale 1333FSB 6MB cache Intel Core 2 Duo E7400 Dual Core Processor LGA775 2.8GHZ 1066FSB 3MB cache Intel Core 2 Quad Q8200 Quad Core Processor LGA775 2.33GHZ

Memory
Computer memory is generally inexpensive these days regardless of manufacture .
However , you also need to understand the difference between inexpensive and down right cheap .
Steer clear from purchasing those no -name brand memory specials .
The memory chips that do not make the grade for quality brands get resold to lower budget memory module manufactures that not only use these chips but may also skip testing before shipping the product out to consumers .
In my opinion Crucial makes some of the best memory modules you can buy .
Their products come with a lifetime warranty , FREE shipping and also have a Memory Advisor tool to help you find guaranteed - compatible products .
Due to chipset limitation , the ASUS P5QL - EM motherboard only supports up to a total of 4 ranks ( 4 sides in total ) of RAM max .
This means , in order to fully populate this board with 8GB , you 're going to need four 2GB single - sided DIMMs or Two 4GB double sided DIMMs .
I 'm going to suggest 4GB of RAM which is more than enough and will only cost you $ 50 .
All Crucial memory compatible with the ASUS P5 Ql - EM 4GB Memory Kit ( Recommended ) 8 GB Memory Kit
CPU Cooler
Due to physical size constraints of most HTPC cases , we 're going to need a low - profile CPU cooler .
For this I 've selected the nearly silent Scythe Shuriken ( SCSK - 1100 - Revision B ) heatsink / cooler .
Featuring copper heat - pipes , high density stacked aluminum fins , a copper base and a low profile 12 mm thick 100 mm Pulse Width Modulation ( PWM ) fan .
The unit stands at 65 mm tall , making it the perfect choice .
Installing socket 775 coolers can be a real pain sometimes , even more so using the SilverStone GD02 case .
The PSU is a tight fit to our cooler .
Avoid constriction by installing your hardware in this order .
CPU , CPU heatsink / cooler and then your power supply .
You 'll thank me later .
High efficiency Power supply
The SilverStone GD02 media center chassis I 've selected fits any standard ATX power supply , so no need for a recommendation here , but keep the following in mind .
The hardware suggested in this article requires a power supply unit of 450 watts , though you may want to select a PSU with a higher wattage to accommodate the addition of future components such as hard drives or a stand - alone video card .
Also another beneficial feature would be a PSU that has modular cords so that you can keep the case free from needless obstruction .
Storage
Due to the nature of a HTPC / Media Center , large amounts of hard drive space may be required to store images , music , video , games , and other multimedia .
Thankfully disk drives are cheap now - a - days .
Whether you have 1080 p high definition movies , an image archive containing thousands of photos or hundreds of downloaded television shows , you 'll want as much storage as possible for now and imminent needs .
I suggest picking up one or two high capacity SATA hard drives from Seagate .
Seagate manufactures a dependable product that provides a level of performance and reliability like no other .
The Seagate Barracuda 7200.11 hard drives are available up to 1.5 TB in size , or for those concerned with power and system temperature get the Barracuda LP ( Low Power ) hard drives which are available up to 2TB in size and offer low power consumption .
Both a good choice .
DVD , Blu-ray or CD player
Now - a - days most people are downloading digital content from torrents , iTunes or by other means from the Internet .
So a fair majority of individuals wo n't even require a DVD or Blu-ray player if this is the case .
Others that have purchased a physical copy of their media may want to play it directly on the HTPC , so a DVD , Blu-ray or CD player is optional for our HTPC system .
Either play direct with an optical drive , rip your content on another PC then transfer over a home network , stream data from a NAS ( Network Attached Storage ) device or transfer via USB drive .
Regardless of where you get your content from , you will need one of these players to at least get the operating system installed .
Any optical drive of your choice will suffice , but I recommend purchasing one with an SATA interface .
TV - Tuner
A TV - Tuner is another component that some HTPC / Media centers have .
However , a tuner is beyond the scope of this article as the software we 'll be focusing on does not include television streaming .
This of course does n't mean you can't install another Open Source software package for this functionality .
Monitor
This article assumes you already have a high - definition television , so I 'd like to take this opportunity to comment on overscan issues .
First let me say that all televisions are subject to overscan , some more than others , but this has been the case since inception .
Basically , the television will display a smaller area of the broadcast than what is received in order to insure there are no visible black borders around the image .
Some individuals may not even notice , as overscan can be as little as 2 % of picture .
However , when displaying your HTPC Desktop environment on a HTDV , a seemingly larger amount of overscan will be noticeable , not to mention irritating .
Rather than fiddling for hours on end with your xorg configuration , check your television user manual for a 1:1 pixel mapping mode .
Pixel mapping refers to the property that a HDTV is capable of displaying a digital signal transmitted at its native resolution without scaling the image .
In the case of my HDTV .
It is a Samsung ( PN58A550 ) and offers " Just Scan " which directly maps the incoming image to the sets pixels , eliminating overscan and other possible processing .
Interfacing
Now that we have a hardware outline for our Media Center the only thing missing is a way of controlling it all from the comfort of the couch .
Conventional wired keyboard & mouse combination 's are limited in range , not to mention difficult to operate in the dark .
Using a wireless keyboard & mouse requires a stable surface to operate from and a stand - alone media center remote control does n't provide keyboard input .
Eliminating any need for these would be ideal .
By far the best solution is a product from Logitech named diNovo Mini .
The diNovo Mini is a Bluetooth ( wireless ) connected device that merges the functionality of full QWERTY keyboard , mouse and remote control into one compact , palm - sized unit .
The clam shell design has a transparent flip top which protects the keys and automatically enables the device once opened .
Featuring two operational modes , you can quickly switch between conventional keyboard & directional mouse pad or remote control .
This is perfect for regular desktop actions that require mouse or keyboard like surfing the Internet , interacting with applications , and operations .
But once in you 're in media center , toggle remote functions for navigating menus , browsing .
movie playback and volume control .
An integrated sensor detects environment light and automatically ( can be controlled manually ) turns the back - lighting on or off .
Orange light represents keyboard & mouse mode , green is media mode .
- Full QWERTY keyboard - Mouse Pad / Directional Pad - Lithium - Ion Battery life rated at 1 - month / per charge - Backlighting ( orange / green ) - Bluetooth 2.0 ( 30 foot range ) - Linux compatible
Out of the box the Logitech diNovo Mini works with Linux ( Or at least Ubuntu 9.04 ) , the only thing that does n't is of course the Windows button .
I 'll be sure yo update this if I can get it remapped .
Operating System
The Operating System of choice for this project will be Ubuntu Linux 9.04 Desktop Edition 32 - bit .
Whether you choose 32 - bit or 64 - bit is dependent on your hardware and personal preference .
Though most newer processors have 64 - bit support which offers a 25 % - 45 % performance boost when using a 64 - bit kernel and libraries .
I find 32 - bit versions of most Open Source software applications are better supported , especially when it comes to multimedia and desktop environment .
Since our HTPC / Media Center will be running Ubuntu 9.04 Desktop Edition and we need the best possible multimedia support , 32 - bit version is recommended .
If you plan on installing more than 4 Gigabytes of memory into your HTPC , you need to recognize the fact that all 32 - bit Operating Systems have only enough memory address space for 4GB .
This " issue " is n't limited to just Linux , it affects other Operating Systems such as Microsoft Windows too .
Good thing is that Linux is free and has a quick solution .
You need to install a kernel that supports Physical Address Extension ( PAE ) .
PAE is a feature of x86 and x86 - 64 processors that enables the use of more than 4 Gigabytes ( 64GB in total ) of physical memory in 32 - bit systems .
Here 's how to utilize more than 4GB of memory with Ubutnu Linux 32 - bit .
Open Source Media Center Software
With so many Open Source media center projects to choose from , I 've selected two I believe are the best based on performance , ease of use , functionality and features .
Elisa Media Center
Elisa is an Open Source cross-platform ( Linux / Windows / Mac ) media center connecting the Internet to an all - in - one media player .
Elisa Homepage How - to install Elisa Elisa Download ( Strongly recommended you install from PPA )
At first glance Elisa may appear to be very basic , but as they say , looks can be deceiving .
With a " less is more " design philosophy , it seems a lot of thought has gone into the Elisa layout .
It is streamlined with a simplistic wheel like interface , that is fast and intuitive .
Right from the start you 'll notice how easy it is to use , something you can sit your child down with and in a matter of seconds they can be watching movies or listening to music .
As with any great piece of software , Elisa just works with little effort .
Elisa runs on top of the GStreamer multimedia framework and takes full advantage of hardware acceleration provided with modern graphic cards by using OpenGL APIs .
Like most media center applications , Elisa automatically detects changes in your media library on start - up ( once configured ) .
Going out onto the Internet to scrape cover art and organizing it all in one place .
I found their method to be a little bit more elegant than other media center software I 've tried in the past , but also lacking some of the customization features such as fan art and HD backgrounds .
Overall , Elisa is a media center application done right .
Though the customization and configuration are somewhat limited .
Ease of use and a powerful feature set are an unbeatable combination , I recommend Elisa for beginners all the way to advanced user .
See here for a full list of Elisa features .
Note : Days before this article was published , the Elisa project announced an upcoming prototype for a new version .
Though I have n't had a chance to look at it yet , they promise a new interface design , quicker navigation and support for album and TV show fan art .
Not only that , but they decided on renaming the project to Moovida .
From the screen - shots alone , it looks like a step in the wrong direction , but I 'll give it a test drive and update this article accordingly .
XBMC Media Center
Originally developed for Xbox game console under the name Xbox Media Center , the XBMC team has ported their popular software to various platforms , including Linux , OSX and Windows OS .
Though not as friendly as Elisa , XBMC offers a full feature set and customization options advance users seek .
XBMC Homepage How - to install XBMC XBMC Download ( Strongly recommended you install from PPA ) XBMC
Uses its own playback engine which supports a wide range of protocols and audio / video formats .
Up - scaling any lower resolutions videos to the maximum of your display capability .
The database driven video and music library offers multiple views which help organize and filter all of your media .
Thought not on but default , it automatically fetches all artwork , fan art , synopsis & reviews on movies , plot , cast and episode information for TV shows , also album covers and artist information for music .
XBMC can download or stream Internet video and audio streams from radio stations such as Podcasts , SHOUTcast and LastFM .
Though the Linux port of XBMC still has a few minor glitches , they have one of the larger communities you can turn to for support .
Overall XBMC is the most flexible and robust Open Source Media Center .
The number of features for XBMC is absolutely huge , check them out for yourself .
Aeon Project
I do n't particularly care for the default XBMC theme .
So , for those of you that appreciate great design and aesthetics , let me introduce you to the Aeon Project .
This gorgeous interface is by far the most impressive piece of eye candy you 'll find .
Aeon developer Duncan Harris explains
Aeon as a new interface for XBMC that was built upon a very simple brief : to create an attractive , sophisticated and above all personal environment for organizing and enjoying media .
Of the many HTPC frontends in development and circulation , too many like to bombard the user with overwrought textures that draw attention away from the most important thing of all : the media itself .
Aeon 's solution is twofold .
By favoring glass and otherwise transparent panels with little in the way of " bling " , it allows digital media to express itself through its artwork .
By drawing much of its texture and colour from themed definable backdrops , which it supports either as single images or cross - faded galleries , it allows individual tastes to dominate the experience .

Environmentalist David Suzuki has received a prestigious award known as the " alternative Nobel " for his work to raise awareness about climate change .
Suzuki , 73 , received the Right Livelihood Award , along with three other activists .
The awards were established in 1980 by Swedish - German philanthropist Jakob von Uexkull to recognize work that he felt was ignored by the Nobel Prizes .
The awards , which were announced in Stockholm on Tuesday , will be presented in a ceremony at the Swedish parliament on Dec. 4 , six days before the Nobel Prizes are handed out .
Suzuki is known for his television and radio series and books about nature and the environment .
He 's also been harshly critical of governments for their lack of action on climate change .
The prize citation describes Suzuki as " one of the most brilliant scientists and communicators about science of his generation , " adding he has shown a " lifetime advocacy for the socially responsible use of science . "
He was selected for " his massive contribution to raising awareness about the perils of climate change and building public policies to address it , " the citation said .
Suzuki , who was born in Vancouver in 1936 , was sent with his family to a Japanese internment camp during the Second World War , before moving east to London , Ont. , to finish school .
He later returned to Vancouver to teach genetics at UBC in 1963 , a position he held until his retirement in 2001 .
He first joined the CBC in 1970 to launch an award - winning broadcasting career that eventually made him a household name across Canada and around the world as an outspoken proponent for protecting the environment .
Suzuki 's honorary award does not include a $ 77,000 cash prize that the three other winners will receive from the Right Livelihood Foundation .
Protecting rain forests , health , peace
Congolese activist Rene Ngongo , 48 , was honoured for his work to protect rain forests .
Ngongo founded the OCEAN environment group in 1994 , which exposed the impact of deforestation and monitored the plunder of minerals by warring factions during Congo 's 1996 - 2002 civil wars .
He also has worked for Greenpeace in Congo .
New Zealand peace activist Alyn Ware , 47 , was recognized " for his effective and creative advocacy and initiatives over two decades to further peace education and rid the world of nuclear weapons , " according to the citation .
Australian Dr. Catherine Hamlin , 85 , was honoured for her work to improve women 's health .
Hamlin moved to Ethiopia in 1959 to work as an obstetrician and gynecologist and founded a hospital where women can seek free treatment for obstetric fistulas .
" The 2009 Right Livelihood Award recipients demonstrate concretely what has to be done in order to tackle climate change , rid the world of nuclear weapons and provide crucial medical treatment to the poor and marginalized , " the foundation said in a press release .

Google is using its Google Earth mapping tool to simulate on a 3D map of the world the predicted effects of climate change until the year 2100 .
Using data provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , the search giant created new layers for Google Earth showing the range of expected temperature and precipitation changes under different global emissions scenarios that could occur throughout the century .
The new tools were introduced in partnership with the Danish Government ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Convention in December .
Known as the COP15 , the meeting in Copenhagen is shaping up as the critical venue for forging a global deal to reduce carbon emissions .
Turkish born Mehmet Ozgur is an engineer by education and profession , Mehmet is also a masterly photographer .
His work spans a substantial range of subject matter and technique , from the landscapes panorama to digital compositions and his amazing smoke works ( seen here ) .
Mehmet has mastered a technique where he can photograph tendrils of smoke and then combine them into recognizable shapes and figures through digital manipulation .
All are executed with fine precision using differing photographic manipulation techniques to achieve the desired outcomes .
Looking through his smoke works collection you will notice an enticing glow of transparencies mixed with the suggestive texture of flame – most in monochrome .
His series includes Genies and bottles , surreal clocks , feather - like waterfalls , swirling swords , and misty ocean scenery .

The blogosphere has been atwitter over the latest supposed defection of a climate scientist to the dark side .
Once again , the contrarians have been egged on by a well - timed fabrication from Marc Morano of Climate Depot , the anti-science propaganda arm of CFACT ( Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow ) .
And once again , Canadian columnist Lorne Gunter has led the charge of the lightweight brigade , with yet another error - ridden and cretinous diatribe against climate science .
[ Update , Oct. 6 : Read the post and then see the video .
Lorne Gunter stars in Climate Denial Crock of the Week : Birth of a Crock .
Peter Sinclair delivers another boffo smash . ]
Even well - meaning and thoughtful commentators and reporters have misinterpreted the recent comments and work of Mojib Latif , the Kiel University climate scientist whose remarks at a session on prediction at the World Climate Conference in Geneva set off the latest furor .
Somehow those writers have managed to overlook the fact that Latif , despite projecting less near - term warming than most climate modellers , is still looking for warming close to 0.2 deg .
C in the coming decade .
But those gaffes are nothing compared to the horrendous distortions of the initial confused accounts now circulating throughout the contrarian echo chamber , where literally hundreds of websites and blogs have echoed Morano ’s and Gunter ’s gross misrepresentations .
It ’s high time to correct the record , which I will endeavour to do with the kind assistance of Mojib Latif himself , who has been most generous in answering my queries ( our complete exchange can be found here ) .
Read the following sequence of quotes and weep :
Sept . 1 : It may well happen that you enter a decade , or maybe even two , when the temperature cools , relative to the present level .
– Mojib Latif at World Climate Conference in Geneva
It a decade , or maybe even two , when the temperature cools , relative to the present level .

Sept. 5 : UN Fears ( More ) Global Cooling Commeth !

UN Fears ( More ) Global Cooling Commeth !
IPCC Scientist Warns UN : ‘ one or even 2 decades during which temps cool ’ – Marc Morano , Climate Depot ( CFACT ) Sept. 19 : Latif conceded … that we are likely entering “ one or even two decades during which temperatures cool . ” – Lorne Gunter , Calgary Herald .
Latif conceded … that “ one or even two decades during which temperatures cool . ” – Lorne Gunter , Calgary Herald .
Sept. 25 : Mojib Latif of Kiel University in Germany told a UN conference earlier this month that he is now predicting global cooling for several decades .
– Marc Morano , Climate Depot ( CFACT ) .
Sept. 28 : 1240 hits , and counting , for the Google search “ Latif ” “ likely entering one or even two decades during which temperatures cool ”
The first step in this sorry story , of course , was the misunderstanding of Latif ’s remarks by Fred Pearce , in the New Scientist article entitled “ World ’s climate could cool first , warm later ” .
As explained in the careful dissection of Latif ’s original remarks at the ThingsBreak blog , Latif ’s hypothetical cautionary situation was misinterpreted as an actual prediction , concerning the coming decade .
This excerpt from Latif ’s presentation makes the point ( I have transcribed key portions , with three key slides , in a separate post ) :
However we all know there is variability , and this variability may look like this .
This has been actually derived from the 20th century by just removing some exponential fit …
And then the real evolution of , say , globally averaged temperature would look like this .
And then you see right away [ that ] it may well happen that you enter a decade or maybe even two , when the temperature cools relative to the present level .
So , Latif extracted the exponential fit from the 20th century , extended the curve into the 21st , and then simulated some variability around that curve , in order to illustrate the point that , theoretically at least , one could have one or even two decades of cooling .
( Of course , the displayed curve can in no way be mistaken for the actual temperature curve of the 20th century , nor any published projection or prediction in the 21st century – unless there ’s one out there that includes a super - volcano around 2030 ! )
In fact , the actual projection discussed much later in the same session by Latif does not even call for cooling in the coming decade as a whole , but rather estimates 0.18C warming relative to the last decade .
( I have more on this below , but the impatient among you can have an advance peek at this figure summarizing Keenlyside et al 2008 projections on which co-author Latif based his discussion ) .
To be sure , Pearce is not the only one to have misunderstood this work .
Andy Revkin has also had problems coming to grips with it , as pointed out by Joe Romm last year and last week , and discussed here at Deep Climate recently .
New Scientist itself had previously published a confused report on Keenlyside et al .
( And what are we make of Pearce ’s statement that “ more and more agree that the short - term prognosis for climate change is much less certain ” , when the proffered evidence is … the very same study Latif presented ! )
Marc Morano was only too happy to add to the the confusion , as only Morano can , and actually claimed with a straight face that Latif had said world “ is about to enter ‘ one maybe 2 decades where temps cool ' ” [ sic ] .
Not “ could ” or “ might ” or even “ likely ” – just a bald , flatout assertion .
More recently , that lie ( what other word is there ? ) was expanded to have Latif “ predicting global cooling for several decades ” .
Apparently , the coming period of cooling is growing faster than Pinnochio ’s nose .
Things really careened out of control once Lorne Gunter got hold of the story .
Gunter , who ca n’t seem to write a single paragraph on climate science without getting something wrong ( for instance here , here and here ) , goes through an elaborate teasing setup .
Latif ’s change of heart , Gunter explains , is like the Pope deciding that priests should be allowed to marry after all , or , even less likely , that “ rock - em - sock - em ” hockey analyst Don Cherry has all of a sudden taken a liking to European style hockey ( hey , this is Canada ) .
Finally , we get to Gunter ’s version of what Latif said ( apparently based on the New Scientist article , with a possible assist from Morano ) :
Latif conceded the Earth has not warmed for nearly a decade and that we are likely entering “ one or even two decades during which temperatures cool . ”
There is so much wrong with this that one hardly knows where to start .
First note the differences from Pearce ’s version :
One of the world ’s top climate modellers said Thursday we could be about to enter one or even two decades during which temperatures cool .
So where Pearce had “ could be about to enter ” , Gunter has “ likely entering ” , transforming a possibility , hypothetical at that , into likelihood .
And somehow Pearce ’s paraphrase has become the exact words out of Latif ’s mouth in Gunter ’s version .
Not only that , but the supposed “ concession ” by Latif concerning the past decade is not found at all in the New Scientist article or in Latif ’s presentation ; that appears to be a fabrication from whole cloth .
( In fact , as we shall see later Pearce actually refers to the “ strong warming ” of the past three decades , in direct contradiction to Gunter ’s assertion . )
You think that ’s bad ?
Look at this paragraph from Gunter , containing his only other supposed Latif direct quote :
But as Latif pointed out , the Atlantic , and particularly the North Atlantic , has been cooling instead .
And it looks set to continue a cooling phase for 10 to 20 more years .
“ How much ? ” he wondered before the assembled delegates .
“ The jury is still out . ” ….
Latif says he expects warming to resume in 2020 or 2030 .
Now here ’s the same direct quote from the New Scientist – but somehow in a totally different context :
Breaking with climate - change orthodoxy , he said NAO [ North Atlantic Oscillation ] cycles were probably responsible for some of the strong global warming seen in the past three decades .
“ But how much ?
The jury is still out , ” he told the conference .
The NAO is now moving into a colder phase .
So Gunter claims that Latif projects Atlantic cooling for another 10 to 20 years , another apparent fabrication , and that warming might only resume in 2030 .
But in fact , Latif only projects moderated warming up to 2015 .
And the Latif quote in New Scientist was actually about possible attribution of past warming , not future cooling !
Latif did say in his presentation that the North Atlantic Oscillation , and therefore North Atlantic sea temperatures , could be predicted with “ significant skill out to ten , maybe even twenty years . ”
But he presented no actual prediction of Atlantic cooling for up to twenty years .
( Once again , New Scientist ’s Pearce is closer , but not quite there : according to Latif the “ jury is out ” on the “ relative contribution ” of “ internal variability ” in general ) .
As I mentioned above , I decided to analyze the Keenlyside et al 2008 projections presented by Latif ( Nature abstract here ) , since there has been so much misinformation on the subject .
At the same time , I entered into correspondence with Latif , who kindly has given me permission to publish our exchange ( see the companion post ) .
Here is the key figure from that study , marked up to highlight the projections for each of the decades 2000 - 10 , 2010 - 20 , and 2020 - 30 .
The chart features a forecast curve based on interpolation between particular decadal projections .
Each decade is centred on the corresponding year , so that the projection at 2015 , corresponds to the decade 2010 - 2020 , for example .
Somewhat confusingly , that also means that the decadal projections are overlapping ( e.g. 2010 is for 2005 - 2015 ) .
As can be seen by the chart above , a flat period is projected to about 2015 , but in subsequent decades strong global warming resumes ( the figure is interpolated between decades centred at 2010 and 2020 , and thus no precise time of resumption is given ) .
Of course , this chart clearly shows that the moderate warming projected for the past decade has been surpassed by a long shot , and a brief cooling period in 1995 - 2004 did not happen either .
These observations were made at RealClimate.org at the time the study was released ; the same commentary noted that the projection also seem to suffer from oscillations due to “ coupling shock ” .
But for our purposes the coming two decades are just as important ; in contrast with Gunter ’s characterization of “ likely ” cooling over the next decade “ or even two ” , Keenlyside and Latif project 0.18C in the coming decade , and 0.35C in the one after that !
Gunter could not have gotten it more wrong .
For greater clarity , I have plotted the projections , but this time without overlapping decades , including a hindcast for the 1990s .
And I have also put in HadCRU decadal observations for the past two decades , leaving off a half - year for the current decade .
In response to my initial query , Latif summarized his remarks as follows :
What I said is that the cooling in the Atlantic and Pacific may offset global warming for a decade so that there may be not much of an additional warming .
…
I also pointed out that the British group issued a competing forecast for the next decade .
They predict that global warming will continue at the rate of the last decades .
Thus there is quite some uncertainty about the short - term evolution .
Yet we all agree that in the long run , say by 2050 and thereafter , the earth will considerably warm , if we do not considerably reduce global greenhouse gas emissions .
Note that this is clearly not an expectation of cooling in the near term , but rather considerably reduced warming .
I went on to present the decadal projections and the differences calculated , as seen above .
Latif provided the following comments :
This is all correct .
However , our forecast more than one decade ahead does not have much skill , as we know from hindcasts ( retropsective forecasts ) .
I think what is important to convey is that there are short - term fluctuations which are superimposed on the long - term warming trend .
Exactly .
And clearly a precise time for resumption of warming can not be fixed in the Keenlyside / Latif model .
Nevertheless , the forecasts beyond one decade ( i.e. beyond 2015 ) call for strong warming in the long term and any uncertainties may cut either way :
We showed the graph more than a decade ahead to see how long the effect of the initial conditions lasts .
It is a forecast , but as I pointed out , we do not have much skill at longer lead times .
It may well be that the warming will be even stronger .
And , of course , it must be emphasized that this view of reduced warming for the next few years is far from accepted among the majority of climate modelers , as Latif himself has always acknowledged .
So far , observations seem to show considerably more warming than projected by Keenlyside and Latif .
So where does that leave us ?
A week ago I left a comment at the Calgary Herald requesting corrections of the most egregious errors , although now that I ’ve had a chance to examine and document all of Gunter ’s falsehoods , it seems that a complete retraction would be appropriate in this case .
However , Gunter usually writes for the Herald ’s sister newspapers the Edmonton Journal and the National Post ( all part of the CanWest Global media chain ) .
In the past the Journal has corrected Gunter ’s factual mistakes , albeit very slowly , while the Post has refused to do so .
Will the Herald , like the Journal , do the right thing ?
Or will it stonewall , like the Post ?
As Latif himself might say , the jury is still out .
The sad and disturbing facts are these : PR disinformation specialists like Marc Morano and complaisant columnists like Lorne Gunter are lying to us about climate science .
Those lies are getting wide circulation through media outlets such as FoxNews and the National Post , and at their base are part of a clearly illegitimate campaign to influence politicians and the public , paid for by well - hidden fossil - fuel interests .
Meanwhile , outside the contrarian echo chamber , there is an eerie and disturbing silence concerning those facts in the mainstream press .
Why is that ?
And is n’t it time that changed ?
Hey kids !
Try this at home .
Pour clean water onto a small plate .
Wait for all the ripples to stop .
Then mix a small amount of mineral oil with an even smaller amount of detergent .
Squeeze a tiny drop of that mixture onto the water and watch in amazement as the oil appears to pump like a beating heart .
It 's a simple experiment , but explaining what makes the drop of oil throb - - and then stop when deprived of fresh air -- has long mystified the scientific community .
Now , in work that could have applications in fields from biology to environmental engineering , an MIT team has cracked the case .
In the July 25 issue of the Journal of Fluid Mechanics , MIT Professors Roman Stocker of civil and environmental engineering and John Bush of mathematics explain what happens when an oil drop containing a water - insoluble surfactant ( or material that reduces the surface tension of a liquid , allowing easier spreading ) is placed on a water surface .
" It 's an easy experiment to make .
But getting the theory for it was not straightforward , " Bush said .
" Roman turned a microscope loose on the problem -- which was key to finally understanding it . "
The question of the physical phenomenon of oil spreading on a surface has been around for some time .
Benjamin Franklin wrote about it in 1774 in the Transaction of the American Philosophical Society , after he saw Bermuda spear fishermen use oil to damp waves so they could more easily see fish under the ocean surface .
The question Stocker and Bush examined had another dimension : why oil with an added surfactant does n't come to rest , but instead contracts and repeats the process in a periodic fashion .
The mechanism , they now know , is surface tension , or more precisely , evaporation - induced variations in surface tension .
These changes in surface tension cause the drop to expand , then contract , and repeat the process every couple of seconds until it runs out of gas , which in this case , is surfactant .
Covering the experiment stops the process because it prevents evaporation of the surfactant .
" We 're dealing with three interfaces : between the oil drop , the water in the Petri dish , and the air above it , " Stocker said , explaining surface tension .
" A detergent is a surfactant , which reduces the surface tension of a liquid .
The detergent molecules we added to the oil drop prefer to stay at the interface of the oil and water , rather than inside the oil drop . "
Think of the oil detergent drop as a small lens with a rounded bottom .
The surfactant in the drop moves to the bottom surface of the lens , where it interacts with the water to decrease the surface tension where oil meets water .
This change in tension increases the forces pulling on the outer edges of the drop , causing the drop to expand .
The center of the drop is deeper than the edges , so more surfactant settles there , reducing the surface tension correspondingly .
This causes the oil and surfactant near the outer edges of the drop to circulate .
This circulation creates a shear ( think of it as two velocities going in opposite directions ) , which generates very tiny waves rolling outward toward the edge .
When these waves reach the edge , they cause small droplets to erupt and escape onto the water surface outside the drop .
Videomicroscopy - essentially , attaching a video camera to a microscope - was critical in observing this step in the process .
Those droplets of oil and surfactant disperse on the water and decrease the surface tension of the water surface , so the drop contracts .
As the surfactant evaporates , the surface tension of the water increases again , and the system is reset .
Forces pull at the outer edges of the lens , and the cyclical process begins again .
But the beating ceases instantly when Stocker and Bush put a lid over it .
If the surfactant can't evaporate , the oil drop remains stable .
In the end , it was being able to stop the beating process that made it clear to the researchers that evaporation played a central role in the mechanism .
" This is a bizarre and subtle mechanism .
Everybody was flummoxed , " said Bush , whose recent research includes understanding how some insects walk on water .
He first heard about the oil drop phenomenon from Professor Emeritus Harvey Greenspan of mathematics , who had pondered it for some time .
Bush in turn talked to Stocker , who was then an instructor in the Department of Mathematics .
It took about three years of sporadic work ( without funding ) , and the help of two undergraduate students who carried out the lab repetitions -- Margaret Avener and Wesley Koo -- but Stocker and Bush finally solved it .
To what end , the researchers do n't yet know .
" One rationalizes the physical world by understanding the mechanisms , " said Bush , explaining the importance of basic scientific research .
" One can never predict which mechanisms will be important . "
" Oil contamination of water resources is a prominent problem in environmental engineering , " said Stocker .
" Awareness of the fundamental mechanisms governing the interaction between the two phases is critical to devise sound engineering solutions for remediation . "
Spontaneous oscillations are observed in many natural systems , including nerve cells , muscle tissue , and the biological clocks responsible for circadian rhythms , the professors said .
And previous work published on the oil drop problem had been carried out by scientists interested in seeing if the mechanism could explain biological oscillations .
Say what you will about the films he has come up with , you have to respect Eli Roth ’s love for the craft .
As reported in The Hollywood Reporter , he is currently developing / working on three , different projects , all of them in more than just the “ idea ” phase .
First up is ‘ Thanksgiving , ’ which has been gestating ever since Roth directed the faux trailer for ‘ Grindhouse . ’
Roth is currently penning the screenplay for a full version of the film , a concept Robert Rodriguez has already turned to with ‘ Machete . ’
Roth plans to direct , produce , and possibly star in the film .
However , that ’s not what is next up for Roth .
He said at the Morelia International Film Festival on Monday that he has finished work on a sci- fi screenplay titled ‘ Endangered Species . ’
This would mark his return to the director ’s chair after a number of years acting and producing .
Also in development for Roth is ‘ The Man With the Iron Fist , ’ a martial arts film that is being developed with the RZA .
Says Roth about his new projects :
Peering far beyond our solar system , NASA researchers have detected the basic chemistry for life in a second hot gas planet , advancing astronomers toward the goal of being able to characterize planets where life could exist .
The planet is not habitable but it has the same chemistry that , if found around a rocky planet in the future , could indicate the presence of life .
"
It 's the second planet outside our solar system in which water , methane and carbon dioxide have been found , which are potentially important for biological processes in habitable planets , " said researcher Mark Swain of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
" Detecting organic compounds in two exoplanets now raises the possibility that it will become commonplace to find planets with molecules that may be tied to life .
" Swain and his co-investigators used data from two of NASA 's orbiting Great Observatories , the Hubble Space Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope , to study HD 209458 b , a hot , gaseous giant planet bigger than Jupiter that orbits a sun-like star about 150 light years away in the constellation Pegasus .
The new finding follows their breakthrough discovery in December 2008 of carbon dioxide around another hot , Jupiter - size planet , HD 189733 b .
Earlier Hubble and Spitzer observations of that planet had also revealed water vapor and methane .
The detections were made through spectroscopy , which splits light into its components to reveal the distinctive spectral signatures of different chemicals .
Data from Hubble 's near - infrared camera and multi-object spectrometer revealed the presence of the molecules , and data from Spitzer 's photometer and infrared spectrometer measured their amounts .
" This demonstrates that we can detect the molecules that matter for life processes , " said Swain .
Astronomers can now begin comparing the two planetary atmospheres for differences and similarities .
For example , the relative amounts of water and carbon dioxide in the two planets is similar , but HD 209458 b shows a greater abundance of methane than HD 189733b .
" The high methane abundance is telling us something , " said Swain .
" It could mean there was something special about the formation of this planet .
" Other large , hot Jupiter - type planets can be characterized and compared using existing instruments , Swain said .
This work will lay the groundwork for the type of analysis astronomers eventually will need to perform in shortlisting any promising rocky Earth - like planets where the signatures of organic chemicals might indicate the presence of life .
Rocky worlds are expected to be found by NASA 's Kepler mission , which launched earlier this year , but astronomers believe we are a decade or so away from being able to detect any chemical signs of life on such a body .
If and when such Earth - like planets are found in the future , " the detection of organic compounds will not necessarily mean there 's life on a planet , because there are other ways to generate such molecules , " Swain said .
" If we detect organic chemicals on a rocky , Earth - like planet , we will want to understand enough about the planet to rule out non-life processes that could have led to those chemicals being there .
" " These objects are too far away to send probes to , so the only way we 're ever going to learn anything about them is to point telescopes at them .
Spectroscopy provides a powerful tool to determine their chemistry and dynamics .

The Zune as we know it is going the way of the dodo , and its replacement is of course the Zune HD .
" As you know , the new Zune HD device — featuring a touch OLED screen , HD Radio , HD video out capabilities , Internet browser and more — is available for preorder now and will be available at retail on September 15 , " a Microsoft spokesperson told Ars.
" Additional flash Zune devices ( Zune 4GB , 8GB and 16GB ) and hard drive devices ( 80 GB and 120 GB ) will continue to be available at retail until sold out , though we will not continue to manufacture those devices . "
The spokesperson also touted Microsoft 's upcoming Zune software and service and the arrival of Zune video on Xbox Live this autumn .
The software giant intends to provide a " great entertainment experience through software and services across multiple screens and devices . "
When Ars asked if the Zune 4.0 software would be available for the old Zunes , the Microsoft spokesperson said " yes " and also noted that more details about updates to the software will be revealed soon .
In terms of firmware for the old Zunes , Ars was told that Microsoft " will also continue to provide updates for previous devices as they are needed for stability . "
The SuperSite Blog was first to break the news , reporting that all of the current Zunes are being discontinued .
The fate of the smaller Zunes was sealed when Microsoft officially detailed the Zune HD in May 2009 .
In August 2009 , the Flash - based Zunes ( Zune 4 , Zune 8 , and Zune 16 ) disappeared from the Zune Store and Zune Originals , leaving only the HDD - based Zune 80 and Zune 120 .
Naturally , suspicions were raised to sky - high levels .
The store still looks as it did last month , but now we know that it 's worse than just the Flash - based Zunes being discontinued ; all Zunes will be gone once the stock runs out .
This is a very risky move on Microsoft 's part .
We learned in August 2009 that the 16GB version will be priced at $ 220 and the 32 GB will go for $ 290 .
What if someone wants more than 32GB ?
Sure , there 's a rumored 64GB version coming later , but some users want even more than that .
What if someone wants a Zune but does n't want to spend more than $ 200 ?
What if they want a smaller device , both in size and capacity ?
Recall that the original Zune 30 GB is considered first generation , that the Zune 4 , Zune 8 , and Zune 80 are considered second generation , and that the Zune 16 and Zune 120 are considered third generation .
When the Zune 30 was discontinued , some consumers were unhappy , but they could n't get very vocal because there was a mere $ 20 difference between the Zune 16 and Zune 80 .
Discontinuing the Zune 30 made sense .
This time around , however , Microsoft 's strategy is questionable .
We all knew that hard drive - based media players would be phased out sooner or later , and it 's completely possible that a 128GB version of the Zune HD , possibly a second - generation , will see the light of day eventually .
The move is understandable on the right side of the spectrum .
On the lower end though , it 's not as clear as to what Microsoft is going for .
A Zune HD that is smaller and cheaper than the 16GB simply wo n't cut it for the sake of the touchscreen and the accompanying apps .
Also , Microsoft might simply think that 4GB and 8GB sizes will no longer be wanted in a few months ( those who like to run with small MP3 players will of course disagree ) .
Finally , it may be simply that Microsoft just does n't want to keep supporting the Zune in its current form and that it sees the Zune HD as a much more profitable beast .
The Zune HD has a lot of potential , but Microsoft has significantly slimmed down the Zune 's potential market — especially with its biggest competitor , Apple , selling audio players in sizes ranging from 4GB to 120GB .
Microsoft believes it 's making a precise surgical slice , but it may just be shooting itself in the foot by giving would - be Zune owners fewer choices .
( CNN ) -- A Long Island , New York , social worker is facing two misdemeanor charges after allegedly posting a sexually suggestive ad on Craigslist that gave interested parties the home phone number of a 9 - year - old girl .
The sexually suggestive ad allowed parties to get a number for a 9 - year - old girl .
According to prosecutors , Margery Tannenbaum posted the ad to get revenge after an argument between her daughter and the girl , who attend the same school in Hauppauge , New York .
On Thursday , Tannenbaum was arraigned on charges of aggravated harassment and endangering the welfare of a minor .
She pleaded not guilty and will appear in court later this month .
Officials told CNN affiliate News 12 in Long Island that the Craigslist ad read " I need a little affection ...
I 'm blond , I 'm cute and I 'll be waiting . "
Interested parties were directed to an e-mail address where they were given the girl 's name and home phone number .
Callers were unaware they were trying to reach a 9 - year - old .
According to Suffolk County authorities , the mother of the girl intercepted calls before her daughter answered .
She said she received 22 calls in one day , in all around 40 calls from various men who saw the ad , including some seeking an escort service .
After Craigslist was issued a subpoena , authorities said they were able to track the account to Tannenbaum .
In court documents read aloud by Suffolk District Attorney Tom Spota , the 9 - year - old 's mother described one of the phone calls she received from a man responding to the ad .
She said , " This is her mother .
Can I help you ? "
The male replied , " Oh . Hot lady lives with foxy mamma ? "
The caller hung up after the girl 's mother told him the " hot girl " he was referring to was 9 years old .
When asked about the case , Tannenbaum 's attorney , Tad Scharfenberg , said , " I think this has been blown out of proportion to what the actual alleged act was . "
He described Tannenbaum as " a well - loved woman by both family and friends , " and said she was a classroom mom at her daughter 's school .
" She 's never been in any trouble for anything before , " Scharfenberg said .
" She 's just really upset by the whole thing .
Her biggest concern has always been that this not materially affect the victim or her child .
She wants to make sure the way it 's being handled does n't make that worse . "
In an interview with News 12 , the victim 's mother said she was " horrified . "
" It 's scary to think that someone would take any issue and attack your child . "

1941 : The Smith - Putnam Wind Turbine feeds AC power to the electric grid , the first wind machine ever to do so .
The unprecedented project was built up from nothing , practically conjured , by Palmer Putnam , an MIT - trained geologist with no formal education or experience in wind power .
He was a fascinating character , a clean - energy entrepreneur 70 years ahead of his time .
Vannevar Bush , President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's science adviser , showered praise on this engineer - of - all - trades , calling Putnam a " go - getter " in his autobiography and noting that he " had some of the characteristics of the best type of promoter in industry .
He was well - liked by men with lots of drive , and often disliked by those with less . "
His friends called him Put , after the Greatest Generation–traditions of the day .
Before this project , windmills had just pumped water for farmers in the boonies , or charged the batteries of rural radios so they could pick up the AM stations that brought news across the lonely , whistling prairies .
The people who sold windmills marketed them to ranchers and farmers ; their advertisements appeared in magazines like American Thresherman , Farm Power , Agricultural Technology and Successful Farming .
The American windmill , as it was called , was simple and Western and rugged .
Its shape hardly changed after key 1880s experiments by Thomas Perry resulted in the founding of the Aermotor company , which dominated the industry thereafter .
But that 's not the kind of turbine that Putnam had in mind .
After looking into the designs of the past , he immediately decided that the economics of scale dictated that he build a wind turbine with 75 - foot blades , the largest in the world .
It would generate more than a megawatt of power and feed it on to the grid , working in tandem with a hydroelectric plant to even out the intermittency of the wind and the seasonality of water generation .
No one had ever pulled off that balancing act before , and most people working in the wind industry were probably too sane to try .
It 's important to understand how ridiculously grand the project really was .
Its scale — 10 times as powerful as the very largest turbine and a thousand times more powerful than most of them — was almost unimaginable .
To plan an equally ambitious project today would mean setting out to build a machine that pumps out 65 megawatts .
This was a small group of inventors ' attempt to make a leap into a different future with breakthrough technology .
The construction of such a novel machine was lousy with difficulties , some internal and many external .
The exigencies of a country preparing for war caused delays and trouble .
The inventors ' desire to finish and monetize the turbine before the war reached the United States may have accelerated the pace of R&D beyond what prudence would have dictated .
The strange thing is : Putnam succeeded .
" Vermont 's mountain winds were harnessed last week to generate electricity for its homes and factories , " read the Sept. 8 , 1941 , issue of Time , jumping the gun a bit .
" Slowly , like the movements of an awakening giant , two stainless - steel vanes — the size and shape of a bomber 's wings — began to rotate . "
The turbine ran through hundreds of hours of testing up to 1943 , often pumping power onto the Central Vermont Public Service Corporation 's electrical grid .
The project 's engineers were sure that , technically , the machine worked .
The Smith - Putnam wind turbine stood as a testament to the power of human — and American — ingenuity .
A decade before , Soviet engineers had built the world 's largest wind turbine , a 100 - kilowatt machine .
Now the Yanks had constructed their own , 10 times more powerful .
Time concluded its article on the project with a hopeful half - prediction , " New England ranges may someday rival Holland as a land of windmills . "
This was , after all , merely the prototype for whole lines of turbines that would be more resistant to German bombs than a centralized coal plant .
Unluckily , a bearing broke in 1943 , and the war prevented its replacement until 1945 .
With the war waning , the wind machine got back up and running in the spring of that year .
And that 's when disaster struck .
At midnight on March 26 , 1945 , the wind was blowing at a sleepy 5 miles an hour , too slow to make electricity .
Harold Perry , a construction foreman , had been working nonstop for the 23 grueling days since the renewable power plant had gone back online after repairs .
That night , an elevator carried Perry 100 feet up through the oil - derrick –like tower to the small , armored building that housed the controls for the world 's largest wind machine .
Atop the rural Vermont mountaintop known as Grandpa 's Knob , Perry did n't know that the grandest wind experiment in the first few millennia of human existence was about to fail .
Perry 's job was to watch over the turbine and make sure that everything ran smoothly .
The turbine had built - in methods for " coning " out of the wind to keep it from spinning too quickly , but it seemed like a good idea to have someone around … just in case .
During the day , Perry could stand behind the rotating blades in a flannel shirt and a hardhat , staring out at the unspoiled expanses of rural New England .
Old films show the blades — the bomber wing look - alikes — beating a rhythmic , majestic whomp - whomp right in front of his face .
At night , however , he could n't see much out there .
The wind was picking up .
At exactly 3:10 a.m. on March 26 , 1945 , after more than 1,100 hours of operation , the Smith - Putnam turbine experienced an epic failure .
One of the turbine 's blades broke clean off and went sailing 750 feet through the night .
The force of the breaking blade threw Perry off his feet , as the unbalanced machine shook like the bridge of the Starship Enterprise when it 's under attack .
Putnam dramatized the scene in his book on the project , Power from the Wind :
Suddenly he found himself on his face on the floor , jammed against one wall of the control room .
He got to his knees and was straightening up to start for the control panel , when he was again thrown to the floor .
He collected himself , got off the floor , hurled his solid 225 pounds over the rotating 24 - inch main shaft , reached the controls , and brought the unit to a full stop in about 10 seconds by rapidly feathering what was found to be the remaining blade of the turbine .
A photo taken the next day shows the enormous blade on the ground , men walking and crawling near it like the Lilliputians around Gulliver .
The book 's caption reads simply , " The Blade That Failed . "
It 's easy to see catastrophic failure in the Smith - Putnam turbine .
What went wrong is as obvious as a 75 - foot blade lying on the ground .
The existence and failure of the turbine hurt renewable - energy advocates in political debates , too .
At congressional hearings in 1951 to provide increased wind - power funding , one historian notes , " [ L]egislators considered Putnam 's blade failure to have proved the whole endeavor a washout . "
The machine 's failure played right into the hands of those committed to other forms of electrical production : fossil , atomic or solar .
Putnam himself later advocated the use of atomic and solar power to replace fossil fuels in the long run .
He devoted only a few dismissive sentences to the potential of wind power in a sweeping energy analysis he wrote for the Atomic Energy Commission in the early 1950s .
But the turbine was n't a failure for the thousands of wind engineers who 've come after Putnam .
" Interest in developing large wind - electric generating systems in the United States was stimulated primarily by one man , Palmer C. Putnam , " a crisis - induced 1973 NASA research report on alternative energy found .
Putnam might have failed , but he failed well .
He created data on which inventors could build the future .
In a startlingly progressive move , the S. Morgan Smith Company , which had bankrolled the project , assigned their patents to the public domain and asked Putnam to write a book detailing what happened , so that others could continue the work .
They made the wind data they 'd gathered from the region public .
This turns out to have been immensely helpful to later generations .
Without the unique experiment , nothing would have been known about large - scale systems .
Less data means more risk — and risk is expensive in big power - plant projects .
By gathering data on what did and did n't work , Putnam saved time and money for subsequent researchers .
Now , an entire industry stands partially on Putnam 's shoulders :
In 2008 , wind employed more people than coal mining .
The economic crisis is now causing a shakeout in green industry , separating the winners from the losers .
In some cases , it 's because the technologies are n't working or are n't scaling up .
But it 's not always an engineering issue .
Business problems , exacerbated by the recession , are foreclosing some technological possibilities before they have a chance to play out .
A bad economy combined with a glut of companies combined to likewise devastate the green - tech industry in the mid-1980s .
Given the likelihood that the vast majority of today 's VC - backed green - tech companies will fail , even if some succeed wildly , it 's troubling that data - sharing remains rare .
What will happen to the data from failed wind and solar companies ?
Unlike the Smith - Putnam turbine , they might take the key to the next breakthrough to their corporate graves .
Despite Putnam 's initial hopes , his turbine was never rebuilt , nor any more on its exact model .
Within six months of the catastrophic blade failure , the S. Morgan Smith Company shut down its wind program .
They pulled the plug instead of plunking down the additional $ 300,000 that Putnam needed .
The blade was carted off , the turbine torn down .
A cellphone tower now adorns Grandpa 's Knob .
Only the foundation of the great wind machine remains .

September 17 , 2009 — Alderson Warm - Fork
So a few days ago there was a huge march in the USA by people who are opposed to something – it may be socialised healthcare , it may be the bailouts , it may be the democrats , it maybe ‘ big government ’ , and it definitely seems to involve Obama .
It ’s an intriguing phenomenon , and I thought I might devote a few words to it .
After all , at least two things seem to suggest , at first glance , a kinship between me and them : some manner of ‘ opposition to government per se ’ , and some manner of fondness for tea .
On the first point , consider an account of the march here ( found via Sociological Images ) : what is particularly of note is this :
“ I would say that the spine of this protest is not any well considered opposition to health care , but to taxes , and to the idea of government itself … one theme that seems to be emerging …is that there is no difference between Obama and George W. Bush …
When they protest big government , ” they are not Republicans , or even conservatives in the conventional sense of the word .
They are defenders of personal liberty against a one party state linked to a secret global system , a state that floods a nation of good white working people with illegal immigrants and freeloading welfare cheats ”
Now , of course this can be overstated – a commenter says , correctly , “ These people are n’t anarchists ” – before going on , bafflingly , to say “ and we should be thankful for that .
Then they ’d be really dangerous . ”
‘ Really dangerous ’ here presumably means something like ‘ having a smaller history of violence against civilian persons than almost any other political grouping , and far less than most of the tendencies that were manifested at the march ’ .
But anyway .
Anarchists are already bedevilled by the need to differentiate themselves from anarcho - capitalists , who also use the same term , ‘ freedom ’ , in what amounts to a very different way .
To understand how people who I would likely disagree with on pretty much all particular points of politics can raise what seem like formally similar cries requires , I think , unpacking what psychologically terms like ‘ freedom ’ mean to different people .
‘ Freedom ’ has of course the connotation of something which is currently held back and restrained – what is this thing ?
We might note that those who ‘ oppress ’ it here are not just those with access to the means of repression , but also people like the unemployed , illegal immigrants , petty criminals , single mothers , homosexuals , and certainly the various latte - drinking academics who spout cultural relativism and atheist indoctrination .
( Often , it needs to be admitted , these categories carry a big racial load – immigrants obviously , and what colour are the ‘ criminals ’ and ‘ welfare cheats ’ ?
But they ’re not purely racial categories , I think , and the ‘ racism ’ issue has got a lot of attention so I want to steer somewhat away from that . )
What does this rag - tag assembly actually threaten ?
The association with government ( corrupt politicians ! fascism !) allows this question to be somewhat blurred – the plausible image of the secret police kicking down the door in the night can be ‘ superimposed ’ , in preference to the faintly comical idea of the homosexuals and single mothers kicking down the door in the middle of the night .
But we can push this to one side – what is the threat from homosexuals and single - mothers themselves ?
One of the threats is to devalue and disenfranchise hard work – the immigrants , the welfare queens , the academics , all are being paid but not working .
Part of this might be simply a rational desire to not be taxed for other ’s benefit , but the thing is that the real fiscal cost of , say , welfare cheats , is much less than the cost of tax - avoidance and / or evasion , the cost of the military , the cost of all manner of things .
The selection of targets for this ‘ thriftiness ’ demands explanation .
What distinguishes the targets of this ire is not so much that they cost the right - wing protester money , but that they steal the prestige of work .
If you survive without working ( or if you do n’t , but are perceived as doing so ) , you symbolically undermine the idea that work is respected and rewarded – and psychologically ( with whatever basis in fact ) , the right - wing protester is a ‘ hard - working ’ person .
Another major theme of course is that many of the targets disrupt and devalue the status of the family , and its associated ‘ regime of sex ’ .
If children can be raised without a father , fatherhood is devalued ; if men and women can both have sex with men and women , then manhood and womanhood mean less .
If sex is more widespread , marriage is less important – especially is sex can be engaged in without resulting in pregnancy .
If people can enter the country illegally and survive , citizenship is devalued ; indeed , ‘ the nation ’ becomes a less determinate notion .
‘ We ’ might even become a minority in ‘ our own ’ country !
Broadly speaking , then , we might sum it up like this : the motley crowd of those despised by the right - wing protesters are all threats to certain facts being true – by their very existence they destabilise the symbolic equations that structure the family , the nation , the community , the economy , the careers , the sex lives , of many people .
Sometimes this is expressed directly by saying that these people themselves are ‘ a threat to civilisation ’ and will ‘ destroy society ’ corrosively , like an acid or a rot .
Very often , it is expressed through the language of that central figure among the undesirables : communists .
COOOOMMMMUNISTS .
They ’re under your bed !
Here all the themes merge : communists want to abolish private property in defense of the feckless and lazy ; they want to disband the nuclear family in defense of genderqueers and sexual deviants ; perhaps worst of all , they want to mingle the races , destroy ‘ whiteness ’ and ‘ blackness ’ as meaningful categories .
As Lenin ’s Tomb says : race mixing IS communism .
And of course communism adds political bite – it seeks the organised power to make things happen .
Which brings us to the third form of expression : through transferring these symbolic anxieties onto the figure of a government which is perceived to be ‘ on their side ’ , and thus becomes ‘ tyrannical ’ in a way that it would not be if it were ‘ on our side ’ , ‘ defending our freedoms ’ .
And there ’s that word again , ‘ freedom ’ .
What does ‘ freedom ’ mean here ?
It means , I think , precisely that set of symbolic equations ( hard work will earn me a reward , the family will give me a role and status , my group - membership will give me authority , etc. ) , presented as defining the natural individual .
That is , the ‘ inner person ’ who is ‘ born free ’ , and ‘ born equal ’ , is the person defined by this set of equations .
In consequence , this person ’s freedom is quite literally threatened by the mere existence of various groups of undesirables .
It is often suggested byleft and liberal commentators are ‘ voting against their own interests ’ .
But there ’s a perfectly real sense in which someone here is voting for their most direct interests – indeed to save their lives .
That ‘ real inner person ’ , defined through those symbolic equations , acts entirely rationally in lashing out in self - defense .
And arguably this is as ‘ real ’ an interest as many people ’s interest in ‘ having more money ’ , which is a focus of symbolic statuses as well as strictly material transactions .
Fortunately , that socially - defined - as - pre- social person is n’t strictly identical to the human individual .
The latter , after all , has the capacity to dispense with the former and redefine themselves – because they are free .
So ‘ freedom ’ means two quite different things here .
Indeed , two pretty diametrically opposed things .
On the one hand , for these tea - heaving protesters , it means the security and sense of strength that comes from the affirmation of a particular identity .
On the other hand , it can mean the creativity of being able to dispense with any given such identity , criticise identities , change your identity .
Anarchism , and other forms of socialism , are partisans of the latter ‘ freedom ’ and consequently rightly identified by tea-partiers as the most consistent enemies of ‘ freedom ’ in the other sense .
These are n’t so clearly political concepts as , say , ‘ positive and negative freedom ’ .
But it ’s psychologically very important , and I think it motivates an awful lot of politics .
And on the second point , the kinship is fairly weak , since the tea in question , being based on that dropped into the sea in the late 18th century in North America , would certainly not have been my preferred Earl Grey , which seems to have been introduced to Europe around the 1830s , at the time of the premiership of Earl Charles Grey .

Pakistan drone war takes a toll on militants — and civilians
By Peter Bergen and Katherine Tiedemann
The Obama administration has dramatically ratcheted up the American drone warfare program in Pakistan .
Since President Obama took office , U.S. drone strikes have killed about a half - dozen militant leaders along with hundreds of other people , a quarter of whom were civilians .
As a result of the unprecedented 42 strikes by drone aircraft into Pakistan authorized by the Obama administration , aimed at Taliban and al Qaeda networks based there , about a half - dozen leaders of militant organizations have been killed .
The dead include two heads of Uzbek terrorist groups allied with al Qaeda and Baitullah Mehsud , the leader of the Pakistani Taliban , in addition to hundreds of lower - level militants and civilians , according to our analysis .
The number of civilian deaths caused by the drones is an important issue , because in the charged political atmosphere of today ’s Pakistan , where anti-Americanism is rampant , the drone program is a particular cause of anger among those who see it as an infringement on Pakistan ’s sovereignty .
A Gallup poll in August found that only 9 percent of Pakistanis favored the strikes , and two - thirds opposed them .
And , according to Philip Alston , a U.N. human rights investigator , the use of drones to carry out targeted assassinations that end up killing civilians may well violate international law .
On Tuesday at a news conference in New York , Alston publicly warned that unless the Obama administration explains what the legal basis is for selecting the individuals targeted by drone attacks , “ it will increasingly be perceived as carrying out indiscriminate killings in violation of international law . ”
An important factor in the controversy over the drones , put forth by some commentators , is the widespread perception that they kill large numbers of Pakistani civilians .
Amir Mir , a leading Pakistani journalist , wrote in The News in April that since January 2006 , American drone attacks had killed “ 687 innocent Pakistani civilians . ”
A month later , a similar claim was made in the New York Times by counterinsurgency experts David Kilcullen and Andrew Exum , who wrote that drone strikes had “ killed some 700 civilians .
This is 50 civilians for every militant killed , a hit rate of 2 percent . ”
In other words , in their analysis , 98 percent of those killed in drone attacks were civilians .
Kilcullen and Exum advocated a moratorium on the strikes because of the “ public outrage ” they arouse .
A very different picture was presented this month by the Long War Journal , an American blog that closely tracks terrorist groups , in particular al Qaeda and the Taliban .
Bill Roggio , the editor of Long War Journal , concluded that according to his close analysis of the drone strikes , only 10 percent of those killed were civilians .
Our analysis suggests quite different conclusions than those of either Kilcullen and Exum or the Long War Journal .
But first , a word on our methodology .
Our analysis of the drone campaign is based only on accounts from reliable media organizations with substantial reporting capabilities in Pakistan .
We restricted our analysis to reports in the New York Times , Washington Post and Wall Street Journal ; accounts by major news services and networks — the Associated Press , Reuters , Agence France - Presse , CNN and the BBC — and reports in the leading English - language newspapers in Pakistan —
The Daily Times , Dawn and The News — as well as those from Geo TV , the largest independent Pakistani television network .
( Links to all those individual reports can be found here . )
The news organizations we relied upon collectively for our data cover the drone strikes as accurately and aggressively as possible .
And though we do n’t pretend that our study is accurate down to the last civilian death in every drone strike , we posit that our research has generated some quite reliable data on the number of militant leaders killed , a fairly good estimate of the number of lower - level militants killed and a reliable sense of the real civilian death rate .
Since 2006 , our analysis indicates , 82 U.S. drone attacks in Pakistan have killed between 760 and 1,000 people .
Among them were about 20 leaders of al Qaeda , the Taliban and allied groups , all of whom have been killed since January 2008 .
It is not possible to differentiate precisely between militant and civilian casualties , because the militants live among the population and do n’t wear uniforms and because the militants have the incentive to claim that all the casualties were civilians , but government sources tend to claim the opposite .
However , of those killed in drone attacks from 2006 through mid-October 2009 , approximately 500 to 720 were described in reliable press reports as militants , or roughly two - thirds of the total killed .
Based on our count of the estimated number of militants killed , the real total of civilian deaths since 2006 appears to be in the range of 260 to 320 , or one - third of those killed .
That finding tracks with polling by the Aryana Institute for Regional Research and Advocacy , described by The News of Pakistan as “ a think tank of researchers and political activists ” that works in the Pakistani tribal region along the Afghan border , where the drone attacks have consistently taken place .
It found that more than half the people surveyed in winter 2008 in this region , known as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas , said the drone strikes were accurate and were damaging the militant organizations based there .
Under President Obama , the strikes have taken out at most half a dozen militant leaders while killing approximately 450 other people .
Of those , about 75 percent are reported to have been lower - level militants , and about a quarter appear to have been civilians .
The strikes appear to have killed a slightly lower percentage of civilians in the past nine months than during the earlier years of the American drone campaign in Pakistan .
Obama , far from curtailing the drone program he inherited from President George W. Bush , has dramatically increased the number of U.S. Predator and Reaper drone strikes .
There have been 44 strikes in Pakistan this year ( two while Bush was still in office ) , compared with 34 in all of 2008 .
None of the strikes under either Bush or Obama has targeted Osama bin Laden , who seems to have vanished like a wraith .
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban , Baitullah Mehsud , the mastermind of Benazir Bhutto ’s December 2007 assassination and many of the suicide bombings in Afghanistan , was a frequent target of the drone attacks .
Under Obama , according to our analysis , 15 drone strikes specifically targeted Mehsud .
But he still did n’t see it coming .
On August 5 , Mehsud , a diabetic former gym instructor , was receiving a leg massage on the roof of a house in South Waziristan when a missile from a drone slammed into his hideout , killing one of his wives , her father and the terrorist chief himself .
The Pakistani press was jubilant .
“ Good Riddance , Killer Baitullah ” was the lead headline in the quality Dawn newspaper .
Much of the previous coverage in Pakistan of U.S. drone strikes in the tribal region had ranged from critical to downright hostile .
But in the case of Mehsud , U.S. strategic interests and Pakistani interests were closely aligned because the Pakistani Taliban ’s victims included not only Bhutto , the country ’s most popular politician , but hundreds of Pakistani policemen , soldiers and civilians .
As the drone attacks have put al Qaeda and allied groups under increased pressure , law enforcement authorities have uncovered few serious plots against U.S. or European targets that are traceable back to militants who had trained in Pakistan ’s tribal regions since summer 2008 , when the drone program was first expanded .
A major exception is Najibullah Zazi , a onetime coffee - cart operator on Wall Street who later worked as a shuttle van driver at the Denver , Colorado , airport .
Authorities say Zazi , an Afghan immigrant , was planning to launch this fall what could have been the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States since September 11 .
He had traveled in late August 2008 to Pakistan , where by his own admission he was trained in explosives by al Qaeda members in a tribal area along the Afghan border .
The FBI found pages of handwritten notes on Zazi ’s laptop computer about the manufacture and initiation of explosives and the components of various detonators and fusing systems , technical know - how he had picked up at one of al Qaeda ’s training facilities between late summer 2008 and January 2009 , a period of intensified drone attacks .
Drone strikes are an important tool to disrupt al Qaeda and Taliban operations and to kill the leaders of these organizations , but they also consistently kill Pakistani civilians , angering the population and prompting violent acts of revenge from the Pakistani Taliban .
For the time being , however , they appear to be the least bad option the United States has for reducing the threat from Pakistan ’s militants , given that an American ground assault into Pakistan ’s tribal regions is out of the question and that U.S. and Pakistani strategic interests are more closely aligned today than they have been in years because of the two countries ’ shared interest in attacking the Pakistani Taliban and their al Qaeda allies .

NBA star Dirk Nowitzki Cristal
Taylor wrote judge a leniency letter NBA star Dirk Nowitzki ’s ex Cristal Taylor was sentenced to five years in jail on Monday , despite writing a letter to the judge asking for leniency .
The sprightly 100 - year - old athlete , who trains five days a week and bench presses 35kg weights , set the record in her age class of 100 to 104 - year - olds at the World Masters Games in Sydney Australia .
Ruth , a great - grandmother of 11 , won a gold medal at the world sporting event for seniors for her shot put throw of 4.07 metres .
Her fitness secret is simple : " Do n't eat vegetables , because I never eat vegetables .
I know people that like diets that will scream at me , ( but ) do n't eat vegetables .
I never have " she said .
Of the 28,000 athletes taking part in the World Masters Games , the oldest participant was Reginald Trewin ( 101 , Australia ) , who competed in the lawn bowling event .

Another grandmother in the news at the moment is that of pensioner Marianne L. , who had to sell old nude pics of herself to pay the bills
And here , the term “ man ” refers to the manual page software .
I already noted that I was working on fixing man-db to work with heirloom - doctools but I did n’t go in much details about the problems I faced .
So let me try to explain it a bit in more detail , if you ’re interested .
The first problem is , we have two different man implementations in portage : sys - apps / man and sys - apps / man - db .
The former is the “ classical ” one used by default , while the latter is a newer implementation , which is supposedly active and maintained .
I say supposedly because it seems to me like it ’s not really actively maintained , nor tested , at all .
The “ classic ” implementation is often despised because , among other things , it ’s not designed with UTF - 8 in mind at all , and even its own output , for locales where ASCII is not enough , is broken .
For instance , in Italian , it outputs a latin1 bytestreams even when the locale is set to use UTF - 8 . Confusion ensures .
The new implementation should also improve the caching by not using flat - files for the already - processed man pages , but rather using db files ( berkeley or gdbm ) .
So what ’s the problem with man-db , the new implementation ?
It supports UTF - 8 natively , so that ’s good , but the other problem is that it ’s only ever tested coupled with groff ( GNU implementation of the ( n ) roff utility ) , and with nothing else .
How should this matter ?
Well , there are a few features in groff that are not found anywhere else , this includes , for instance , the HTML output ( eh ? no I do n’t get it either , I can tell that the nroff format is n’t exactly nice , and I guess that having the man pages available as HTML makes them more readable for users , but why adding that to groff , and especially to the man command ?
no clue ) , as well as some X - specific output .
Both those features are not available in heirloom , but as far as I can see they are so rarely used that it really makes little sense to depend on groff just because of those ; and the way man - db is designed , when a nroff implementation different from groff is found , the relative options are not even parsed or considered ; which is good to reduce the size of the code , but also requires to at least compile - test the software with a non -groff implementation , something that upstream is not currently doing it seems .
More to the point , not only the code uses broken ( as in , incomplete ) groff - conditionals , but the build system does depend on groff as well : the code to build the manual called groff directly , instead of using whatever the configure script found , and the testsuite relied on the “ warnings ” feature that is only enabled with groff ( there was one more point to that : previously it returned error when the -- warnings option was passed , so I had to fix it so that it is , instead , ignored ) .
But it does n’t go much better from here on : not only man - db tries to use two output terminals that are no defined by the heirloom nroff ( so I hacked that around temporarily on heirloom itself , the proper fix would be having a configuration option for man - db ) , but it also has problems handling line and page lengths .
This is quite interesting actually , since it took me a long time ( and some understanding of how nroff works , which is nowhere near nice , or human ) .
Both nroff and groff ( obviously ) are designed to work with paged documents ( although troff is the one that is usually used to print , since that produces PostScript documents ) ; for this reason , by default , their output is restricted width - wise , and has pagebreaks , with footers and headers , every given number of lines .
Since the man page specification ( command , man section , source , … ) are present in the header and footer , the page breaks can be seen as spurious man page data in - between paragraphs of documentation .
This is what you read on most operating systems , included Solaris , where the man program and the nroff program are not well combined .
To avoid this problem , both the man implementations set line and page breaks depending on the terminal : the line break is set to something less than the width of the terminal , to fill it with content ; the page break is set as high as possible to allow smooth scrolling in the text .
Unfortunately , we got another “ groff versus the world ” situation here : while the classic nroff implementation sets the two values with the .ll and .pl roff commands ( no , really you do n’t want to learn about roff commands unless you ’re definitely masochist ! ) , groff uses the LL register ( again … roff … no thanks ) , and thus can be set with the command - line parameter - rLL= $ width ; this syntax is not compatible with heirloom ’s nroff , but I ’m pretty sure you already guessed that .
The classic man implementation , then , uses both the command and the register approach , but without option switches ; instead it prepends to the manpage sources the roff commands ( .ll and .nr LL that sets the register from within the roff language ) , and then gets the whole output processed ; this makes it well compatible with the heirloom tools .
On the other hand , man - db uses the command - line approach which makes it less compatible ; indeed when using man-db with the heirloom - doctools , you ’re left with a very different man output , which looks like an heirloom in itself , badly formatted and not filling the terminal .
Now we ’re in quite a strange situation : from one side , the classic man implementation sucks at UTF - 8 ( in its own right ) , but it works mostly fine with heirloom - doctools ( that supports UTF - 8 natively ) ; from the other side we got a newer , cleaner ( in theory ) implementation , that should support UTF - 8 natively ( but requiring a Debian - patched groff ) , but has lock - ins on groff ( which definitely sucks with UTF - 8 ) .
The obvious solution here would be to cross-pollinate the two implementations to get a single pair of programs that work well together and has native UTF - 8 ; but it really is not easy .

Meet Morgui , the new robot constructed at the University of Reading , which has been deemed so scary it has been banned from interacting with anyone aged under 18 .
The x-rated robot is a disembodied head with five senses and big bright eyes and is able to follow people around the room .
But the university 's ethics and research committee took one look at Morgui and decided it might be just a bit too scary .
This is ironic .
Morgui , which is Mandarin for Magic Ghost , cannot experience emotions - it is an experiment in how people react to robots .
The metal head , a bit like a cadaverous automaton from Star Wars or a Terminator , is the creation of Kevin Warwick , a University of Reading cybernetics professor with a long record in attention - seeking robots .
" We want to investigate how people react when they first encounter Mo , as we lovingly like to call the robot , " said Prof Warwick .
" Through one of Mo 's eyes , he can watch people 's responses to him following them around .
" It appears this is not deemed acceptable for under 18 - year - olds without prior consent from their legal guardian .
" This presents us with a big problem as we cannot demonstrate Mo in action either to visitors or potential students . "
Mo 's five senses include visual and audio , as well as a further three that are extra-sensory , as far as humans are concerned : radar , infrared , and ultrasonic .
In Europe , Japan and the US , researchers have been looking for robots that will respond " naturally " to humans .
It therefore follows that the robots must also study how humans respond to them .
Prof Warwick once implanted a chip in his arm to explore his experiences as part - man , part - cyborg .
He devised Roger the running robot and entered it in a half - marathon , although it unfortunately crashed quite early in the race .
Other cybernetics department products include Hissing Sid - a cat - like pneumatic robot - Cybot and the Seven Dwarfs , and a gallery of other silicon - brained inventions .
Morgui is an experiment in sensory input to provide a strategy to control robot behaviour and keep an eye on humans watching him .
" We 've not had a robot head before , " said Prof Warwick .
" It 's sort of scaryish , but in a fun way .
Kids like this sort of thing .
Of course , some of them we expected to be a little bit scared , others not , and we wanted to see how they responded .
" We now have a notice on the door from the chairman of the ethics and research committee saying any under - 18s must have approval before they come in the lab . "
A University of Reading spokesperson said the college is confident that its policies are " successfully maintaining appropriate ethical practices for research " .
This week I did an intervention on Sarah , one of my dearest friends .
It was n't the first time .
Over the last few years I have unsuccessfully attempted to get her to seek help for a problem that has cost her conservatively $ 48,000 and put financial and emotional stress on her family .
This week , after over five years of trying to manage her problem , she finally hit rock bottom .
She once again had to borrow money from her family — this time to pay for her daughter 's healthcare .
Sarah had $ 800 of the $ 900 doctor bill in the bank , but she 'd already earmarked that money for the horrible monkey on her back .
Sarah has a substance abuse problem — but not with drugs .
Sarah has a problem with self storage .
Sarah used to have financial stability .
But five years ago she made a major life change when she decided , at age 40 , to adopt a child and become a single parent .
Sarah sold her beautiful 3000 square foot home so she could afford to quit her high - powered job and be a stay at home mom until her daughter could start pre-school .
She moved into a 1200 square foot apartment in a good school district .
This was all part of a good , long term plan .
Unfortunately , she then made what became possibly the worst financial decision of her entire life :
She put the 1800 square feet worth of possessions that did n't fit into the apartment into self storage .
Using a technique that drug dealers use to reel in future customers , the storage company offered Sarah , the first time user , free product to ensure her loyalty .
Convinced that she would be able to sell , donate or otherwise dispose of her extra stuff during the " First 30 Days Free Rent " period that her storage company offers to all new customers , Sarah moved her designer guest room furniture , her Christmas decorations , her art collection , etc into four of the cheapest storage units available .
" I 'm just going to use this as a staging area to get organized , " she told me at that point in time .
" That way , I 'll have four weeks to figure stuff out and wo n't have to make any financial decisions about what to get rid of under duress . "
She never moved out .
Although she has plenty of very valuable things in storage , as we surveyed the contents of one of Sarah 's units earlier this week , she finally did the math .
Even if she pulled everything out of the unit and set it on fire in the parking lot , it would still be a better financial decision than keeping it in storage for another month .
5 years x $ 200 a month per unit x 4 units = $ 48000 .
And that total does n't even account for the money spent on gasoline to get her to and from her storage or all the late fees she 's paid on other bills because she chose to pay her storage bill on time so her stuff would n't be seized for non-payment .
The phone company can turn off your service , but the storage company can auction off your dream diary , fake IDs , and herpes medication to the highest bidder .
Although Sarah 's situation may be the worst that I know of personally , she 's hardly alone .
According to the Self Storage Association , 50 % of storage unit renters are storing what wo n't fit into their homes .
1 out of every 11 Americans rents storage .
Watching Sarah 's horrible journey has made me realize that , although self storage ( like easy credit ) , can be beneficial to a percentage of the population , it 's a pact with Satan for many folks who do n't have an iron fist over their finances or excellent time management skills .
Quite simply , it 's bad on several fronts .
Self storage is a bad investment
I called four different storage companies with units in my area of Los Angeles .
The cheapest price for the smallest storage space , a 5 x 5 unit , in my neighborhood is $ 67 per month .
The first month costs just a mere $ 1 , but that 's not counting the one time only $ 22 " Administration Fee " that they 'll also tack onto the first 30 days .
Although all those numbers sound doable financially , if I rented this space , I 'd be out a whopping $ 760 in the first 12 months , all to rent a space that 's the size of my laundry room .
In other words , stuff that is n't functional enough to put in my house and use every day would become more and more expensive with each passing year .
( On a side note , I had to hang up on three out of the four storage sales reps because I was getting such a hard sell , that they continued to demand my personal information even after I 'd told them that their rental prices were beyond my budget . )
Self storage can lead to overconsumption
Self storage is like diet food for material goods .
It fools the mind by fooling the eye .
If your clutter is n't visible in your house , do you really have a spending problem ?
The first self storage facilities were built in Texas in the late 1960's .
It took 25 years to build the first one BILLION square feet of storage .
But it took just eight years ( 1998 - 2005 ) to add the second billion .
According to the National Association of Home Builders , the average 1960 's home was 1200 square feet .
In 2004 the average home had ballooned to almost twice that size to 2330 square feet .
Bigger houses are harder to fill up , which may explain why Americans buy twice the number of consumer goods than the citizens of any other first world nation .
( Okay , so we 're a geographically huge country , but if we 've got such big homes , why do we need an additional billion square feet of storage space ? )
The environmental cost of creating , transporting and finally housing two billion square feet of unused possessions is mindboggling .
Self storage can waste time as well as money
Self storage companies count on the basic physics of human laziness , that is : Objects at rest , remain at rest ... in storage .
After all , who wants to spend their precious free time , digging through boxes looking for stuff ?
Sarah , in her efforts to deal with her storage problems , has spent hundreds of hours " organizing " her stuff in storage , attempting to repack it more efficiently so she can scale down to smaller , cheaper units .
Self storage is urban blight
In all fairness , one of the storage companies in my area is housed in the hollowed - out facade of an Art Deco office building , so that 's quite pretty .
But for the most part , self storage facilities are architectural monsters .
In addition to being ugly as sin , they bring in few jobs or sales tax benefits to the community , compared to other structures of similarly huge proportions .
Self storage can keep you from living in the moment
There are certain groups of people , like those who live on sail boats and soldiers fighting overseas , or the newly moved , who can follow their dreams because they can temporarily stash their possessions in storage .
Storage gives them the wiggle room to experience life without being connected to personal belongings .
For more than half the storage renters , however , this is simply not the case .
Once a month , one of the storage companies in my neighborhood holds an " estate sale " where the owner of the company sells off the contents of units that were seized for non-payment of rent .
What odd , desperate or lazy story is behind this lapse of judgment ?
Why the renters failed to move their possessions out of storage before the rent was due is always a mystery .
What tales of woe are behind the abandoned photograph albums , bronzed baby shoe ashtrays or the hand - embroidered vintage napkins ?
Why were n't these items , so obviously full of sentimental value , kept in the home where they could be used and admired ?
A clearer narrative about why items were acquired is visible from a lot of the sale merchandise , however .
You can almost hear the nagging spouses behind the half dozen exercise bikes and Thighmasters for sale each month or the siren 's call of Martha Stewart behind the hundreds of half - finished craft items .
Whether they are nostalgic artifacts from the past or wishful self - help tools for the future , none of these objects relate to the present day lives of their former owners , which is probably why they were put into storage to begin with .
These monthly sales are sad museums , a collection of failed ventures and unfulfilled dreams of what could be .
As with every successful product , self storage provides a powerful storyline for the consumer to buy into : that preserving memories of the past or the potential of the future through material goods is valuable .
For the past five years , Sarah has denied the chaos that keeping so much stuff in storage brings to her daily life .
Her dream of returning to her former standard of living in the future has cost her the very security she wants for her daughter and their quality of life today .
$ 48,000 could have gone toward her daughter 's college fund .
$ 48,000 could have paid for a lifetime of vacations .
It could have been a down payment on a house .
Up until this week , I think Sara actually believed that she would one day find her way back into a big house in the hills , even though she 's a self - employed , single parent facing a global financial downturn .
As I photographed her possessions to list on Craigslist , she fretted about selling her formal dining room set , because she wanted to pass it on to her daughter as a family heirloom .
That her daughter , who is currently in kindergarten , might not like the style of the set as an adult and would have no emotional connection to an object that she 'd only ever seen in storage , never crossed her mind .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Top House Democrats on Tuesday slammed insurers who claim that domestic violence is a pre-existing condition that can be used to deny coverage to battered women .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was among those targeting the coverage practice .
They pledged to incorporate a ban on the practice in the health care reform legislation winding its way through Congress .
Forty - two states have passed such a prohibition , according to a recent report from the National Women 's Law Center .
Idaho , Mississippi , North Carolina , North Dakota , Oklahoma , South Carolina , South Dakota , Wyoming and the District of Columbia have not , however .
" Think of this , " House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said .
" You 've survived domestic violence , and now you are discriminated [ against ] in the insurance market because you have a pre-existing medical condition .
Well , that will all be gone . "
The ban would be part of a broader prohibition against the use of pre-existing conditions to deny care , a component of all the reform bills now under consideration .
Washington Sen. Patty Murray , a Democrat , told CNN that she heard about the issue several years ago while talking to women who trying to escape abusive relationships .
One of the women " told me that she did not report her domestic violence because her health insurance company would drop her .
I [ initially ] did n't believe " the woman , Murray said .
Murray introduced an amendment banning the practice in 2006 but was unable to get the measure approved .
One Republican opposed to the amendment , North Carolina Sen .
Richard Burr , argued that it's " deplorable to deny coverage to victims of domestic violence .
However , states should be responsible for regulating insurance markets . "
On Tuesday , a spokesman for an association representing health insurance companies backed the proposed change .
" No one should be denied coverage because they are a victim of domestic abuse , " said Robert Zirkelbach , spokesman for America 's Health Insurance Plans .
It is unclear how many women are now being denied coverage because they are stuck in an abusive relationship .
Women 's Law Center Vice President Judy Waxman conceded that there are no current examples .
" We do not know the extent to which this practice actually happens , " she said .
" But our point is , it 's the kind of thing insurance companies look to do .
...
They will find ways in the current situation to deny people care if they find anything wrong with them . "
Some reform advocates say the proposed federal action , though a positive step , does not go far enough .
" We have to go further and take affirmative steps to reach out to battered women who may have been denied coverage to let them know the landscape has changed and there may be insurance options available to them , " said Shelley Senterfitt , a representative of the Georgia Coalition Against Domestic Violence .
" We need to fix the damage that 's been done , " she said .

The pre-eminent Muslim advocacy group in Washington , DC , has greeted four Republicans ’ accusations that it is trying to plant “ spies ” disguised as interns on Capitol Hill with outrage , derision and ridicule .
US House Reps. Paul Broun ( R - GA ) , Trent Franks ( R - AZ ) , Sue Myrick ( R- NC ) and John Shadegg ( R - AZ ) announced Wednesday morning that they want the House ’s sergeant - at - arms to investigate claims made in a new book that the Council on American - Islamic Relations has a plan to infiltrate Congress with interns who would spy for the group .

CAIR says the evidence for the allegations made in the book is nothing more than documents showing the group is engaged in typical lobbying efforts in Congress .
It also says the allegations made against them could be fuel for hate groups .
The Republican quartet ’s claims are based on a book published by the conservative news site WorldNetDaily , entitled Muslim Mafia : Inside the Secret Underworld That ’s Conspiring to Islamize America .
The book was written by Paul Sperry and Dave Gaubatz .
According to Politico , Gaubatz , an anti-Muslim activist , wrote last year that “ a vote for Hussein Obama is a vote for Sharia law . ”
CAIR denounced Sperry and Gaubatz ’s claims as “ racist ” and “ insidious , ” reports Politico , but the group ’s communications director , Ibrahim Hooper , took a sarcastic tone when responding to the allegations .
“ We would love to help people find jobs on Capitol Hill , ” he said .
“ There ’s a Muslim Staffer Association .
Should they be investigated ? ”
Who ’s spying now ?
As WorldNetDaily described , to make its argument that CAIR is “ infiltrating ” Congress , the authors planted an infiltrator in CAIR — specifically , Dave Gaubatz ’s son , Chris , who posed as “ Dave Marshall , ” a “ bearded Muslim convert , ” to land an internship at CAIR ’s Washington office .

It was that deception that seemed to raise the most outrage from CAIR ’s Hooper , who told TalkingPointsMemo ’s Justin Elliott that Gaubatz had taken numerous documents from the organization ’s offices .
“ We treated him so well , ” an “ angry ” Hooper told TPM .
“ I jokingly offered to help him get married . …
They lied to us about their background .
They falsely claimed to be Muslim .
They would stand next to us and pray during prayers . ”
Hooper told TPM that Gaubatz ’s “ evidence ” amounts to little more than documents showing that CAIR engaged in standard lobbying efforts .
“ This guy spied on us for months , and the most they can come up with is that we ’re doing ordinary lobbying work on Capitol Hill ? ”

Hooper told The Hill : “ If these people were n’t so hate - filled , it would be laughable , but unfortunately they have an audience and , given their positions , it ’s going to get picked up by the hate blogs . ”
“ God forbid American Muslims take part in the political process and exercise their rights , ” he said .

Now , here ’s something you do n’t see every day : scientists cure color - blind monkeys .
According to a report published online in the journal Nature , researchers have used gene therapy to allow color - blind squirrel monkeys to look at their fruit in a whole new light .
In one type of squirrel monkey , the males lack a visual pigment called L - opsin .
Its absence renders the monkeys color - blind , unable to distinguish reds and green .
Most of the females , on the other hand , see in full color .
So the scientists got to wondering : what would happen if they gave a boy squirrel monkey the same opsin that girls have .
Using a harmless virus , the scientists introduced the pigment gene into the eyes of color - blind adults .
Lo and behold , about a month later , the monkeys with the new L - opsin gene were able to see hues they ’d never seen before .
The research does n’t mean we ’ll soon be trying the same thing in humans .
Because we ’re not yet ready to monkey with our own selves that way .
But the fact that a fellow primate was able to make and use the new pigments , even though they received the genes as adults , was a real eye - opener .

In the most under - reported story of the week , the Republican ’s have , yet again , screwed over the people who have been hardest hit by the recession .
This is the second time this month that the GOP has blocked extending unemployment benefits .
Washington Independent ’s Mike Lillis wrote :
Last week , Senate Democratic leaders rolled out a proposal to extend unemployment insurance by 14 weeks — with an extra six weeks thrown in for those states where jobless figures have topped 8.5 percent — only to have Republicans block the measure on the chamber floor .
Well , today it happened again .
According to the office of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) , Democrats on Tuesday asked for consent to pass the bill , only to be shot down by GOP leaders .
The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Republicans are n’t objecting to the extension , but to how it ’s funded .
( The Democrats ’ plan would tap an expiring surtax on businesses , while the Republicans want to use unspent money from the stimulus bill . )
The House has already passed its version of the extension .
With unemployment numbers creeping up each month , the pressure ’s on the Senate to work out a deal quickly .
The saddest thing about this story is not the story itself ( which is disgusting enough ) , but the comments by regular American people who responded to this story and the desperation some of them are feeling .
I have posted the following comments as they were written .
My unemployment benefits ran out in August and I am barely holding on .
I am watching daily to see if this bill will be passed .
I lost my job and went from a salary of comfortable salary to $ 450.00 a week .
my family and I was able to live off of our saving for a while but now we are dependent on UI benefits .
My husband was layed off and we are only surviving on his benefits .
We are in jeopardy of losing our home .
We ’ve already lost both cars and have had to cut our expenses substantially .
As the weather changed we are afraid to use our heater and we are bundling up for fear of not being able to pay the bill our heating bill .. .
I need the GOP to get off their high horses and live a day in my life .
I guess if you have n’t been affected by the economy then you do n’t get it .
I will just continue to pray .
I wish people would stop playing the blame game , and realize it does n’t matter who we vote in or out !
And …
well i finally got enough money to buy a little groceries for the kids and the rent never thought i would have to do what i did to get it but necessity out ways legality , all because these assholes are n’t in our shoes , so they can take there sweet time because the crime rate will go up !!!!!!!!!!!!!
It would be nice if the GOP would leave their bubble of knee - jerk obstruction to see real American ’s who are suffering .
Their lives should not be used as political pawns by a party who wants every opportunity to create a Democratic Waterloo .
Thankfully , not all is lost .
More comments and commentary below the fold .
YOU F’n PRICKS !!!
WE DESERVE A UNITED GOVERNMENT AND I AM SOOOOOOOOO TIRED OF THE WHOLE US vs. THEM WAY OF WASTING OUR TAXPAYERS MONEY !!!
EVEN WHEN THERE IS A GOOD IDEA THERE IS ALWAYS A STUPID FIGHT BECAUSE ONE PARTY DOESN ’T WANT THE OTHER TO LOOK GOOD .
I ALMOST WENT TO STEAL A BOTTLE OF CAUGH SYRUP FOR MY 7yr OLD DAUGHTER TODAY BECAUSE I HAVEN ’T HAD A CHECK IN 6 WEEKS .
WE ARE BROKE AND DROWNING AND THE GOP COULD CARE LESS !!!
I WILL DEFINATELY REMEMBER THIS COME ELECTION TIME !!!
I AM AN INDEPENDANT AND WILL NEVER VOTE REPUBLICAN EVER EVER EVER
And …
What are they thinking ?
Many people are losing their homes and the life they built is slipping furthering into the bottom .
Trying to make a life for my family on unemployment means to barely make it .
I worked for 25 years and to now be unemployed for so long is knocking me around a bit .
Asking for help was hard to realize and to now have it run out and have nothing coming in while the fat cats sit on their a**** is horrible .
As they go home for the weekend to comfortable lives not thinking about the hurting people .
Pass the extension and give us a chance at staying a float .
And …
Its difficult to grasp the fact our government can’t see the “ trouble ” we ’re in as the unemployed increase and lose benefits .
Give us tests , offer more challenges whatever it takes to prove to you we are , in fact making great strides to gain employment , what do you want ?
Pride has gone by the wayside , this is new to me and I ’ve always worked , now the benefits just ended , im avoiding phone calls , friends .. starting to get quite depressed .
The contributing factor is our government , I do n’t understand it , there ’s a pink elephant in the room and they stand by idle , its become a match of power egos ?
What the heck is going on ?
Really ?
Im so pissed off at the entire country … we can help each other ca n’t we ?
Isnt that what we were made of ???
I help whomever i can , do whatever I can .
Has our society given up and become so selfish and untrusting that we are no longer united ?
What happened to patriotism ?
The government is the backbone , and they are NOT supporting us ..
And …
this is nuts ….
I am starving and I ran out of benefits .
Even if they passed it today it will take me weeks to get a check .
They need to pass this bill and they need to do it today and they need to extend for all states .
LETS GOOOOOO
And …
You can bet we ’ll remember this come election day .
I do n’t care HOW it ’s funded – get that extension passed .
This should have been taken care of before you went on August recess !!
People began exhausting their benefits in August .
Thankfully , there were more than a few of these :
I ’m a registered Independent that is now swinging hard to the Democratic Party .
The Republicans are showing their absolute lack of feeling for the working ( or non-working ) guys out there suffering .
Holding up benefits for people in need ????
And …
I called all my relatives in AZ and let them know how hard it has been to find work and how my unemployment had run out .
They were aghast at how John Kyle had helped in blocking the bill that would have helped me and my children survive through till the holidays .
My whole family is now changing party affiliation and we are dead set against voting any more GOP ’s into office .
They are all talking to their friends and advising them of how the GOP is blocking Health care reform and ending the support of out of work Americans .
Do not to continue supporting senators who care nothing for the American people who are unemployed and struggling just to stay afloat .
John Kyle just lost my families support and a butt load of votes !.
I have their promise they will carry the word to all their senior friends .
I will vote Democrat till my dying days from now on !!!
I will advise every one of my friends and remind them that the Republican party ’s actions caused suffering and strife among my family .
Spread the word !!
There seem to be a good many reformed Republicans out there these days .
Let ’s hope that our collective ADHD does n’t kick in and we finally get enough American ’s to vote good people into government who believe that government is there to work for We , The People .
When you vote people into office who do not believe that government can work , you are assured that government wo n’t work .

Converting the rubbish that fills the world ’s landfills into biofuel may be the answer to both the growing energy crisis and to tackling carbon emissions , claim scientists in Singapore and Switzerland .
New research published in Global Change Biology : Bioenergy , reveals how replacing gasoline with biofuel from processed waste could cut global carbon emissions by 80 % .
Biofuels produced from crops have proven controversial because they require an increase in crop production which has its own severe environmental costs .
However , second - generation biofuels , such as cellulosic ethanol derived from processed urban waste , may offer dramatic emissions savings without the environmental catch .
“ Our results suggest that fuel from processed waste biomass , such as paper and cardboard , is a promising clean energy solution , ” said study author Associate Professor Hugh Tan of the National University of Singapore .
“ If developed fully this biofuel could simultaneously meet part of the world ’s energy needs , while also combating carbon emissions and fossil fuel dependency . ”
The team used the United Nation ’s Human Development Index to estimate the generation of waste in 173 countries .
This data was then coupled to the Earthtrends database to estimate the amount of gasoline consumed in those same countries .
The team found that 82.93 billion litres of cellulosic ethanol could be produced from the world ’s landfill waste and that by substituting gasoline with the resulting biofuel , global carbon emissions could be cut by figures ranging from 29.2 % to 86.1 % for every unit of energy produced .
“ If this technology continues to improve and mature these numbers are certain to increase , ” concluded co-author Dr. Lian Pin Koh from ETH Zürich .
“ This could make cellulosic ethanol an important component of our renewable energy future . ”
It Tolls For You
Little Rabbit
I 've been hating ona lot recently .
Last week when a fan of the series thrust a calloused finger in my direction and demanded games which did large - scale combat better , I obviously mentioned , but was surprised when another name fell out of my mouth .
Themod turned full game that paints a grubby , heart - stopping picture of the Eastern front of WW2.solves a problem I 've had with almost every shooter I 've ever played - that of them steering clear of simulating real guns and real bullets .
Game guns are relatively quiet , do n't have much recoil , can be shot with accuracy while you walk or run and are always reloaded in a few seconds .
Game bullets have the mysterious ability to fill the clips you 're carrying in your pockets so those clips are always full when inserted into guns , and when shot game bullets do n't so much as cause anyone pain until enough of them are lodged in a single body that they cause some kind of mysterious stroke .
There are tons of games which act as exceptions to one or two of these rules , but 's the only recent game I can think of to ignore them all .
Inyou point a gun at someone , there is a BANG and they DIE and you do n't RELOAD because it takes AGES and besides in a tight spot you 'll never empty a full magazine before getting SHOT yourself anyway .
It 's obvious why this is traditionally avoided .
It means combat 's over in a flash and becomes the domain of twitch - gamers and campers .
And yet that 's not the case in .
In most multiplayer games , the game 's designed first and the weapons are chosen and tweaked to fit .
In the name of setting itself apart , built the guns first , the most worrying and wicked and downright real things the UT engine has ever seen , and created something great by packing the game tightly around them like a snowball .
At once the sneakiest adjustment and the one that 's sat in everyone 's face at all times is 's map design .
Levels take place in cramped , ruined cities , labyrinthine industrial sites and murky sprawls of countryside , all of which make it very tricky to line up enemies under your sights .
By which I mean it's a pretty taxing process to actually find the other team .
It turns the game from a shooter into more of a hunter and a creeper , elongating that combat which those realistic guns would originally render too short .
The player uniforms do the same job .
The Russian side wear murky brown .
The Germans wear browny green .
All of the levels are murky , and some are murky browny green .
This is a pretty awesome joke in a game where life and death is divided and decided by a split - second and friendly fire is always on .
I 've had more than one match ofwhere I was exploring some broken house , rounded a corner , come face to face with Another Guy and both of us leapt back out of sight again because for each of us it was the only option that 'd definitely keep us alive and prevent us from team - killing .
The really fun part comes when the two of you decode the mental image you 're left with and realise no , oh no , you actually are on opposite teams , you missed your chance for a snap shot and now you 're alone in a house with a murderer .
Although shooting from the hip can be a bad time too .
Unless you 've attached your bayonet , missing at close quarters with those old bolt - action rifles is a very noisy way of announcing your pants are temporarily down .
Again , the point of this is to slow down the combat , to plug the flow of death , and have everyone moving slower and more thoughtfully .
Another thingdoes to accommodate its deadly weaponry is take the disadvantages of real guns as well as their capacity for murder , like having to aim .
Shooting inmeans looking down ironsights , which means being close to stationary and ditching your peripheral vision .
As I 've mentioned , it 's possible to fire from the hip but unless you 're close enough to an enemy to smell the tang of BO and vodka you might as well be firing blanks .
Reloading takes a long time , of course , and there 's no counter as to how many bullets are left in your clip .
But you remember how to count , right ?
The list goes on .
Machine guns must be deployed on something to get the most out of them .
Bullet drop is modeled for all guns , so if you 're shooting from one end of the map to the other you 'll need to aim above your target as well as leading them if they 're moving .
Even taking out tanks with anti-armour rockets means you can't hit your target from an angle or the projectile will bounce off the armour .
You need a direct hit .
How many countless late nights and unnutritious meals went into experimenting with all these features I 'm not sure , but the results can't be argued with .is a distinctly playable and fast - paced shooter that boasts honest - to - God real guns .
It 's an achievement in itself , sure , but on paper it can seem like a pointless one .
When a thousand shooters have had ( and continue to have ) incredible success dancing around the concept of realism , getting only as close as they can without burning away at the fun of the game , why would you try and force your way closer ?
There 's an answer hidden in that question .
A thousand shooters offer something fun .
Battlefield or Warhawk or Counter - Strike offer up fun with both hands and a grin on their painted faces .
It , and it alone , can provide something else .
I remember joining my friend for his very first game of , how we dropped into the same server just as the match was starting and found ourselves in the muddy woolens of a crowd of Russian infantrymen .
We were standing next to a truck in a snowy forest .
As the game began the rest of our team ran off as one to take up positions in the barns and trenches that gave us the best chance of survival , with my friend and I sprinting in their footsteps , rifles against our chests .
Soon the first shots were crackling in the distance , their origin and destination unknown to us .
We lay there , shoulder to shoulder in a ditch , and we waited and watched for movement .
" OH MY GOD " , typed my friend .
" I AM ERNEST HEMINGWAY .
" Never mind the , uh , multitude of inaccuracies in his claim .
The word is immersion .'s guns , seductive as they are , are really only the starting point of something greater .
See , realistic weapons that obey all the rules of the real world lead to one thing only , and that 's realistic , believable combat .
Because of its weaponry , organically creates so many of the tactics and tropes that games likeandhave to fake through set pieces and abstract mechanics .
Flanking , suppressive fire , stealth segments , hesitation before shooting , even morale and panic , all of it exists withinwithout the developers adding so much as a single line of code or breathing a word about it to the player , simply because of the way the guns work .
Adapting to survive means adopting the small - unit tactics that exist in real life , and that 'll happen whether you 're conscious of it or not .
Another war story .
I was playing a machine gunner on a heathery , flat map with a massive maze of trenches making up the centre .
Through luck and more luck I 'd managed to slink through to the far side of it undetected , and found myself and my enormous gun standing some twenty feet behind several enemy soldiers who were lying on their bellies and shooting down at my friends in the trench .
Feeling empty , I lay down facing them and tapped the key that began the laborious process of propping up my machine gun on the ground in front of me .
As I was lining up the first shot I noticed a scrap of colour between me and the man I 'd chosen to die first .
Pulling back from the ironsights , I saw it was a single flower .
Gee .
It was a pretty thing .
The rest of the landscape was so ugly .
That was when one of the soldiers turned around , saw me , whipped up his gun and shot me dead before I could have breathed a word .
Some of us do n't have it in us , I guess .
I love that story , because it 's too saccharine to appear in a piece of war fiction .
A soldier dying because he was totally absorbed in the captivating beauty of a single flower ?
C'mon .
Think about this :
Because everything in a piece of fiction is preordained by the author , certain events , occurrences or coincidences are off - limits because they appear too unlikely or because they 're too obviously meaningful or ugly .
They either destroy the story because they are n't believable , or because the give off the stench of bad storytelling , or both .
Ridiculous , overblown imagery then is an area in which games can play where other forms of media cannot , because it 's not something placed by an author .
It can be something you find , or create yourself .
So , I love the flower story because it's a war story that only a game could tell , and I lovebecause it 's he only game telling it .
Yikes .
I remember when I envisioned Battle Klaxon as a light - hearted thing .
Not sure what happened there .
Tune in next time when I 'm sure I 'll have written 4,000 words on the parallels betweenand the Canterbury Tales .
No .
No !
Something fun , next time .
I promise .

A ` Seattle ' in Copenhagen could scuttle a climate deal that only serves the richest countries .
By Patrick Bond
September 5 , 2009 – Durban --
Here ’s a fairly simple choice : the global North would pay the hard - hit global South to deal with the climate crisis , either through the complicated , corrupt , controversial ``Clean Development Mechanism ’ ( CDM ) , whose projects have plenty of damaging sideeffects to communities , or instead pay through other mechanisms that must provide financing quickly , transparently and decisively to achieve genuine income compensation plus renewable energy to the masses .
The Copenhagen climate summit in December is all about the former choice , because the power bloc in Europe and the US have put carbon trading at the core of their emissions reduction strategy , while the two largest emitters of carbon in the Third World , China and India , are the main beneficiaries of CDM financing .
What that means is that problems caused when Al Gore ’s US delegation brought pro-corporate compromises to Kyoto in 1997 – promising a US sign - on to Kyoto ( hah , what a lie ) in exchange for carbon trading - are going to now amplify , and haunt us for a very long time , unless serious reforms are achieved in Copenhagen .
They wo n’t be , and nor will any substantive agreement emerge , hinted the new UN Development Programme director and New Zealand ’s neoliberal former prime minister Helen Clark this week :
`` The success of the Copenhagen summit on climate change in December will not depend on a final international deal being sealed there . ’’
In other words , prepare for a stalemate by a coalition of selfish , fossil - fuel addicted powers .
Terribly weak targets may get a mention ( or even no mention , as last time at Bali ) , but market mechanisms will be invoked as the ``solution ’’ so as to appease polluting capitalists and the governments under their thumb , especially US President Barack Obama’s .
In contrast , there are attractive , simple mechanisms for financing Africa ’s survival , including the militant ``ecological debt ’’ ( or ``climate reparations ’’) demands now being made by environmental leaders of the African Union ( AU ) , as well as Jubilee Africa ’s request to just remove the damn boot from Africa ’s financial neck by canceling ongoing debt repayments .
On that score , in 2009 the lowest - income African countries are suffering a 50 % increase in debt repayments ( as a percentage of export earnings ) , according to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) .
As I noted four years ago , that means the Make Poverty History NGO - rockstar campaign was a farce .
The only debt written off was n’t possible to repay anyway , so for low - income Africa , ``debt relief ’’ was just an accounting gimmick and the G8 ’s real Gleneagles debt strategy was to squeeze Africa even tighter , as IMF data now shows .
African Union role
But , you may well ask , should anyone take anything said by the AU leadership seriously ?
The AU typically serves , as Zimbabwe ’s new finance minister Tendai Biti once put it , as the continent ’s ``trade union of dictators ’’ .
Heading the AU climate team is Ethiopian strongman Meles Zenawi , who also chairs South Africa 's subimperialist New Partnership for Africa ’s Development and thus gets invited to G20 gatherings along with Pretoria ( better him than AU chair Moammar Gaddafi , reckon the others ) .
Sometimes seen merely as a US puppet – thanks to the disastrous , Washington - sponsored 2007 invasion of neighbouring Somalia – Zenawi is rather more complex .
He was once a self - described Marxist but is now a brutal tyrant whose troops have killed scores of students and other democrats , and who has just imposed a ban on international funding of local civil society aimed to intimidate critics .
Quite ridiculous , is n’t it , for Zenawi to lead the charge , reportedly demanding a minimum of US $ 65 billion – and up to $ 200 billion – annually from the North by 2020 ?
Well , no , not considering how much Africa will be devastated .
Even Zenawi ’s voice , and role in Copenhagen are potentially crucial in the struggle ahead .
What a struggle it is .
The most shocking probable outcome of climate change is that 90 % of the African peasantry will be out of business by 2100 due to drought , floods , extreme weather events , disease and political instability , according to UN experts .
The Climate Change Vulnerability Index , calculated in 2009 ``from dozens of variables measuring the capacity of a country to cope with the consequences of global warming ’’ , listed 22 African countries out of 28 across the world at ``extreme risk ’’ , whereas the United States is near the bottom of the world rankings of countries at risk , even though it is the leading per capita contributor to climate change .
There is no question that those most responsible should pay reparations , now that we are aware of the damage being done by rising greenhouse gas emissions , and by the ongoing stubborn refusal by the rich - country government – especially Obama ’s - to cut back .
The amounts can be debated , for of course $ 65 billion / year for Africa is way too low , given how much devastation to individuals and communities is already underway , how many economies will falter , and how many incalculably valuable species will be lost .
But in addition to AU leaders , the world is awakening .
After several years of hard work by World Council of Churches ( WCC ) members and staff , on September 2 the WCC ’s central committee adopted a formal statement on the North ’s ``deep moral obligation to promote ecological justice by addressing our debts to peoples most affected by ecological destruction and to the earth itself . ’’
The WCC slams ``the agro-industrial - economic complex and the culture of the North , characterized by the consumerist lifestyle and the view of development as commensurate with exploitation of the earth 's so - called natural resources ’’ , and cites the eco-debt definition pioneered by Accion Ecologica of Ecuador : ``historical and current resource - plundering , environmental degradation and the dumping of greenhouse gases and toxic wastes . ’’
Like the USA ’s ``Superfund ’’ legislation or any other damages paid by corporations for messes made – such as Thor Chemicals ’ notorious mercury spillage a few dozen kilometres from my Durban home , now leaking into the city ’s bulk water supply at the Inanda Dam – the point is to get a general estimate of clean - up costs and a rough estimate of damages done .
As compensation , flows of grant funding are required – hopefully via an accountable , fair , transparent system such as a basic income grant for all residents of Africa ( a Namibian pilot is showing excellent results ) – instead of the kinds of corrupting carbon trade financing that dictators or big corporations currently grab hold of and redirect to adverse ends .
Carbon market
What is a carbon market regime and why is it counterproductive ?
This is the heart of the debate about the merits of a Copenhagen deal .
Carbon trading allows corporations and governments generating greenhouse gases to seemingly reduce their net emissions .
They can do this , thanks to the Kyoto Protocol , by trading for others ’ reductions ( e.g. CDM projects in the Third World ) or emissions rights ( e.g. Eastern Europe ’s ``hot air ’’ that followed the 1990s economic collapse ) .
Why do they do it ?
The pro-trading rationale is that once property rights are granted to polluters for their emissions , a ``cap ’’ can be put on a country ’s or the world ’s total emissions ( and then progressively lowered if there is political will ) .
So as to minimise adverse economic impact , corporations can stay within the cap even by emitting way above it , by buying others ’ rights to pollute .
But the carbon market is n’t working , for several reasons :
the idea of inventing a property right to pollute is effectively the privatisation of the air ; the idea of inventing a property right to pollute is effectively the privatisation of the air ;
the corporations most responsible for pollution and the World Bank – which is most responsible for fossil - fuel financing – are behind the market , and can be expected to engage in systemic corruption to attract money into the market even if this prevents genuine emissions reductions ;
many of the offsetting projects – such as monocultural timber plantations , forest ``protection ’’ and landfill methane - electricity projects – have devastating impacts on local communities and ecologies ;
the price is haywire , having crashed by half in a short period in April 2006 and by two - thirds in 2008 ;
there is a serious potential for carbon markets to become an out - of - control , multi-trillion dollar speculative bubble , similar to exotic financial instruments associated with Enron ’s 2002 collapse ( indeed , many Enron employees populate the carbon markets ) ;
as a ``false solution ’’ to climate change , carbon trading encourages merely small , incremental shifts , and thus distracts us from a wide range of radical changes we need to make in materials extraction , production , distribution , consumption and disposal ; and
the idea of market solutions to market failure is an ideology that rarely makes sense , and especially not following the world ’s worst - ever financial market failure .
Recall that scientists insist an 80 % cut in emissions will be necessary within four decades at most , with the major cuts before 2020 .
To achieve this , carbon markets wo n’t work , as the leading US climate scientist , James Hansen , remarked in opposition to Barack Obama ’s cap and trade scheme .
Obama ’s legislation – the Waxman - Markey bill that passed the US House of Representaives in June 2009 – is so profoundly flawed it should be scrapped .
Some excellent movements have sprung up to try to prevent US carbon trading and the destruction of Environmental Protection Agency powers to regulate carbon pollution , on which Waxman - Markey is especially wicked .
( Please help by joining scores of groups disgusted with Obama ’s legislation , at http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/action/toolbox/ACESA/sign-on_letter.html and http://www.climatesos.org – and do give a miss to pro-``Hopenhagen '' campaigners like Avaaz , the World Wildlife Federation , the ``Climate Action Network ’’ and other deal - doers who either have n’t thought through the issues properly or who wallow in conflicts of interest as carbon - traders themselves . )
In sum , the emissions trade is a bogus ``false solution ’’.
Very different forms of climate finance are required at the Copenhagen summit in December , including the North ’s payment of ecological debt .
But Zenawi and others from Africa – especially civil society – will have to work much harder to put climate compensation on the agenda ( and to ensure that governments corrupted by the fossil fuel industry and other transnational corporations , as well as local elites , do not become the vehicle for distributing the compensation ) .
For a ` Seattle ’ at Copenhagen
While carbon trading is at the heart of Copenhagen negotiations , any deal done will be a step backwards .
The Durban Group for Climate Justice – founded in 2004 in South Africa - is the main civil society network explicitly fighting carbon trading ; a superb analysis by Larry Lohmann is available from the Dag Hammarskjold Foundation at http://www.dhf.uu.se/pdffiler/DD2006_48_carbon_trading/carbon_trading_web_HQ.pdf.
One of our other gurus , University of KwaZulu - Natal honorary professor Dennis Brutus , puts the challenge ahead quite frankly : ``My own view is that a corrupt deal is being concocted in Copenhagen with the active collaboration of NGOs who have been bought off by the corporations , especially oil and transport .
They may even be well - intentioned but they are barking up the wrong tree . ’’
Instead of a bad deal , Brutus recommends that we all ``Seattle ’’ Copenhagen , i.e. the AU insiders work with massed protest outside to prevent the North from doing a deal in their interests , against Africa ’s and the planet ’s .
A decade ago , that formula stopped the World Trade Organisation ’s Millennial Round from succeeding in Seattle , and in 2003 the feat was repeated in Cancun .
`` We ’re outta here ’’ , Zenawi may well say in Copenhagen , for on September 3 , he issued a strong threat from Addis Ababa : `` If need be we are prepared to walk out of any negotiations that threatens to be another rape of our continent . ’’
To ``Seattle ’’ Copenhagen would entail civil society protesting outside and African governments working for Africans ’ interests inside , to halt a dirty deal that makes matters worse .
Even with less than 100 days to go , Brutus insists it ’s feasible , and would then allow us to move on to the real emissions reduction and alternative energy and production systems the world desperately needs .

Posted on by Jason Dyer
[ This post is written for the non-mathematician .
So if there ’s something that needs clarification , please ask ! ]
About seven weeks ago Timothy Gowers started the Polymath project .
It seems to me that , at least in theory , a different model could work : different , that is , from the usual model of people working in isolation or collaborating with one or two others .
Suppose one had a forum ( in the non-technical sense , but quite possibly in the technical sense as well ) for the online discussion of a particular problem .
The idea would be that anybody who had anything whatsoever to say about the problem could chip in .
And the ethos of the forum — in whatever form it took — would be that comments would mostly be kept short .
[ Source : Is massively collaborative mathematics possible ? ]
Dr. Gowers chose a problem in mathematics that he thought amenable to an online collaborative approach , then kicked things off with a blog post .
Six weeks later , the main problem he proposed was declared ( essentially ) solved .
However , the project still continues apace , especially at threads at Terry Tao ’s blog .
I ’m going to explain the main idea of what Polymath accomplished in as comprehensible a manner as possible .
I . But first , a related problem
So , Tic - Tac - Toe : X and O alternate turns , and whoever gets 3 of their own symbol in a row wins ; if the board is filled there ’s a tie .
I remember figuring out the “ perfect game ” strategy when I was 7 and smoking all challengers .
Due to its simplicity , people teaching recreational mathematics like to use it as a starting example .
Let ’s change the game a little , and say before gameplay begins , some of the squares are “ removed ” .
You ’ll notice it ’s still possible to get 3 in a row in the last row or the last column , but it ’s not much of a game anymore .
However , we are n’t really caring about the game itself , but rather :
Make as few removals as possible so that it is impossible to get 3 in a row .
How many empty squares are left ?
You might be wondering ( after you do a third removal in the lower right corner , and count 6 squares remaining , giving an answer of 6 ) how this might be a problem worthy of mathematicians .
To answer that , we need to take things to the next level …
II .
Multi-dimensional tic-tac-toe
Now it gets interesting !
Let ’s suppose you are playing multi-dimensional tic-tac - toe on the board above ( dimensions of 4x4x4 ) .
Question # 1 : After removing the fewest squares possible so there ’s no way to win , how many squares are left open ?
( Feel free to attempt this and leave your answer in the comments . )
Now , take the same problem to any size board and any dimension .
This is known as the Moser ’s cube problem .
One of the major accomplishments of the Polymath project so far is to obtain a value for , which takes the classic 3×3 tic - tac - toe board into 5 dimensions ( so 3x3x3x3x3 ) and asks how many squares are left after removing the minimum number of squares to prevent a win ( which turned out to be 124 ) .
Take a look at how elaborate the proof was .
III .
Some notation
When doing anything in mathematics , it helps to have a common notation .
Notice in the grid above I have numbered the columns from left to right as 1 - 3 , and the rows from bottom to top as 1 - 3 , and write each square as the number of the column followed by the number of the row .
This way when I talk about one possible solution , instead of saying I remove the upper left , center , and bottom right squares , I can talk about removals 13 , 22 , and 31 leaving behind squares 23 , 33 , 12 , 32 , 11 , and 21 .
( Question # 2 : How many possible solutions are there ? )
Of course this can be extended to further dimensions :
For example , the lower right square in the third grid is the number 413 .
IV .
Combinatorial lines
What we ’ve been using so far are called geometric lines .
As I already mentioned , part of the Polymath group worked with ( and are still working with ) this type of line , but there are others .
Let ’s say with the 4x4x4 example above .
Call the character * a wild card , sort of the Joker in a card deck .
When I say * 21 , that is shorthand for giving four different numbers :
121
221
321
421
or * 4 * is
141
242
343
444
Every set formed by the wildcard procedure is called a combinatoric line .
There ’s a lot of overlap with geometric lines , but there are geometric lines which are not combinatoric lines :
However , all combinatoric lines are also geometric lines .
( Side note : geometric lines can be represented by two wildcards : suppose * means 1 - 2 - 3 , and @ means 3 - 2 - 1 , then *@ is the geometric line 13 - 22 - 31 , just as in the diagram above . )
V . The big problem
Once again we ’re removing points on the tic - tac - toe grid , but this time we want to avoid any combinatoric lines .
Note this can lead to setups which remove all combinatoric lines but not all geometric ones :
13-22-31 would clearly win Tic - Tac - Toe , but it is n’t a combinatoric line because it ca n’t be represented by using the * wildcard .
Time for the big problem : let ’s restrict ourselves to what ’s called the k=3 case , meaning our numbers only go 1 to 3 , but we can change the dimension to whatever we want ( 3 , 3×3 [ normal Tic - Tac - Toe ] , 3x3x3 , 3x3x3x3 , etc. )
Let n be the dimension of the grid .
For each dimension n , get rid of all the combinatorial lines in as few removals as possible ; let the number of empty spaces left after this is done .
We then want to prove that as the number of dimensions increases towards infinity , the ratio of empty spaces ( ) to total spaces ( ) approaches zero .
This problem is called the density Hales - Jewett problem .
There already existed a proof , but it used somewhat indirect and abtruse methods from ergodic theory .
The idea of the project is to produce a new proof , using “ purely combinatoric ” methods , which can be thought of ( roughly ) as “ in a more intuitive way ” .
The proof that was discovered was restricted to k=3 as above , but it seems quite possible to take the same method to any k , which the Polymath group is now doing .
( UPDATE : Has now done . )

A BBC presenter has attacked the decision to invite the leader of the British National Party ( BNP ) on to BBC1's Question Time tonight , warning that the move " completely contradicts " rules on impartiality and would erode the public 's trust in the Corporation .
Michael Rosen , the former children 's laureate , accused the broadcaster of " hiding behind " the BNP 's European election victories to justify its decision , adding that executives " were relishing " the ratings that the broadcast is expected to receive .
" It is failing in the very impartiality that it claims to be trying to uphold , " he said .
The BBC Trust is due to be handed a letter from anti-fascist protesters this morning calling for the decision to invite Mr Griffin to take part in the programme to be reversed .
However , last night the Trust rejected an appeal by the Welsh Secretary , Peter Hain , to block Mr Griffin 's appearance because the BNP had an illegal constitution .
The media have been prevented from attending the recording of the show , or even watching a live feed .
A spokesman cited " logistical " reasons , but in the past , journalists have been allowed to watch a live feed of the broadcast .
The programme will be recorded earlier than normal to allow editors to delete any libellous comments .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Rosen , who presents Radio 4's Word of Mouth , said that the Corporation had " utterly failed in its journalistic duties " in its attitude to handling the BNP after two members who appeared on Radio 1 said the England footballer Ashley Cole was not " ethnically British " .
He added that the BBC 's championing of the " trust agenda " , introduced after controversy over a documentary about the Queen , had been ignored in pushing ahead with Mr Griffin 's appearance .
" It will lose my trust and that of others if it goes ahead with this , " he said .
" The BBC is not just any ordinary organisation .
It is like a public place – we all own it and need to be a part of it .
It has a responsibility to everyone .
" They make this very clear when you work for them .
If I were to say anything remotely similar to the things Nick Griffin has said and will say tonight , I would not be allowed on .
The BNP 's whole notion of reversing immigration rests on the notion that many people should n't be here ... the people that the BNP target are licence - fee payers . "
He added : " The BBC is obsessed with putting things ' through compliance ' , to ensure no one will find programmes politically , sexually or socially offensive .
I have been stopped from reading a poem that contained one swear word before .
Yet while they go into palpitations over things Jonathan Ross says , they are allowing Nick Griffin airtime to say things that will offend millions . "
Meanwhile , Mr Griffin welcomed the BBC 's decision .
" This could be the key moment that propels the BNP into the big time .
Never before have we had the chance to present our patriotic , common - sense solutions to Britain 's nightmare situation to the public at large in such a prominent fashion . "
The BBC's Director General Mark Thompson said ministers would have to impose a broadcasting ban , as it did with Sinn Fein in the 1980s , before it would consider breaching its its " central principle of impartiality . "
Writing in The Guardian , he said : " Keeping Nick Griffin off air tonight is a job for parliament , not the BBC . "
Hundreds of protesters are expected to gather outside the BBC tonight , and police are poised for violent clashes .
The programme may be moved to a secret location should it prove too dangerous to ferry guests to the studio in BBC Television Centre , west London .
Weyman Bennett , joint national secretary of Unite Against Fascism , said : " The BBC will be responsible for any increase in racist attacks that take place after they have gone ahead with this . "
A spokesman for the BBC said : " The BNP received more than one million votes at the European elections and we do allow parties on once they reach a certain level of support . "
A Tempe pastor is raising eyebrows with his prayers that include his pleas for the death of President Barack Obama .
Steven Anderson , 28 , was featured on CNN this week for the content of his sermons , including one earlier this month titled " Why I Hate Barack Obama . "
An audio of the sermon posted on Anderson 's Web site includes what Anderson contends is proof found in scripture that " God hates Barack Obama . "
Anderson gave the sermon on Aug. 16 while Obama and his family were visiting Arizona .
" I 'd like to see Barack Obama melt like a snail tonight , " Anderson said in the sermon , referencing the practice of pouring salt on slugs .
" He ought to be aborted . "
An expert on CNN said Secret Service agents had likely visited Anderson because of the content of his sermons .
Anderson , who ministers at Faithful Word Baptist Church , did not return a call or e-mail for comment .
Chris Broughton , the 28 - year - old Tempe resident who gained national notoriety after carrying a rifle to protest President Obama 's appearance last week in downtown Phoenix , has said Anderson is his pastor .
Anderson last appeared in the news in the spring , following a dispute with Border Patrol agents and Arizona Department of Public Safety officers that he turned into a YouTube video .
Anderson 's attorney in the Border Patrol - DPS dispute said he was unaware of his client 's Obama sermon or any subsequent contact with law - enforcement officials .
In April , Anderson claimed DPS officers and border patrol agents beat him following a stop at a checkpoint on Interstate 8 about 70 miles east of Yuma .
Anderson was charged with disorderly conduct , and the case is headed to court in Yuma on Sept. 29 .
In the months before that incident , Anderson posted several YouTube videos in which he confronts authorities .
In February , he posted a video showing an encounter he says was at a checkpoint at the New Mexico border .
He keeps his windows rolled up .
He questions the agents on why he 's being stopped .
In March , he shot a video titled " Another Cop Harasses me for ABSOLUTELY NO REASON * Minnesota . "
In January , he posted another video shot at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport .
He walks up to a Phoenix police officer and asks him about his machine gun .
When the officer replies that it 's none of his business , Anderson says , " It 's none of my business ?
Do n't you work for me since I 'm a citizen of Phoenix and of the United States ? "
" It 's not that I hate police officers and it's not that I 'm anti-government or anti-authority , " Anderson said in April .
" I 'm a Baptist pastor ; I 'm not some sort of anarchist . "
Is political correctness to blame for lack of coverage over horrific black - on - white killings in America 's Deep South ?
It was the kind of crime that strikes terror into the hearts of parents everywhere .
A bright young couple were carjacked after a Saturday night date and murdered in the most brutal way imaginable .
Christopher Newsom , 23 , was tied up and raped , shot in the back of the head and then dragged to a railway track and set on fire .
His girlfriend , 21 - year - old University of Tennessee student Channon Christian ’s fate was even more horrific .
Her death came only after hours of torture , during which time she was raped and savaged with a broken chair leg .
She was beaten in the head and a household bleach was poured down her throat and over her bleeding and battered genital area in an attempt by her attackers to cover any evidence of rape – all while she was still alive .
Torture : Channon Christian was forced to watch the attackers rape and kill her boyfriend Christopher Newsom before she was murdered
Then she was ‘ hog - tied ’ with curtains and a strip of bedding and a plastic bag was wrapped over her face .
Her body was stashed inside five bigger rubbish liners and dumped in a bin , where , according to the autopsy report , she slowly suffocated to death .
On Monday , the alleged ringleader of the gang accused of the killings goes on trial in Knoxville , Tennessee .
One of the gang has already been convicted and sentenced to life in prison without parole .
But , even though the killings happened in January , 2007 , they have attracted very little national and international coverage .
That ’s because they do not fit into the conventional contours of an attack in America ’s Deep South , where a shameful history of racial intolerance has meant assaults by whites on blacks have historically been regarded in the context of race .
In this case , the races were reversed : the victims were white and the four men and one woman charged in connection with the murders are black .
Ironically , the case has now generated more publicity surrounding the furore over whether or not political correctness was behind the US media ’s decision to largely ignore the story than it did for the murders themselves .
Lemaricus Davidson , centre , goes on trial in Tennessee over the murders this week .
Letalvis Cobbins , top right , has been jailed for life .
Eric Boyd , Vanessa Coleman and George Thomas will be tried after Davidson
Life : Letalvis ' Rome ' Cobbins was found guilty of multiple counts of first degree murder .
He was also convicted of rape , kidnapping and robbery
Defence lawyers were quick to say that some of the accused dated white women and even prosecutors denied any racial overtones .
‘ There is absolutely no proof of a hate crime , ’ said John Gill , special counsel to Knox County District Attorney Randy Nichols .
‘ It was a terrible crime , a horrendous crime , but race was not a motive .
We know from our investigation that the people charged in this case were friends with white people , socialised with white people , dated white people .
' So not only is there no evidence of any racial animus , there ’s evidence to the contrary , ’ he added .
But that has n’t stopped conservative critics from blaming liberal bias in the US mainstream media for failing to cover the attacks .
Columnist and right - wing blogger Michelle Malkin weighed in , saying : ‘ This case – an attractive white couple murdered by five black thugs –does n’t fit any political agenda .
' It ’s not a useful crime .
Reverse the races and just imagine how the national media would cover the story of a young black couple murdered by five white assailants . ’
Country music singer Charlie Daniels pointed out the media frenzy that came after a black woman accused three white members of the Duke University lacrosse team of raping her .
The players were later cleared after their accuser changed her story .
But Daniels said on his website : ‘ If this had been white on black crime , Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson and their ilk would have descended on Knoxville like a swarm of angry bees . ’
Victims : Channon christian , 21 , and boyfriend Christopher Newsom , 23 , were carjacked and murdered after a Saturday night date in Tennessee in 2007
Much of the criticism over the scant coverage of the murders has been on the internet through blogs and websites .
University of Tennessee law professor Glenn Reynolds said the American media has a ‘ template ’ for covering white - on - black crime but not the reverse .
‘ I think it would have gotten a lot of national play faster if it had been a black couple kidnapped and killed by five white people , ’ he told the local paper in Knoxville .
White supremacists have jumped onto the bandwagon , seeking to twist the facts for their own racist agenda .
They spread false details about the murders , claiming the victims were sexually dismembered and that Channon was sexually tortured for days , neither of which is true .
‘ The DA ’s office is outraged they have tried to abuse the victims by using the death of loved ones for racist purposes , ’ John Gill said .
‘ The things that have been seized on by these hate groups are things that never happened . ’
‘ There are people out there that just want to make something even worse than what it already is , ’ Channon ’s father , Gary Christian , said in a recent interview .
But Chris ’s father , Hugh , told a local TV station : ‘ Would they have done that to a black couple ?
I do n’t think so . ’
‘ With all the things they did to them , what else could you call it but hate ? ’ his wife , Mary , said .
‘ I think any kind of crime like that ’s a hate crime .
Was it racial ?
No , I do n’t think so ' , Mr Christian added .
Outrage : Campaigners believe the murders have n't received extensive media coverage because of race issues
Knox County Sheriff Jimmy Jones said : ‘ I do n’t believe if they ’d been Mexican , Chinese or Japanese it would have mattered .
I believe these people were evil .
' I believe it was a plan .
These two kids just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time . ’
According to court testimony , Chris , a talented carpenter and former high school baseball player , and college senior Channon had gone to a friend ’s home after a date at a local restaurant when they were held up at gunpoint and carjacked on January 6 , 2007 .
They were forced to drive to an old clapboard house in one of Knoxville ’s toughest neighbourhoods , where their captors , some of them ex-convicts , subjected them to the nightmare ordeal .
Wearing glasses and dressed smartly in trousers , a collared shirt and jumper , Lemaricus Davidson , 28 , looked more like a college student than an accused killer during pre-trial hearings .
The seven women and five man jury includes just one black juror .
If convicted , Davidson could face the death penalty .
In a separate trial last month , Davidson ’s brother , Letalvis Cobbins , 27 , was sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of multiple counts of first degree murder .
He was also convicted of rape , kidnapping and robbery .
George Thomas , 27 , and Cobbins ’ former girlfriend , Vannessa Coleman , 21 , will be tried after Davidson .
A fifth defendant , Eric Boyd , 37 , is serving an 18 - year prison sentence after being convicted of being an accessory to a fatal carjacking .

Consumers said no to the GM farming giants a decade ago , but that did n't stop millions of tonnes of their soya entering the food chain
Ten years ago , when the genetic modification of food was first offered to the British public , it responded with a resounding no , and politicians and the food industry said GM would not be foisted on reluctant consumers .
As far as most people are concerned , that is still the situation today ; they think their diet remains GM - free .
A report from the Royal Society to be published on Wednesday will spark an intense new phase in the GM debate , however , during which the public may be surprised to discover how far GM has already penetrated our food supply .
The report 's contents are strictly embargoed but it's a safe bet that its authors , many of whom work in biotechnology research , will argue that we need to put aside any suspicions and embrace GM if there is to be any chance of feeding the world 's growing population in the face of climate change and growing scarcity of water and land .
The government has been waiting for the report since a cabinet meeting at the turn of the year .
Back then the prime minister , all secretaries of state with responsibilities that touch upon food , the chief scientist Sir John Beddington , and the then chair of the Food Standards Agency Dame Deirdre Hutton , got together to discuss what they saw as an urgent dilemma : they believed that the official line on GM had become untenable , according to a well - placed source .
Of the 2.6 m tonnes of soya imported into the UK last year , nearly two - thirds was genetically modified .
The vast majority of this came from the Americas and was used as animal feed , although most people remain unaware of it .
GM soya oil is also now used in quantity in the catering industry , according to government reports .
" We are living a lie " , is how one senior food industry executive put it in discussions with Whitehall officials .
" My wake up and worry moments are about high levels of GM being found in the UK feed chain where it 's claimed to be GM - free , " a leading retail figure has told the Guardian .
Shipping in GM soya is perfectly legal , so long as the varieties imported are ones that have been authorised by the EU .
The variety of GM soya that currently dominates global production , Monsanto 's Roundup Ready , has been authorised by the EU .
However , some newer varieties have not yet been approved here .
Importing even trace levels of unauthorised varieties is illegal , and industry has been pushing hard to have the approval process speeded up .
Any GM food sold directly to the consumer also has to be labelled .
With so much imported GM soya in the system , a senior official told us : " It seems increasingly unlikely that food on the shelves in the UK is free of GM .
Identity - preserved chains [ in which manufacturers and retailers track the source of their soya at every stage back to non-GM plantings ] are becoming very , very difficult and there is just so much GM coming in , the probability is that , if you tested food from the supermarket shelf , you would find traces of GM in it .
There is great anxiety about it . "
In fact a special report on food commissioned by the prime minister from the Cabinet Office strategy unit highlighted GM as an immediate domestic issue back in the summer of 2008 .
It said : " Consumer confidence in UK regulations , regulators and food supplies might be prejudiced if GM feed was found in systems claiming to be GM - free or if non-authorised varieties were detected in the UK food chain .
If non-authorised material is found , there are also significant cost implications associated with recall . "
Perhaps fortunately for industry and government , almost no GM testing of food products is currently conducted .
To keep ahead of a crisis , the cabinet meeting decided that the independent Royal Society report would represent an opportunity for a respectable shift in government position .
Several departments have been persuaded that GM will be needed to tackle the pressures of population growth and climate change .
Many scientists have also argued that GM research could make some contribution to calming the " perfect storm " threatening global food supply that Beddington has warned we face in the coming decades .
It was also agreed that the Food Standards Agency should reopen the debate with the public about GM – which it did last month by announcing new research on consumer opinion .
Announcements from the Department for the Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) over the summer also began to frame GM as a new moral imperative in feeding the world .
A Defra spokeswoman said today : " We have not yet seen the report , but we look forward to its release and will read it with interest .
Our top priority is to safeguard human health and the environment and always follow the science .
We recognise that GM crops could offer a range of potential benefits over the longer term . "
Up for a fight
The anti-GM lobby meanwhile have been squaring up for a fight over the Royal Society report ever since the project was conceived .
A group of development and environmental charities wrote an open letter last October , accusing the Royal Society of failing to look at the real causes of the global food crisis .
They said that the new work would be " of limited value " if it focused on " proprietary technologies " controlled by agribusiness .
They also asked why it was needed when a UN - sponsored four - year review , involving more than 400 international scientists and chaired by Defra 's own chief scientist , Professor Robert Watson , had already concluded that GM technologies were unlikely to have more than a limited role in tackling global hunger .
According to the Watson - led review , the scientific evidence on the claimed benefits of GM suggests they are variable , with increases in yield in some areas but decreases in others , and both greater and lesser pesticide use in different contexts .
But crucially it concluded that global hunger is as much to do with power and control of the food system as with growing enough food .
Tim Lang , professor of food policy at London 's City University and government adviser on sustainable development , says : " There is no technical fix to the huge issue of food security .
If there were a " people 's GM " , I would n't be against it .
But the problem with GM is the way it has been introduced , primarily as a way of maintaining the sales of pesticide companies . "
The concentration of corporate power in commercial seed and agrochemical production is unprecedented , as is its crossover with the powerful US - based commodity trading corporations Cargill , ADM and Bunge .
In the space of less than three decades , intellectual property rights have been applied to 82 % of the global seed market , according to data collected by campaign group ETC .
Three companies now control nearly half of the total global market in proprietary seeds , worth $ 22bn ( £ 13.5 bn ) a year .
In 2007 , the US - based Monsanto accounted for nearly a quarter of the total global market ( 23 % ) , followed by another American company , DuPont ( 15 % ) and Swiss - headquartered Syngenta ( 9 % ) .
Just six companies – the above three plus Bayer , BASF and Dow AgroSciences – control three - quarters of the global agrochemical market .
Until recently they were often engaged in bitter litigation with each other – DuPont is currently claiming that Monsanto operates an illegal monopoly in the US , an allegation denied by Monsanto and being investigated along with soya seed price hikes by the US department of justice .
But the more recent trend has been to form strategic alliances .
For example , in 2007 Monsanto and Syngenta dropped litigation over intellectual property rights against each other and agreed cross-licences instead .
For John Fagan , chief scientist at Cert - ID , it is this corporate concentration and the realities of global trade that are at the heart of the UK government 's perceived dilemma over GM .
Fagan does not believe the dilemma is a real one .
His company is the leading US certifier of non-GM soya for import from Brazil to Europe and the idea that GM - free chains of supply are too hard to maintain is " garbage " he says .
Brazil has more than enough GM - free soya to keep the UK going and , despite the fears of the food and farming industry and Whitehall departments , will continue to plant non-GM so long as it gets paid to keep different supplies segregated .
" The big US agricultural commodity traders Cargill , ADM and Bunge have major biotech seed research projects of their own , " said Fagan .
" They have deep alliances with Monsanto and Syngenta .
They want US GM soya to be accepted uncritically in Europe and they would prefer every soya bean on the planet to be equal to every other soya bean because that 's what profitable commodity trading is about . "
There is unease among scientists too that agribusiness restricts the kind of research on GM that might actually spread any potential benefits .
An editorial in Scientific American magazine complained recently that it was " impossible to verify that genetically modified crops perform as advertised " .
" Agritech companies have given themselves the power of veto of the work of independent researchers .
Under threat of litigation , scientists cannot compare seeds … [ or test whether ] crops lead to unintended environmental effects ...
Only studies the seed companies have approved see the light of day , " it said .
The Royal Society report looks certain to walk into a perfect storm all of its own .

Advertisement Gamers could be joining in a real televised sporting event from their homes early in 2010 .
Real Time Race has been developing a system that places players side - by - side with the drivers in real races .
The firm 's technology would map the circuit just before the race so the virtual track would match up to the one on TV .
The video recording of the track would then be manipulated by the gamer during live coverage .
This data would then be streamed to the player 's computer or straight to a television via the internet .
" We can put you in your own car , within real TV coverage of a real race , and in real time against the professionals , " said Chris Leigh , the company 's head .
Car using lasers and 360 degree HD images to capture circuits in video " When Jenson Button nails his car from the front you can go and chase after him and try and beat him to the first corner , " he said .
Immersive experience
To make this possible , ahead of the race , a car with a mounted five headed - camera would need to do a lap to film a 360 degree picture of each part of the track .
Unlike current video manipulation , which rotates the picture , this system allows users to move to places where the camera has not been but still offer a video footage experience .
Roderick Kennedy , the technical officer at Real Time Race , said this gave drivers an immersive driving experience .
" Our data gathering system can generate an image from anywhere on the track so you can drive freely around the track . "
GPS sensors help pinpoint a car 's position to within a few centimetres , while a rotating drum fires off 64 lasers .
The returning light tells the system the distance to objects .
Chris Leigh 's company has been developing the tech for four years
It works like a radar , except this system can map 1.3 million points a second and produce a high - resolution 3D model which the video is " mapped " on to .
Gamer interaction Software compiles all this information to recreate the racing environment , including details such as photo - realistic curves that glint in the sun .
Mark Wilkin , the F1 Editor at the BBC , says audiences are becoming more demanding in the level of sophistication they expect in interactive TV .
" They kind of get CGI [ computer generated - imagery ] - they 've seen it , they 've done it , and it 's no longer interesting , " he said .
" It needs to be real , it needs to look real . "
He believes that if future games are to be based on actual races , games companies will need to get the interaction right .
" When you bump into Alonso , he 's not really going to go flying off the track , so how are they going to do that ?
That will be interesting to see . "
Compromises may be needed to fit in with the live coverage , but players could benefit from live television commentary with tailored recorded notes to cover their own progress .
First image showing what players could expect to see on their screens
Also , if the weather changes on television this could be reflected in the racing game .
Finishing touches Gamers would download the circuits ahead of time to their PCs or TVs to keep the constant data stream required to a minimum .
During the race , just each car 's co-ordinates and orientation would be constantly updated .
The system 's makers hope it will be usable across different sports too such as skiing , cycling , and sailing .
The " rules of engagement " for drivers are yet to be finalised , the software finessed , and integrated into a real sport .
Sports rights will need to be agreed , and TV companies approached .
But the company says it is making fast progress on all of these issues .
After four years of research , Mr Leigh expects the technology will be ready to take on a real motor sport series next year .
But keen gamers can download a demo for now .

Brazil : Evangelical leader tied to Lula government charged with wholesale fraud
By Ali Ismail
15 September 2009
Last month , prosecutors in Brazil charged the founder of one of Brazil ’s largest evangelical churches with committing fraud against its followers , many of them poverty - stricken , as well as the church itself .
Bishop Edir Macedo and nine other people associated with the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God ( Igreja Universal do Reino de Deus ) are suspected of diverting hundreds of millions of dollars in donations to businesses and television stations , and for their personal enrichment .
The majority of donations to the church are from working class followers , many of whom live in poverty .
“ São Paulo state ’s prosecutors office alleged in a statement that Macedo and others took more than $ 2 billion in donations from 2003 to 2008 alone , but charged that the alleged scheme went back ten years , ” the Associated Press reported .
The church receives hundreds of millions of dollars in donations from followers spread across thousands of temples in Brazil .
Prosecutors said the church asked followers for donations to fund new temples and religious television programs , but Macedo and his partners used the funds to purchase businesses to enhance their personal wealth .
While the accused have denied the latest charges brought against them , there is no denying that the charges are part of a larger pattern .
The church was under investigation for embezzlement and tax evasion during the 1990s , although the number of members has continued to increase rapidly since then , with its leaders claiming that they are victims of religious persecution .
The Universal Church of the Kingdom of God was founded by Macedo in 1977 .
He now owns Rede Record , the country ’s second - largest TV network , several radio stations , a tourism agency , and an air taxi company .
While the majority of his followers endure poverty and social inequality , Macedo has done quite well for himself .
The church has also been accused of having money - laundering ties to Colombian drug lords .
Brazilian prosecutors believe these ties could go back to the 1980s .
The charges against Macedo came just over a week after two other evangelical leaders returned to Brazil from the United States after serving a two - year sentence for attempting to smuggle money into the US .
Estevam Hernandes Filho and Sonia Haddad Moraes had attempted to smuggle more than $ 56,000 through the airport in Miami in 2007 .
The couple stuffed their luggage and their child ’s backpack and Bible case with cash , hoping to bypass a law that requires visitors to the US to declare if they are bringing more than $ 10,000 with them into the country .
Following their arrest in the US , Brazil sought to have them extradited on charges of fraud , larceny , and money laundering .
These charges are still pending .
Brazilian officials accuse the couple of spending donations they received from their mostly impoverished followers on personal luxuries like mansions and horse farms .
Estevam Hernandes Filho and Sonia Haddad Moraes founded the Reborn in Christ Church in 1986 .
The church has a large number of members and more than 1,200 temples in Brazil .
Although Pentecostal churches have existed in Brazil since the early twentieth century , the movement did not begin to spread until the 1960s and 1970s — the period of military dictatorship — mostly through religious radio and television programs , often backed by US Protestant denominations .
The number of evangelicals doubled in Brazil during the 1990s , and there are now more than 30 million in the country .
The Universal Church of the Kingdom of God has turned Brazil into an exporter of religion , having set up branches in scores of countries , including nearly 80 churches in the US .
The growth of the movement has come at the expense of the Roman Catholic Church .
In 1980 , Catholics represented 88 percent of the Brazilian population ; they now represent less than 70 percent .
The growing number of converts from Catholicism is a direct challenge to the political power of the Roman Catholic Church .
The Vatican has accused the Pentecostal churches of being overly aggressive in seeking converts and refers to these churches as “ sects . ”
The success of the evangelicals can be attributed in no small measure to the disillusionment of more impoverished sectors of Brazil ’s working class with the failure of a succession of corrupt and reactionary civilian governments — including the present administration of Workers Party ( PT ) President Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva — to produce any significant improvement in social conditions .
The evangelical churches have attracted converts through a gospel of faith - based individual financial success and a populist style incorporating pop music and a stripped - down theology .
The evangelical movement ’s influence on Brazilian politics has increased drastically since the movement ’s early days .
In both 2002 and 2006 , Lula chose as his running mate Jose Alencar , a textile magnate and leader of the right - wing Brazilian Republican Party ( PRB ) , which functions virtually as a political arm of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God .
There are more than 60 evangelicals in the Brazilian parliament , including PRB senator and Lula ally Marcelo Crivella , a nephew of the church ’s indicted leader , Edir Macedo .
These evangelical legislators usually come together to vote on so - called social issues , opposing abortion rights , stem cell research and homosexual marriage .
Evangelicals have repeatedly controlled the governorship of the state of Rio de Janeiro .
Religious rhetoric has routinely been used as a campaign tactic by candidates in this state , which is one of Brazil ’s most populated .
The movement is influential enough to have compelled Brazil ’s president to meet with evangelical leaders at least three times during his 2006 campaign for re-election .
Lula went so far as to say , “ For many years of my life , people said if I was elected , I would close the doors of the evangelical churches .
I say today that the evangelical church does n’t have any doubts about President Lula , and President Lula does n’t have any doubts about the evangelical church . ”
The Brazilian government has aided the growth of the evangelical movement by allowing some churches to directly distribute forms of public assistance including welfare checks .
It is not difficult to imagine how this aid distribution helps win over converts in poverty - stricken neighborhoods and line the pockets of church officials .
Evangelical leaders have also come under fire for campaigning politically directly from the pulpit .
Attempts to enforce the law barring such activity have been largely futile .
Politicians associated with the evangelical movement have been mired in corruption .
They were prominently involved in the so - called mensalao scandal , in which legislators sold their votes to the government in return for monthly stipends .
And nearly half of the members of the evangelical caucus in the Brazilian parliament were implicated in a scheme in which they took bribes to purchase overpriced ambulances .
This latter scandal resulted in the RSB congressional delegation being virtually wiped out in the 2006 election .
This corruption has hardly distinguished them , however , in a political system that is overrun with bribes , payoffs and embezzlement , to the extent that it is increasingly threatened with paralysis .
The latest scandal has involved former president Jose Sarney , a leader of PMDB , which has the largest bloc in congress and functions in an alliance with the Lula government .
Sarney was found to have pushed a number of so - called “ secret acts ” through congress — laws passed but not publicly reported by the senate — handing out jobs , contracts and payola to friends and relatives .
The growth of the evangelicals has generated significant tension with the country ’s Catholic church , which , with 125 million Brazilian on its rolls , counts as the Vatican ’s largest national constituency .
In 1995 , a minister of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God kicked the statue of Our Lady of Aparecida on a national television program .
The statue is one of the most important icons for Catholics in Brazil .
When Pope John Paul traveled to Brazil in 1997 , many posters of the pontiff were defaced all over Rio de Janeiro .
Many large billboards with the Pope ’s image had gun sight targets painted over his chest .
Catholic officials blamed “ radical fundamentalists , ” referring to the evangelicals .
Archbishop Lucas Moreira
Neves stated , “ Catholics are not bellicose , nor preoccupied with this holy war , but the lack of respect for our faith could prove a factor for reaction . ”
With both sides referring to the sectarian tension as a “ holy war , ” the objective is to divide Brazilian workers along sectarian lines .
Brazil has experienced a significant amount of economic growth since the 1990s , but the growth has done nothing to reduce the rampant social inequality that pervades Brazilian society .
The concentration of wealth is among the greatest in the world , with the wealthiest 10 percent of Brazilians receiving 50 percent of the nation ’s income , while the poorest 10 percent receive less than 1 percent of the income .
Poverty is endemic , with inner-city slums ( favelas ) and underdeveloped rural areas the most negatively affected .
According to some recent estimates , over 30 percent of Brazilians live in poverty and over 10 percent live in extreme poverty , and must struggle with food insecurity .
Malnutrition has been blamed for causing high rates of school non-attendance among children and is one of the most serious problems facing Brazil ’s education system .
A lack of investment in education has caused a very high examination failure rate , which has contributed to students dropping out of school altogether .
Most Brazilians who can afford to send their children to private schools do so .
Child labor is not uncommon in Brazil despite laws requiring children to remain in school until the age of 16 .
Many Brazilians are forced to give up on education even before reaching secondary school in order to assist their parents in making ends meet .
Social inequality has led to a society ravaged by crime , ranging from drug trafficking and gang violence to robberies and kidnappings .
Brazil ’s homicide rate stands at well above 20 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants , making it one of the highest in the world .
The Brazilian ruling elite has used police terror against alleged criminals residing in slums in cities like Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo .
Innocent bystanders have been killed or injured in brutal police raids in which anyone residing in a certain neighborhood is treated like a potentially violent criminal .
Brazil ’s elite special forces unit , the Special Police Operations Battalion , or BOPE , has been trained in urban warfare and has been accused of killing innocent youths under the false pretense of them being drug dealers .
According to Amnesty International , “ Brazil ’s police forces use violent and repressive methods that consistently violate the human rights of a large part of the population . ”
Evangelical leaders seek to win converts by preaching against drug use and gang activity , in spite of multiple allegations concerning the movement ’s ties to organized crime .
But for all the hypocrisy and corruption of these leading church figures , the growth of the evangelical movement in Brazil is a manifestation of deeper processes whose source is to be found in the immense social and economic changes that have swept Brazil in the past quarter of a century .
The dramatic growth of Brazil ’s capitalist economy and its full integration into the world market have spelled the spectacular enrichment of a small layer at the top , at the expense of the country ’s working masses .
Given this unprecedented class polarization , the country ’s ruling elite and its political parties — including Lula ’s PT — are incapable of advancing any economic and social programs capable of winning a genuine mass social base .
Religion has been injected into this political vacuum as a means of diverting the anger of an increasingly discontented population .
A renewed upsurge in the class struggle in Brazil , spurred on by the deepening world capitalist crisis , will create the conditions for millions of workers to grasp this social and political role played by the evangelicals and religion in general .

Merge Early , Merge Often
Integrating changes in branched development
Dear KV ,
When doing merged development , how often should you merge ?
It 's obvious that if I wait too long , then I spend days in merge hell , where nothing seems to work and where I wind up using the revert command more often than commit ; but the whole point of branched development is to be able to protect the main branch of development from unstable changes .
Is there a happy middle ground ?
Merge Daemon
Dear Merge ,
For years people have asked me about the " happy middle ground , " not only in branched development but also in many areas .
I do n't know if you 've noticed this , but the tenor of these questions is rarely happy and even more rarely results in anything that could be considered a middle ground .
There are two related themes in dealing with merge purgatory ( if it were hell there would be no chance of escape , but from purgatory you might be able to work your way out ) .
The first theme is related to how the software you 're working on is developed .
If there are well - defined boundaries between the sections of the code , then you really should not have to enter merge purgatory at all , because if you 're working on a component , then no one else should be making changes to it ; the only differences will be yours , case closed — and well done there .
Of course , that 's pretty unlikely in any project larger than a few people .
Projects often have the problem of everyone having their fingers in all of the code .
That 's not difficult to solve if the project is small : you can simply sit down with the other participants in the project and break up the work along some logical boundaries .
In a large project you 're likely to have several people looking into and modifying the same piece of code .
Perhaps one is fixing bugs while another is developing new features , or there are two versions of the product or project that have different teams working from the same main line .
Whatever the case , there are a few things you should do to avoid purgatory — such as having an automated build process so that everyone knows when something broken got merged or checked in .
For more on this , see my response to Made to be Broken in " Broken Builds " ( forthcoming in Communications of the ACM , December 2009 ) .
The second and more relevant point to this discussion is the direction of merges .
When you 're working off in your own branch , it 's kind of like working off in a corner of a building — usually a nice quiet place , away from the hubbub of your coworkers where you can concentrate on your work and get things done .
Alas , while you 're coding in this temporary Nirvana the rest of the world continues on , with all its attendant suffering .
It would be nice if you could remain in Nirvana , but , well , you can't .
You have two choices : you can decide to remain in Nirvana as long as possible and then at the very end stride boldly into the mouth of merge purgatory , or you can allow small bits of suffering to enter your world .
The suffering , in this case , is a merge from the main branch , the one in which everyone is committing changes , and from which all of your suffering ultimately comes .
When I 'm working on branched development — and at this point that 's about 95 percent of the time — I merge early and I merge often , just like when I vote .
Now when I say " merge early " I do not mean " early in the morning . "
As a matter of fact , I pretty much never say " early in the morning " because I really do n't believe such a time exists , and anyone who tries to tell me there is such a time I consider to be a figment of my imagination .
In particular , I recommend against merging anyone else 's code before you write or debug some of your own .
Few things are more frustrating than to start your working day with someone else 's broken code messing up your beautiful branch .
Get some of the things you wanted to do done first and then integrate a bit of the main branch 's suffering into your own .
I prefer to do these kinds of merges after I feel good about having gotten some of my own work done .
At least then I 'm starting out on a high , and the drudgery of fixing my branch will bring me back to a neutral state instead of sending me down into a code depression .
I would say that on a fast - moving project you should be merging from the main branch once a day , and no less than once a week .
A lot can happen in a week , and you do n't want to spend your weekend fixing your working branch .
When is it best to merge code back into the tree ?
That depends on what you 're merging .
If it 's bug fixes , then they need to be merged as soon as they 're tested because there are likely other people depending on those bug fixes .
For features they should be complete , which means tested and ready to use .
Complete does not mean bug free .
At some point you have to stop polishing that turd and just flush it into the system .
That covers the process part of when to merge , but there is also a tool component .
Some source - code control systems simply do not have the tools to support branched development , while others encourage so much branching that code never comes back to the main line .
Avoid both of these types of systems if you want to do branched development .
A good system for branched development must include a decent tool for comparing multiple versions of a file .
In a better world it would be possible for the source - code control system to handle all merges automatically , but this is not yet possible , so the act of performing a merge is really one of handling the exceptions to the merging process .
If the tool that calculates the differences between files in different branches is a poor one , then a larger amount of work will fall to you to integrate the differences .
The reason people call it " merge hell " is n't because of the merging , per se , but because of the amount of human intervention that is required .
Do you want the code in version 1.2.2.1 that Bob wrote to be merged with your code in your current version ?
These are the types of decisions that make merging so unpleasant .
On a positive note , this is a known problem and many people are trying very hard to provide us with better tools , so it 's one area in which things are actually improving .
To sum up , my advice is to integrate changes into your branch daily — but not at the beginning of the day — and to work with a modern source - code control system that has good support for merging changes and resolving differences .

J. Paul Reed - Beyond the Fix - it Treadmill
Given that humanity ’s study of the sociological factors in safety is almost a century old , the technology industry ’s post - incident analysis practices and how we create and use the artifacts those practices produce are all still in their infancy .
So do n’t be surprised that many of these practices are so similar , that the cognitive and social models used to parse apart and understand incidents and outages are few and cemented in the operational ethos , and that the byproducts sought from post - incident analyses are far - and - away focused on remediation items and prevention .
Laura M.D. Maguire - Managing the Hidden Costs of Coordination
Some initial considerations to control cognitive costs for incident responders include : ( 1 ) assessing coordination strategies relative to the cognitive demands of the incident ; ( 2 ) recognizing when adaptations represent a tension between multiple competing demands ( coordination and cognitive work ) and seeking to understand them better rather than unilaterally eliminating them ; ( 3 ) widening the lens to study the joint cognition system ( integration of human - machine capabilities ) as the unit of analysis ; and ( 4 ) viewing joint activity as an opportunity for enabling reciprocity across inter - and intra-organizational boundaries .
Marisa R. Grayson - Cognitive Work of Hypothesis Exploration During Anomaly Response
Four incidents from web - based software companies reveal important aspects of anomaly response processes when incidents arise in web operations , two of which are discussed in this article .
One particular cognitive function examined in detail is hypothesis generation and exploration , given the impact of obscure automation on engineers ’ development of coherent models of the systems they manage .
Each case was analyzed using the techniques and concepts of cognitive systems engineering .
The set of cases provides a window into the cognitive work " above the line " in incident management of complex web - operation systems .
Richard I. Cook - Above the Line , Below the Line
Knowledge and understanding of below - the - line structure and function are continuously in flux .
Near - constant effort is required to calibrate and refresh the understanding of the workings , dependencies , limitations , and capabilities of what is present there .
In this dynamic situation no individual or group can ever know the system state .
Instead , individuals and groups must be content with partial , fragmented mental models that require more or less constant updating and adjustment if they are to be useful .

Jet -Powered Genius : 7 Ludicrously Rocket Propelled Vehicles
Obviously , ingenuity does n’t always equal common sense .
There are new examples every year of people strapping ridiculous amounts of propulsion power to things that they really should n’t .
These eight examples show just how crazy some people can be with their jet engines and rocket power .
We really do n’t condone trying any of these at home .
Nope , that portable toilet is n’t on fire .
It ’s just , for some reason , equipped with a Boeing jet engine .
The port -a - potty goes can reach a speed of 70 mph and shoots a trail of fire behind it up to 30 feet long .
Paul Sender , a mechanic , spent thousands of dollars building this monument to WTF - ness .
There probably are n’t many of us out there who have never hopped onto or into a shopping cart and taken a quick ride .
Andy Tyler , however , takes that innocent ride to a dangerous new level with his rocket - powered shopping cart .
He got instructions for building the jet engine on the internet and decided to affix it to a shopping cart he ’d fished from a river .
The powerful engine reaches very high temperatures , so Tyler had to equip the cart with a heat shield .
The crazy car can go up to 50 mph before getting a bit wobbly , but at least it ’s got a steering system and brakes .
A jet - powered lawnmower may sound like a good idea at first , but then you realize that you ca n’t actually mow the lawn with this thing .
Gary Packham ’s crazy “ Turbitrac ” tractor mower features a homemade gas turbine engine .
If you ’re just aching to make one of your own to freak out the neighbors , there are detailed instructions on Packham ’s website .
Unfortunately , the top picture from Allegro Medical is just a joke , though a very well - executed one .
But an enterprising man in England did , in fact , make an actual jet - powered wheelchair .
Giuseppe Cannella somehow found himself with a spare jet engine , and at his wife ’s suggestion decided to strap it onto his mother - in - law ’s wheelchair .
Luckily the MIL , who has Parkinson ’s Disease , had already purchased a new wheelchair .
Cannella puts on shows with the wheelchair to raise money for Parkinson ’s Disease research .
Some people say that their favorite armchair is so comfortable they never want to leave it .
You could definitely increase your sitting time by equipping your fave chair with a jet engine , just like Bill Decambre did .
This insane invention manages to look even more unsafe than most of these others , yet he looks totally at ease riding around on it .
Now if you just attached a TV to it , you could spend your last moments comfy and entertained .
Luges are supposed to go fast and be sort of deadly , but this one is going way further than you ’d expect .
Joel King used a small jet engine , one normally used on gliders and unmanned aircraft , to build this street luge .
On it , he reached a speed of 112 mph , breaking the previous world speed record .
Going that fast , inches off of the ground and with a jet engine centimeters from your head , must be exhilarating but pretty dang scary .
If you think that bicycle + motor = motorcycle , you probably have n’t seen Bob Maddox ’s jet - powered bike .
The Oregonian artist / cabinet maker likes playing with jet pulse engines , so he decided to start strapping them onto bicycles and selling them on eBay .
Mind you , this was only after skydiving with a rocket strapped to his chest because , according to him , he thought “ itâ€™d be fun to strap a jet engine to my chest and make myself into a human missile . ”
Sure , if that ’s your idea of fun .

A Proctor man driving a motorized La- Z - Boy lounge chair hit a parked vehicle while under the influence of alcohol .
Dennis LeRoy Anderson , 62 , pleaded guilty Monday in St. Louis County District Court to DWI in connection with the Aug. 31 , 2008 , incident in Proctor .
There were no injuries .
According to the criminal complaint , Anderson drove his motorized chair into a vehicle parked near a Proctor bar .
Anderson told police he was traveling from the Keyboard Lounge after consuming approximately eight or nine beers .
His blood - alcohol content was measured at 0.29 , more than three times the legal limit to drive .
Anderson claimed he was driving the chair fine until a woman jumped on it and knocked the chair off course .
He has one prior DWI conviction .
He could n’t be reached for comment Wednesday .
Proctor Deputy Police Chief Troy Foucault said the chair was powered by a converted lawnmower with a Briggs & Stratton engine .
It has a stereo , cup holders and other custom options , including different power levels .
A National Hot Rod Racing Association sticker is posted on the chair ’s head rest .
The chair had a small steering wheel , about a third of the size of a golf cart ’s , coming straight up from the middle of the La - Z - Boy .
Proctor City Prosecutor Ronald Envall said he charged Anderson under the portion of Minnesota law that makes it a crime to operate a self - propelled motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drugs .
He declined further comment .
Anderson had to forfeit his motorized chair to Proctor police , who plan to auction it with other forfeited items , Foucault said .
Duluth defense attorney David Keegan , who represented Anderson , declined comment .
Sixth Judicial District Judge Heather Sweetland sentenced Anderson to 180 days in the St. Louis County Jail or at the Northeast Regional Corrections Center and fined him $ 2,000 plus court fees .
She stayed the jail time and one - half of the fine for two years of supervised probation .
As conditions of his probation , Anderson must submit to a chemical dependency assessment , follow all recommendations , abstain from alcohol and unprescribed drugs , be subject to random testing and undergo 30 days of electronic monitoring .
Even as we have anniversaried the Lehman collapse , the primary indicator of economic viability and potential growth : intermodal traffic , continues to decline .
In fact the weekly decline was slight worse , and came out at - 17.2 %
YoY for week 40 , nominally worse than the prior week 's - 17.1 % .
The categories most impacted were Primary Forest Products and Lumber and Wood Products , both instrumental in new housing construction .
If there is a reason to be buying Centex , Lennar and Toll , sure do n't look for it here .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Merck &
Co won U.S. approval to sell its cervical cancer vaccine for prevention of genital warts in boys and young men , the company said on Friday .
The Food and Drug Administration approved the Gardasil vaccine for males ages 9 through 26 , Merck said in a statement .
Gardasil fights infection with the human papillomavirus ( HPV ) , which causes cervical cancer and genital warts .
Gardasil already is sold for girls and women to prevent cervical cancer .
Merck shares fell 5 cents to $ 33.25 on the New York Stock Exchange at mid-afternoon .
The first demonstration of a renewable method for hydrogen production from wastewater using a microbial electrolysis system is underway at the Napa Wine Company in Oakville .
The refrigerator - sized hydrogen generator will take winery wastewater , and using bacteria and a small amount of electrical energy , convert the organic material into hydrogen , according to a Penn State environmental engineer .
" This is a demonstration to prove we can continuously generate renewable hydrogen and to study the engineering factors affecting the system performance , " said Bruce E. Logan , Kappe professor of environmental engineering .
" The hydrogen produced will be vented except for a small amount that will be used in a hydrogen fuel cell . "
Eventually , Napa Wine Company would like to use the hydrogen to run vehicles and power systems .
Napa Wine Company 's wastewater comes from cleaning equipment , grape disposal , wine making and other processes .
The company already has on - site wastewater treatment and recycling and the partially treated water from the microbial electrolysis system will join other water for further treatment and use in irrigation .
" It is nice that Napa Wine Company offered up their winery and facilities to test this new approach , " said Logan .
" We chose a winery because it is a natural tourist attraction .
People go there all the time to experience wine making and wine , and now they can also see a demonstration of how to make clean hydrogen gas from agricultural wastes . "
The demonstration microbial electrolysis plant is a continuous flow system that will process about 1,000 liters of wastewater a day .
Microbial electrolysis cells consist of two electrodes immersed in liquid .
Logan uses electrode pairs consisting of one carbon anode and one stainless steel cathode in his system rather than an electrode coated with a precious metal like platinum or gold .
Replacing precious metals will keep down costs .
The wastewater enters the cell where naturally occurring bacteria convert the organic material into electrical current .
If the voltage produced by the bacteria is slightly increased , hydrogen gas is produced electrochemically on the stainless steel cathode .
The demonstration plant is made up of 24 modules .
Each module has six pairs of electrodes .
" The composition of the wastewater will change throughout the year , " said Logan .
" Now it is likely to be rather sugary , but later it may shift more toward the remnants of the fermentation process . "
The bacteria that work in the electrolysis cells will consume either of these organic materials .
The project is supported by Air Products & Chemicals , Inc. , The Water Environmental Research Foundation Paul L. Busch Award and other donors .
Brown & Caldwell , an environmental engineering consulting firm , was contracted to build the demonstration plant .
The Napa Wine Company is donating its facilities and wastewater for the demonstration .

By Bob Chaundy
Samuel Johnson , born 300 years ago this week , wrote one of the most important books in the English language .
So what made his dictionary so special ?
" Dictionaries " , said Samuel Johnson , " are like watches : the worst is better than none , and the best cannot be expected to go quite true . "
Johnson was buried in Westminster Abbey
It may not have achieved perfection , but Samuel Johnson 's A Dictionary of the English Language , published in 1755 , is generally regarded as one of the most important works of scholarship in the English language .
Such was its authority that it remained the most pre-eminent of its kind for more than 170 years , until the advent of the Oxford English Dictionary in 1928 .
Johnson introduced a literary quality to lexicography that remains an influence to this day .
Remarkably , during the nine years it took him to complete his work , his wife Elizabeth , known as Tetty , died and he suffered increasing bouts of depression that had afflicted him throughout his life .
JOHNSON'S DEFINITIONS Spider :
" the animal that spins webs for flies " " the animal that spins webs for flies "
Wheel :
" a circular body that turns round upon an axis " " a circular body that turns round upon an axis "
Oats :
" a grain , which in England is generally given to horses , but in Scotland supports the people " " a grain , which in England is generally given to horses , but in Scotland supports the people "
It was n't just the wealth of poems , essays , novels , and literary criticism that inspired a group of publishers to commission the dictionary from Dr Johnson , but also his reputation for tackling the most daunting of literary tasks such as compiling comprehensive reports of parliamentary debates .
Books were in his blood .
He was born the son of a bookseller and from an early age devoured the wide range of literature at his disposal .
" He had an amazing memory , " says Joanne Wilson , curator of the Samuel Johnson Museum situated at his birthplace in Lichfield , Staffordshire .
" He was a walking encyclopaedia and there 's a story that when he was three , his mother handed him a large section of the Book of Common Prayer , and he had memorised it within minutes . "
Reading 2,000 books Johnson 's was n't the first English dictionary ; around 20 had been produced previously , most notably Nathan Bailey 's Dictionarium Britannicum of 1721 .
But there was open dissatisfaction with their lack of authority and style .
" Many of the previous English lexicographers had been schoolmasters who were didactic but not necessarily authoritative , " says John Simpson , chief editor of the Oxford English Dictionary .
" Johnson brought an authority which tied in with the spirit of the times , basing literature on classical models and so on . "
Henry Hitchings , author of the 2005 book Dr Johnson 's Dictionary : The Extraordinary Story of the Book that Defined the World , describes how Johnson 's working method was innovative .
THE 1755 DICTIONARY took eight years to compile listed 40,000 words required six helpers included 114,000 quotations words such as bang , budge , fuss , gambler and touchy were omitted " He started not by coming up with a list of words like previous compilers had , but by reading 2,000 books .
When he saw words that were interesting , he marked notes on them in the margin .
So usage became his primary criterion and he had at least one quotation for each word . "
Samuel Johnson also brought elegance to his definitions .
Whereas Bailey described a wheel as " a round device too well known to need description " , and a spider as " an insect well known " , Johnson defined a wheel as " a circular body that turns round upon an axis " , and a spider as " the animal that spins webs for flies " .
Johnson defined a trance as " a temporary absence of the soul " , and a rant as " high sounding language unsupported by dignity of thought " .
He also enjoyed asserting his own prejudices into his definitions .
Suicide became " the horrid crime of destroying one 's self " .
Johnson set out with the intention of embalming English for all time , but he soon recognised that language has a plastic nature that can't be set in aspic
Henry Hitchings
He described excise as " a hateful tax levied upon commodities , and adjudged not by the common judges of property , but wretches hired by those to whom excise is paid " .
In some ways , Johnson was influential without necessarily breaking new ground .
As John Simpson of the OED points out , " he brought together elements of layout and style which had appeared separately in other dictionaries , things like etymology square brackets which give the words ' origins , the numbers given for different senses of the word , labelling , quotations and so on .
So , he was important for bringing these elements together in one place . "
Johnson was also a driver of standardising English , particularly spelling .
He was writing at a time of an explosion in popular print culture , with newspapers , magazines , posters and so on .
Yet , as Henry Hitchings observes , " Johnson set out with the intention of embalming English for all time , but he soon recognised that language has a plastic nature that can't be set in aspic . "
One of the patrons of the Samuel Johnson tercentenary celebrations is the actor Robbie Coltrane who , in a famous Blackadder episode is enraged when he realises , after reading Baldrick 's " semi-autobiographical " novel , that he has omitted the word " sausage " from his dictionary .
It 's paradoxical that Coltrane is a Scot given Johnson 's famous aversion to the people north of the border .
Perhaps Samuel Johnson 's most famous definition is of oats described as " a grain , which in England is generally given to horses , but in Scotland supports the people " .

Indeed a work the perispication of which embiggens the smallest mind .
Martin Herbert , Llanidloes , Wales
As a scholar who was orthographically challenged I always took solace in the fact that my surname was spelt JohnsTon .
S Johnston , Southend - on - sea Johnson was indeed a pioneer .
I am anaspeptic , phrasmotic , even compunctious if anyone has had pericombubulations to read his work .
Robbie , Blantyre I blame Dr Johnson for the my dyslexia and for increasing illiteracy .
He was more interested in demonstrating the etymology of words in their spelling , rather than making them easy to pronounce or spell .
Now , remind me again , how do you pronounce ' ough ' ?
Through , thorough , cough , Loughborough , bough , chough .
Thanks Dr. Johnson .
Rory , UK Tony Howe - very good .
I wondered how long it would take to get a Blackadder joke in there .
My favourite : Dog - NOT a cat .
Ian , Swadlincote
When Johnson remarked to Boswell that in England they fed to horses what in Scotland they fed to people , Boswell replied " Aye ; better horses , better people . "
Ian H Thain , Banbury , Oxfordshire
My favourite entries are : " Lexicographer : a writer of dictionaries ; a harmless drudge that busies himself in tracing the original and detailing the signification of words " and " Monsieur : a term of reproach for a Frenchman " Just goes to show that certain words have not lost their meanings in the last 250 years !
Rod , Edinburgh
It is hardly right to say that Johnson had an aversion to the Scots .
He enjoyed and appreciated the company of Scots during his travels .
On the other hand he was appalled and upset by the poverty and hardship he witnessed in the Highlands .
John , Edinburgh Johnson 's dictionary is a work of genius .
We must offer our most sincere contrafibularities .
Tony Howe , London Name

Real argument about " network neutrality " is fascinating stuff , provocative and well worth anyone 's time if they care about the Internet .
Unfortunately , Congress is n't great at having intelligent arguments , and net neutrality is rapidly on its way to becoming the latest victim of the Sound Bite Wars .
Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) and Rep. Marsha Blackburn ( R - TN ) have each introduced an anti-net neutrality bill into their respective chambers .
McCain's is known as the " Internet Freedom Act of 2009 , " but Blackburn 's is billed as ( seriously ) the " Real Stimulus Act of 2009 " ( PDF ) .
This " real stimulus " consists of a single line , which is identical in both bills : " The Federal Communications Commission shall not propose , promulgate , or issue any regulations regarding the Internet or IP - enabled services . "
While the bills target network neutrality , they appear to go much further by banning any sort of new rules on all IP services .
It 's clear why that is : McCain and Blackburn both see broad and nefarious implications to FCC Chair Julius Genachowski's attempt to codify network neutrality into rule .
Blackburn , for instance , says that net neutrality " ironically would make the Internet less neutral by allowing the FCC to regulate it in the same way it regulates radio and television broadcasts . "
She also says that the rules are akin to " the imposition of a fairness doctrine on the Internet . "
And there 's more irony : " ironically , government intervention would hamper industry ’s ability to protect intellectual property online and crack down on piracy . "
McCain went even further in a recent op - ed , calling net neutrality " a government takeover of the Internet . "
It 's not clear what this means , since the government is n't taking a new stake in any part of " the Internet " and is proposing to regulate Internet access , not content .
McCain also charges that " the administration can't resist imposing regulations on the Internet — particularly since Google Inc. and other Internet content providers were promised the imposition of such regulations as these companies seek to control what consumers see and do n't see on the Internet . "
And he praises " the light - touch regulatory approach toward the Internet that was put forth by previous administrations , " which " has brought Americans social networking , low - cost long - distance calling , texting , telemedicine and over 85,000 almighty ' apps ' for the iPhone . "
This light - touch regulatory approach would include the Republican - adopted Internet policy statement ( the " four freedoms " that Genachowski wants to codify into rules ) , the Republican - led effort to censure Comcast for interfering with P2P transmission , and the Republican preference for case - by - case decision - making rather than detailed rules ( an approach kept in the current draft of the neutrality rules ) .
The last part of the op - ed calls " an open and unfettered Internet " the " real stimulus during these difficult economic times , " which probably explains where Blackburn picked up her bill 's tagline this week .
" Regulation kills innovation , " McCain ends .
" Let 's not kill the Internet . "
We certainly agree ; let 's not kill the Internet .
But let 's have a better public debate about it , one that ( for instance ) honestly wrestles with the chart below .
Produced by Harvard researchers for the FCC ( but funded independently ) , it graphs the costs and speeds of the fastest broadband offerings of providers from all over the world .
The high - priced , low - speed options are in the lower - left , while the low - priced , high - speed options are in the upper right .
We have highlighted the US ISPs on the chart with red boxes just to drive the point home .
Regulated ISPs , especially those in forced line - sharing agreements , tend to be much faster and offer better value .
" Regulation " certainly does n't mean " automatic awesomeness , " but to say that " regulation " in the abstract always threatens to destroy innovation is simply belied by the facts on the ground .
" If we do n’t prosecute [ him ] to the fullest extent of the law , I do n’t know who on Earth we would .
It makes a sham , a mockery of the law .
And it ’s pretty hard to argue the guy did n’t have a gun and it was n’t loaded . "
~ Michael Bloomberg , Mayor of New York City
" Plax Burress gets two years in jail for shooting himself and Charles Augusto is a hero for shooting somebody else .
What a country ! "
~ Facebook Status
I almost did n't submit this piece .
Besides , LRC's own Johnny Kramer already summed up my feelings with an essay published during the time of the initial public discourse on the issue .
This quote from his essay is absolute money :
To summarize , Burress is being prosecuted not for damaging another person ’s body or property , for which that person has filed a complaint , seeking restitution and / or damages ; he ’s being prosecuted for not having a permission slip from the State to carry his own property .
And the people who helped him get medical treatment are being threatened for not turning Burress in to the State for not having a permission slip and because the piece of his property , for which he did n’t have a permission slip , involved in the victimless incident happened to be a gun ; and for not cooperating with the State , once the non-crime came to its attention , in helping it gather evidence to prosecute Burress for the non-crime , and possibly to prosecute them for their involvement in the non-crime too .
Exactly .
Little more need be said .
And if you need more , Kramer and others already said much of it .
( Despite that admission , I could not help but offer my own thoughts recently on the LRCBlog , with " Shoot Them , You Win. Shoot You , You Lose . " )
Now that Burress has been sentenced , it seems appropriate to revisit the case , not because there are new truths from a libertarian and moral perspective , but because it still incenses me for this man to be going to jail — a place rightly reserved for evil people who have infringed upon others directly — for a crime that is , at best , man-made and at worst , non-existent .
One of my anarchist friends may have said it best with , " from a libertarian perspective , Burress going to jail for what he did is an Orwellian nightmare of the highest order . "
Another reason I feel so compelled to again chime in on this issue involves the racial component , particularly as it resonates in combination with the fact that Burress is a professional athlete .
The final reason I feel compelled to pontificate as Plaxico is sent to Riker 's Island has to do with this opinion , which I believe to be fact : Everyone should be armed if they so desire , not just athletes .
Burress being armed represents neither the exception nor the rule .
What Part of " Self Defense " Do n't You Understand ?
Some time ago , black sports reporter and pundit Stephen A. Smith voiced a commentary on ESPN that fit well with the typical reaction to an event like Burress shooting himself .
For example , Smith voiced his extreme disappointment with black athletes who seem to not understand that they cannot misbehave without consequence .
In this regard , I agree with him , largely .
There are consequences for behavior .
All people , be they professional athletes , politicians , or run -of - the - mill citizens should realize this .
However , this event is not about bad behavior — not in the slightest .
From the libertarian and more importantly , from the moral standpoint , Plaxico Burress did nothing wrong .
He injured himself with his own property .
Let that sink in for a moment .
Charles Augusto also discharged an illegal firearm , actually killing several people , on purpose .
He was rightfully defending himself , but it ’s still incredibly similar .
( For the record , my heart does not bleed for the rights - infringers Augusto shot . )
I suspect that Plax wanted to avoid the fates of Darrent Williams and Sean Taylor , both NFL players , both shot by others ( one of them , Taylor , in his own home ) .
Plaxico Burress felt he had to protect himself — and he had data that suggested such a step was prudent — so he carried a gun .
The Constitution affirms this right ; it does not grant it .
As such , the City of New York can not take it away .
One last bit of context is worth noting .
Burress went through the metal detectors that are , as far as I know , relatively standard in night clubs such as the one he visited .
His gun was found by security .
They let him through with it .
Let that sink in too .
( Apparently , the people tasked with keeping the club safe also realized that Plaxico was not out of line to be carrying a burner ! )
Yet , somehow , the DA can throw the book at him for not having an appropriate permission slip .
If the owners of the property , or their representatives , did n't care , who is the complainant ?
The mind reels .
Roger Goodell , Commissioner of the NFL was quoted as saying , " if you 're in a place where you suspect you need to protect yourself , you should leave that situation . "
This initially might appear to be a fine , if tragically simplistic , motherhood statement .
Under scrutiny , such a sentiment is ludicrous to the point of hilarity .
Apparently , Commissioner Goodell thinks that only a person in the wrong place will ever need to defend himself .
Given that the aforementioned Sean Taylor was killed in his home , I reckon such infantile logic — and I use that term loosely — as employed by Goodell can be placed in its proper context and completely ignored .
Where Burress wanted to go , where Burress should have gone , and the fact that he carried a gun are separate issues .
In a truly free society , with a truly free market , one should be rewarded or punished for doing whatever he feels is appropriate , as long as he does not infringe upon the private property of another .
The consequences fit the behavior .
The Burress case and its resulting punishment reflect a quasi- parenting paradigm that is incessant in the American body politic .
This punishment paradigm is antithetical to private property since it is based upon a belief that the State — much like an ignorant , overbearing parent — can do whatever it likes to its subjects , ownership and property be damned .
The State owns everything , including you , and can therefore punish as it sees fit .
I have written about this error in logic before , but that such a paradigm continues to exist so virulently is still disturbing .
More distressing , it seems that race and status interact to further confuse the issues .
I have heard it said that if Burress was either poor or not famous , he would n't even have stood trial .
I believe this to be the case ; and while it saddens me , it does not surprise me .
If justice is the goal or the result , why would such an observation be so believable ?
Conclusion
This case might not necessarily be about race , but it is definitely about status .
The Burress prosecution presented the DA with an opportunity to “ make his bones ” by pursuing a high - profile , wealthy , dare I say , uppity Negro athlete .
( Recall that Eliot Spitzer made his bones pursuing wealthy , uppity Wall Street types . )
The DA can’t really pursue Augusto because he ’s just a regular guy who the local press has made into a hero .
Not so with Burress .
An acquaintance of mine remarked that " Burress deserves to be punished for being stupid .
People could have been injured ! "
Really ?
That anyone would cheer this outcome is proof that Queen Amidala was right when she noted , " So this is how liberty dies : with thunderous applause . "
If people can be put in cages for what might have happened , and frankly the U.S. is well along that course , it 's just a matter of time before the erstwhile mistakes you made become offenses punishable with jail time .
( Wait .
Is that the phone ringing ?
It 's probably George Orwell calling to get his 1984 back . )
If the Burress case reflects how we view law and order in a just and civil society , the economic ignorance exposed during the current fake health care debate is the least of our worries .

Pete Campbell is a rapist .
On Sunday night 's episode , he met a young au pair living in his building and helped her out of a difficult situation with her employers .
He propositioned her ; she refused .
Later that evening , undeterred , he knocked on her door , forced her to let him in to avoid a scene , followed her into her bedroom , closed the door , and kissed her , leading her towards the bed .
Apparently , for some people , this was n't clearly a rape .
I 'm here to tell them : it was .
Pete Campbell is a rapist .
I 've heard some people say that Mad Men is a show about nuance , shades of grey , and therefore Pete Campbell Cannot Be A Rapist .
( As if there was no such thing as a rapist in serious , well - developed drama . )
I think these people are doing a very superficial read of Mad Men .
I do n't think the writer or director of this episode was the least bit confused .
The au pair is slightly afraid of Pete throughout .
She does n't want him in the apartment .
She recoils when he kisses her .
That she submits , ultimately , is irrelevant to the question of whether Pete rapes her .
She did n't want to sleep with him ; she made it clear ; he did n't care .
He wanted to have sex , and she was there , and she owed him , in his mind .
So he raped her .
End of story .
Pete Campbell is a rapist .
What Mad Men is being subtle about , when it shows us an episode in which a character rapes someone for no reason better than boredom , is the fact rape does n't just happen in alleys .
It does n't just come from total strangers who leap from bushes .
It does n't involve kicking and screaming and clawing his eyeballs out , because that would only get you in even more trouble .
Pete Campbell is a rapist .
The feminist blogger fugitivus has really eloquently pointed out that we have this strange habit of teaching women to submit - not to fight , not to be mean , not , above all , to be a " bitch " to men ( " bitch " being a watchword for " woman who reists sexual aggression " ) lest your dispute with him get physical , and then :
It 's a rude fucking awakening when a woman gets raped , and follows the rules she has been taught her whole life — does n't refuse to talk , does n't refuse to flirt , does n't walk away ignoring him , does n't hit , does n't scream , does n't fight , does n't raise her voice , does n't deny she liked kissing — and finds out after that she is now to blame for the rape .
She followed the rules .
The rules that were supposed to keep the rape from happening .
The rules that would keep her from being fair game for verbal and physical abuse .
Breaking the rules is supposed to result in punishment , not following them .
For every time she lowered her voice , let go of a boundary , did n't move away , let her needs be conveniently misinterpreted , and was given positive reinforcement and a place in society , she is now being told that all that was wrong , this one time , and she should have known that , duh .
For anybody who has ever watched the gendered social interactions of women — watched a woman get browbeaten into accepting attention she does n't want , watched a woman get interrupted while speaking , watched a woman deny she is upset at being insulted in public , watched a woman get grabbed because of what she was wearing , watched a woman stop arguing — and said and done nothing , you never have the right to ever ask , " Why did n't she fight back ? "
Pete Campbell is a rapist because he told the au pair , though perhaps not in so many words , that he did n't care about her arguments .
He ignored all the behaviour she exhibited that said she did n't want him .
He did n't really bother to think about what the au pair wanted or desired , because it was irrelevant to him .
Pete Campbell is a rapist .
I keep repeating it like that , keep saying it flat - out like that , not because I demand that you hate his character now .
( In fact , I 've always thought Vincent Kartheiser - who I hated on Angel - does an excellent job of making such a weasel character kind of sympathetic , human . )
I keep saying he is a rapist because I think everyone would benefit from understanding that " rapists " are not monsters : they are human beings .
They are human beings who have been taught , time and time again , by this culture , that they are entitled to sexually use other people .
They are not outliers ; they are not blips on the radar ; they are not deviants .
They are , often , just men who have gotten so caught up in themselves , so blinded by the ego they are told from birth they must develop as a symbol of virile masculinity , that they have utterly forgotten that woman are human beings .
They have forgotten that women are not there for their sexual use .
Pete Campbell is a rapist .
People who care about ending rape know that most rapists look , in fact , a lot like Pete : acquaintances , harmless - looking , perhaps a bit of a lech , but in general using means other than physical violence to coerce sex .
Using tricks .
People who care about ending rape know that keeping rapists in the " deviant " bucket does absolutely nothing to keep people - women , children , and sometimes men - from being raped .
Pete Campbell is a rapist .
I 'm gonna keep saying that because I 'm tired of people being afraid , desperately , mortally afraid , of calling a rape a rape , of calling a rapist a rapist .
This terror , this insistence that the term rape only be applied to " serious cases " - meaning , only those cases where society believes someone has been raped - does absolutely nothing to stop rape from happening .
It results in people scrambling for fictions to cover up the holes in these stories - see how her lips turned up at the corner , she could have kneed him , she 's only sad about cheating on her boyfriend - just so that they wo n't have to call it rape .
You see this with Pete , you see it with Polanski , you see it with Kobe Bryant : why did n't she stop him ?
Never : why did n't he stop ?
Pete Campbell is a rapist .
It 's worrisome that this is controversial , and at the same time I 'm grateful to Mad Men , because I think the scene said something that needed to be said .
It 's getting people to listen to them that 's the problem .
President Barack Obama 's approval rating has risen to 56 percent in the latest AP - GfK poll , up from 50 percent in September and the first time since January that his approval has gone up in the poll .
Obama 's approval ratings climb
President Barack Obama ’s approval rating has risen to 56 percent in the latest AP - GfK poll , up from 50 percent in September and the first time since January that his approval has gone up in the poll .
Thirty - nine percent said they disapprove of his job performance — down from 49 percent last month .
Among the poll ’s other findings : 41 percent say the country is headed in the right direction , compared with 37 percent who said so in September ; 50 percent approved of Obama ’s handling of the economy , and 48 percent approved of his handling of health care .

In fact , the president fared better on his handling of every individual issue except one : the war in Afghanistan , on which 46 percent said they approved and 41 percent disapproved , unchanged since last month .
Overall , 40 percent said they favored the war in Afghanistan ( down slightly from September ) , while 57 percent said they opposed it .
But while Obama ’s numbers are up , Democrats have lost their edge in the 2010 congressional elections , according to a new Gallup survey that shows voters closely divided on whether they would rather support a Democrat or a Republican for Congress next year .
“ Forty - six percent of registered voters say they would vote for the Democrat , and 44 percent say the Republican when asked which party ’s candidate they would support for Congress if the election were held today , ” Gallup reported .
In July , the Democratic Party held a 6 - percentage - point lead on the same question — 50 percent to 44 percent , Gallup said .
Both surveys “ show a more competitive political environment than Gallup has generally seen since before the Democrats regained control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2006 midterm elections , ” the polling company said .
“ Closer to elections , Gallup bases its results on ‘ likely voters . ’
Doing so typically improves the Republicans ’ positioning by several points ; thus , when Democrats lead slightly among registered voters , it is possible for Republicans to be ahead among likely voters . ”
Such is the way of adrenalin .
It dissipates .
And along comes Angela Merkel , the adrenalin - free Ossi , who has been a chancellor of unmemorable steadiness , and who , barring an upset , will be re-elected at the head of her center - right Christian Democratic Union .
Merkel has been a leader in the image of a settled Germany .
Everything about her screams drama over —
Brandt on his knees in the Warsaw ghetto ; chain - smoking Schmidt ( “ a politician with vision needs to see an ophthalmologist ” ) fighting the fight for medium - range U.S. missiles ; Kohl clasping Mitterrand ’s hand at Verdun and later inhaling unification with unabashed appetite .
Every risk - averse fiber in Merkel ’s body proclaims the social - market consensus has prevailed , even through financial crisis .
The extent of discord may be measured by the fact that Merkel ’s chief opponent is also her foreign minister in the governing Grand Coalition : Frank - Walter Steinmeier , the Social Democrat leader .
He ’s a likeable technocrat who always seems to be wondering how he ever ended up as a politician .
None of the above should suggest there ’s nothing at stake .
There is : a little .
If Merkel gets her favored option — a center - right coalition with the liberal Free Democrats — tax cuts , nuclear power and support for the Afghan mission ( Germany has sent more than 4,000 troops ) will get a boost .
If not , well , more of the same is in order .
My sense is most Germans feel market reforms of recent years have gone far enough .
Germans are hunkered down , not unhappy but uninspired .
This has been a campaign of astonishing intellectual nullity .
I spoke of hope and concern :
The former springs from Germany ’s absorption of its eastern third and passage into normality , the latter from the country ’s numbness .
We have n't seen such inappropriate celebration since dozens of Black Kids Lept up in elation at the reading of the First OJ Verdict exactly 14 Years ago TODAY !
Anybody remember that ?
Anyone remember the Outrage ?
I think a lot of people still do - and it might even be argued that at least some of the Backlash against Barack , and against those who benefit from the so - called " Race Card " - helped fueled yesterdays reaction .
Blacks Cheered and Whites Raged !!
To many of them Obama is just another " Black ( Kenyan ) Guy who Got Away with It ( Winning the Presidency ) " , y'know - like OJ got away with it , for awhile .
We may still be experiencing the slow burn of the " White Riot " against Black Priviledge .
Or of course , they simply hate Democrats like the White - Hot Core of a Supernova !
Oh - but wait , there is some argument that America 's Failure in this doomed Olympic endeaver may actually have been - George W. Bush 's Fault .
In the official question - and - answer session following the Chicago presentation , Syed Shahid Ali , an I.O.C. member from Pakistan , asked the toughest question .
He wondered how smooth it would be for foreigners to enter the United States for the Games because doing so can sometimes , he said , be " a rather harrowing experience . "
A " harrowing experience " may be an understatement .
Immediately after 9/11 , the Bush Administration began requiring fingerprints and photographs of tourists from all but 28 countries entering the US .
President Bush required that all foreigners register online within three days of travel .
Thirty - five ( mostly European ) countries now participate in the US Visa Waiver program , however tourists from the rest of the world still have to jump through the following hurdles : * Pay hefty visa processing and issuance fees .
* Undergo an interview by a visa officer at the US Embassy .
* Provide evidence which shows the purpose of the trip , intent to depart the United States , and arrangements made to cover the costs of the trip may be provided .
* Present convincing evidence that an interested person will provide financial support if the applicant does not have sufficient funds to support him or herself .
The idea that America has become more onerous to foreign travelers ( and their economy boosting dollars ) than Communist China was just last year - should be a daunting thought .
But then again maybe that 's unfair to pin all of this on Bush , the No Fly Lists , shoe removals and dumping of beverages before the inevitable wanding and embarassing , probing questions - many countries that have experienced terrorism have upped their security requirements and tightening their Visa requirements .
Maybe it 's not all Georgie 's fault - it 's Mitt Romney's .
The scandalous behavior of IOC members and Salt Lake City Olympic bidders in the 1990s triggered reform that effectively banned the gifts and favors .
The reform effort also made it difficult to apply legitimate politicking to the bidding process .
This not only hog - tied the savvy political operatives in Chicago , it also minimized the role of President Obama , the Olympic bidder - in - chief .
The tough bidding rules established after the Salt Lake City scandal made it impossible to conduct even the most fundamental political campaign .
IOC members are not permitted to visit bidding cities and even meet with the bidders , except under very limited and controlled circumstances .
The rampant glad - handing and corruption of process that led to the Salt Lake City Olympics may have tainted the waters for America , and for our ability to use similar tactics in the future .
Is n't this Blame Game Fun ?
Maybe we all should have jumped up and Cheered that Bush Lost Us Another One - on top of the Two Wars he failed to Win , the failure of his Administration at anticipating , stopping or capturing the Al Qeada Leadership , the skyrocketing deficit and broken American Economy .
Yeah - We 're # 1 ( in National Debt and Unemployment ! )
Cue the Streamers !!!
None of this should be a surprise , as the Lord - God - King - Bufu of the Con-Americans already announced this is what he wanted .
It does n't matter to Rush that Obama did n't take over the Banks , the Car Companies and the Mortgage Companies - GEORGE W. BUSH DID - or that beside the fact neither of them really had a viable choice since all those agencies utterly failed as a result of unregulated crony capitalistic greed , and also that none of those corporate entities could ever be deemed " The Middle Class " .
Down with CHICAGO !
Down With CHRYSLER !
DOWN WITH CITIBANK !
DOWN WITH FORD !
Down with - America !
Yeah , good times .
Rush still wants Obama - and hence the Banks , the Car Companies and the Mortgage Companies - To Fail because that 's what 's " Good " for America .
And when they all go down - he and the rest of the cons will Cheer !
YAY - Up Yours OBAMA !
Then again , maybe we just plain lost the Olympics not just to a city , not just to another country - but An Entire CONTINENT that has never before hosted an Olympic games while the U.S. has hosted it 8 Times already ( Los Angeles Twice , Salt Lake City , Lake Placid Twice , Atlanta , Squaw Valley & St Louis ) so granting us our Ninth Olympics versus South America 's First is a pretty tough argument to beat .
We 've had our turn , over and over again - now it time for someone else to shine .
But instead of being gracious in defeat we have this ...
Not exactly " Country First " is it ?
Why do the CONS Hate America so ?

By Giles Ji Ungpakorn
On September 19 , 2006 , the Thai army staged a coup toppling the elected government of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra .
Soldiers sported yellow royal ribbons and the military junta claimed that it was staging the coup to protect ``democracy with the king as the head of state ’’ .
It certainly was not protecting democracy , but most Thais believed that this was indeed a “ royal coup ” .
The coup came after mass street demonstrations against the elected government by the royalist and conservative Peoples Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) , in which many PAD members and leaders of the so - called Democrat Party had called for the king to sack the elected prime minister and appoint another one .
Later , the yellow - shirted PAD took on a semi- fascist nature , using extreme nationalism and having its own armed guard .
The PAD used violence on the streets of Bangkok .
Support for monarchy exaggerated
It was always an exaggeration to claim that “ all Thais revere the king ” or that “ the monarchy has held the country together for decades ” .
Statements like these gloss over the level of coercion surrounding public attitudes to the monarchy , the real deep tensions in society and the serious lack of power , courage and character shown by the king throughout his reign .
Nevertheless , there was a short period of 20 years after the mid-1980s when the monarchy was very popular .
This was more to do with the weakness of any opposition and the level of promotion that the institution received , rather than any “ ancient or natural ” love for the king among Thais .
Yet , it was enough to convince most
Thais that monarchism was deeply embedded in society .
The present crisis has shattered all these illusions .
Since the coup , the royalists have been promoting the king ’s “ sufficiency economy ” ideology , which argues against redistribution of wealth .
At the same time , budget documents show that the public purse spent more than 6 billion baht on the monarchy in 2008 , mainly for the royal household ( more than 2 billion baht ) , royal overseas visits ( 500 million ) , the Royal Thai Aid - De-Camp Department ( more than 400 million ) and the rest being for security by the police and army .
These figures did not include the cost of the new royal plane fleet , which amounted to 3.65 billion baht .
Some commentators , who ought to know better , go to great lengths in supporting illusions about the monarchy .
Benjamin Zawacki , Southeast Asia researcher for Amnesty International , making a disgraceful comment on the 18 - year jail sentence given to a democracy activist for making a speech against the monarchy , said that “ you have an institution here ( the monarchy ) that has played an important role in the protection of human rights in Thailand .
We can see why the monarchy needs to be protected ” ( by lese majeste laws ) .
There is absolutely no evidence that the king has ever protected human rights .
In fact , the opposite is true .
Just look at what happened on October 6 , 1976 .
The statement is not surprising , however , since the Amnesty International office in Thailand is closely associated with the semi-fascist PAD .
Thai Rak Thai party
Immediately after the coup in 2006 , there was no mass response by the millions of citizens who had repeatedly voted for Thaksin ’s Thai Rak Thai party ( TRT ) government .
But a small group of activists , who called themselves “ the 19th September Network Against the Coup ” did stage a protest and continued to organise repeated protests .
I was one of those people who protested against the coup .
But we were not supporters of Taksin ’s TRT and were critical of his gross human rights abuses in the southern Thailand and in the ``war on drugs ’’ .
Since then , the destruction of democracy by the conservative elites has continued relentlessly and has stimulated the growth of a grassroots pro-democracy movement called the “ Red Shirts ” .
It has long become necessary to take sides .
That is why I joined the Red Shirts in November 2008 .
After writing a new pro-military constitution and using the courts to dissolve Thaksin ’s TRT party , the military junta that staged the 2006 coup held fresh elections in 2007 .
This was won by the Peoples ’ Power Party ( PPP ) , a new party set up by TRT politicians .
Again the election results were ignored .
The conservative courts , violent protests by the PAD , including the shutting down of the international airports , plus the behind scenes activity of the army eventually resulted in an undemocratic government with Democrat Party leader Abhisit Vejjajiva as the prime minister in December 2009 .
Thailand took further steps backwards with the introduction of draconian censorship , the use of lese majeste laws against pro-democracy activists , and the creation by the government of the armed paramilitary gang called the “ Blue Shirts ” .
The Blue Shirts are thought to be soldiers out of uniform .
They are controlled by government politicians such as Newin Chitchorp and Sutep Teuksuban .
The reason for the creation of the Blue Shirts is that the PAD is beyond the control of the government and hence there are attempts to limit its power .
Nevertheless , the foreign minister is a PAD supporter and he took part in the illegal airport occupation .
Red Shirts ’ evolution
The Red Shirts have continued to evolve .
Mass meetings of ordinary people , numbering hundreds of thousands , were held in sports stadiums in Bangkok .
The movement was initially built by former TRT politicians , but it quickly evolved into a grassroots movement with branches in most communities throughout the country and even abroad .
There are local educational groups , community radio stations and websites .
In April 2009 , for the fourth time in 40 years , troops opened fire on pro-democracy demonstrators in Bangkok .
Some months later , a tape recording of a cabinet meeting was leaked to the public .
Prime Minister Abhistit was caught on tape urging the military to create a situation in which they could shoot the Red Shirt protesters .
Each time the army has shot unarmed protestors in Thailand , the aim has been the same : to protect the interests of the conservative elites who have run the country for the past 70 years .
This time , the protesters were Red Shirts , and at least two people died and hundreds more were injured , some seriously .
Since then , Abhisit ’s military - backed government has repeatedly used “ internal security ” as an excuse to prevent legitimate street protests .
It has declared what amounts to “ martial law ” in Bangkok over the next few days .
2006 coup
Thaksin ’s Thai Rak Thai party was modernising and this is why the conservatives hated it .
For the first time in decades , a party gained mass support from the poor because it believed that the poor were not a burden .
They argued that the poor should be “ stakeholders ” rather than serfs .
These “ populist ” policies were developed after the 1997 Asian economic crisis and were a result of widespread consultations in society .
This was no socialist party , but a party of big business committed to free - market policies at a national and global level , and Keynesian policies at the village or grassroots level .
When the party came to power in 2001 , the banks had stopped lending and there was an urgent need to stimulate the economy .
It represented the modernising interests of an important faction of the capitalist class .
The major forces behind the September 19 coup were anti-democratic groups in the military and civilian elite , disgruntled business leaders , middle - class reactionaries and neoliberal intellectuals and politicians .
The coup was also supported by the monarchy and the majority of the NGO movement .
What all these groups had in common was contempt for the poor .
For the neoliberals , “ too much democracy ” gave “ too much ” power to the poor electorate and encouraged governments to “ overspend ” on welfare .
The intellectuals and NGO activists believed that Thailand was divided between the “ enlightened middle classes who understood democracy ” and the “ ignorant rural and urban poor ” who were trapped in a “ patron - client system ” .
There was a belief that Thaksin cheated in elections , mainly by “ tricking or buying the ignorant rural poor ” .
This was a convenient justification for ignoring the wishes of 16 million people .
There was no evidence of any serious electoral fraud which would have changed the clear majority that TRT gained in many elections .
Thaksin has often been wrongly accused of being against the monarchy .
In fact , he is a royalist .
He opposes people like myself who are republicans .
His government promoted the king ’s 60th anniversary celebrations and started the North Korean - style “ Yellow Shirt mania ” .
But Thaksin lost out to the conservatives in his attempt to use the monarchy for his own legitimacy .
Thaksin is also accused of corruption .
His sale of Shin Corp shares , without paying tax , was certainly “ moral corruption ” , but quite legal .
The military and the courts have had three years to come up with evidence of his corruption , but have only managed to convict him on a technicality in one instance .
Perhaps a thoroughgoing anti-corruption campaign might unearth widespread corruption among all the elites , especially the military and the conservatives and even those involved in the king ’s “ sufficiency economy ” program .
Much damage has been done to Thai society by the conservative elites and the coup .
They may manage to cling on to their power and wealth for some time , but millions of pro-democracy
Thais are no longer willing to compromise and accept anything less than a real democracy in which the army and the monarchy are kept out of politics .
Many , like myself , would now like to see a republic and a wholesale dismissal of the top generals and judges .
The king will die soon and his son is universally despised .
But the elites , whose real power lies in the hands of the army , will still try desperately to promote and use the monarchy for their own ends .
We can only hope that their dreams will soon crumble to dust .

When you go from bed to bathroom on a dark night , a quick flick of the lights will leave a lingering impression on your mind ’s eye .
For decades evidence suggested that such visual working memories — which , even in daylight , connect the dots to create a complete scene as the eyes dart around rapidly — fade gradually over the span of several seconds .
But a clever new study reported in the journal Psychological Science finds that such memories actually stay sharp until they are suddenly lost .
Cognitive psychologists Weiwei Zhang and Stephen J. Luck , both at the University of California , Davis , tested subjects ’ recall for the hues of colored squares flashed briefly on a screen up to 10 seconds earlier .
Subjects marked their answer on a color wheel .
If memories decay gradually , the guesses should have become increasingly imprecise as time wore on , evidenced by participants selecting yellow or red , for example , when the correct choice was orange .
Instead subjects went straight from fairly accurate answers to random choices — no better than chance — indicating the memories were decaying all at once .
According to Zhang and Luck ’s mathematical analysis , most subjects ’ memories went “ poof ” somewhere between four and 10 seconds after the stimulus .
Researchers say a sudden die - off is to be expected if working memories are stored in circuits that feed back on themselves .
Luck says the system is like a laptop as compared with a flashlight .
“ The laptop is an active system that uses feedback circuits to limit how much power it draws , ” he says .
So whereas a flashlight dims when it runs low on juice , “ the computer runs perfectly normally while the battery drains , ” he says , “ until suddenly the laptop shuts off . ”

* August GDP down 0.1 percent on lower oil , gas extraction
* Huge growth needed in September to meet bank ’s forecast
* Canadian dollar sinks on news ( Adds comments by opposition Liberal party )
OTTAWA , Oct 30 ( Reuters ) - Canada ’s gross domestic product shrank by 0.1 percent in August , casting doubt on whether the country climbed out of recession in the third quarter and making official growth projections all but impossible to reach .
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the economy to grow 0.1 percent in August after a month of stagnation in July .
But lower oil and gas production nudged GDP lower in the month , and August showed a 4 percent year - on - year decline in GDP , a broad measure of goods and services in the economy .
“ Two months into the quarter and the economy is largely standing still .
Worse , the economy is headed in the wrong direction , ” HSBC Securities economist Stewart Hall said in a note that expressed “ palpable disappointment ” in the data .
“ It would seem that Canada will have to wait until the fourth quarter for the economy to transition from economic stabilization to economic recovery . ”
The August figure means that a Bank of Canada forecast for annualized growth of 2.0 percent in the third quarter looks unrealistic and should remove any lingering talk of an early interest rate hike to rein in inflation .
Statistics Canada officials said September GDP would have to grow by an almost unprecedented 2.0 percent to meet the central bank ’s forecast and by 0.6 percent to record any growth at all in the third quarter .
Scotia Capital analysts Derek Holt and Karen Cordes said Canada was paying the price for the lagging recovery in the United States , Canada ’s largest trading partner .
“ The Bank of Canada is nowhere close to hiking rates with this kind of disappointing growth and inflation dynamic in the Canadian economy , ” they said in a note .
The bank says it will keep its overnight rate at a record low of 0.25 percent at least until the second quarter of next year unless inflation emerges as a risk .
Consumer prices in September fell by 0.9 percent from a year earlier .
The economy has also been hit by the high value of the Canadian dollar , which is hurting the manufacturing sector .
The GDP data pushed the Canadian dollar as low as C$ 1.0808 to the U.S. dollar , or 92.52 U.S. cents , from C$ 1.0670 to the U.S. dollar , or 93.72 U.S. cents , at Thursday ’s close and prompted cautious words from Finance Minister Jim Flaherty .
“ The figures quite frankly confirm what we ’ve been saying and that is that there are some positive signs in the economy but the recovery is fragile and tentative , ” he said in Toronto .
Bank of Montreal said the economy had turned the corner regardless of the August figures , and the painful recession was now “ in the rear - view mirror . ”
The largest single month - on - month GDP increase in the last few decades was the 1.6 percent recorded in October 1985 .
The last time the economy grew by as much as 0.6 percent was in December 2006 .
The official opposition Liberal Party said the GDP data showed the government ’s program to stimulate the economy was not working .
Statistics Canada said oil and gas extraction fell by 2.3 percent in August as maintenance work at some east coast crude petroleum facilities slowed production .
The manufacturing sector fell by 0.7 percent on a drop in primary metals products that was caused mainly by labor disputes .
Wholesale trade fell by 0.5 percent , reflecting weakness in both foreign and domestic demand .
Ian Pollick , economics strategist at TD Securities , said growth at the initial phase of a recovery would be tepid .
“ We would n’t draw too many dire conclusions ...
As the massive fiscal and monetary stimulus continues to garner momentum , the recovery should regain traction , ” he said .

The heirs of Jack Kirby , co-creator of Captain America , The Fantastic Four , The X - Men , The Avengers , Iron Man , Hulk , The Silver Surfer and Thor and have sent notices terminating copyright to publishers Marvel and Disney , as well as film studios that have made movies and TV shows based on characters he created or co-created , including Sony , Universal , 20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures .
Just as the Jerry Siegel estate has done so with rights to Superman , so Kirby 's heirs are looking to regain his share of copyright in the characters and their use in comics and other media .
the heirs are using the same lawyers as the Siegels , Toberoff & Associates , who have been fairly successful in their case against DC / Warner so far .
Such claims , if found valid , would begin from 2014 and , as always , its worth noting that Marvel / Disney will still own the trademarks of the characters in comics , and the studios in movies .
The likelihood is that , if successful , Kirby heirs would enter into negotiation with Marvel over terms to continue publishing comics based on his work .
Jack Kirby battled Marvel for years over the return of the physical artwork to his comics , and was asked to sign documents that would have irrevocable and specifically signed away rights to the characters , something he refused to do .
He also contributed to other creators fights with Marvel , including Steve Gerber , co-creating Destroyer Duck with Gerber in a benefit book over the Howard The Duck deal .
Born Jacob Kurtzberg , Jack Kirby is considered the most influential superhero comic artist in the world , though he also worked for decades in romance , war and science - fiction comics .
His DC work also provided much of the backbone for the recent blockbuster series Final Crisis from DC .

On Thursday morning , the freshman Republican announced that he would lead a congressional delegation to Honduras on Friday ahead of the country ’s Nov. 29 elections .
The U.S. State Department , which acknowledges ousted President Manuel Zelaya as the legitimate ruler of the Central American nation , has said it will not recognize the contests because of ongoing political turmoil .
“ No U.S. Senator has yet been to Honduras to assess facts of crisis .
[ Kerry ] & Obama admin using bullying tactics to hide truth , ” DeMint , who also sits on the Foreign Relations panel , said on Twitter after he heard the trip would not occur .
" @JohnKerry ( Foreign Rel. chair ) trying to hide truth to protect Zelaya , blocking our fact - finding trip to Honduras at last minute , " DeMint also tweeted late Thursday afternoon .
DeMint 's office followed with a statement .
" These bullying tactics by the Obama administration and Senator Kerry must stop , and we must be allowed to get to the truth in Honduras .
Not a single U.S. Senator has traveled to Honduras to learn the facts on the ground .
" While this administration has failed to act decisively in Afghanistan , it is has no problem cracking down on a democratic ally and one of the poorest nations in Latin America , " DeMint added .
" Now , President Obama and Democrats ' blind support for this would - be dictator and friend of Hugo Chavez will prevent members of Congress from learning the truth first hand . "
Kerry spokesman Frederick Jones responded Thursday evening that " Senator DeMint ’s statement wins an A for ‘ audacity . ’ "
" The Foreign Relations Committee always prefers to operate in a bi-partisan and collegial fashion , and it did so when it approved these two nominees by votes of 14 to 4 for Mr. Shannon and 15 to 4 for Mr. Valenzuela , " Jones told The Hill in a statement .
" But now Sen .
DeMint refuses to let the nominations of two distinguished public servants even be considered on the floor of the Senate . "
" When Senator DeMint lifts these holds and allows these individuals to receive an up or down vote on the Senate floor , the Committee will approve his travel to Honduras , a country that is in the middle of delicate , political crisis . ”
Honduras has experienced political turmoil since June , when the Honduran military deposed Zelaya after a supreme court ruling ordering his removal .
The now - exiled president had attempted to change the country 's constitution in part to eliminate presidential term limits .
DeMint has long objected to the Obama administration 's response to the crisis , saying they should shun Zelaya , not promote his return to power .
The United States does not recognize the de facto government led by President Roberto Micheletti .
Honduras ’ acting government has hoped that the November elections would put an end to the political crisis there .
Zelaya ’s ouster has divided members of Congress .
Many Republicans accused Zelaya , who is a left - leaning figure , of acting unconstitutionally to extend his term as president .
Many Democrats stood behind Zelaya and alleged the coup was an undemocratic power grab .
Kerry has frequently criticized the acting regime for shunning diplomatic attempts to resolve the crisis .
In early September , he praised a vote to slash $ 30 million in aid to the country in reaction to the ouster .
The 2004 Democratic presidential nominee also demanded that Zelaya be returned to power under the conditions of a negotiated agreement with Costa Rican President Oscar Arias .
“ I strongly support Costa Rican President Arias ’s efforts to restore democracy with the conditioned return of President Zelaya , ” Kerry said after the aid reduction .
“ The coup regime has engaged in undemocratic practices that cast a dark shadow over elections scheduled for November . ”
Kerry echoed the stance of the U.S. government , which also backs supports restoring Zelaya to power .
Under the terms of the agreement , Zelaya would return to office with limited power then leave office when his term expires in December .
DeMint first announced the delegation ’s trip on Twitter , a statement that was later confirmed by his office .
“ Leading delegation to Honduras tomorrow to support Nov 29 elections .
Hondurans should be able to choose their own future , ” he wrote .
The identities of the lawmakers who planned to travel with DeMint are unknown .
Under the current constitution , both Micheletti and Zelaya are ineligible for re-election .
To the Editor :
Ali Soufan effectively answers the question of whether our nation ’s use of torture “ worked ” ( “ What Torture Never Told Us , ” Op - Ed , Sept. 6 ) .
But this is a question that we should n’t be asking .
We have domestic laws and international treaties that make torture illegal .
Senior government officials are not above the law , even if breaking the law “ works . ”
And we settled the question of whether waterboarding is torture when we prosecuted Japanese officers for using this enhanced interrogation method on our soldiers during World War II .
The questions we need to answer now are “ Who was responsible for breaking these laws ? ” “ How can they be brought to justice ? ” and “ How do we make sure this never happens again ? ”

The price ?
Hard to know , real estate agents say , because not since Richard M. Nixon lived in a New York City apartment has the market tried to assess the value of immediate proximity to the president in a dense urban neighborhood .
( The Greenwood Avenue neighbors are separated by about 20 feet , a line of thin trees and an iron fence that is more decorative than forbidding . )
The Grimshaws paid $ 35,000 in 1973 ; other homes in the area have sold for $ 1 million to $ 2.5 million .
“ We think there ’s a premium , ” said Matt Garrison , the listing agent with Coldwell Banker , who does not intend to put an asking price on the house .
“ We do n’t know what the Obama effect is . ”
Mr. Garrison said he had tried to scout similar parcels of residential property , but pointed out that there was no family living next door to the White House .
“ I tried to look at 12 Downing Street , but that ’s all offices , ” Mr. Garrison said , referring to the building next door to the British prime minister ’s residence in London .
“ Here we are looking out the kitchen window at the president ’s back porch .
Buyers establish the market .
Stuff sells for what people are willing to pay . ”
On the third floor , in a playroom , a large picture window offers a sweeping view of the red brick Georgian - style house that Mr. Obama bought in 2005 for $ 1.65 million .
I ’ve happened upon an interesting snippet from the regular Nature “ 100 years ago ” feature concerning a 1907 debate on whether insanity was really increasing or whether it just seemed that way due to changes in diagnosis and treatment methods .
It made me smile because it is almost exactly the same argument that is being had now about whether cases of autism are genuinely increasing or whether this just reflects changes in diagnosis and treatment methods :
Notwithstanding the much improved statistics recently issued by the Lunacy Commissioners , thoroughly satisfactory materials are still wanting for solving the question whether the prevalence of insanity is or is not increasing .
The importance of the problem … imparts special interest to a paper by Mr. Noel A. Humphreys on the alleged increase of insanity …
This paper shows in a striking manner the value of scientific statistics in checking crude figures .
The author expresses a decided opinion that there is no absolute proof of actual increase of occurring insanity in England and Wales , and that the continued increase in the number and proportion of the registered and certified insane is due to changes in the degree and nature of mental unsoundness for which asylum treatment is considered necessary , and to the marked decline in the rate of discharge ( including deaths ) from asylums .

Driving along the highway at night , it is an eerie sight to look at some of the vacant buildings .
The lights are on but the floors are empty awaiting an audience that will never come .
Can it be that commercial real estate , with over $ 3 trillion outstanding be in worse shape than residential housing ?
In a short answer , yes .
I ’ll give you a few reasons but the most obvious is that unlike housing , there is rarely a price point where a commercial real estate development will make sense without a sustainable economy .
For example , there are places in Nevada and Arizona that were built with no residences coming and commercial real estate to feed this ghost population .
Another point that makes commercial real estate more problematic is the way commercial projects are financed .
These projects are financed with short - term financing that requires refinancing every 5 , 7 , or even 10 years .
This stands in sharp contrast to the 30 year fixed mortgages on residential properties .
If you really want to see what is happening on the ground , you need to look at housing starts .
After all , these are the builders and should have a better sense of regional niches and demand .
Now their projections are never perfect but they probably have a better sense than say Wall Street which is a few thousand miles from billion dollar construction projects :
Now here is a fascinating case and point .
Single family starts have collapsed .
This is true .
Since the peak , they have been trending lower and lower .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve even with virtually interest free money cannot stimulate demand in an overbuilt market .
Single family starts are down 8.7 year over year .
But multifamily starts ?
Try a stunning 67.4 percent .
Many of these projects are financed with commercial loans and you can see that the demand is virtually gone .
This is one of those unintended consequences that Wall Street and the government fail to notice .
With a tunnel vision focus on propping up the residential housing market , demand for homes has increased .
People are buying up foreclosures and financing their purchase with historically low interest rates courtesy of the Federal Reserve .
The government has also sweeten the pot with the $ 8,000 poorly targeted tax credit .
But what the Fed fails to see is that vacancy rates were already high for both residential and commercial buildings in the form of say , apartments .
So what happens ?
You shift demand from lower priced rental units to homes .
Good news right ?
Not at all .
Now what you have is an increase in defaults for commercial loans instead of residential loans because of even higher vacancy rates .
As I mentioned before , the problem with commercial real estate loans is also how they are financed .
Take a look at the turnover profile for the next few years :
Source : Zero Hedge
From 2009 to 2010 the amount of MBS maturing is double and it only elevates from that point on .
Who is going to refinance an empty strip mall ?
Or a gym with no membership ?
What about an office complex with no tenants ?
This is the big problem with commercial loans .
Consumer demand has shifted .
With the U.S. dollar tanking the average American is facing higher costs for daily items like food and is seeing some items like cars drop on the secondary market but what is a priority ?
How deep have prices fallen on commercial real estate ?
Try 41 percent :
Unlike residential housing that has stabilized in terms of pricing because of trillions in bailouts , commercial real estate is on the way down .
But make no mistake , the U.S. Treasury has been having off poorly publicized talks about preemptive bailouts in this market .
Even without the talks , the Fed is willing to take everything and anything in exchange for Treasuries .
While the residential housing market peaked in 2005 , it looks like CRE peaked in late 2007 .
It looks like a two year lag is in the commercial real estate market and this is typical .
These projects take longer to build and usually follow residential projects .
Rents have been falling and this has hurt real estate in Manhattan to apartments in Los Angeles .
In many cases , you would think that a lower price for something is good but this is only reflecting a weaker American consumer that is confronting an unemployment and underemployment rate of 17 percent .
We hear much about this jobless recovery but incomes are low , commercial real estate is a major problem , and the average American is seeing their view of the American Dream become more and more of a mirage .
The only winner seems to be Wall Street .
David Einhorn from Greenlight Capital summed it up well :
“ And the neighbors are angry , because at some level , Americans understand that the Washington - Wall Street relationship has rewarded the least deserving people and institutions at the expense of the prudent .
They do n’t know the particulars or how to argue against the “ without banks , we have no economy ” demagogues .
So , they fight healthcare reform , where they have enough personal experience to equip them to argue with Congressmen at town hall meetings .
As I see it , the revolt over healthcare is n’t really about healthcare , but represents a broader upset at Washington .
The lack of trust over the inability to deal seriously with the party goers feeds the lack of trust over healthcare . ”
And this leads us to where we are at .
When have we heard prolonged debates regarding commercial real estate or even the bailouts ?
We sometimes hear the plutocracy argument that we should have bailed out Lehman Brothers .
Really ?
We should have a talk about why we did n’t let more firms fail .
From both parties we get estimates of healthcare reform between $ 800 billion and $ 1.2 trillion over a decade .
Commercial real estate has 3 times that sum !
Not one hour of airtime is dedicated to talking about this .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve have backstopped nearly $ 13 trillion from the banking sector .
The airwaves should be saturated on a daily basis talking about this and the other bailouts that were never fully vetted .
Do n’t believe it ?
Here is your bill :
If there is no resistance , we are going to have another major stealth bailout of the commercial real estate industry .
The U.S. Treasury already has a nice name of “ Plan C ” for it .
Next time you see those empty buildings keep in mind that you might be paying the mortgage on it pretty soon .

We 've introduced a new feature in version 1.6 of the Android platform : Text - To - Speech ( TTS ) .
Also known as " speech synthesis " , TTS enables your Android device to " speak " text of different languages .
Before we explain how to use the TTS API itself , let 's first review a few aspects of the engine that will be important to your TTS - enabled application .
We will then show how to make your Android application talk and how to configure the way it speaks .
Languages and resources
About the TTS resources
The TTS engine that ships with the Android platform supports a number of languages : English , French , German , Italian and Spanish .
Also , depending on which side of the Atlantic you are on , American and British accents for English are both supported .
The TTS engine needs to know which language to speak , as a word like " Paris " , for example , is pronounced differently in French and English .
So the voice and dictionary are language - specific resources that need to be loaded before the engine can start to speak .
Although all Android - powered devices that support the TTS functionality ship with the engine , some devices have limited storage and may lack the language - specific resource files .
If a user wants to install those resources , the TTS API enables an application to query the platform for the availability of language files and can initiate their download and installation .
So upon creating your activity , a good first step is to check for the presence of the TTS resources with the corresponding intent :
Intent checkIntent = new Intent ( ) ; checkIntent.setAction(TextToSpeech.Engine.ACTION_CHECK_TTS_DATA ) ; startActivityForResult(checkIntent , MY_DATA_CHECK_CODE ) ;
A successful check will be marked by a CHECK_VOICE_DATA_PASS result code , indicating this device is ready to speak , after the creation of our android.speech.tts .
TextToSpeech object .
If not , we need to let the user know to install the data that 's required for the device to become a multi-lingual talking machine !
Downloading and installing the data is accomplished by firing off the ACTION_INSTALL_TTS_DATA intent , which will take the user to Android Market , and will let her / him initiate the download .
Installation of the data will happen automatically once the download completes .
Here is an example of what your implementation of onActivityResult ( ) would look like :
private TextToSpeech mTts ; protected void onActivityResult ( int requestCode , int resultCode , Intent data ) { if ( requestCode == MY_DATA_CHECK_CODE ) { if ( resultCode == TextToSpeech.Engine.CHECK_VOICE_DATA_PASS )
{ // success , create the TTS instance mTts = new TextToSpeech ( this , this ) ; } else { // missing data , install it Intent installIntent = new Intent ( ) ; installIntent.setAction ( TextToSpeech .Engine.ACTION_INSTALL_TTS_DATA ) ; startActivity ( installIntent ) ; } } }
In the constructor of the TextToSpeech instance we pass a reference to the Context to be used ( here the current Activity ) , and to an OnInitListener ( here our Activity as well ) .
This listener enables our application to be notified when the Text - To - Speech engine is fully loaded , so we can start configuring it and using it .
Languages and Locale
At Google I/O , we showed an example of TTS where it was used to speak the result of a translation from and to one of the 5 languages the Android TTS engine currently supports .
Loading a language is as simple as calling for instance :
m Tts.setLanguage ( Locale.US ) ;
to load and set the language to English , as spoken in the country " US " .
A locale is the preferred way to specify a language because it accounts for the fact that the same language can vary from one country to another .
To query whether a specific Locale is supported , you can use isLanguageAvailable ( ) , which returns the level of support for the given Locale .
For instance the calls :
m Tts.isLanguageAvailable( Locale.UK ) ) mTts.isLanguageAvailable( Locale.FRANCE ) ) mTts.isLanguageAvailable ( new Locale ( " spa " , " ESP " ) ) )
will return TextToSpeech .LANG_COUNTRY_AVAILABLE
to indicate that the language AND country as described by the Locale parameter are supported ( and the data is correctly installed ) .
But the calls :
m Tts.isLanguageAvailable( Locale.CANADA_FRENCH ) ) mTts.isLanguageAvailable ( new Locale ( " spa " ) )
will return TextToSpeech .LANG_AVAILABLE
.
In the first example , French is supported , but not the given country .
And in the second , only the language was specified for the Locale , so that 's what the match was made on .
Also note that besides the ACTION_CHECK_TTS_DATA intent to check the availability of the TTS data , you can also use isLanguageAvailable ( ) once you have created your TextToSpeech instance , which will return TextToSpeech .
LANG_MISSING_DATA
if the required resources are not installed for the queried language .
Making the engine speak an Italian string while the engine is set to the French language will produce some pretty interesting results , but it will not exactly be something your user would understand
So try to match the language of your application 's content and the language that you loaded in your TextToSpeech instance .
Also if you are using Locale.getDefault ( ) to query the current Locale , make sure that at least the default language is supported .
Making your application speak
Now that our TextToSpeech instance is properly initialized and configured , we can start to make your application speak .
The simplest way to do so is to use the speak ( ) method .
Let 's iterate on the following example to make a talking alarm clock :
String myText1 = " Did you sleep well ? " ; String my Text2 = " I hope so , because it 's time to wake up . " ; mTts.speak(myText1 , TextToSpeech.QUEUE_FLUSH , null ) ; mTts.speak(myText2 , TextToSpeech .QUEUE_ADD , null ) ;
The TTS engine manages a global queue of all the entries to synthesize , which are also known as " utterances " .
Each TextToSpeech instance can manage its own queue in order to control which utterance will interrupt the current one and which one is simply queued .
Here the first speak ( ) request would interrupt whatever was currently being synthesized : the queue is flushed and the new utterance is queued , which places it at the head of the queue .
The second utterance is queued and will be played after myText1 has completed .
Using optional parameters to change the playback stream type
On Android , each audio stream that is played is associated with one stream type , as defined in android.media .
AudioManager .
For a talking alarm clock , we would like our text to be played on the AudioManager .
STREAM_ALARM stream type so that it respects the alarm settings the user has chosen on the device .
The last parameter of the speak ( ) method allows you to pass to the TTS engine optional parameters , specified as key / value pairs in a HashMap .
Let 's use that mechanism to change the stream type of our utterances :
HashMap < String , String > myHashAlarm = new HashMap ( ) ; myHashAlarm.put( TextToSpeech.Engine.KEY_PARAM_STREAM , String.valueOf(AudioManager.STREAM_ALARM ) ) ; mTts.speak(myText1 , TextToSpeech.QUEUE_FLUSH , myHashAlarm ) ; mTts.speak(myText2 , TextToSpeech.QUEUE_ADD , myHashAlarm ) ;
Using optional parameters for playback completion callbacks
Note that speak ( ) calls are asynchronous , so they will return well before the text is done being synthesized and played by Android , regardless of the use of QUEUE_FLUSH or QUEUE_ADD .
But you might need to know when a particular utterance is done playing .
For instance you might want to start playing an annoying music after myText2 has finished synthesizing ( remember , we 're trying to wake up the user ) .
We will again use an optional parameter , this time to tag our utterance as one we want to identify .
We also need to make sure our activity implements the TextToSpeech .
OnUtteranceCompletedListener interface :
m Tts.setOnUtteranceCompletedListener(this ) ; myHashAlarm.put( TextToSpeech.Engine.KEY_PARAM_STREAM , String.valueOf(AudioManager.STREAM_ALARM ) ) ; mTts.speak(myText1 , TextToSpeech.QUEUE_FLUSH , myHashAlarm ) ; myHashAlarm.put( TextToSpeech .Engine.KEY_PARAM_UTTERANCE_ID , " end of wakeup message ID " ) ; // myHashAlarm now contains two optional parameters mTts.speak(myText2 , TextToSpeech.QUEUE_ADD , myHashAlarm ) ;
And the Activity gets notified of the completion in the implementation of the listener :
public void on UtteranceCompleted ( String uttId ) { if ( utt Id == " end of wakeup message ID " ) { playAnnoyingMusic ( ) ; } }
File rendering and playback
While the speak ( ) method is used to make Android speak the text right away , there are cases where you would want the result of the synthesis to be recorded in an audio file instead .
This would be the case if , for instance , there is text your application will speak often ; you could avoid the synthesis CPU - overhead by rendering only once to a file , and then playing back that audio file whenever needed .
Just like for speak ( ) , you can use an optional utterance identifier to be notified on the completion of the synthesis to the file :
HashMap < String , String > myHashRender = new HashMap ( ) ; String wakeUpText =
" Are you up yet ? " ; String destFileName = " / sdcard/myAppCache/wakeUp.wav " ; myHashRender.put( TextToSpeech.Engine.KEY_PARAM_UTTERANCE_ID , wakeUpText ) ; mTts.synthesizeToFile( wakuUpText , myHashRender , destFileName ) ;
Once you are notified of the synthesis completion , you can play the output file just like any other audio resource with android.media .
MediaPlayer .
But the TextToSpeech class offers other ways of associating audio resources with speech .
So at this point we have a WAV file that contains the result of the synthesis of " Wake up " in the previously selected language .
We can tell our TTS instance to associate the contents of the string " Wake up " with an audio resource , which can be accessed through its path , or through the package it 's in , and its resource ID , using one of the two addSpeech ( ) methods :
m Tts.addSpeech(wakeUpText , destFileName ) ;
This way any call to speak ( ) for the same string content as wakeUpText will result in the playback of destFileName .
If the file is missing , then speak will behave as if the audio file was n't there , and will synthesize and play the given string .
But you can also take advantage of that feature to provide an option to the user to customize how " Wake up " sounds , by recording their own version if they choose to .
Regardless of where that audio file comes from , you can still use the same line in your Activity code to ask repeatedly " Are you up yet ? " :
m Tts.speak(wakeUpText , TextToSpeech.QUEUE_ADD , myHashAlarm ) ;
When not in use ...
The text - to - speech functionality relies on a dedicated service shared across all applications that use that feature .
When you are done using TTS , be a good citizen and tell it " you wo n't be needing its services anymore " by calling mTts.shutdown ( ) , in your Activity onDestroy ( ) method for instance .
Conclusion
Android now talks , and so can your apps .
Remember that in order for synthesized speech to be intelligible , you need to match the language you select to that of the text to synthesize .
Text - to - speech can help you push your app in new directions .
Whether you use TTS to help users with disabilities , to enable the use of your application while looking away from the screen , or simply to make it cool , we hope you 'll enjoy this new feature .
The Taliban has been building simpler , cheaper anti-personnel bombs made of hard - to - detect nonmetal components , increasing the number of lethal attacks on NATO forces in Afghanistan , according to a confidential military report .
The shift in the use of improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) away from larger anti-armor bombs has allowed the Taliban to produce more weapons and hide them in more places as they strive to kill larger numbers of American forces in southern Afghanistan ’s Helmand province and other contested regions .
The change in production from metal - dominated explosives to devices made of plastic is making it more difficult for ground troops to detect the buried IEDs with portable mine - detectors , creating an “ urgent need ” inside the Pentagon for better detection devices , the report said .
The new Taliban tactics are disclosed in a confidential report from the Pentagon ’s Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization , portions of which were obtained by The Washington Times .
The area around Now Zad , northwest of Kandahar , has experienced some of the most ferocious fighting for control of southern Afghanistan since the surge of 21,000 U.S. troops began last spring .
News reports and military bloggers say Marines on patrol face a constant threat from hidden IEDs .
“ Although the Taliban still fights with small - arms , rocket - propelled grenades and improvised explosive devices , they have increasingly focused the role of IEDs as antipersonnel devices , ” the report said .
“ Smaller , lighter , more quickly constructed and quite often triggered by a victim - operated switch [ booby trap ] , these antipersonnel IEDs have been a significant factor in labeling Now Zad the most dangerous location with the highest U.S. casualty rate in either the Afghan or Iraq theaters . ”
The Aug. 11 report , titled , “ The Taliban ’s Emerging IED TTPs in the Proving Grounds of Now Zad , Helmand Province , ” was written by an analyst at U.S. Central Command , which oversees troops in the Middle East and Afghanistan .
TTPs is short for tactics , techniques and procedures .
The shift in tactics comes at a particularly sensitive time for President Obama .
Sentiments inside the Pentagon lean toward sending more troops to Afghanistan , while key Democrats oppose such an expansion as the number of casualties grows in the theater .
The research Web site icasualties .org reports 328 NATO fatalities so far this year , already making it the most deadly since the war began in October 2001 .
The U.S. has lost 190 service members this year , after reporting 155 deaths last year .
In the past two months , more than half of the battlefield deaths suffered by NATO troops were caused by IEDs .
This month , of 31 fatalities , 15 came from IEDs ; in August , 46 of the 77 coalition deaths resulted from these devices , according to icasualties.org .
The Pentagon report said the Taliban IED research - and - development program used the Now Zad region to show that smaller , more numerous IEDs kill more people .
The rate for dead and wounded for the 2nd Battalion , 7th Marine Regiment stood at one - third of the unit in August , the report said .
A typical Marine battalion has 800 to 1,000 troops .
A military official , who monitors Afghanistan and asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media , said the Taliban is shifting to small IEDs for a number of reasons .
“ You ’ve got the fear factor , ” the source said .
“ It ’s also less costly .
It ’s easier for them to build those things and use them as opposed to running the risk of getting in firefights and losing people .
The cost is relatively low .
We ’re fighting guys who from all appearances are from three centuries ago , but we ca n’t figure out how to beat them . ”
The Pentagon report said the Taliban has become adept at mining a road called the “ Pakistani Alley ” — so - named because Taliban militants use it to ferry in new fighters from the neighboring country .
“ U.S. troop movements are split between foot and mounted patrols , ” the report said .
“ The terrain and deplorable road conditions often necessitate that foot patrols be conducted on uneven terrain .
The Taliban have taken advantage of this by littering the area north of ‘ Pakistani Alley ’ with numerous antipersonnel IEDs to maintain control over their northern buffer - zone . ”
Robert Maginnis , a military analyst and Army adviser , said IEDs are tailor - made for Afghanistan .
“ IEDs are effective in Afghanistan in part because of the terrain , ” Mr. Maginnis said .
“ There are few paved roads , which means planting a device in or near a road is easier and harder to detect by visual inspection .
The increase in Taliban use of IEDs is due to the increased coalition forces in country , which forced the relatively small Taliban force to adjust its tactics .
It stretches the force ’s impact . ”
Lt. Col. Edward Sholtis , a spokesman for Gen. Stanley McChrystral , the top commander in Afghanistan , told The Times the general has stepped up efforts to disrupt networks before they can plant bombs , and get better intelligence on where they are embedded in light of “ the weapons ’ increasing use against coalition forces and because of the impact of a larger number of indiscriminate , victim - operated IEDs on the Afghan people . ”
“ Like most everything in Afghanistan , the IED threat here is complex , and we go about addressing it in a number of ways , ” Col .
Sholtis said .
“ Broadly speaking , there ’s an offensive component that involves intelligence collection tied to Afghan and coalition operations designed to identify and disrupt the cells that manufacture , place and operate IEDs .
“ There ’s also a robust defensive component that involves a comprehensive reporting system that tracks IED events , disseminates threat intelligence to all levels , identifies emerging threats and lessons learned , and trains the force in the latest threats and countermeasures . ”
Two nonmetallic ingredients , salt solution and carbon , are being considered by the Taliban as IED trigger mechanisms , the Pentagon report said .
The Taliban can harvest carbon from everyday batteries .
This reduces the amount of metal , making detection difficult .
“ The use of IEDs as antipersonnel mines offers several distinct advantages , ” the report said .
“ They are small and easily transported and emplaced .
They are easily camouflaged and do not need to be remotely controlled .
In addition , antipersonnel IEDs are almost always lethal to their victims and are extremely difficult to detect with current U.S. minesweepers . ”
One Taliban tactic involves waiting until NATO forces enter an IED field .
Once a bomb explodes , the militants open fire with mortars and rocket grenades .
The military source said the Taliban is also thwarting detection by using long pull - cords rather than an electronic signal to ignite IEDs .
This way , the bomb cannot be defeated by electronic countermeasures on vehicles and aircraft that jam the signal .
The source , who completed several tours in Afghanistan , said the Taliban strategy has been to abandon some villages rather than fight the Marines head - on .
They then watch the Marines ’ routines and place IEDs along those routes .
The Pentagon report said the current mine detector , the AN / PSS - 12 , is not sufficiently sensitive to pick up the scarce metal in anti-personnel IEDs .
“ There is an urgent need to identify new man-portable detection platforms to expand the ability of U.S. troops to detect anti-personnel IED - mines , ” the report concludes .
One system now readily available commercially consists of electric field sensors , which can pick up electricity from nonmetallic conductors , the report said .

Jason Douglass , Rob Dew , Jason Bermas
Infowars
September 23 , 2009
Editor ’s Note :
This is a rush report to protect our reporters on the ground .
It is an integration of multiple first person accounts from Jason Douglass , Rob Dew and Jason Bermas .
Paul Watson , at PrisonPlanet.com , posted a link to DefenseLink stating that more than 2,000 Army , Air Force and National Guard troops were massing at a National Guard refueling station in the suburb of Pittsburgh in preparation for riot control .
So we did what any news company would do– we sent our reporters to the base to request to speak to their press spokesperson .
The following secret police oppression then occurred .
Infowars reporter Jason Douglass gave Alex Jones in Austin , Texas the phone number that the agent called his cell phone from .
Alex called the number and discovered that it was the Allegheny County Sheriff ’s Department in Pennsylvania .
A man who would only identify himself as Officer Wateska admitted to Infowars.com that he had posed as an Alamo rental car representative and offered Jason Douglass two free days of rental if he would trade the car in .
The Infowars crew would then have been taken into custody by a Joint - Terrorism Task Force .
The officer also confirmed that Jason Douglass ’ name and Driver ’s License information taken from the rental car company computers was being forwarded into the suspected terrorists database , and that it was being investigated as a potential case of terrorist activity .
Officer Wateska went on to say that the Army had filed a report with them stating that Infowars crew members had refused to provide information to Army personnel and had “ fled the scene ” – that is a complete lie .
The reporters from Infowars went to the front gate and requested to speak with the information officer .
Minutes later , another soldier arrived and told them that he would get them a media spokesman after they showed their credentials .
The Infowars crew showed him the credentials .
The officer then laughed at them and said , ‘ These are not G20 credentials ’ and then wanted to speak to their boss in Austin .
Rob Dew then called Alex Jones .
For approximately five minutes ,
Alex then heard everything said over the cell phone as Rob Dew tried in vain to give it to the Army representative .
The officer laughed at them and said , ‘ You ’re free lance media ; you might be able to talk to our public relations officer tomorrow if you come back . ’
Alex says that he was ‘ shocked ’ by how arrogant and hateful the soldier sounded , and that he was talking aggressively to the reporters .
It is clear that the Army is attempting to frame us as they did in Brooksville , Florida in 1999 .
Mainstream media has reported that the Army surveilled ‘ End the Fed ’ protests , Ron Paul , Alex Jones and listed them as terrorists .
DHS reports that Infowars.com have broken that the military and police have been trained to believe that red- blooded Americans are their main enemy .
Reporters politely request that they be able to speak to the Army ’s media representative , which is standard operating procedure and they are made the subject of a Homeland Security terror investigation .
Alex wants the lying so - called authorities to know that the American people are aware of their criminal activities ; the American people are aware of the police provacoteuring violence all across the United States at protest events , and that if they attempt to frame or entrap any of our reporters , they are going to be slapped by civil rights RICO suits that will dwarf the legal actions that stopped their criminal operations in the 1960s and 1970s .
Statement from Alex Jones :
This is not some Third World country where you can mow down and enslave a bunch of starving people .
The ghost of what this great country once was is rising .
I know what you are and what you do– you practice lies , deceit and murder .
You love the death you deal out to innocent people .
Well know this , your masters inject you with cancer - filled vaccines everyday– all you New World Order servants drink deeper from the feted cup that you pour out on the people .
You curse yourself , your family name and everything this great Republic ever stood for .
How dare you try to frame good , decent , First Amendment reporters .
I pray that God soften your hearts and that you become good , decent people once again , and not a bunch of arrogant control freaks on power trips .
I know that you ’re just spoiling to bring in full tyranny upon this nation– but the American people are waking up to who and what you are .
The majority of your commanders have completely given themselves over to true evil , but I know that Ron Paul received more contributions from the military than any other presidential candidate , and I know the good soldiers are with us , and that they know what ’s happening .
There is a hostile corporate takeover taking place in the United States .
Foreign offshore banks have created tens of trillions of dollars in fiat derivatives and used it to fraudulently buy our country .
The FBI , the military and local police may have been brainwashed that those of us who are telling the truth are bad , but nobody ’s buying it .
A change is coming , but not the one the social engineers had planned on .
Statement from the Reporters : At 8:30 PM on the eve of the G20 summit in Pittsburgh , PA , I received a call from a police officer pretending to be from Alamo car rental .
During the initial course of the conversation , the supposed Alamo customer service agent tells me that the car I am driving has bad brakes and needs to be serviced .
The " agent " baits me with a promise of several free days on the rental , if I would take the car in and exchange it for another rental .
After explaining to the agent that we were stuck in downtown Pittsburgh , in the heart of the G20 control zone , and security has closed the streets to all traffic but pedestrians , I then offered to bring the rental car in once I knew what the schedule was for the road closures .
Once he realized that I was n’t going to bring the car in and their trap would go unsprung , the tactics immediately changed and he divulged that he was n’t in fact from Alamo but worked for the military as part of an anti-terrorism task force .
I could barely wrap my mind around what was happening , still stuck on the previous cover story .
Officer Wateska , as he later identified himself , then began to explain that the car I had rented was recently seen at a military installation and had failed to provide proper identification when asked .
He then insinuated that the occupants of the car had turned around and fled , leaving their identity in question .
Having no idea what to say and still reeling from the previous lies , I remained silent for a moment .
He further explained that the military feared we may be terrorists and had released my name to the FBI and told me that I would be placed on an FBI watch list .
Furthermore , he explained that the car was now flagged , and if spotted , would be pulled over and we would be detained .
It was then implied that I was now on a list and that if I did n’t cooperate , he insinuated bad things would come of it .
Even though I was being a very good sport about the whole thing , veiled threats were being made and I felt the grasp of our far too empowered military closing its fist .
In the end , the alleged events of 9/11 have given our government carte blanche to do anything they think is necessary .
As long as they can make the leap to terrorism– and in their minds everything is potentially terrorism– they can justify almost any action including asking questions .
All their actions are justified under the veil of National Security .
Each day we slip further and further into the police state .
Below is the first hand account of Rob Dew and Jason Bermas following up on a report that 2,500 troops were stationed right outside Pittsburgh for the G - 20 :
Rob Dew and I pulled up to the gates of the 171st Airborne Division in Coraopolis , Pa .
Rob then asked the armed guard at the gate if he could confirm the report that U.S. troops were going to be deployed in Pittsburgh for the G - 20 .
The guard said he could not comment ; Rob then asked if they could speak to a PR spokesperson .
The guard told us to park in the side lot and they would contact someone .
Rob and I then pulled to the side of the road as instructed and waited for a military representative who was supposed to answer our questions .
Instead when he arrived , he was not satisfied with our credentials .
We spoke with him on and off for around 10 minutes and he was still unsatisfied with our credentials even after taking Rob Dew ’s press pass , making some calls , and talking with other members of the military .
He then told us that he would not answer our questions and if we wanted to return with better credentials the next morning he would answer our questions .
He then gave us his contact information and we left .
Upon leaving another car was parked sideways on the other side of the street , waited for us to pass , and then proceeded to follow us for one exit , and then departed .
We arrived back at the hotel to meet with Jason Douglass .
As we were leaving the hotel room Jason received a call from the unknown number .

Our regulation - hungry leaders in Washington are acquiring a new taste in governmental control .
A sumptuous feast of tempting regulatory delicacies awaits them under the guise of improving the safety of our food supply .
Is this a well - meaning but horrendously misguided attempt by the administration to " protect " the public through draconian regulations heaped onto farmers and small food processing businesses ?
After all , leftist policy - makers are the masters of unintended consequences .
Radical environmentalist organizations such as the Sierra Club have long fought battles alongside the EPA against individual farmers for producing " animal emissions " and farm dust .
Now the EPA is using the Endangered Species Act of 1973 as a weapon against agriculture .
The latest and most egregious example of this is the EPA enforcement of the act to turn off the water supply to the farmers of the San Joaquin valley .
Arguably the most essential of America's " bread baskets " , it was producing as much as 12 % of the nation 's agriculture , at least until the EPA decided that the protection of the three - inch Delta Smelt was more important and deserved the water more than the farmers .
Now up to 40,000 residents are out of work and short of food .
They are waiting in lines up to five hours long for food packages marked " Product of China " .
Farms are going bankrupt and being abandoned in droves .
Obama has so far denied requests to reverse the EPA 's decision .
There are 1,320 officially - designated endangered species in the US .
Each one can be used to regulate and restrict agriculture as the EPA so deigns .
I agree with George Carlin , who used to say , " Species disappear at a rate of 25 a day , regardless of our behavior .
Let them go gracefully . "
That brings us to the two - edged sword of the FDA .
I have worked with the FDA ( known to insiders as " the Agency " ) for over thirty years , so I know from personal experience that it can be a force for good in protecting public health .
It has restrained many a pharmaceutical and medical device business from illegal or unethical practices .
On the other hand , it has destroyed good companies and prevented beneficial products from reaching the market , many times based on the political agenda of the Agency at the time .
In this case , the sword is being directed by Obama political appointees and the legislation currently before Congress .
It is pointed directly at the heart of the food industry .
There are two major pieces of food legislation in progress , the Food Safety Enhancement Act of 2009 ( HR 2749 ) , and the Food Modernization Act of 2009 ( HR 875 ) .
These bills unleash a cornucopia of new regulations and harsh penalties on small farmers and food processors .
Fines of up to $ 7.5 million can be assessed and sentences of up to ten years in prison can be imposed for violations of the new regulations .
All farms and food businesses must pay a mandatory annual FDA registration fee of $ 500 .
There are fears that the new laws will make growing organic foods illegal by outlawing the use of manure and requiring chemical pesticide application to all crops .
Other frightening interpretations of the provisions in these bills include potentially mandating genetically - modified ( GM ) crops and " terminator " seeds that will require farmers to purchase new GM seeds each season .
One thing is certain .
The Obama administration is fundamentally changing food regulation to more closely resemble the current regulations on pharmaceuticals and medical devices .
New FDA draft guidance documents have been issued on food regulation , with more to come .
These automatically become law in two years with no congressional approval required .
One example of the unsustainable burden being placed on the food industry is the FDA 's new draft guidance document " Commodity Specific Food Safety Guidelines for the Fresh Tomato Food Chain " .
Do n't let the term " guidelines " fool you .
This is an Agency code word for " enforceable regulations " .
Under this guidance document , all growers must develop written procedures for risk mitigation strategies , employee hygiene practices , employee training and other employee policies , internal quality audits , and process validations .
They must keep written records of environmental assessments , water usage , pest control , crop production practices , corrective action processes , and the conducting of employee training and internal audits .
All of these documents and records are subject to unannounced FDA on - site inspection .
Violations will result in fines and / or imprisonment .
These types of regulations are very difficult for established pharmaceutical and medical device businesses to follow .
Many of them must hire legions of professional consultants ( mostly retired FDA inspectors ) to interpret Agency laws .
Imagine the difficulty that will now be faced by a local farmer or a corner bakery .
Many will be driven out of business .
Let me temper these concerns with the fact that we are unarguably in need of stronger enforcement of our existing food regulations .
Particularly required is increased inspection of imported food products .
Currently , FDA inspections are conducted only on 1 % of all foreign meats , fruit , and vegetables .
Even fewer foreign raw food ingredients are inspected .
Under the Obama administration , the number of inspectors is being increased .
But at the same time , the ravenous regulatory bureaucrats have been unfettered and are champing at the bit .
Is it possible that our benevolent Democrat - controlled legislative and executive branches would want to control the American populace through acquiring power over one of our basic needs for survival ?
To paraphrase an old adage , " once you 've got them by their stomachs , their hearts and minds will follow " .
The use of food to control and enslave populations has been evidenced throughout history .
The most well - known example of this was the Stalinist revolution .
Of course , he blatantly starved to death millions of Ukrainians who attempted to rebel against his authority .
But he also used food to control the people of Soviet Russia .
In the book Food Nations , an essay entitled " Food and the Politics of Scarcity in Urban Soviet Russia , 1917 - 1941 " by Mauricio Borrero , states :
In the first decades of Soviet power , a " politics of scarcity " developed in response to the government 's claims to control all aspects of food supply ( production , transportation , and distribution ) and its inability to perform these activities in a consistently reliable manner ...
In the context of persistent shortages and widespread social upheaval that was sometimes spontaneous ( Civil War ) and sometimes state - induced ( the Stalin revolution ) , the government 's control of food supplies became one of the " sticks " by which it sought to restore order and enforce discipline ...
Thus , with sharply reduced food stocks at its disposal , government rationing policies alternated between notions of food as a right to be given to all and as a privilege to be awarded by the state to selected groups of people .
My suspicions of the motives of our President are aroused by his famous pre-election quote :
" We can't drive our SUVs and eat as much as we want ... That 's not going to happen ( under the Obama administration ) . "
The decision to invite Nick Griffin , the British National party leader , on to tomorrow 's edition of Question Time is obviously an editorial judgment – and one for which the BBC and I will certainly be called to account .
But it is not a decision like the running order for this morning 's Today programme or the line - up of stars on this season 's Strictly Come Dancing .
Those who argue that , while the BBC is right to feature BNP politicians occasionally on the air , it is nonetheless wrong to have invited the party 's leader on to Question Time , fail to understand not just the programme itself , but the reality of what the BBC 's central principle of political impartiality means in practice .
Question
Time is an opportunity for the British public to put questions to politicians of every ideological hue .
Politicians from the UK's biggest parties appear most frequently , but from time to time representatives of parties with many fewer supporters – from the Scottish Socialists and Respect to the Green party – also take their seats on the stage .
Question
Time is the most prominent programme of its kind on British television , and we carefully study the support gained in elections by each of the parties , large and small , before deciding who to invite and how frequently they should appear .
It is a straightforward matter of fact that , with some 6 % of the vote and the election of two MEPs in this spring 's European elections – and with some success in local elections as well – the BNP has demonstrated a level of support that would normally lead to an occasional invitation to join the panel on Question Time .
It is for that reason – not for some misguided desire to be controversial , but for that reason alone – that the invitation has been extended .
For the BBC to say to the BNP ( or indeed to any political party ) , " Yes , you 've met the objective criteria for appearing on Question Time , but we have decided that in your case it would be more appropriate if you did n't , but instead appeared on Newsnight or Panorama , " would be for us to deny them parity with other parties , presumably on the basis of our own , or somebody else 's , qualitative political judgment about the BNP .
That is n't impartiality , it is its opposite .
It would be contrary to our obligations under the BBC 's charter ; and contrary , I believe , to the British public 's expectations of us .
It would be wrong .
Does that mean that we believe the BNP should not be challenged ?
Of course not .
They should be challenged as tenaciously and as searchingly as any other political party – and I believe they are when they appear on the BBC .
From news coverage to hard - hitting , and indeed award - winning , investigative journalism , we have probed both the BNP 's stated policies and some of the views of the party 's leaders and supporters that are expressed only behind closed doors .
But Question
Time is the public 's chance to challenge the politicians – that is why it is so important that they should sometimes be able to hear and interrogate politicians from the relative fringes as well as from the mainstream .
Political parties , of course , have the right to be treated fairly and evenhandedly by the BBC .
But the central right we are upholding in this decision is the public 's right to hear the full range of political perspectives , to hear other members of the public putting those perspectives to the test , and then to form their own conclusions .
Excluding any party with demonstrable popular support from taking part in the programme would be to curtail this public right .
The case against inviting the BNP to appear on Question Time is a case for censorship : the case , in other words , that ( in the opinion of those who make it ) the BNP 's policies are so abhorrent and so liable to sow hatred and division that they should be excluded from this form of public discourse altogether .
Democratic societies sometimes do decide that some parties and organisations are beyond the pale .
As a result , they proscribe them and / or ban them from the airwaves .
The UK government took exactly this step with specific parties and organisations in Northern Ireland in the 1980s .
Many would argue that proscription and censorship can be counter - productive , and that it is usually better to engage and challenge extreme views than to try to eliminate them through suppression .
My point is simply that the drastic steps of proscription and censorship can only be taken by government and parliament .
Though we argued against it , the BBC abided by the Northern Ireland broadcasting ban in the 1980s , and , if the BNP were proscribed , the BBC would abide by that decision too , and the BNP would not appear on Question Time .
But that has n't happened , and until such time as it does it is unreasonable and inconsistent to take the position that a party like the BNP is acceptable enough for the public to vote for , but not acceptable enough to appear on democratic platforms such as Question Time .
If there is a case for censorship , it should be debated and decided in parliament .
Political censorship cannot be outsourced to the BBC or anyone else .
At the heart of public service broadcasting is the idea of public space – of programmes and services available to all , and within which people can encounter not just ideas and attitudes that accord with their own , but ones that are utterly different from theirs , and with which they may profoundly disagree .
As the present debate about Question Time demonstrates , maintaining this space is sometimes difficult and controversial .
It is also essential , if we really want the public to engage in the democratic debate about the great issues of the day .
The ex-investigator said most soldiers served their country with dignity The Royal Military Police has failed to investigate claims of abuse against civilians by British troops in Iraq and Afghanistan , a whistleblower has said .
The former senior investigator said the RMP was not equipped to deal with the pressures of their own investigations .
He told BBC 5 Live 's Donal MacIntyre programme allegations of torture and murder were being " covered up " .
The Ministry of Defence said there was no evidence of failures and claims of abuse were always fully investigated .
' Structural flaws '
Speaking anonymously , " John " said whilst most British troops had served their country with distinction , hundreds of suspicious incidents of alleged misconduct had not been properly investigated or simply ignored .
For too long I belonged to an organisation that was n't seeking out the truth
Whistleblower " John "
Army abuse ' covered up '
Referring to his time in the RMP's Special Investigation Branch , he said : " I believe that I was serving in something that was party to covering up quite serious allegations of torture and murder . " ...
For too long I belonged to an organisation that was n't seeking out the truth . "
He said a lack of resources was partly to blame , but claimed there were also serious structural flaws in the Army justice system .
One case which came to his attention involved the alleged murder of an Iraqi by a British sergeant .
There was , he claimed , evidence to strongly suggest the Iraqi victim had been shot at point blank range for throwing rocks at a British Army tank .
' Testing conditions '
He told the BBC : " A friend of mine who was a senior NCO went to the scene and was ordered not to investigate it as a murder .
He was told that statements should just be taken as if it was a routine incident . "
Some cases involving allegations of murder and abuse , followed by a failure to carry out an adequate investigation , have already come to public attention .
The death of Baha Mousa , an Iraqi hotel receptionist who died in British military custody having allegedly been beaten by soldiers , is currently the subject of a public inquiry .
Responding to the allegations , the MoD insisted any substantive allegations of abuse brought to its attention would always be investigated as fully as possible and that such cases were relatively rare .
It also said there was no evidence of systemic failure or interference in the RMP or military justice system .
In a statement it added : " We must remember that over 100,000 of our personnel served in Iraq and , with the exception of a few individuals , they have performed to the highest standards under extraordinarily testing conditions there . "

UNITED NATIONS , United States — UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon yesterday expressed strong criticism of Iran 's human rights record , voicing concern about the use of excessive force after the recent presidential election , the harassment of women 's rights activists , the ongoing execution of juveniles , and the continued persecution of minorities , including Baha 'is .
In a 19 - page report written specifically to address a request made last December from the UN General Assembly about human rights in Iran , Mr. Ban said there have been " negative developments " in the area of civil and political rights since 2008 .
The year saw " an increase in human rights violations targeting women , university students , teachers , workers and other activist groups , particularly in the aftermath of the elections , " Mr. Ban said .
" Members of various ethnic and minority groups faced harassment , violence and , in some cases , persecution , " he added , noting that " a pattern of concern arises with respect to the protection of minorities , including the Baha 'i community , the Arab minority in Khuzestan , the Nematollahi Sufi Muslim community , the Kurdish community , the Sunni community , the Baluchi community , and the Azeri - Turk community . "
The report made specific mention of seven imprisoned Baha 'i leaders who were arrested in the spring of 2008 and have since been held in Evin prison , noting that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has written to Iran " on numerous occasions to express concern and seek clarification " about the status of the seven .
Mr. Ban also noted that during the year reports " continued to be received about members of the Baha 'i community being subjected to arbitrary detention , confiscation of property and denial of employment , government benefits , and access to higher education . "
The report , which was dated 23 September 2009 but actually released yesterday , focused extensively on the government 's response to post-election protests .
It noted that Mr. Ban himself had on 22 June issued a statement " expressing dismay at the post- election violence , particularly the use of force against civilians , which had led to the loss of life and injuries . "
That statement , the report noted , called on the authorities to respect fundamental civil and political rights , especially freedom of expression , freedom of assembly , and freedom of information .
It also called for an immediate stop to the arrests , threats , and use of force .
Yet , the report noted , a spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry said the following day that he rejected the secretary general 's statement .
Like a similar report he issued last year , Mr. Ban also took note of reports of Iran 's continuing execution of juveniles , reports of the use of torture , and the oppression of women 's rights activists .
" I encourage the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to address the concerns highlighted in the report and to continue to revise national laws , particularly the new penal code and juvenile justice laws , to ensure compliance with international human rights standards and prevent discriminatory practices against women , ethnic and religious minorities , and other minority groups , " he said in the report 's conclusion .
Bani Dugal , the principal representative of the Baha'i International Community to the United Nations said Mr. Ban 's report was extremely welcome – and timely .
" Although Mr. Ban has praised Iran for some developments , such as government 's pursuit of the redistribution of wealth and poverty reduction , overall the report is quite damning , " said Ms. Dugal .
" He also makes a number of suggestions about how Iran could make a constructive response , such as by opening the country to visits by special UN human rights monitors , and we sincerely hope that Iran will heed his call .
" Mr. Ban paints a grim picture of the situation in Iran , clearly indicating that the human rights situation has worsened since his report last year .
Our hope , therefore , is that the UN General Assembly will again adopt a resolution this year urging Iran to live up its international human rights obligations . "

Aurora Biofuels
A California start - up , Aurora Biofuels , says it has cultivated algae that doubles production of biodiesel by absorbing more than twice as much carbon dioxide as conventional strains .
According to Robert Walsh , the chief executive of the company , Aurora ’s breakthrough was to develop algae mutations that can ingest carbon dioxide regardless of the intensity of sunlight .
“ Algae have a built - in mechanism to be effective at low light and as it gets brighter during the day their uptake of carbon dioxide levels off , ” said Mr. Walsh .
“ We ’ve been able to go in and alter strains by natural mutation to cause the algae to deal with light across the whole spectrum .
The algae continue to uptake CO2 through brighter light and are more productive . ”
He said Aurora has built a pilot facility “ between a 7 - Eleven and the beach ” near Melbourne , Fla. , and that for the past several months the new algae strains have been producing a gallon of biodiesel a day in an Olympic pool - sized pond .
An algae - derived substitute for gasoline is the great green hope of the nascent biofuels industry .
Aurora is one of dozens of start - ups vying to bring an algae - based product to market that will be competitive with petroleum but does not take farmland out of food production , an issue that has plagued the corn ethanol industry .
But significant hurdles remain — including finding ways to profitably extract and process the oil from the algae .
Like some of its competitors , Aurora will offer power plants and other carbon emitters the opportunity to sequester their emissions by feeding carbon dioxide into ponds to stimulate the growth of algae .
Christoph Benning , a Michigan State University professor of biochemistry whose work involves algae , serves on Aurora ’s scientific advisory board .
He said the data Aurora has shown him confirms the company ’s claims .
“ They ’ve proven that their proprietary strain can increase carbon sequestration and the ability of algae to utilize CO2 and grow higher biomass , ” said Mr. Benning , who is compensated for his work on the Aurora advisory board .
Mr. Walsh said the challenge for Aurora is to commercialize its scientific advance .
“ We ’ve proven we can do it at Olympic - pool size — can we do it at 50 acres ?
Can we maintain the costs at scale ? ” he said .
The company plans to have a demonstration plant capable of producing 1,000 gallons of fuel a day in operation by the second quarter of 2010 .
A full - scale production facility is to follow in 2011 .
Aurora has raised $ 25 million from investors that include Oak Investment Partners , Noventi Ventures and Gabriel Venture Partners .
Mr. Walsh said that financing will be sufficient to see Aurora through the construction of the demonstration plant .

PROPAGANDA TECHNIQUES
http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/fr/546409/posts
“ Propaganda Techniques ” is based upon “ Appendix I : PSYOP Techniques ” from “ Psychological Operations Field Manual No.33 - 1 ” published by Headquarters ; Department of the Army , in Washington DC , on 31 August 1979
( from http://www.zoehouse.com/is/sco/proptech.html)
Knowledge of propaganda techniques is necessary to improve one ’s own propaganda and to uncover enemy PSYOP stratagems .
Techniques , however , are not substitutes for the procedures in PSYOP planning , development , or dissemination .
Techniques may be categorized as :
Characteristics of the content self - evident .
additional information is required to recognize the characteristics of this type of propaganda .
“ Name calling ” and the use of slogans are techniques of this nature .
Additional information required to be recognized .
Additional information is required by the target or analyst for the use of this technique to be recognized .
“ Lying ” is an example of this technique .
The audience or analyst must have additional information in order to know whether a lie is being told .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Evident only after extended output .
“ Change of pace ” is an example of this technique .
Neither the audience nor the analyst can know that a change of pace has taken place until various amounts of propaganda have been brought into focus .
Nature of the arguments used .
An argument is a reason , or a series of reasons , offered as to why the audience should behave , believe , or think in a certain manner .
An argument is expressed or implied .
Inferred intent of the originator .
This technique refers to the effect the propagandist wishes to achieve on the target audience .
“ Divisive ” and “ unifying ” propaganda fall within this technique .
It might also be classified on the basis of the effect it has on an audience .
SELF -EVIDENT TECHNIQUE
Appeal to Authority .
Appeals to authority cite prominent figures to support a position idea , argument , or course of action .
Assertion .
Assertions are positive statements presented as fact .
They imply that what is stated is self - evident and needs no further proof .
Assertions may or may not be true .
Bandwagon and Inevitable Victory .
Bandwagon - and - inevitable - victory appeals attempt to persuade the target audience to take a course of action “ everyone else is taking . ”
“ Join the crowd . ”
This technique reinforces people ’s natural desire to be on the winning side .
This technique is used to convince the audience that a program is an expression of an irresistible mass movement and that it is in their interest to join .
“ Inevitable victory ” invites those not already on the bandwagon to join those already on the road to certain victory .
Those already , or partially , on the bandwagon are reassured that staying aboard is the best course of action .
Obtain Disapproval .
This technique is used to get the audience to disapprove an action or idea by suggesting the idea is popular with groups hated , feared , or held in contempt by the target audience .
Thus , if a group which supports a policy is led to believe that undesirable , subversive , or contemptible people also support it , the members of the group might decide to change their position .
Glittering Generalities .
Glittering generalities are intensely emotionally appealing words so closely associated with highly valued concepts and beliefs that they carry conviction without supporting information or reason .
They appeal to such emotions as love of country , home ; desire for peace , freedom , glory , honor , etc .
They ask for approval without examination of the reason .
Though the words and phrases are vague and suggest different things to different people , their connotation is always favorable :
“ The concepts and programs of the propagandist are always good , desirable , virtuous . ”
Generalities may gain or lose effectiveness with changes in conditions .
They must , therefore , be responsive to current conditions .
Phrases which called up pleasant associations at one time may evoke unpleasant or unfavorable connotations at another , particularly if their frame of reference has been altered .
Vagueness .
Generalities are deliberately vague so that the audience may supply its own interpretations .
The intention is to move the audience by use of undefined phrases , without analyzing their validity or attempting to determine their reasonableness or application .
Rationalization .
Individuals or groups may use favorable generalities to rationalize questionable acts or beliefs .
Vague and pleasant phrases are often used to justify such actions or beliefs .
Simplification .
Favorable generalities are used to provide simple answers to complex social , political , economic , or military problems .
Transfer .
This is a technique of projecting positive or negative qualities ( praise or blame ) of a person , entity , object , or value ( an individual , group , organization , nation , patriotism , etc. ) to another in order to make the second more acceptable or to discredit it .
This technique is generally used to transfer blame from one member of a conflict to another .
It evokes an emotional response which stimulates the target to identify with recognized authorities .
Least of Evils .
This is a technique of acknowledging that the course of action being taken is perhaps undesirable but that any alternative would result in an outcome far worse .
This technique is generally used to explain the need for sacrifices or to justify the seemingly harsh actions that displease the target audience or restrict personal liberties .
Projecting blame on the enemy for the unpleasant or restrictive conditions is usually coupled with this technique .
Name Calling or Substitutions of Names or Moral Labels .
This technique attempts to arouse prejudices in an audience by labeling the object of the propaganda campaign as something the target audience fears , hates , loathes , or finds undesirable .
Types of name calling :
- Direct name calling is used when the audience is sympathetic or neutral .
It is a simple , straightforward attack on an opponent or opposing idea .
- Indirect name calling is used when direct name calling would antagonize the audience .
It is a label for the degree of attack between direct name calling and insinuation .
Sarcasm and ridicule are employed with this technique .
- Cartoons , illustrations , and photographs are used in name calling , often with deadly effect .
Dangers inherent in name calling :
In its extreme form , name calling may indicate that the propagandist has lost his sense of proportion or is unable to conduct a positive campaign .
Before using this technique , the propagandist must weigh the benefits against the possible harmful results .
It is best to avoid use of this device .
The obstacles are formidable , based primarily on the human tendency to close ranks against a stranger .
For example , a group may despise , dislike , or even hate one of its leaders , even openly criticize him , but may ( and probably will ) resent any non group member who criticizes and makes disparaging remarks against that leader .
Pinpointing the Enemy :
This is a form of simplification in which a complex situation is reduced to the point where the “ enemy ” is unequivocally identified .
For example , the president of country X is forced to declare a state of emergency in order to protect the peaceful people of his country from the brutal , unprovoked aggression by the leaders of country .
Plain Folks or Common Man :
The “ plain folks ” or “ common man ” approach attempts to convince the audience that the propagandist ’s positions reflect the common sense of the people .
It is designed to win the confidence of the audience by communicating in the common manner and style of the audience .
Propagandists use ordinary language and mannerisms ( and clothes in face - to - face and audiovisual communications ) in attempting to identify their point of view with that of the average person .
With the plain folks device , the propagandist can win the confidence of persons who resent or distrust foreign sounding , intellectual speech , words , or mannerisms .
The audience can be persuaded to identify its interests with those of the propagandist :
Presenting soldiers as plain folks .
The propagandist wants to make the enemy feel he is fighting against soldiers who are “ decent , everyday folks ” much like himself ; this helps to counter themes that paint the opponent as a “ bloodthirsty ” killer .
Presenting civilians as plain folks .
The “ plain folks ” or “ common man ” device also can help to convince the enemy that the opposing nation is not composed of arrogant , immoral , deceitful , aggressive , warmongering people , but of people like himself , wishing to live at peace .
Humanizing leaders .
This technique paints a more human portrait of US and friendly military and civilian leaders .
It humanizes them so that the audience looks upon them as similar human beings or , preferably , as kind , wise , fatherly figures .
Categories of Plain Folk Devices :
Vernacular .
This is the contemporary language of a specific region or people as it is commonly spoken or written and includes songs , idioms , and jokes .
The current vernacular of the specific target audience must be used .
Dialect .
Dialect is a variation in pronunciation , grammar , and vocabulary from the norm of a region or nation .
When used by the propagandist , perfection is required .
This technique is best left to those to whom the dialect is native , because native level speakers are generally the best users of dialects in propaganda appeals .
Errors .
Scholastic pronunciation , enunciation , and delivery give the impression of being artificial .
To give the impression of spontaneity , deliberately hesitate between phrases , stammer , or mispronounce words .
When not overdone , the effect is one of deep sincerity .
Errors in written material may be made only when they are commonly made by members of the reading audience .
Generally , errors should be restricted to colloquialisms .
Homey words .
Homey words are forms of “ virtue words ” used in the everyday life of the average man .
These words are familiar ones , such as “ home , ” “ family , ” “ children , ” “ farm , ” “ neighbors , ” or cultural equivalents .
They evoke a favorable emotional response and help transfer the sympathies of the audience to the propagandist .
Homey words are widely used to evoke nostalgia .
Care must be taken to assure that homey messages addressed to enemy troops do not also have the same effect on US / friendly forces .
If the propaganda or the propagandist lacks naturalness , there may be an adverse backlash .
The audience may resent what it considers attempts to mock it , its language , and its ways .
Social Disapproval .
This is a technique by which the propagandist marshals group acceptance and suggests that attitudes or actions contrary to the one outlined will result in social rejection , disapproval , or outright ostracism .
The latter , ostracism , is a control practice widely used within peer groups and traditional societies .
Virtue Words .
These are words in the value system of the target audience which tend to produce a positive image when attached to a person or issue .
Peace , happiness , security , wise leadership , freedom , etc. , are virtue words .
Slogans .
A slogan is a brief striking phrase that may include labeling and stereotyping .
If ideas can be sloganized , they should be , as good slogans are self - perpetuating .
Testimonials .
Testimonials are quotations , in or out of context , especially cited to support or reject a given policy , action , program , or personality .
The reputation or the role ( expert , respected public figure , etc. ) of the individual giving the statement is exploited .
The testimonial places the official sanction of a respected person or authority on a propaganda message .
This is done in an effort to cause the target audience to identify itself with the authority or to accept the authority ’s opinions and beliefs as its own .
Several types of testimonials are :
Official Sanction .
The testimonial authority must have given the endorsement or be clearly on record as having approved the attributed idea , concept , action , or belief .
Four factors are involved :
Accomplishment .
People have confidence in an authority who has demonstrated outstanding ability and proficiency in his field .
This accomplishment should be related to the subject of the testimonial .
Identification with the target .
People have greater confidence in an authority with whom they have a common bond .
For example , the soldier more readily trusts an officer with whom he has undergone similar arduous experiences than a civilian authority on military subjects .
Position of authority .
The official position of authority may instill confidence in the testimony ; i.e. , head of state , division commander , etc .
Inanimate objects .
Inanimate objects may be used in the testimonial device .
In such cases , the propagandist seeks to transfer physical attributes of an inanimate object to the message .
The Rock of Gibraltar , for example , is a type of inanimate object associated with steadfast strength .
Personal Sources of Testimonial Authority :
Enemy leaders .
The enemy target audience will generally place great value on its high level military leaders as a source of information .
Fellow soldiers .
Because of their common experiences , soldiers form a bond of comradeship .
As a result , those in the armed forces are inclined to pay close attention to what other soldiers have to say .
Opposing leaders .
Testimonials of leaders of the opposing nation are of particular value in messages that outline war aims and objectives for administering the enemy nation after it capitulates .
Famous scholars , writers , and other personalities .
Frequently , statements of civilians known to the target as authoritative or famous scholars , writers , scientists , commentators , etc. , can be effectively used in propaganda messages .
Nonpersonal Sources of Testimonial Authority :
Institutions , ideologies , national flags , religious , and other nonpersonal sources are often used .
The creeds , beliefs , principles , or dogmas of respected authorities or other public figures may make effective propaganda testimonials .
Factors To Be Considered :
Plausibility .
The testimonial must be plausible to the target audience .
The esteem in which an authority is held by the target audience will not always transfer an implausible testimonial into effective propaganda .
False testimonials .
Never use false testimonials .
Highly selective testimonials ?
Yes .
Lies ( fabrications ) ?
Never .
Fabricated ( false ) testimonials are extremely vulnerable because their lack of authenticity makes them easy to challenge and discredit .
PROPAGANDA TECHNIQUES WHICH ARE BASED ON CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CONTENT BUT WHICH REQUIRE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE PART OF AN ANALYST TO BE RECOGNIZED
Incredible truths .
There are times when the unbelievable ( incredible ) truth not only can but should be used .
Among these occasions are :
When the psychological operator is certain that a vitally important event will take place .
A catastrophic event , or one of significant tactical or strategic importance , unfavorable to the enemy has occurred and the news has been hidden from the enemy public or troops .
The enemy government has denied or glossed over an event detrimental to its cause .
A double - cutting edge .
This technique has a double - cutting edge :
It increases the credibility of the US / friendly psychological operator while decreasing the credibility of the enemy to the enemy ’s target audience .
Advanced security clearance must be obtained before using this technique so that operations or projects will not be jeopardized or compromised .
Actually , propagandists using this technique will normally require access to special compartmented information and facilities to avoid compromise of other sensitive operations or projects of agencies of the US Government .
Though such news will be incredible to the enemy public , it should be given full play by the psychological operator .
This event and its significance will eventually become known to the enemy public in spite of government efforts to hide it .
The public will recall ( the psychological operator will “ help ” the recall process ) that the incredible news was received from US / allied sources .
They will also recall the deception of their government .
The prime requirement in using this technique is that the disseminated incredible truth must be or be certain to become a reality .
Insinuation .
Insinuation is used to create or stir up the suspicions of the target audience against ideas , groups , or individuals in order to divide an enemy .
The propagandist hints , suggests , and implies , allowing the audience to draw its own conclusions .
Latent suspicions and cleavages within the enemy camp are exploited in an attempt to structure them into active expressions of disunity which weaken the enemy ’s war effort .
Exploitable vulnerabilities .
Potential cleavages which may be exploited include the following :
– Political differences between the enemy nation and its allies or satellites .
– Ethnic and regional differences .
– Religious , political , economic , or social differences .
– History of civilian animosity or unfair treatment toward enemy soldiers .
– Comforts available to rear area soldiers and not available to combat soldiers .
– People versus the bureaucracy or hierarchy .
– Political differences between the ruling elite , between coalitions members , or between rulers and those out of power .
– Differences showing a few benefiting at the expense of the general populace .
– Unequal or inequitable tax burdens , or the high level of taxes .
The audience should be informed of hidden taxes .
– The scarcity of consumer goods for the general public and their availability to the various elites and the dishonest .
– Costs of present government policies in terms of lost opportunities to accomplish constructive socially desirable goals .
– The powerlessness of the individual .
( This may be used to split the audience from the policies of its government by disassociating its members from those policies . )
This technique could be used in preparing a campaign to gain opposition to those government policies .
Insinuation devices .
A number of devices are available to exploit these and similar vulnerabilities :
– Leading questions :
The propagandist may ask questions which suggest only one possible answer .
Thus , the question , “ What is there to do now that your unit is surrounded and you are completely cut off ? ” insinuates that surrender or desertion is the only reasonable alternative to annihilation .
– Humor : Humor can be an effective form of insinuation .
Jokes and cartoons about the enemy find a ready audience among those persons in the target country or military camp who normally reject straightforward accusations or assertions .
Jokes about totalitarian leaders and their subordinates often spread with ease and rapidity .
However , the psychological operator must realize that appreciation of humor differs among target groups and so keep humor within the appropriate cultural context .
– Pure motives .
This technique makes it clear that the side represented by the propagandist is acting in the best interests of the target audience , insinuating that the enemy is acting to the contrary .
For example , the propagandist can use the theme that a satellite force fighting on the side of the enemy is insuring the continued subjugation of its country by helping the common enemy .
– Guilt by association : Guilt by association links a person , group , or idea to other persons , groups , or ideas repugnant to the target audience .
The insinuation is that the connection is not mutual , accidental , or superficial .
– Rumor : Malicious rumors are also a potentially effective form of insinuation .
– Pictorial and photographic propaganda : A photograph , picture , or cartoon can often insinuate a derogatory charge more effectively than words .
The combination of words and photograph , picture , or cartoon can be far more effective .
In this content , selected and composite photographs can be extremely effective .
– Vocal : Radio propagandists can artfully suggest a derogatory notion , not only with the words they use , but also by the way in which they deliver them .
Significant pauses , tonal inflections , sarcastic pronunciation , ridiculing enunciation , can be more subtle than written insinuation .
Card stacking or selective omission .
This is the process of choosing from a variety of facts only those which support the propagandist ’s purpose .
In using this technique , facts are selected and presented which most effectively strengthen and authenticate the point of view of the propagandist .
It includes the collection of all available material pertaining to a subject and the selection of that material which most effectively supports the propaganda line .
Card stacking , case making , and censorship are all forms of selection .
Success or failure depends on how successful the propagandist is in selecting facts or “ cards ” and presenting or “ stacking ” them .
Increase prestige .
In time of armed conflict , leading personalities , economic and social systems , and other institutions making up a nation are constantly subjected to propaganda attacks .
Card stacking is used to counter these attacks by publicizing and reiterating the best qualities of the institutions , concepts , or persons being attacked .
Like most propaganda techniques , card stacking is used to supplement other methods .
The technique may also be used to describe a subject as virtuous or evil and to give simple answers to a complicated subject .
An intelligent propagandist makes his case by imaginative selection of facts .
The work of the card stacker in using selected facts is divided into two main phases :
– First , the propagandist selects only favorable facts and presents them to the target in such a manner as to obtain a desired reaction .
– Second , the propagandist uses these facts as a basis for conclusions , trying to lead the audience into accepting the conclusions by accepting the facts presented .
Presenting the other side .
Some persons in a target audience believe that neither belligerent is entirely virtuous .
To them propaganda solely in terms of right and wrong may not be credible .
Agreement with minor aspects of the enemy ’s point of view may overcome this cynicism .
Another use of presenting the other side is to reduce the impact of propaganda that opposing propagandists are likely to be card stacking ( selective omission ) .
Lying and distortion .
Lying is stating as truth that which is contrary to fact .
For example , assertions may be lies .
This technique will not be used by US personnel .
It is presented for use of the analyst of enemy propaganda .
Simplification .
This is a technique in which the many facts of a situation are reduced so the right or wrong , good or evil , of an act or decision is obvious to all .
This technique ( simplification ) provides simple solutions for complex problems .
By suggesting apparently simple solutions for complex problems , this technique offers simplified interpretations of events , ideas , concepts , or personalities .
Statements are positive and firm ; qualifying words are never used .
Simplification may be used to sway uneducated and educated audiences .
This is true because many persons are well educated or highly skilled , trained specialists in a specific field , but the limitations of time and energy often force them to turn to and accept simplifications to understand , relate , and react to other areas of interest .
Simplification has the following characteristics :
It thinks for others :
Some people accept information which they cannot verify personally as long as the source is acceptable to them or the authority is considered expert .
Others absorb whatever they read , see , or hear with little or no discrimination .
Some people are too lazy or unconcerned to think problems through .
Others are uneducated and willingly accept convenient simplifications .
It is concise : Simplification gives the impression of going to the heart of the matter in a few words .
The average member of the target audience will not even consider that there may be another answer to the problem .
It builds ego : Some people are reluctant to believe that any field of endeavor , except their own , is difficult to understand .
For example , a layman is pleased to hear that ‘” law is just common sense dressed up in fancy language , ” or “ modern art is really a hodgepodge of aimless experiment or nonsense . ”
Such statements reinforce the ego of the lay audience .
It is what they would like to believe , because they are afraid that law and modern art may actually be beyond their understanding .
Simple explanations are given for complex subjects and problems .
Stereotyping is a form of simplification used to fit persons , groups , nations , or events into ready - made categories that tend to produce a desired image of good or bad .
Stereotyping puts the subject ( people , nations , etc. ) or event into a simplistic pattern without any distinguishing individual characteristics .
CHARACTERISTICS OF CONTENT WHICH MAY BECOME EVIDENT WHEN NUMEROUS PIECES OF OUTPUT ARE EXAMINED
Change of Pace .
Change of pace is a technique of switching from belligerent to peaceful output , from “ hot ” to “ cold , ” from persuasion to threat , from gloomy prophecy to optimism , from emotion to fact .
Stalling .
Stalling is a technique of deliberately withholding information until its timeliness is past , thereby reducing the possibility of undesired impact .
Shift of Scene .
With this technique , the propagandist replaces one “ field of battle ” with another .
It is an attempt to take the spotlight off an unfavorable situation or condition by shifting it to another , preferably of the opponent , so as to force the enemy to go on the defense .
REPETITION
An idea or position is repeated in an attempt to elicit an almost automatic response from the audience or to reinforce an audience ’s opinion or attitude .
This technique is extremely valid and useful because the human being is basically a creature of habit and develops skills and values by repetition ( like walking , talking , code of ethics , etc. ) .
An idea or position may be repeated many times in one message or in many messages .
The intent is the same in both instances , namely , to elicit an immediate response or to reinforce an opinion or attitude .
The audience is not familiar with the details of the threat posed .
Ignorance of the details can be used to pose a threat and build fear .
Members of the audience are self - centered .
The target can take immediate action to execute simple , specific instructions .
Fear of change .
People fear change , particularly sudden , imposed change over which they have no control .
They fear it will take from them status , wealth , family , friends , comfort , safety , life , or limb .
That ’s why the man in the foxhole hesitates to leave it .
He knows and is accustomed to the safety it affords .
He is afraid that moving out of his foxhole will expose him to new and greater danger .
That is why the psychological campaign must give him a safe , honorable way out of his predicament or situation .
Terrorism .
The United States is absolutely opposed to the use of terror or terror tactics .
But the psychological operator can give a boomerang effect to enemy terror , making it reverberate against the practitioner , making him repugnant to his own people , and all others who see the results of his heinous savagery .
This can be done by disseminating fully captioned photographs in the populated areas of the terrorist ’s homeland .
Such leaflets will separate civilians from their armed forces ; it will give them second thoughts about the decency and honorableness of their cause , make them wonder about the righteousness of their ideology , and make the terrorists repugnant to them .
Follow - up leaflets can “ fire the flames ” of repugnancy , indignation , and doubt , as most civilizations find terror repugnant .
In third countries .
Fully captioned photographs depicting terroristic acts may be widely distributed in third countries ( including the nation sponsoring the enemy ) where they will instill a deep revulsion in the general populace .
Distribution in neutral countries is particularly desirable in order to swing the weight of unbiased humanitarian opinion against the enemy .
The enemy may try to rationalize and excuse its conduct ( terroristic ) , but in so doing , it will compound the adverse effect of its actions , because it can never deny the validity of true photographic representations of its acts .
Thus , world opinion will sway to the side of the victimized people .
Friendly territory .
Under no circumstances should such leaflets be distributed in friendly territory .
To distribute them in the friendly area in which the terrorists ’ acts took place would only create feelings of insecurity .
This would defeat the purpose of the psychological operator , which is to build confidence in the government or agency he represents .

The Logic of Inquiry : Rhetorical Devices
___________________
Both inductive and deductive arguments , even when properly formed , may result in invalid conclusions if the terms of the argument are not properly formed .
The study of these sorts of errors ( called “ fallacies ” ) is called “ rhetoric . ”
There are seven main fallacies :
Fallacy of Relevance :
The argument does not relate to the issue it is supposed to be addressing .
Ad hominem ( “ personal attack ” ) —
“ If you ca n’t argue the case , argue against the person making the case ”
Ad bellum ( “ appeal to force ” ) —
“ Might makes right . ”
Ad ignorantium ( “ appeal to ignorance ” ) —
“ You ca n’t prove it ’s not true , so I ’m right , ” or , as Bart Simpson puts it , “ I did n’t do it .
Nobody saw me .
You ca n’t prove it . ”
Ad misericordium ( “ appeal to pity ” ) —
“ If you do n’t fund this project , hundreds of people will be thrown out of work . ”
Ad populum ( “ appeal to the gallery ” ) —
“ All the polls support this position . ”
Ad vericundium ( “ appeal to authority ” ) —
“ Smith & Jones ( 1997 ) say this is the way to go . ”
Post hoc , ergo propter hoc ( “ false cause ” ) —
The Latin words mean “ It came after this , so it must be because of this . ”
For example , “ Students moved in , and there went the neighborhood . ”
Accident & Hasty Generalization :
This fallacy occurs by moving from the group to the individual ( when the group characteristic is not universal ) , and from the particular to the universal .
For example , “ People in this neighborhood have incomes above $ 100,000 ; you live in this neighborhood , so your income must be above $ 100,000 ” may or may not be true — it depends on whether the group characteristic ( “ income above $ 100,000 ” ) is a universal ( “ in order to live in this neighborhood , you must have an income above $ 100,000 ) or a generalization ( “ the average income in this neighborhood is above $ 100,000 ” ) .
Similarly , “ This crow is black , so all crows are black ” may or may not be true — if all birds in the family “ crow ” must have black feathers , then it is true ; but if the color of the feathers is accidental ( e.g. , can there be albino crows ? ) , then it is not .
Complex Question :
This fallacy occurs when two ( or more ) questions are combined into one , such as “ Have you stopped beating your children yet ? ”
This assumes two questions —
“ Have you ever beaten your children ? ” and “ If so , have you stopped beating your children ? ”
Begging the Question :
This fallacy occurs when the answer to a question assumes what the question was asking in the first place , rather than providing proof ( circular reasoning ) .
For example , “ Your work does not meet performance standareds because it is unsatisfactory . ”
( And why is it unsatisfactory ?
Because it fails to meet performance standards ! ) .
Irrelevant Conclusion :
This is similar to begging the question , except that a conclusion is offered which appears to answer the question , but it does not necessarily come from the data which were offered in evidence .
For example , “ Look at all the effort I am putting forth ; of course I ’m an effective manager ! ” ( as if effort and effectiveness were the same thing ) .
Fallacy of Ambiguity : A shift in the meaning of the middle term creates the appearance of a valid argument :
Equivocation :
The same term is used , but with different meanings ( “ All men are mortal .
Jane is not a man .
Therefore Jane is not a mortal . ” )
Amphiboly :
The grammatical structure itself permits different meanings ( “ Time flies like an arrow ; fruit flies like an apple ” )
Accent : Emphasis changes the meaning ( “ You did something right ! ” –implying that you usually do n’t ) .
Excerpted from URSI 609 –Applied Quantitative Analysis by Tony Filipovitch
( The claim that there are seven main types of fallacies , followed by a listing of only six is how it appears in the original .
I ’m not sure if this is a gaffe , a clever joke , or an example of one of the types of fallacies ( Perhaps a fallacy of ommission . )

“ Have you ever beaten your children ? ” and “ If so , have you stopped beating your children ? ”
Begging the Question :
This fallacy occurs when the answer to a question assumes what the question was asking in the first place , rather than providing proof ( circular reasoning ) .
For example , “ Your work does not meet performance standareds because it is unsatisfactory . ”
( And why is it unsatisfactory ?
Because it fails to meet performance standards ! ) .
Irrelevant Conclusion :
This is similar to begging the question , except that a conclusion is offered which appears to answer the question , but it does not necessarily come from the data which were offered in evidence .
For example , “ Look at all the effort I am putting forth ; of course I ’m an effective manager ! ” ( as if effort and effectiveness were the same thing ) .
Fallacy of Ambiguity : A shift in the meaning of the middle term creates the appearance of a valid argument :
Equivocation :
The same term is used , but with different meanings ( “ All men are mortal .
Jane is not a man .
Therefore Jane is not a mortal . ” )
Amphiboly :
The grammatical structure itself permits different meanings ( “ Time flies like an arrow ; fruit flies like an apple ” )
Accent : Emphasis changes the meaning ( “ You did something right ! ” –implying that you usually do n’t ) .
Excerpted from URSI 609 –Applied Quantitative Analysis by Tony Filipovitch
( The claim that there are seven main types of fallacies , followed by a listing of only six is how it appears in the original .
I ’m not sure if this is a gaffe , a clever joke , or an example of one of the types of fallacies ( Perhaps a fallacy of ommission . )

All Things Pythonic
Stricter Whitespace Enforcement
by Guido van van Rossum
April 1 , 2005
Summary
The Python Style Guide ( PEP 8 ) lists a number of guidelines for the use of whitespace .
Since there are still a lot of folks ignoring these rules , here 's a proposal for enforcing them .
Advertisement
Python currently gives you a lot of freedom on how to format your code .
For example , instead of this :
def fool ( one , four ) : year = 2005 while year < 10000000 : year *= 10 return year + four * 100 + one
you could just as well have written this :
def fool ( one , four ) : year=2005 while ( year < 10000000 ) : year *= 10 return ( year + four * 100+ one )
This is a clear violation of TOOWTDI and enables poorly written code .
Therefore , I propose that as soon as practical , Python should enforce the following rules for horizontal whitespace :
All code indented with four spaces .
This will also get rid of the tabs problem !
No redundant parentheses allowed ( e.g. no " return ( 1 ) " where " return 1 " would do ) .
No whitespace immediately following a left parentheses or immediately before a right parenthesis .
No whitespace before a left parenthesis that starts an argument list , or before a left square bracket that starts an index expression ( e.g. " x [y ] " ) .
No whitespace before a comma or semicolon .
Exactly one space required after a comma or semicolon ( except when at the end of a line ) .
No semicolon at the end of a line ( it 's redundant ) .
More than one consecutive space within an expression is never allowed .
Asignment and comparison operators must be surrounded by spaces .
The amount of whitespace on both sides of a binary operator should be the same .
If variable amounts of whitespace are used within an expression , this should correspond to the relative priorities of the operators used .
For example : " 1* 2 + 3 * 4 " is okay but " 1* 2 + 3 * 4 " is not .
However , " 1* 2+3 * 4 " is still encouraged .
No space allowed before a colon .
In a dictionary display , exactly one space required after a colon .
In a slice , none .
The short form of a block ( " if x : y " ) is abandoned ; you must use the newline - plus - indentation form .
A limited form of vertical whitespace fascism may also be introduced , although this may encounter more resistance , so it may be put off until Python 3.0 :
At least one blank line should separate function or method definitions .
At least two blank lines should separate classes .
In order to give users sufficient time to adapt their coding style , the new syntax will be optional in Python 2.5 , and required in Python 2.6 .
In Python 2.5 , you can enable the strict whitespace checking for a particular module with a future statement :
from __future__ import whitespace
I have hacked up a quick and dirty implementation , which is available at the following SourceForge URL ( new , now updated ! ) :

About the Blogger
Guido van Rossum is the creator of Python , one of the major programming languages on and off the web .
The Python community refers to him as the BDFL ( Benevolent Dictator For Life ) , a title straight from a Monty Python skit .
He moved from the Netherlands to the USA in 1995 , where he met his wife .
Until July 2003 they lived in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington , DC with their son Orlijn , who was born in 2001 .
They then moved to Silicon Valley where Guido now works for Google ( spending 50 % of his time on Python ! ) .
