Katrina victims still waiting for aid NEW ORLEANS ( AP ) 
Theone Watts is pulling waterlogged drywall out of her modest brick home , determined to gut and rebuild .
So far , she is doing it with little government help .
" The money would help a great deal , " said Watts , a 57 - year - old resident of New Orleans ' once - bustling Gentilly neighborhood .
" But as I see it , a lot of it is going to have to be self - done .
It 's frustrating the money is slow to come . "
More than 11 months after Hurricane Katrina , Louisiana 's " Road Home " housing - aid program for victims of Katrina and Hurricane Rita has yet to come through with money for Watts or the roughly 100,000 others who have applied .
The first anniversary of Katrina at the end of August could come and go before they see the first dime .
And it could be more than two years before the last of the money is handed out .
Designed by the state and funded by the federal government , the $ 7.5 billion Road Home will be one of the largest redevelopment programs in U.S. history .
Road
Home will provide grants of up to $ 150,000 per homeowner to buy them out or help them repair or rebuild .
It is for Louisiana residents with extensive home damage , and the idea is to make homeowners whole again , by giving them as close as possible to what they had before the storm .
But the bulk of the federal funding was not approved until almost 10 months after Katrina , caught up in disputes over the costs of the Iraq war and other spending .
And the program had to run a gantlet of additional state and federal approvals .
Watts and others who can scrape together insurance dollars , loans or savings are rebuilding on their own for now .
But others can only wait .
" I think there 's a lot more waiting than have started in Cameron Parish , " said Tina Horne , administrator of the southwestern Louisiana parish hard - hit by Rita , which flattened homes , fishing and hunting camps , and fields of sugar cane .
State officials hope the housing aid will start flowing before the end of August .
" We 're going to move as rapidly as possible , " said Michael Byrne , chief program executive for ICF International Inc. , a Virginia consulting firm picked to run Louisiana 's program .
Mississippi is setting up its own housing - aid program with federal dollars , but only for flooded - out homeowners who lived outside the floodplain .
Grants are capped at $ 150,000 .
More than 16,500 people have applied , and the first applications have been approved , said Scott Hamilton of the Mississippi Development Authority .
In Louisiana , homeowners will need home inspections and damage assessments to determine if they are eligible .
Title searches will also be have to be done to confirm the applicant owns the property .
And any title disputes will add to the delays .
The grants will not arrive by check , but will instead be deposited in escrow - like accounts for people to draw down as needed to ensure they spend the money properly .
Those who were in a floodplain and had no flood insurance will have a 30 % penalty taken off what they can receive .
Homeowners who do not want to rebuild in Louisiana will get buyouts of as much as 60 % of their homes ' pre-storm value , up to the $ 150,000 cap .
Any insurance proceeds will be deducted from the grant .
In New Orleans ' well - to - do Lakeview section , volunteers from a church helped Eddie Bertrand carry soggy insulation and moldy debris from his home .
Bertrand said that the insurance proceeds he received had already been put toward his mortgage .
What was left for rebuilding ?
" Pocket change , " the 44 - year - old replied .
Bertrand was skeptical of Road Home .
" You hear good news , then you find out it 's far down the road .
It seems like the Road Home is going to take place ; I just do n't naturally believe it 's going to be enough .
It wo n't make people whole , " he said .

To the Vice President and President of the United States of America :
My name is James Circello .
I am sure some of you already know who I am now that wiretaps and spying on American citizens has been approved .
Or maybe you 've heard of me when you saw my name on a comprehensive list of Anti-War activists .
Or maybe you just know of me because I was a Sergeant in the United States Army and served as an Airborne Infantryman for six years , went to Iraq in March 2003 and served until March 2004 , remained in the Army a little longer before refusing to take part in the Occupation of the Middle East and went AWOL .
I am writing you today , not asking for forgiveness for what I decided to do , but to give you an idea of what brought me to that decision to leave the Army and speak out against the Occupation .
Though some will claim I left for other reasons and will try to force the discussion away from the facts and at the same time attempt to assassinate my character with half truths and out right lies , these are the facts .
If later we wish to get into more of my personal life , we can do that : I have no fear of it .
I will first like to say that I am no longer a member of the United States Armed Forces .
When I left the military on Easter morning , April 2007 , I have officially resigned from service to that military .
There are no ties between myself and an oppressive military regime set on occupying groups of impoverished indigenous people .
I am no longer a Sergeant or a paratrooper .
I will not respect an organization that can and does , at its own will , change entire enlistment contracts for the purpose of extending soldiers ;
Gives quarterly sexual harassment courses and still allows roughly 30 % of women to be sexually assaulted in some way , shape or form ;
Openly discriminates against people based on homosexuality , race , gender and ethnic background ;
Allows crimes against humanity and peace to occur and covers them up with internal investigations ;
Actively recruits young boys and girls from low level income high schools and communities with false promises of health care , school and job experience and fails on all accounts ;
Refuses to recognize conscientious objectors ( C.O. ) , and when individuals apply for C.O. status that are administratively " punished " by their chain of command ;
I refuse to be a part of a military and Administration that continue to abuse and torture , does n't recognize the rights of detainees and allows them to be shipped to secret detention facilities for " National Security " purposes ; a military that is illegally , based on all U.S. as well as International Law , inside of Iraq ; a military that is over extended , under funded in a war with no foreseeable end ( because time tables give our enemy a " sense of victory " , but how can the enemy have victory when " Mission Accomplished " has been declared ? ) ; a military that watches billions of government contracts given to private military outfits , while they run through the streets of Iraq unchecked , and allows soldiers to be poorly equipped and the V.A. poorly funded . ; the No Child Left Behind
Act and it's policy of making it mandatory for schools to send out the information of all students attending the school to military recruiters , or they are threatened with being cut off from Federal funding ( I thought school was a place of
learning , not a place of turning our youth into the :
" ( insert Arabic country name here ) Veterans Against The War " .
This and many other reasons are why I tell you today , I do not recognize any of the warrants that may have been placed upon me .
These warrants are merely a way to silence any opposition to this criminal war .
I do not support the United States foreign policy and will not be the fool that enforces it .
The United States has a history of using the poor of this country to massacre and oppress the poor of other countries and I say to everyone that is able to read this - I am no longer a member of the United States Armed Forces .
I also say , this by no way makes me Un - American .
I love this country and feel very strongly that it can be saved and that it must be saved .
I say this without a growing ego , but my acts as of now are what the Founding Fathers envisioned and wrote about .
This is what Democracy looks like .
Dissent is n't Un - American , it is what Patriotism means .
Patriotism is not blindly following a Flag waver , it is Direct Action .
I joined the Army after the towers of New York fell .
Swept up in the fervor , I left college to enlist .
My country was attacked - I , like many , wanted to defend it .
But here is where a majority of Americans , as well as Politicians have made their largest mistake : Defending your country does not mean destroying other Nations out of and / or for Revenge .
But the People bought into the outcry that we must kill to feel better , and the Politicians sang their songs and danced their dances , in an attempt to show who was the most Patriotic of them all !
America stayed fixed to the lies from Fox News ( can it really be called " News " ? ) and we watched the towers fall so many thousands of times until we were all ready to go kill and die for the Eagle and Red , White and Blue .
Though , I will admit , I was angry and young but it did n't take me too long to see that this was n't about defending America , but creating an entirely new enemy .
It was all there .
It was almost too perfect .
They are of different color .
They speak a different language .
They are a people that have been made to be poor - not a people that are poor ; there is a difference .
They follow a strange religion that Americans do n't understand !
A religion so very similar to Christianity , that - get this - it recognizes almost the same individuals as being Prophets that the Bible does .
They " hate us ( you ) for our ( your ) freedom " .
They will come here and kill our women and children if we do not go there ( and kill their women and children first ) .
The Administration and all of Its men and women sold it and Americans bought it .
How many people got chills when the American flag was placed there at Ground Zero ?
Remember when there were so many flags outside of houses , and flag stores ran out of them ?
So I went to Iraq and I saw their faces .
People that I thought wanted to kill me , and hated me because I was free , brought me into their homes , offered me food and something to drink .
Was the food poisoned ?
No .
Was it a poor family that could barely afford the food they were offering , but offered it to me without charge or regret ?
You bet .
I was quickly disillusioned by the military .
Senators and Representatives from Congress would come to visit us - and we would be told to get everything clean for the Dog and Pony Show .
We would up the security levels , to make everything look ship - shape .
When it was time for the questions and answers portion , we would never be without a question , because the chain of command was always there for us - and thankfully they had come up with the questions we were allowed to ask our Representatives .
This is what happens every time someone from D.C. came for a little sight seeing visit .
I can only imagine what kinds of shows they put on now .
Long story short , I left Iraq feeling really uncomfortable with America 's position in this entire conflict .
It did n't feel right .
It did n't look right .
And after much soul searching and researching , I discovered that it plain out just was n't right .
It took me a while to finally decide to leave .
I wanted to leave prior to invading Iraq , while witnessing the illegal " Shock and Awe " that killed so many innocent people and destroying the infrastructure of the country that we had n't destroyed from the first bombings in the Gulf War and what was n't antiquated and useless from the illegal sanctions held over the heads of the every day Iraqi citizen .
I fell for the trap of " do n't let your buddies down " .
And what a well spun web it is .
I can not control the conscience of another man .
I can only follow mine .
And after deciding what I believe in is not consistent with the United States military and learning that " do n't let your buddies down " is just a form of domination through guilt , I left my post in Italy to return to America .
I began speaking out against this Occupation .
I do not fear arrest .
I do not stay hidden .
I go to all national events and travel the country at my own leisure .
I say this to you Congressional Democrats : you have failed us .
I delayed my going AWOL , because when I learned both Houses of the Congress were controlled by Democrats I was confident that the war was finally over .
You ran on the platform of ending the war .
I told all of my friends to just hang on , it will be over very soon .
You funded the war and you continue to fund it .
By no means is my hostility solely directed towards the Republican bench of the government .
You lied to the American people , and more so , you failed the American people .
We are finally awake and more and more are realizing that we do n't have a two party system in America , we have a single party that is not representing the will of the People .
Realize this Congressional Democrats , that when you agreed to continue funding the Occupation , this was no longer the President ’s war against the Arabs .
You helped buy this Occupation and now you own it as well .
And I will remind you every time that I see your faces .
The People say end the war .
Stop funding the Occupation .
The Soldiers want to come home .
The insane idea of we must stay in Iraq and Afghanistan so that these thousands of soldiers will not have died in vain should never be said again !
We tried saying that in Vietnam !
The Iraqi people are strong and can defend themselves .
They also want us out .
It took years for a G.I. Resistance to begin within the Military during Vietnam , but I am telling you right now - the feeling of resentment is there .
The feeling that Politicians and Businesses are profiting off of this Occupation while we suffer through extended tours and battle Post Traumatic Stress Disorder , depleted uranium , losing friends and family and losing our lives and limbs through wounds .
We come home and barely have time to adjust to being home before we begin training to leave again .
Families are falling apart .
Iraqis are dying .
For what ?
A red , white and blue flag that says , " I'm a Patriot " ?
Dissent is Patriotic .
Open discussion is Patriotic ( this to Speaker of the House Pelosi who refuses to have an open forum with the people of her district .
I believe it is going on just over 2 Years now . )
And I say to you dissent is filling the ranks of the military and it does n't even need a charismatic figurehead to come forth and say " Dissent ; Desert ! " .
They are doing it and will keep doing it .
And the military 's attempt to censor free speech will not contain it .
Blogs , Youtube , Myspace : these sights , and others , were n't blocked for any reason other than these are the most popular places to find out that the G.I. Resistance Movement is growing daily .
So proud Patriots of America , I ask you today for nothing .
You are my Employee , never forget that .
My tax dollars pay your salary , never forget that .
I do however have demands for you :
- End the Occupation Now .
Not tomorrow .
- Bring home all American troops .
Replace them with a true international coalition designed specifically for peace keeping operations , NOT military operations .
- Remove all U.S. contractors from the Middle East that continue to benefit off of the death of the Iraqi and Afghan people and the destruction of their countries .
- Allow the Afghan and Iraq governments the freedom to decide what kind of country they want to be in , not what kind of country we want them to have .
- Allow the Afghan and Iraq governments freedom to choose who is given reconstruction contracts - which none should be American companies , for obvious reasons .
- Fund in full all reconstruction projects in Afghanistan and Iraq :
We destroyed their countries , by International Law we must pay .
By Moral virtue we must pay .
- Support the Troops means take care of them when they come home , not blindly fund their continued existence in a war zone - Completely fund the V.A. Department !
- Fund the Levees ; Do NOT allow another Hurricane Katrina or Rita .
- Oversight on Gulf Region reconstruction ( where is it ? ) - I was just in New Orleans , it is still a disaster area two years later .
Fix it now .
- Open Diplomatic negotiations with Iran - Do not allow another war to take place .
We have Diplomats that are paid by taxpayers to do just that : to Talk and Discuss .
Use Diplomats not Depleted Uranium and Cruise Missiles .
I also want to say this before I close , I wrote it in a letter , just yesterday , to the people of Italy that stand up and actively oppose more U.S. military bases in their country .
And it says :
The Iraq war is a War of Aggression , led by a cry of " We Will Never Forget " ; the famous quote from September 11 , 2001 .
Well , I have something to say for the people of the World and to the People of this Administration , as well as to the members of the U.S. Congress .
We WILL never forget .
We will never forget that the men who hijacked those aircraft on September 11 , 2001 were not Iraqi .
We will never forget that Iraq had no Weapons of Mass Destruction ( W.M.D ) when we invaded .
We will never forget that the W.M.D's that Iraq did have years before , were sold to them by the U.S. Government .
We will never forget the millions of Iraqi men , women and children who have suffered through the Dictatorship of Saddam Hussein , The Iraq - Iran War , The Gulf War , Depleted Uranium , Years of Illegal Sanctions , Shock and Awe , " Liberation " from a Tyrant only to find a new Tyrant take his place .
We will never forget the 2 million of Iraqi men , women and children who are now displaced refugees within their own country .
We will never forget the 1.5 million refugees in Syria , the 775,000 refugees in Jordan and the nearly 200,000 refugees in Egypt .
We will never forget the 1 million dead Iraqi men , women and children since March 2003 .
We will never forget that nearly 100,000 Iraqis flee the country each month since 2003 .
We will never forget the widows , widowers and orphans of those dead .
We will never forget the effects of depleted uranium in American ammunition that litters the countries of the Middle East .
We will never forget the increased infant mortality rate .
The sewage on the streets .
The sectarian violence that was never in the streets of Iraq until we installed a Pro-U.S. Government .
We will never forget the destruction of Shock and Awe that destroyed Iraq 's entire infrastructure .
We will never forget Abu Ghraib .
We will never forget the Lost men and women of Guantanamo Bay and other Secret U.S. Detention facilities .
We will never forget the every day Iraqi that is gunned down at a Traffic Control Point by a tired American teenager .
We will never forget the sounds of Improvised Explosive Devices ( I.E.D ) directed not at the American soldier , but at American Policy .
We will never forget the Women and Children gunned down at random after an I.E.D. explodes , because they were working the vegetable fields and were frightened and began to run .
We will never forget that War is , in fact , Terrorism .
And America is the largest State Sponsor of Terrorism .
We will never forget that the Men , Women and Children of the Middle East may be of the same color as Saddam Hussein , but they do not have his face .
They are not him .
They do not deserve what they have been made to endure .
And we will never forget that corporations are profiting off of the death and destruction .
We will never forget that Blackwater and other private armies , which are in themselves illegal , are running around the Middle East killing at will - and are left unchecked .
We will never forget amazing photo opportunities with the soldiers , whether its walking through a market in Iraq with security all around you and Apaches in the air , or sitting on the deck of a ship under a " Mission Accomplished " banner .
We will never forget that a majority of the American population want the Occupations to end and we will keep repeating it until you do what you are paid to do - and that is , Listen to the People .
The People are United and I know that attempts will be made to have me appear a fool and soon you will have my grade school photographs , my coloring books , a list of every library book I have ever checked out , and whatever other records these incredibly large and over - funded Secret Agencies compile on Activists in America , but I do not fear you .
You have no moral authority over me .
Or any authority at all .
I do not fear you .
Any of you .

A last - minute entry wound up the winner in the competition to host The Simpsons Movie premiere .
Springfield , Vt. , beat out 13 other Springfields across the country that entered the Hometown Movie Challenge .
Twentieth Century
Fox studio asked them to create a video showing their enthusiasm for The Simpsons .
Videos were posted on USA TODAY 's website , where readers voted for their favorite .
MORE : A ' Simpsons ' frenzy in Springfield , Vt. Springfield , Vt. , got 15,367 votes .
Springfield , Ill. , came in second with 14,634 votes .
Springfield , Ore. , was third with 13,894 .
The Vermont town of 9,300 will host the premiere at Springfield Theater on Main Street July 21 with the movie 's filmmakers on hand to walk the yellow carpet .
" We 're so excited , " says Patricia Chaffee , vice president of the Springfield Regional Chamber of Commerce and producer of the town 's film .
" We came in at the last minute , and for us to win , we feel like the underdogs , which makes this so big and so great for us . "
The town planned to spread the news the old - fashioned way : " Downtown is only a couple of blocks away , and we 'll probably go door to door on Main Street , " Chaffee said before the official announcement Tuesday .
During 18 seasons of The Simpsons TV series , the fictional Springfield 's location has never been identified .
Several of the Springfield videos made their case for being considered Homer 's " real " hometown .
" All of these years , the Springfields have supported The Simpsons , and we wanted to do something to give back and get them involved , " says Breena Camden , executive vice president of publicity for Fox .
Springfield , Vt. , rallied support through the local media and sent out mass e-mails , Chaffee says .
On Monday , local newscasts aired footage of Gov. Jim Douglas voting online and encouraging everyone to participate .
The winning entry took two days to film with help from the Vermont Film Commission .
It begins much like the opening sequence of the TV show , with the familiar theme song playing as Vermont 's Homer chases a giant doughnut ( actually an inner tube designed by a local graphic artist ) through the town , causing mayhem wherever he goes .
The townspeople chase after him until they are beckoned into the movie theater , where they sit down for the premiere of The Simpsons Movie .
The 13 other Springfields need not go " D'oh ! "
They 'll each be given special screenings of their own the night before the movie hits theaters nationwide July 27 .

Pirates target passenger and cargo vessels for ransom or loot
A spokesman said the government was disappointed , but understood why the Danica White 's owners had paid for the release of the ship and its five crew .
No details of the deal were given , but Danish television reported that the pirates had demanded $ 1.5 m ( £ 750,000 ) .
The pirates turned the vessel over to a French warship on Wednesday .
It was expected to arrive in Djibouti this weekend , and Denmark planned to send a plane to bring the crew home , the government spokesman said .
Warning shots
The Danish ship was hijacked off the Somali coast on 2 June while heading for the Kenyan port of Mombasa to deliver a cargo of building materials .
The Danish foreign ministry said the crew are in good condition , " although the hijacking has been a great strain " .
Days after the ship was captured , a US ship fired several warning shots across its bow and destroyed three boats the pirates had used in their attack and were towing behind the Danish vessel .
But the US ship stopped its pursuit after the pirates navigated the Danica White into Somalia 's territorial waters , where the US does not have jurisdiction .
Somalia 's waters are reported to be among the most dangerous in the world .
Somali pirates are trained fighters , and often use speedboats equipped with satellite phones and Global Positioning System technology .
They target passenger and cargo vessels for ransom or loot , and use the money to buy weapons .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Former Vice President Al Gore said he has " fallen out of love with politics " and has no intentions of running for office again .
Former Vice President Al Gore said the only campaigning he wants to do is against global warming .
" I 'm involved in a different kind of campaign , not for myself not as a candidate , but to change people 's minds about the most dangerous crisis we 've ever faced , and the greatest set of opportunities we 've ever confronted to solve this climate crisis , " he told CNN 's Larry King on Thursday .
When asked on NBC's " Today Show " why he would n't run for president again -- when presumably a president could shape an agenda to fight global warming --
Gore said those in power must have the support of the people to make it work .
" The key players are the American people , " he said .
" When the American people have the awareness of what this means for their children , and for their grandchildren , that all of civilization is at risk here , then they will demand that whoever is running for office , whoever is elected to serve , will have to respond to this . "
Despite Gore 's stance , many grassroots movements , with Web sites such as AlGore.org and draftgore2008.org , are trying persuade him to run .
" Americans from every corner of our nation are calling on you , " reads a petition on Draftgore.com .
" Please listen to our plea and run for the Democratic nomination for the presidency of the United States in 2008 . "
The petition has has nearly 100,000 signatures .
And according to a recent CNN poll , Gore is the choice of 16 percent of likely Democratic voters , putting him in third place , behind Sen. Hillary Clinton ( 35 percent ) and Sen. Barack Obama ( 23 percent ) .
Gore refused to endorse any candidate , saying that the election is 500 days away .
Gore has stopped short of closing the campaign door , but he has left little room to expect anything else .
" I 've kind of fallen out of love with politics .
... Whatever experience and talents I 've gained over the years -- I think it may well be that the highest and best use of that is to try to bring enough awareness of the solutions to the climate crisis and enough of a sense of urgency that we come together across party lines on behalf of our children , " Gore said .
After 16 years in Congress , Gore was vice president under President Bill Clinton from 1993 to 2001 .
He was the Democratic nominee for president in 2000 , losing to President Bush after a lengthy legal fight over voting results in Florida .
Gore toyed with the idea of a rematch against Bush in 2004 , but decided against it .
Gore was making TV appearances to discuss Saturday 's " Live Earth " concerts , which will be broadcast by NBC .
Watch Gore discuss his campaign with Larry King »
The purpose of the event is to " trigger a global movement to solve the climate crisis , " according to the Live Earth Web site .

As the climate shifts , plant and animal species are beginning to move , each in its own way and at its own pace , in order to stay within unique , evolved envelopes of temperature , moisture , and light .
A central tenet of biology and ecology is that living things are inextricably tied to their habitat .
As changes proceed , many species will be able to shift their range or change behaviors in response to change .
But some will be blocked because they ’ve run out of mountain or island , because potentially suitable habitat has been destroyed , or because they ca n’t move fast enough .
What will become of the familiar habitat associations of Earth or the biodiversity and genetic flexibility they contain ?
Unfortunately , ecosystems are unlikely to stay intact .
“ Communities of species do not move together , ” according to conservation biologist Thomas Lovejoy .
“ [ Species ] move individually at different rates and in different directions . ”
As climate change intensifies , the life zones and ecological associations familiar to us from introductory biology courses , represented by multicolored bands splashed across world maps , are not going to move in synchrony .
Rather , they will deform unevenly as the plants and animals within them react in varying ways .
No less than the ice shelves of Antarctica and the permafrost of the Arctic , ecosystems worldwide are rending and disintegrating .
With this , the rich biodiversity of Earth , the flow of life that humans rely on , is threatened .
A major factor in this disintegration is the range of speeds at which species adapt to ecosystem changes .
Looking back , by reading ice cores , pollen layers , and animal remains , scientists have been able to measure the rate and process of migrations as the glaciers retreated following the last ice age .
During those thousands of years , according to a 2005 volume titled Climate Change and Biodiversity , edited by Lovejoy and Lee Hannah , a senior fellow at the Center for Applied Biodiversity Science , a few very rapid atmospheric temperature changes occurred .
Those rapid and large climatic changes , notes Brian Huntley in Climate Change and Biodiversity , “ triggered substantial numbers of extinctions . ”
Hardier , or better placed , creatures survived only by embarking on extensive migrations as some habitats shrank or disappeared , while others grew .
Adaptation was not an option under such volatile conditions .
Adaptation , rather , requires long periods of very slow change , allowing animals to adjust their physical behaviors and characteristics in a process that leads eventually to the evolution of new species .
As is pointed out in Climate Change and Biodiversity , such slow changes — on the order of 1 degree F ( 0.6 degrees C ) over 1,000 years ( compared to the 1 degree rise over the last 100 years ) — were common in the distant past .
In recent millennia , leading up to the present day , the climate has been unusually warm and stable .
That stability , however , seems to be gone .
This means animals and plants will need to be exceptionally flexible or remarkably mobile if they are to survive .
If by flexibility we mean the ability of species to continue to live in a habitat that is changing , Camille Parmesan ’s research and analysis indicates that although there are always extraordinary individuals that can withstand stresses , “ there is no evidence for [ a ] change in the absolute climate tolerance of a species . ”
Unfortunately , species usually go extinct .
Free-living bacteria , plankton , and small insects and plants — parts of the crucial bottom of the food chain — may be able to move ( perhaps even evolve ) relatively quickly .
This is seen in the northward movement of plankton around the British Isles , for example , and in an apparent genetic adaptation to longer summers in a species of eastern North American mosquito .
But larger organisms , especially plants and trees that have evolved into narrow ecological niches over thousands of years , may not be able to change fast enough and could well die out .
In a report for the World Wildlife Fund , Jay Malcolm of the University of Toronto ’s department of forestry and ecologist Adam Markham estimated that today , global warming is pushing plant species to migrate at a rate 10 times greater than rates recorded from the last glacial retreat .
Migration of eastern forest trees appears to have occurred at a rate of more than half a mile a year , according to forest ecologist Louis Pitelka .
However , he wrote , this does “ not guarantee rapid plant migration in response to future climate change . ”
For one thing , people have greatly altered landscapes , and many of the resulting blockades and gaps impede migration .
Moreover , Pitelka stated , the species whose past migrations we know of are not necessarily representative of the surrounding plant community as a whole .
He warned of “ the unpleasant prospect that , in the event of rapid climate change , unwanted species — weeds — would be the species that would have little trouble shifting their ranges . ”
Investigations of sensitive ecosystems like the tundra and California grasslands show that changing the balance of temperature , CO2 , and precipitation reduces diversity .
Plants central to the diet of grazing animals and insects may not thrive in the new conditions .
In extreme cases , an ecosystem could shift permanently , taking on totally different characteristics , under stress of rapid climate change .
It is a well - known ecological process , such as when a lake becomes a bog or when a forest fails to regenerate after a fire or logging .
Aquatic ecologist Marten Scheffer and colleagues warned in 2001 that ecosystems from coral reefs to deserts already have problems from disease and damage from storms or by humans .
A severe climate event could rapidly overcome a system ’s weakened resilience .
Parmesan says in her 2006 paper analyzing 866 studies that “ more crucial than any absolute change in timing of a single species is the potential disruption of coordination in timing between the life cycles of predators and their prey , herbivorous insects and their host plants , parasitoids and their host insects , and insect pollinators with flowering plants . ”
“ This , ” say Lovejoy and Hannah , “ implies that vegetation communities may be torn apart and reassembled in novel ways . ”
The implications are enormous .
While ecosystems are undergoing great stress , they are more and more important as suppliers of crucial biological services and as repositories of the world ’s genetic pool .
Think especially of the rich lands of Latin America , like the Amazon , and of Africa , which harbors about one - fifth of all plants , mammals , and birds .
In a world where 80 percent of the land is influenced by roads , habitation , river traffic , or agriculture , according to the Human Footprint Project ; where overfishing and pollution have reduced many fish populations ; where 6.5 billion humans ( rising to above 9 billion in this century , if estimates hold ) vie for space and returns from the Earth — in such a world the need for the rich benefits of natural landscapes becomes ever more pressing .
Yet only about 12 percent of the Earth ’s land , and much less of the ocean , is under some kind of protection , and many of the areas that have been set aside are , whether for political or social reasons , too small to support the wildlife and natural features they were intended to protect .
Some were founded not on ecological values , but rather for scenic or historical or economic reasons .
As Jeff McNeeley , chief scientist of the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) , stated at the 2005 Stony Brook World Environmental Forum on parks and reserves , they are not at all separate from human life .
“ Protected areas mean culture .
We have created them . ”
Although we think of such lands as storehouses of biodiversity , many are crucial to local people for water , building materials , hunting , recreation , and spirituality .
Protected areas , in other words , are part of the habitat for human life on Earth , because they help guard the natural world we all rely on .
And in a time of global warming , scientists have told the U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity , “ genetically diverse populations and species - rich ecosystems have a greater potential to adapt to climate change . ”
Perversely , in many cases rapid climate change is knocking the ecological foundations of the parks from under them .
If climatic and life zones move outside a park ’s constrained boundaries , little hope remains for the associated animals , plants , and watersheds .
This includes the hundreds of migratory birds and other animals that rely on specific habitats during their yearly journeys .
“ We can think of our entire nature reserve and park system as a static network , ” wrote Louis Pitelka , “ with little flexibility in the face of climate change . ”
As famed paleontologist Richard Leakey said at the 2005 Stony Brook forum on protected areas , they are “ not protected against the ravages of climate change . ”
The list of famed parks and World Heritage Sites under great pressure from human development , and now also affected by climate change , reads like an eco- tourist ’s dream itinerary : the Everglades and West Bengal ’s Sundarbans mangrove forest , the Great Barrier Reef and Florida Keys , the Monteverde cloud forest of Costa Rica and the Daintree rainforest of northern Queensland , Glacier National Park and Mount Kilimanjaro , Nepal ’s Sagarmatha National Park , the Farallon Islands , Alaska ’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , and the Antarctic Peninsula , to name just a few .
Even natural paradises that have just been discovered and are free of direct human damage are menaced by climate change .
Just weeks after expeditions from Kew Gardens in London and Conservation International announced discovery of a new genus of palm tree and previously unknown species of insects , birds , frogs , and a marsupial tree kangaroo in the highlands of New Guinea , another researcher said weather records showed the place was warming 20 times faster than previously known .
We may think that designating such natural marvels as protected areas is enough .
But in reality , these areas ’ very isolation makes them highly vulnerable .
As Thomas Lovejoy put it at the protected - area forum , “ We have to stop thinking we can protect a few postage stamps with fences around them and use up all the rest . ”
The lands set aside in national parks and reserves , along with their ecosystem services to us , will deteriorate without strong interconnections with the surrounding land , water , and people who care about them .
The reverse is likely true as well : the surrounding land , water , and people will deteriorate if the protected areas are lost .
We need to protect biodiversity and whole ecosystems not for their sake alone , but also to help us survive climate change .

It has taken me 9 years of unsatisfactory sex to realize that men are clueless in bed and that my time will be much better spent pleasuring myself .
I am aware that I will be spending a lot more money on AA batteries and I have come to terms with that .
I will still be saving money , by not having to buy condoms .
I just want to make it clear that it is not that I cannot have an orgasm , I have them all the time , just not with someone else in the room , it is just that guys do not get what it takes to get a woman off .
For the other girls out there that have not become completely disgusted with the lack of sexual ability among men , I will lay out these rules for men to follow : 1 - Breasts are attached .
They are a part of our body and grabbing them so hard that they are literally lifted from the chest DOES NOT feel good .
It hurts .
2 - Nipples are sensitive .
This means that sucking them is good .
Gently holding one in your teeth while flicking your tongue across it is good .
Some LIGHT biting is good .
Biting them like you would a steak , all the while asking " how does that feel baby ? " ... not good .
It fucking hurts .
3- There are more to our breasts that the nipples and the entire breast would like attention too .
Just make sure that you have read rule # 1.4 - Fingering is a multi step process .
First off if a girl is not wet , do n't try to stick two fingers up her .
That will just hurt her .
Make sure she is wet .
If she is not , make out with her , play with her breasts a little and that should do the trick .
Girls like the feeling of being fucked with a guy 's fingers , but please make sure that your fingers are not all dirty , do not have hangnails , or anything else that can make us uncomfortable .
Also , the majority of women do not have an orgasm from pentration .
Now men , I know that this is a blow to your ego because most of you believe that you can get a woman off from a good hard fucking every time .
The women are faking it , and yes , this has happened to every single guy .
Every single one , you are not a sex god .
5 - The clit is a delicate thing .
# 5 will deal with fingering the clit .
Oral sex will be talked about next .
The clit is the center of a woman 's sex life .
We love our clits , they bring us lots of joy .
If you are going to rub it , please keep that finger wet .
Rub it gently .
Remember that the more excited we get the more excited our reaction gets .
That is not an invitation to start rubbing it harder , it means we love the way you are doing it at that time .
Do n't change it .
Do not try to press into it super hard , or rub it out with the pad of your thumb .
Nothing can make a girl turned off quicker than a pained clit .
6 - Oral sex should not be as dull as watching paint dry .
Most girls loved to be eaten out .
It is awesome when done properly .
Lick the entire thing , but remember the clit is your friend .
You want a girl to go crazy , alternate between her clit and the rest of her pussy .
But ... once she starts getting close , concentrate on the clit .
It is okay if you want to take you fingers and spread her lips to fully expose the clit while your tongue works magic in it .
Also , some girls like to have you fuck them with a few fingers right before they come , while you CONTINUE to lick their clit .
Fucking a girl with your tongue will feel nice to her , but seeing again that the majority of women do not orgasm from pentration , we will not get off from it .
7 - Fucking is not a race .
Sex is great , it feels wonderful .
Even though I will not orgasm from sex , it still feels amazing .
Take your time .
I did not get a brazilian bikini wax and spend $ 100 on new underwear to have something that lasts for 3 minutes .
I do n't care if you are so worked up that you have to bust a nut .
Think of something else , think of Rosie O'Donnell or your great Aunt Esther , or anything to calm yourself down and let us enjoy a good hard dicking .
There should be a ten minute minimum and 30 minute maximum of pure fucking that is mandated by law .
Of course there are days where a quick fuck is in order , or a marathon session is desired , but as a general rule , the above time frame works .
We like it gentle and hard , but please do not fuck us so hard that our heads are banging into things .
Concussions have no place in the bedroom .
8 - Variety is the spice of life .
Sometimes us girls want to just be taken missionary style , sometimes we want to be your dirty girl that takes it from behind doggie style while you grip our ponytail with one hand and finger our ass with the other .
Sometimes we want to take control and just ride you off into the sunset , sometimes we want slow Sunday morning side sex that is more for intimacy that sexual pleasure .
9 - Talk dirty to us .
Call me you whore , your dirty little slut , tell me what you want - in detail .
Tell me to suck your cock .
Tell me play with myself as I lick your balls .
If this kind of talk is broken out every once in a while as a surprise ( and only in the bedroom ) , it can make things really hot .
10 - Do n't be afraid to try new things with us .
It is ok , if you want to ask me to do something to you that is not in the ' vanilla ' sex rulebook .
You want me to stick two fingers up your ass when I blow you , ask .
You want to eat out my asshole as you jerk off then come all over my tits .
Just ask .
Just remember that girls like to get to know a guy before he breaks out his freakier side and that slightly freaky things should be exception sex .
Meaning , most girls would be down with doing non-vanilla things every once in a while with a guy that she cares about a trusts .
In fact , most of us get wet at the thought of having a little more freakiness every once in a while .
So you want to stick an anal plug in me and move it in and out while we ' 69 ' , just ask .
Happy learning men , and happy trails ladies .
Hopefully this post will do some of you guys some good in bed .
Drug abuse is a very common problem in most countries so it seemed like a good topic for a list .
This is a list of ten of the most abused drugs and the effects they have on people .

10 Heroin
Heroin is an opiate processed directly from the extracts of the opium poppy .
It was originally created to help cure people of addiction to morphine .
Upon crossing the blood - brain barrier , which occurs soon after introduction of the drug into the bloodstream , heroin is converted into morphine , which mimics the action of endorphins , creating a sense of well - being ; the characteristic euphoria has been described as an “ orgasm ” centered in the gut .
One of the most common methods of heroin use is via intravenous injection .
For the last 4 months , my partner and I have been recreationally using heroin .
H became our weekend ritual .
Lighting candles , playing music , brie and wine and grapes , reading tarot and finally fucking … for hours on end , the most intense beautiful technicolor sex .
Each time we did it we got closer to each other .
And each time we did it , we wanted to do it again , and again .
We tried saying we ’d only do it once every two weeks , but that lasted 6 days .
We have rules about how much we do in one night , how late we stay up and so on .
So far the rules have kept us safe from addiction .
Unless you consider the nagging i- do n’t - wanna - go - a - weekend - or - have - sex - without - it feelings .
We ’ve never run out , although , once we were down to our last little bit and I left the vial open on the night stand .
I was reaching for the lube when I heard the most sickening sound , the vial falling over .
Turns out , I was mistaken , I had remembered to put the cap back on .
But in those few seconds of uncertainty , my girl and I shot each other a look we had never seen before ..
Fear .
Sometimes fiction reveals the truth better than reality ever could .

9 Cocaine
Advertisement
Cocaine is a crystalline tropane alkaloid that is obtained from the leaves of the coca plant .
It is both a stimulant of the central nervous system and an appetite suppressant , giving rise to what has been described as a euphoric sense of happiness and increased energy .
It is most often used recreationally for this effect .
Cocaine is a potent central nervous system stimulant .
Its effects can last from 20 minutes to several hours , depending upon the dosage of cocaine taken , purity , and method of administration .
The initial signs of stimulation are hyperactivity , restlessness , increased blood pressure , increased heart rate and euphoria .
The euphoria is sometimes followed by feelings of discomfort and depression and a craving to experience the drug again .
Sexual interest and pleasure can be amplified .
Side effects can include twitching , paranoia , and impotence , which usually increases with frequent usage .
The cocaine arrived and we agreed to use it at a time that translated to three and a half hours after I arrived .
It cost $ 60 for what I was told was an eighth of a gram .
This seemed rather expensive , but I was assured that it was ‘ high quality product . ’
I took the line up my left nostril .
After about ninety seconds , I felt my heartbeat increase .
It was definitely kicking in .
I began to worry a bit , as I could feel my heart pounding and my pulse increasing .
I finally felt as if it had reached a plateau .
My heartbeat became level , albeit still very high .
Many people say that one feels euphoria – being invincible and / or the desire to clean the house .
I did not feel either of these ( and I did remember to think about these things ) .
For me , the positive effects of cocaine came directly from knowing that I had reached a plateau and I was going to be fine .
I felt invigorated , yet also very comfortable .
One of the best treatment for drug addiction is to consult with cocaine rehab centers for recovery .
8 Methamphetamine
Methamphetamime , popularly shortened to meth or ice , is a psychostimulant and sympathomimetic drug .
Methamphetamine enters the brain and triggers a cascading release of norepinephrine , dopamine and serotonin .
Since it stimulates the mesolimbic reward pathway , causing euphoria and excitement , it is prone to abuse and addiction .
Users may become obsessed or perform repetitive tasks such as cleaning , hand - washing , or assembling and disassembling objects .
Withdrawal is characterized by excessive sleeping , eating and depression - like symptoms , often accompanied by anxiety and drug- craving .
We first smoked meth on New Year ’s Eve because we heard it was great for sex .
I had to work the next day and so saved some to smoke before work in the morning .
When I got home another g was waiting for me and I smoked every day but one until I finally quit three months later .
For three weeks we smoked meth with little consequence , then my skin became fragile and in addition to breaking out , started to swell .
I was really worried because I was constantly thirsty and drinking water , but I rarely urinated .
Then my kidneys started hurting .
I had lost twenty pounds in two months and my husband had lost thirty , and we ’d read somewhere that rapid weight loss can cause kidney failure .
I slept every three or four days for an hour or so and woke feeling rested .
I was an hour late for work everyday .
My husband wrecked the truck three times .
One day I forgot to feed my son .
Everything was either the highest of highs or the lowest of lows , no in between existed anymore .
We were banned from the sauna at our apartment complex because no one else could use it .
Our sweat smelled so strongly of ammonia it burned the eyes , it was caustic , and it burned our skin too .
My husband and I have n’t done any drugs at all for four weeks , and things are slowly going back to normal .
But I still want it .
I ca n’t sleep tonight because I want it .
I wrote this in all honesty mostly to help myself , to remind myself why I do n’t want it .
And still I want it .
7 Crack Cocaine
Crack cocaine , often nicknamed “ crack ” , is believed to have been created and made popular during the early 1980s .
Because of the dangers for manufacturers of using ether to produce pure freebase cocaine , producers began to omit the step of removing the freebase precipitate from the ammonia mixture .
Typically , filtration processes are also omitted .
Baking soda is now most often used as a base rather than ammonia for reasons of lowered odor and toxicity ; however , any weak base can be used to make crack cocaine .
When commonly “ cooked ” the ratio is 1:1 to 2:3 parts cocaine / bicarbonate .
As I held the smoke in for a ten count and exhaled , I thought I felt nothing except a little excitement that was neither bad nor pleasurable .
The complete rush some writers have called a ‘ whole - body orgasm ‘ hit me shortly after and I distinctly remember demanding ‘ more ’ as soon as the realization of heaven - on - earth came .
Some people say that the effects of smoking crack lasts 10 - 15 minutes .
For me , it was just a shortest instant of gratification .
Everything afterwards was just a great increase in energy and confidence geared towards obtaining more of the drug .
6 LSD
Lysergic acid diethylamide , LSD , LSD - 25 , or acid , is a semisynthetic psychedelic drug of the tryptamine family .
Arguably the most regarded of all psychedelics , it is considered mainly as a recreational drug , an entheogen , and a tool in use to supplement various types of exercises for transcendence including in meditation , psychonautics , and illegal psychedelic psychotherapy whether self administered or not .
LSD ’s psychological effects ( colloquially called a “ trip ” ) vary greatly from person to person , depending on factors such as previous experiences , state of mind and environment , as well as dose strength .
They also vary from one trip to another , and even as time passes during a single trip .
An LSD trip can have long term psychoemotional effects ; some users cite the LSD experience as causing significant changes in their personality and life perspective .
Widely different effects emerge based on what Leary called set and setting ; the “ set ” being the general mindset of the user , and the “ setting ” being the physical and social environment in which the drug ’s effects are experienced .
About ten years ago I bought my third trip from a guy in my home town Norwich ( UK )
It was a ‘ Strawberry ’ and I was told it had been double dipped .
The guy had a reputation for selling good acid so I happily gave him my cash .
I took the single LSD tab in the late morning in a positive state of mind with no worries or anxieties .
I began to come up on the acid towards the lunch time .
It was to be the first and last time I ’d ever trip alone .
Outside it was a glorious sunny day but I was happy enough in my temporary sanctuary to even think about going outside .
The LSD rush started blazing up my spine and racing through my guts , I felt a little uneasy with it but had enough mind to allow myself to just go with it and wait until the rush plateaued .
I was having a wonderful time , watching floral Escher type patterns breathing over my skin .
I vaguely recall deciding to go downstairs again for some reason then the next thing I recall was awakening on the floor of the dining room alone .
The first thing I noticed was that there were blowflies buzzing around a bowl of catfood on the kitchen floor .
I remember feeling perplexed as to why both flies had two bright neon after images in red and blue .
Somehow I navigated myself through Norwich during the busy lunchtime shoppers and begun to head in the direction of the city ’s central park ‘ Chapelfield gardens ’ .
If you could imagine for a moment being surrounded by people in a busy place where their heads had been removed and replaced by Squids and Octopus you might begin to accurately picture the scene confronting me in the park .
Everyone had tentacles smothering their faces and dangling down their necks like fleshy snake beards , even the women and children were not exempt from this disfiguration .
In retrospect , it was the worst day of my entire life , It was the closest I can imagine to having full blown psychosis .
5 Ecstasy
Ecstasy ( MDMA ) is a semisynthetic psychedelic entactogen of the phenethylamine family that is much less visual with more stimulant like effects than most all other common “ trip ” producing psychedelics .
It is considered mainly a recreational drug that ’s often used with sex and associated with club drugs , as an entheogen , and a tool in use to supplement various types of practices for transcendence including in meditation , psychonautics , and illicit psychedelic psychotherapy whether self administered or not .
The primary effects of MDMA include an increased awareness of the senses , feelings of openness , euphoria , empathy , love , happiness , heightened self - awareness , feeling of mental clarity and an increased appreciation of music and movement .
Tactile sensations are enhanced for some users , making physical contact with others more pleasurable .
Other side effects , such as jaw clenching and elevated pulse , are common .
Sitting comfortably in our cosy living room , Café del Mar and similar CDs playing in the background , we began at 8 pm .
I swallowed one white tablet with water .
Over the next hour nothing much happened except that I found myself talking quite openly and confidently with the others , moving very easily into interesting conversations .
This was a little unusual for me as I am normally quite shy and overly self - conscious in social situations and it takes me a while to loosen up .
The next thing I experienced was a striking shift in my visual perception .
I do n’t mean a hallucination or a distortion , but a wonderful step up in the aesthetic quality .
For a moment it was like being in one of those nostalgic TV ads where the world looks all gold and sepia .
‘ Everything ’s gone amber ! ’
I blurted .
But then I found that my vision was becoming beautifully enhanced .
It made my normal visual experience seem like cheap , fuzzy CCTV footage in comparison .
Now I was seeing the world anew in sharp , lush , top-quality Technicolor !
I also began to move in time to the music .
The music !
Oh , the music !
Wow !
It sounded so good , so organic !
The uplifted state stayed with me and took a long time to fade — at least a couple of weeks .
It had unleashed in me a rush of joy that was still accessible when I focused on it weeks later .
4 Opium
Opium is a resinous narcotic formed from the latex released by lacerating ( or “ scoring ” ) the immature seed pods of opium poppies ( Papaver somniferum ) .
It contains up to 16 % morphine , an opiate alkaloid , which is most frequently processed chemically to produce heroin for the illegal drug trade .
Opium has gradually been superseded by a variety of purified , semi-synthetic , and synthetic opioids with progressively stronger effect , and by other general anesthesia .
This process began in 1817 , when Friedrich Wilhelm Adam Sertürner reported the isolation of pure morphine from opium after at least thirteen years of research and a nearly disastrous trial on himself and three boys .
I remember that what I smoked was much easier to smoke than marijuana .
There was no burning in my throat nor in my lungs .
I took a very large , smooth hit .
Smoking it like marijuana , I held it in for about 10 or 15 seconds and let it out .
It did n’t taste like marijuana , I remember the taste being rather faint .
It actually tasted and smelled like incense .
I was very surprised to suddenly find myself on the floor , in the dark , with a crowd of people surrounding me .
Apparently I had fainted and fallen to the ground , but I had n’t noticed .
The high itself is rather hard to describe .
It was much more intense than marijuana .
It felt heavy , like my whole body was being impacted … but it also felt very clear and refined at the same time .
As I made my way towards the bathroom the drug began to kick in again .
My steps kind of faded away and it felt like I was just floating over to the bathroom .
The scary thing was though , that I was having trouble seeing .
My vision was fading .
Distinct figures melted into shadows and everything had a sparkle to it .
All of a sudden , everything felt really good .
I could n’t stop smiling .
Everything was profound in a very positive way , especially the music since it resonated everywhere .
It was a very abstruse experience .
I imagine that I was coming down at this point , an hour had surely past by because the band was building a climax to end their first set .
I went along with the crowd and made my way outside .
The fresh air was wonderful .
The cool air seemed to wrap around my body .
A slight breeze on the back of my neck sent chills that rapidly multiplied throughout my body .
3 Marijuana
Cannabis , known as marijuana in its herbal form , is a psychoactive product of the plant Cannabis sativa .
Humans have been consuming cannabis since prehistory , although in the 20th century there was a rise in its use for recreational , religious or spiritual , and medicinal purposes .
It is estimated that about four percent of the world ’s adult population use cannabis annually .
It has psychoactive and physiological effects when consumed , usually by smoking or ingestion .
The minimum amount of THC required to have a perceptible psychoactive effect is about 10 micrograms per kilogram of body weight .
The state of intoxication due to cannabis consumption is colloquially known as a “ high ” ; it is the state where mental and physical facilities are noticeably altered due to the consumption of cannabis .
Each user experiences a different high , and the nature of it may vary upon factors such as potency , dose , chemical composition , method of consumption and set and setting .
After taking that first hit , and not feeling the effects within a minute ( holding it in for a minute , and then waiting a little bit after exhaling ) I decided , well I better hit this again , harder if I can .
I took just as large of a hit , and again held it in for longer than a minute .
I let my brother know I was really starting to feel something now and I do n’t think I liked it all .
It snuck up on me really bad , and I still had no idea what to expect .
I wanted him to be quiet .
Laying down was not helping , so I got back up .
I went back to the garage and tried to explain to everyone ‘ I am totally fucked up .
This is scary !’
I was rationalizing everything tremendously , but it was SO intense !
And it was only getting more intense faster !
I did n’t know what to expect , I was sinking within myself , accelerating downward like into the depths of my own oblivion .
I was a novice , I had no idea what to expect , and the world had become out of synch , the talking of my brothers , his friend , all ridiculous and extremely annoying .
I became amazingly irritable and wanted them to leave me alone or not talk in my presence .
They did not understand or appreciate my fear , and they began to get loud again .
I ran upstairs to my parents bed and laid down with some wistful hope that I could wait out this storm .
2 Psilocybin Mushrooms
Psilocybin mushrooms ( also called psilocybian mushrooms ) are fungi that contain the psychedelic substances psilocybin and psilocin , and occasionally other psychoactive tryptamines .
There are multiple colloquial terms for psilocybin mushrooms , the most common being magic mushrooms or ‘ shrooms .
When psilocybin is ingested , it is broken down to produce psilocin , which is responsible for the hallucinogenic effects .
The intoxicating effects of psilocybin - containing mushrooms typically last anywhere from 3 to 7 hours depending on dosage , preparation method and personal metabolism .
The experience is typically inwardly oriented , with strong visual and auditory components .
Visions and revelations may be experienced , and the effect can range from exhilarating to distressing .
There can be also a total absence of effects , even with large doses .
I had acquired about 8 grams of dried mushrooms and some liquid psilocybin equivalent to another 5 grams of powdered mushrooms .
I swallowed the liquid first , on an empty stomach of course .
I could feel a slight sensation after about 10 - 15 minutes .
Then I added the powder to some water in a mug and swallowed that also .
I then sat by the camp fire , listening to the wind in the trees while I contemplated what was about to happen .
After about 45 - 50 minutes I heard a ‘ voice ’ calling to me .
It was n’t audible in the normal sense – it came from inside my own mind !
Then I was gone – out of this world .
I escaped into what I perceived to be the outer boundaries of my mind or my imagination .
This placed presented itself as a natural forest with low light .
Here I met the owner of the aforementioned voice – the Mushroom Goddess .
She took the form of a white , strapless , ankle - length dress , standing side - on from me .
For about the next two hours I dialoged with her , becoming totally bewitched by her charm , her wit , her intelligence , her knowledge , her unconditional affection for me and her seemingly infinite perspective .
I have come to think of her as my other - worldly girlfriend .
1 PCP
PCP ( Phencyclidine ) is a dissociative drug formerly used as an anesthetic agent , exhibiting hallucinogenic and neurotoxic effects .
It is commonly known as Angel Dust , but is also known as Wet , Sherm , Sherman Hemsley , Rocket Fuel , Ashy Larry , Shermans Tank , Wack , Halk Hogan , Ozone , HannaH , Hog , Manitoba Shlimbo , and Embalming Fluid , among other names .
Although the primary psychoactive effects of the drug only last hours , total elimination from the body is prolonged , typically extending over weeks .
PCP is consumed in a recreational manner by drug users , mainly in the United States , where the demand is met by illegal production .
It comes in both powder and liquid forms ( PCP base dissolved most often in ether ) , but typically it is sprayed onto leafy material such as marijuana , mint , oregano , parsley or Ginger Leaves , and smoked .
PCP has potent effects on the nervous system altering perceptual functions ( hallucinations , delusional ideas , delirium or confused thinking ) , motor functions ( unsteady gait , loss of coordination , and disrupted eye movement or nystagmus ) , and autonomic nervous system regulation ( rapid heart rate , altered temperature regulation ) .
The drug has been known to alter mood states in an unpredictable fashion causing some individuals to become detached and others to become animated .
When I was taking the drug , I used very small amounts .
The effect was incredibly pleasant and social , so much so that me and my friends all used it instead of booze for almost a year .
I could n’t dance for shit on the stuff ( I ’d get stumbly and actually fell on my ass on the dancefloor once ) but the physical sensations and mental pictures were really fun .
It is quite different from any psychedelic visuals or even Ketamine visuals …more like rolling through old film footage .
To be honest , I liked it more than my experiences on Ketamine .
PCP can make one nearly impervious to pain at high doses .
Because of this , PCP can make things seem like a good idea that otherwise would n’t ( leading to the stories of people leaping out of windows , etc . )
I experienced very confusing physical reality when really high on it , like being unable to discern the difference between walking up stairs and down them , or standing still and walking .
This could lead to very unusual behaviour .

US Politics Thanks for Dick Cheney By Joel S. Hirschhorn
Published June 28 , 2007
When someone in high elected office shows the nation how vulnerable our Constitution is , we should be thankful for the wakeup call .
Like many ruthless dictators , evil kings , and monster generals , Dick Cheney is the leading practitioner of the ends - justify - the - means mentality , where only his vision of the desired ends counts .
If this means disregarding and disobeying the Constitution , torturing prisoners , killing thousands of American soldiers , disrespecting Congress , destroying our environment , embracing the invasion of illegal immigrants , increasing out national debt , and disregarding the will of the vast majority of Americans , so be it .
Serving corporate interests rather than serving the people is Cheney 's brand of patriotism .
Cheney 's self - righteous ego is bigger than George W. Bush's , and what makes Cheney more striking is that he is enormously smarter and more competent than Bush , his token boss .
He is so dangerous and frightening that no impeachment of Bush effort ever stood a chance - not as long as " President Cheney " enters your consciousness .
Cheney has become Bush 's shield .
When reality hits the fan we can use the lessons - learned approach to stay sane .
With his finger - in - the - eye disdain for what anybody else ( or history ) thinks of him , Cheney offers a far better lesson - learned benefit than the stumbles and fumbles of Bush the Smirker .
Bush is a joke .
Cheney is a monster .
Take Cheney 's current view that he is a part of the legislative branch , not the executive , so he does not have to comply with an Executive Order on reporting use of secret materials .
It is wildly inconsistent with his prior claims of executive privilege , but Cheney has no use for logical consistency .
What Cheney wants is all that matters .
Proposed Amendments
When we witness the brazen acts of Cheney and Bush we should envision these types of Constitutional amendments :
An amendment could explicitly state that the Vice President is a member of the Executive Branch , and the Office of the Vice President must comply with Executive Orders .
Perhaps we should also consider a statement of the criteria that the President can invoke for firing the Vice President with the consent of Congress .
Why not also consider a different method of breaking ties in the Senate ?
If someone from the Executive Branch can do it , why not someone from the Judicial Branch ?
Why not the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court ?
Better yet , why not make the constitutional solution what the House already uses : a tie vote means that the question fails .
We could eliminate the position of President of the Senate .
As another example , consider the frequent assertion of executive privilege by Cheney and Bush to withhold information that Congress believes it needs .
The Constitution does not provide for executive privilege .
Considering how strong the presidency has become and the predilection to invoke executive privilege , we need an amendment that explicitly says there is no such thing as automatic executive privilege .
Any assertion of it should be presented to the Supreme Court and only it should rule that it is appropriate in a particular case to protect the national interest .
As the final example , consider the clear need for an amendment that prohibits the President from using any kind of signing statement to announce and justify not obeying part of a newly signed law .
We can give thanks for Dick Cheney just like we give thanks eventually that a catastrophe or disaster makes us stronger in the future .
He has exposed constitutional weaknesses .
The principles that define the best of our nation must be protected through amendments that learn from history .
In particular , the ingenuity and boldness of some people has allowed them to disobey and dishonor those principles .
Dick Cheney sought and achieved power sufficient to make a mockery of our nation 's finest principles and he was enabled by George W. Bush , who apparently sought more guidance from his God than from our Constitution .
Article V Convention
One thing is clear .
History provides little confidence that Congress will propose constitutional amendments that deserve full public discussion .
Now is the time to use what our Constitution offers us : an Article V convention for proposing amendments .
If we are to make our federal government work for the good of we the people , then we require the nation 's first Article V convention – the goal of Friends of the Article V Convention .
Why is it now so appropriate ?
Because Americans now have so little confidence in Congress , the President , and the Vice President , and because the corruption of politicians by money has reached unprecedented heights .
As much as politicians deserve our mistrust , we the people deserve to have an Article V convention .
Politicians fear it because they know the public will support amendments that make the government subservient to us – the sovereign American citizens .
Politicians are not supposed to rule us .
They are so supposed to justly represent us .
But they do not .
They represent the moneyed interests that control them .
As Thomas Jefferson said , " An elected tyranny is not what we fought for . "
Our Constitution should not allow the government to make us victims and our nation hated by so much of the world .
That 's what Cheney should teach us .
Now , it 's up to us .
Pray that a petulant Bush does not learn from Cheney , exploit the Constitution by resigning , and create President Cheney .

Scientists ask :
Where have all the dolphins gone ?
PARIS , Aug 22 ( AFP ) Aug 22 , 2007
Sightings by marine scientists of dolphins in the north Atlantic 's Bay of Biscay have dropped off by 80 percent compared to the same period in 2006 , a wildlife conservation group said Wednesday .
The alarming drop in numbers of the Bay 's three most common species of dolphin -- the striped , bottlenose and common -- can be attributed to one or both of two causes , Clive Martin , senior wildlife officer for the Biscay Dolphin Research Programme , told AFP .
" We know for a fact that by - catch is killing thousands of dolphins every year , " he said , referring to commercial fishing operations in the bay , which is formed by the northern coast of Spain and the eastern French seaboard up to the tip of Brittany .
Martin singled out French " pair trawlers " that sweep the ocean with huge nets twice the size of a football pitch strung out between them as being especially lethal to the marine mammals .
" Dolphins are sometimes trapped hundreds at a time , and are asphyxiated " when they cannot come up for air , he said .
Most dolphins typically replenish their lungs with fresh air every five minutes or so , he explained .
The second -- and probably more important -- reason that dolphins have disappeared is that there is simply very little left for them to eat .
" Anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay has progressively failed , and this year there is a complete ban by Spain , France and the United Kingdom on the fishing of anchovies , " a principal food source for dolphins , Clive said .
He speculated that the roving sea mammals -- which swim in pods numbering in the dozens for bottlenose dolphins , and sometimes in the thousands for the common dolphin -- had moved west toward the mid-Atlantic looking for food .
A sharp decrease in the presence of many seabirds that also feed on fish -- such as auks , shearwaters and gannets -- lends support to this explanation .
The Bay of Biscay Research Programme has been systematically recording dolphin sightings along the same route from Bilbao , Spain to Portsmouth , England for 13 years .
Compared to the comparable period in 2004 and 2005 , dolphin sightings in 2007 have decreased by 50 percent , he said .
The Bay of Biscay hosts a greater variety of dolphin populations than any other part of the world 's oceans .
Clive suggested that policy makers should consider transforming the area into a sanctuary for marine life .

The stage version of JRR Tolkien 's The Lord Of The Rings finally opened in London with a standing ovation for its cast of singing orcs and dancing hobbits but mixed reviews from the critics .
The £ 25 m production is the most expensive in West End history .
Scroll down for more
The show debuted in Toronto last year and received a critical mauling .
After a major re-write , a shortened running time and six weeks of previews to fine - tune the performances , it opened officially at the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane .
The production boasts pyrotechnics , acrobatics and myriad special effects to recreate Middle Earth .
It features a £ 1 m revolving stage which conceals a series of hydraulic lifts .

Such features impressed some critics , such as Sam Marlowe of the Times , who described it as a " wonder " , and Michael Billington , of the Guardian , who said he " could n't see how it could be better done " .
But others were ferocious in their criticism .
Charles Spencer in the Daily Telegraph said despite the producer and director 's efforts to overhaul the Toronto effort , the show was a " thumping great flop " , hated more by his 14 - year - old son - a fan of the Peter Jackson Lord of the Rings films - than by him .
Paul Taylor , of the Independent , criticised the interplay of the score with the drama and said the story - telling was " rushed " , while Quentin Letts of the Daily Mail slated the production as " corny " .
But a host of celebrities , including Andrew Lloyd Webber , Dame Judi Dench , Kevin Spacey , Richard E Grant and Brian May , were kinder .
Dame Judi said : " For anyone who is a Tolkien fan , it is just a terrific treat .
" I have never seen the films but I am a great fan of Tolkien 's writing .
" It has wonderful choreography and the cast worked so hard . "
The show stars Laura Michelle Kelly , best known to West End audiences as Mary Poppins , as the Elvish queen Galadriel .
Newcomer James
Loye plays the hero , Frodo Baggins .
The production played for six months in Canada and left critics there unimpressed .
The Toronto Star renamed it " Bored Of The Rings " while Variety called it : " A saga of short people burdened by power jewellery . "
For its West End incarnation , the running time has been cut by 40 minutes but it 's still a lengthy three hours .
The London production has not been without its mishaps .
Actor Adam Salter , who plays a ranger , was taken to hospital after his leg became trapped in the set machinery during a preview performance .
Audiences at first believed his screams for help were part of the show .
What the critics said :
Although some critics were kind to the new all - singing all - dancing version of Tolkein 's classic , for the most part they were scathing .
Just as they panned the version put on for Lord of the Rings fans in Toronto , British critics remained uninspired by the spectacle .
" British adults will find it hard to suppress open laughter at this show 's Portentous Moments .
Corny is hardly the word .
There 's more corn here than in Kansas . "
Quentin Letts , Daily Mail
" Overblown , over - orchestrated and now over here . "
Bill Hagerty , The Sun
" Despite the drastic cuts to material the story - telling is rushed .
Some of the ordeals seem to be over almost before they 've begun , so it 's hard for the adventurers to register weight .
The evening 's stand - out performer is Michael Thierrault ... as the slimy perverted Gollum ... This show is unlikely to blow you away . "
Paul Taylor , The Independent
" As the show boomed along , there were moments when I thought this was a union of a Sixties hippy craft fair and scenes from Doctor Who . "
Paul Callan , Daily Express
" I 'm sorry to report that it remains a thumping great flop .
I took my 14 - year - old son .
Unfortunately , he hated it even more than I did ... Its run , I fear , will be nasty , brutish and short . "
Charles Spencer , Daily Telegraph
" I had a perfectly good time at Drury Lane and , if Tolkien 's trilogy is to be a stage spectacle , I do n't see how it could be better done . "
Michael Billington , The Guardian ( four stars )
" Snobbery and cynicism be damned .
This show is a wonder .
Go with an open mind , an open heart , and wide - open eyes , and prepare for enchantment . "
Sam Marlowe , Times ( four stars )
In an interview on Democracy Now !
Arun Gupta , a reporter and editor of The Indypendent , a bimonthly newspaper based in New York , points out that David Petraeus has ‘ credibility ’ and our ‘ trust ’ mostly because his past actions in Iraq have gone largely unreported .
According to Gupta , one of the key things that Petraeus did was to support the creation of paramilitary forces in Iraq .
One of the most ' aggressive ' of these was the " Special Police Commandos " , commanded by General Adnan Thabit with a force of about 5,000 troops .
( Unraveling Iraq 's Secret Militias )
At the highest levels , White House officials consider the Police Commandos as the leading force against the insurgency .
In hearings before the Senate Appropriations Committee on February 16 Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said the commandos are among " forces that are going to have the greatest leverage on suppressing and eliminating the insurgency . "
Petraeus calls the Police Commandos " a horse to back " and has done so by providing it with " money to fix up its base and buy vehicles , ammunition , radios and more weapons . "
In a satellite briefing to the press on February 4 , Petraeus repeatedly praised the Special Police Commandos , calling the leadership " tremendously aggressive " in operations .
Unfortunately , the Special Police Commandos morphed into death squads that were used against the insurgency and against Iraqis , in general .
Now Petraeus did not authorize or approve the actions of the death squads .
But the key point is that he failed to put in place a system to ensure that there would not be those kinds of abuses .
Of course , none of this is new .
Larry Johnson made note of it on his blog here .
Front Line has a piece on the descending violence of the militias entitled the Gangs of Iraq .
Investigative reporter Max Fuller in his detailed examination of documents , stresses that the vast majority of atrocities attributed to ‘ rogue ’ Shiite or Sunni militias , " were in fact the work of government - controlled commandos of ‘ special forces ’ , trained by the Americans , ‘ advised ’ by Americans and run largely by former CIA agents . "
( Chris Floyd , ‘ Ulster on the Euphrates : The Anglo - American Dirty War ’ )
Petraeus attempt to play ‘ Good Cop / Bad Cop ’ in order to ‘ divide and rule ’ has n’t gone too well , nor is it likely to succeed now .
As Gutpa noted with understatement : " This played a key role in terms of stoking and fomenting the civil war , because you had death squads wearing government uniforms , being armed and trained by the U.S. going around killing Sunnis randomly .
It generally alienated the Sunni Arab population from the government and drove them into the arms of the resistance . "
Now Petraeus is apparently funding and training the Sunnis to take on the Shiite .
" ... there are reports that have stated clearly with these militias saying , like , " Yes , we 're getting weapons from the U.S. government . "
And part of it is , is that they do want to fight al - Qaeda in Iraq , which is another Sunni - based group .
It 's an Iraqi - based group .
But their main purpose is they want this money and weapons and aid to fight the Shiite militias . "
" So here we have them , like in 2004 , setting up these Shiite militias , and now he 's setting up these Sunni militias to fight these Shiite militias .
And what it portends is just an absolute disaster for Iraq .
And , of course , it will also be used as justification : " Well , we can't leave because a bloodbath will result . "
But we 're not looking at the fact that it's the U.S. that 's creating this bloodbath . "
Besides whacking folks , the Iraqi security forces under General Petraeus also had trouble hanging on to their weapons .
Back in October 2006 there was this account :
The inspector general ’s office released its report Sunday in a series of three audits finding that :
Nearly one of every 25 weapons the military bought for Iraqi security forces is missing .
Many others cannot be repaired because parts or technical manuals are lacking .
The Pentagon cannot account for 14,030 weapons — almost 4 % of the semiautomatic pistols , assault rifles , machine guns , rocket - propelled grenade launchers and other weapons it began supplying to Iraq since the end of 2003 .
The missing weapons will not be tracked easily :
The Defense Department registered the serial numbers of only about 10,000 of the 370,251 weapons it provided — less than 3 %
That was followed by this report :
Weapons Given to Iraq Are Missing
The Pentagon has lost track of about 190,000 AK - 47 assault rifles and pistols given to Iraqi security forces in 2004 and 2005 , according to a new government report , raising fears that some of those weapons have fallen into the hands of insurgents fighting U.S. forces in Iraq .
This was all on General Petraeus 's watch .
Here ’s more from the interview :
AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about General Petraeus and the missing arms , the missing weapons ?
ARUN GUPTA : Also during his tenure , 190,000 weapons went missing .
These were Pentagon weapons that were supposed to go to Iraqi Security Forces ... There were no records of it kept .
Such simple things as recording the serial numbers were not done .
And , of course , the fear is that this is just going to turn up all sorts of places .
The Turkish government has already claimed that it has seized more than 1,000 of these guns in Turkey that are being used by anyone , from criminal enterprises to anti-government militants .
And there 's also reports that they 've turned up as far away as Italy .
So -- and this was part of the Petraeus strategy , that he was just throwing all this money and weapons and aid at the Special Police Commandos , because they were so desperate to create a strategy to defeat the Sunni insurgency .
And , of course , by the time he left his mission in 2005 of training Iraqis , there was only one battalion that was considered ready .
In one year , that 's what his work amounted to .
And now a report just came out , a commission set up by Congress of four retired US generals , in which they stated that the National Police , which is what the Special Police Commandos are now known as , the National Police are so corrupt , so riven with sectarianism , they 're so hated by the public , the Iraqi military and other police services , that they should just be completely disbanded .
And yet , none of this is being talked about in Congress or the media .
Instead , they 'll focus on John McCaine 's rather dictatorial threat to throw organizations like Moveon.org out of this country because they have the temerity to note that Petraeus is a liar and has betrayed his oath of office .
And , being merely a liar is the benign view of Petraeus .
Around the same time as the creation of the " Special Police Commandos " was the creation of Iraq 's so called Wolf Brigadefor all practical purposes a Shiite counterpart to the Special Police Commandos .
According to Gareth Porter
Last May , the Association of Muslim Scholars publicly accused the Wolf Brigade of having " arrested imams and the guardians of some mosques , tortured and killed them , and then got rid of their bodies in a garbage dump in Shaab district " of Baghdad .
Journalists began reporting details of forced confessions through torture and indiscriminate killing of Sunni detainees by the Wolf Brigade last summer .
In one case reported by the Associated Press last July , a woman detained by the Wolf Brigade in Mosul was whipped by six men with electric cables and forced to sign a false confession that she was a high - ranking local leader of the insurgency .
After the Brigade left the city and turned her over to local authorities , they released her with an apology for the torture she endured .
The Financial Times reported in late June that 474 people had been seized from their homes during one Wolf Brigade sweep in the Abu Ghraib area and had suffered systematic abuse at the hands of the Brigade .
A former detainee said commandoes had " attached electrical wires to his ear and his genitals , and generated a current with a hand - cranked military telephone " .
Despite this mounting evidence of systematic torture , the U.S. command had shown no evidence of discomfort about supporting the Brigade .
Some Wolf Brigade sweeps through Sunni neighbourhoods have been carried out alongside U.S. troops .
On Nov. 10 , a U.S. officer described on his personal weblog a " battalion sized joint operation " between the " Nightstalkers " ( Army Airborne 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment ) and the Wolf Brigade in southern Baghdad .
The blogger concluded , " As we passed vehicle after vehicle full of blindfolded detainees my face stretched into a long wolfish smile ... "
The Wolf Brigade obviously had full US support , not only in tactical matters , but also with manipulation of the Iraqi media space .
The Wolf Brigade became famous for the awful TV program called " Terrorists in the Grip of Justice " that appeared on the American - created - staffed - funded - and - controlled Al ` Iraqiyya TV network ( should have been called Al Amrikiyya ) .
The program showed supposed " terrorists " , who had clearly been abused , sometimes badly beaten , and probably also tortured , confessing to a variety of offenses , some of which were completely ludicrous , such as having homosexual orgies in mosques .
The ostensible purpose of the TV show was to influence the Iraqi public against the resistance by presenting the " terrorists " as the lowest of all possible low - lifes - a pretty transparent , and transparently stupid American P.R. stunt .
Once you penetrate the lies and ' warped ' reality smokescreen consciously set up by folks like Petraeus and the cabal at the Pentagon , terms like ' betrayal ' seem entirely too civil to describe the monster they have had a hand in creating -- and continue to support .
... the radical materialist Charvaka ( or Carvaka ) school 's theory of the evolution of the universe through a purposeless , random development of matter , with all mental processes viewed as derivative of complex configurations of material phenomena .
In this school the four elements , earth , fire , water and air are the original principles .
From these alone , when transformed into the body , intelligence is produced — just as the intoxicating power of some herbs is developed from the mixing of certain ingredients .
When the body is destroyed , intelligence at once perishes also .
They quote the Vedic text for this :
Springing forth from these elements itself
solid knowledge is destroyed
when they are destroyed —
after death no intelligence remains .
Therefore the soul is only the body distinguished by the attribute of intelligence , since there is no evidence for any self distinct from the body .
Therefore the existence of such a separate self cannot be proved , because this school holds that perception is the only source of knowledge and does not allow inference as an alternative source .
This last position is not dissimilar to scientific materialism 's belief that mind is reducible to neurological and biochemical reality and these in turn to facts of physics .
Buddhism , by contrast , explains the evolution of the cosmos in terms of the principle of dependent origination , in that the origin and existence of everything has to be understood in terms of the complex network of interconnected causes and conditions .
This applies to consciousness as well as matter .
( pp. 76-77 )
You think materialism is relatively new ?
I did too , years ago .
Then I discovered that , in both East and West , there are very old ( thousands of years old ) materialist schools of philosophy that sound just like the latest sage in Time Magazine .
While writing about why the Dalai Lama accepts modern science but rejects materialism , I had occasion to read about a genuinely materialist school of philosophy in ancient India ( over 2500 years ago ) .
The Charvaka school that flourished around 600 B.C. , and it had nothing to do with claims about discoveries in science .
In The Universe in a Single Atom , the Lama references Random ?
Everything old is new again !
Here is an extract from a later work setting forth the Charvaka philosophy :
The Charvakans were bolder than most modern materialist philosophers because they seemed to think that consciousness ( " solid knowledge " in the text above ) can actually be produced directly by matter .
The modern materialist is content to argue that mind ( self ) is an illusion generated by the activities of neurons of the brain , but not that it can be produced by mixing elements of matter .
So we have learned something or other in the last 2500 years after all .
The Lama is an atheist , but a non-materialist atheist , so he does n't think that this sort of materialism is compatible with Buddhism .
He writes , The point here is that he thinks that consciousness is real and that it is capable of causing events ; it is not an illusion .
Here is an old text on Charvaka .
Interestingly , the West also featured some interesting old materialists in Epicurus ( 341-270 BCE ) and Lucretius ( 99 - 55 BCE ) .
Outside the hothouse of the academy , it never caught on then and my guess is , it wo n't now .

Alcatel and Microsoft are involved in a number of legal battles
Alcatel had sued Microsoft , saying two patents related to the standards used for converting audio into MP3 files had been breached .
Microsoft said it may appeal against the federal jury 's decision , saying it was " unsupported by the law or facts " .
Alcatel said it was pleased with the San Diego court 's decision .
" We made strong arguments supporting our view " said an Alcatel - Lucent spokeswoman .
Concerned
Microsoft said it had already licensed the MP3 technology , paying $ 16 m to a German firm Fraunhofer .
" We are concerned that this decision opens the door for Alcatel - Lucent to pursue action against hundreds of other companies who purchased the rights to use MP3 technology from Fraunhofer , the industry - recognized rightful licensor , " said Microsoft lawyer Tom Burt .
There are a number of long - running patent disputes between Microsoft and US - based Lucent Technologies which Alcatel is taking over - with a further five set to go to court .
New research from the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany shows that unlike humans , chimpanzees conform to traditional economic models .
The research used a modification of one of the most widely used and accepted economic tools , the ultimatum game .
In the ultimatum game - which was developed by another German , Werner Güth , now at the Max Planck Institute for Economics in Jena - one person , the proposer , is given money by an experimenter .
That proposer can then divide the " manna from heaven " with a second person , the responder .
The responder is not powerless - if he accepts the division , both people take home the offered amounts .
But if he rejects it , both get nothing .
The fear of having an unfair offer rejected causes the proposer to make a fair offer .
People typically make offers of close to 50 % .
Anything less is likely to be rejected .
Sensitivity to unfair offers and a willingness to pay a cost to punish someone contradicts economic models of pure self - interest , and they have been claimed to be unique to humans .
In this study , the researchers confronted our closest living relatives , chimpanzees , to a simplified version of the ultimatum game .
The proposer would propose an offer of raisins to the responder by partially pulling out a tray of raisins as far as he could .
If the responder accepted the division of raisins , he would pull the tray the rest of the way and the two would be able eat .
However , if the responder did not like what he saw , he would not pull the tray and neither of them would get anything to eat .
In each version of this mini-ultimatum game , the proposer could pull one tray with 8 raisins for himself and 2 for the other ( an unfair split that people routinely reject ) .
However , the proposer would have a choice .
In one game , he could choose between this unfair offer and a fair one ( 5 raisins each ) .
In another , he could choose a hyper - fair option ( 2 for himself and 8 for the responder ) .
In a third , he had no choice ( the second tray also had 8 for himself and 2 for the other ) .
In the fourth game , the proposer 's other choice was hyper - unfair ( 10 for himself , 0 for the responder ) .
Unlike humans faced with these games , chimpanzee responders accepted any nonzero offer , whether it was unfair or not .
The only offer that was reliably rejected was the 10/0 option ( responder gets nothing ) .
The researchers conclude that chimpanzees do not show a willingness to make fair offers and reject unfair ones .
In this way , they behave like selfish economists rather than as social reciprocators .

Students were taken to a hastily organised crisis centre
Police reaction
The gunman shot himself in the head and later died from his wounds in hospital , officials said .
The shootings took place in Tuusula , some 50 km ( 30 miles ) north of the capital , Helsinki .
Finnish police said an 18 - year - old man killed five boys , two girls and the female principal of Jokela High School .
Investigators have reportedly identified the gunman as Pekka - Eric Auvinen .
It felt unreal - a pupil I have taught myself was running towards me , screaming , a pistol in his hand

A teacher said the gunman , who had posted footage foreshadowing the massacre on video - sharing website YouTube , was a student at the school .
Police responded to a call made at 1144 ( 0944 GMT ) and made contact with the gunman when they arrived at the school 11 minutes later , said Timo Leppala , the officer in charge of the police operation .
" Police ordered him to surrender , to which he answered by shooting towards the police , " Mr Leppala said .
He described a scene of chaos with students jumping from school windows and running for shelter as more police arrived .
It is not clear when the gunman shot himself in the head .

Police said he was armed with a .22 calibre pistol for which he obtained a license on 19 October .
He did not have a criminal record and " was from an ordinary family , " a police spokesman said .
A Tuusula municipality spokeswoman said the gunman opened fire during a lesson at Jokela secondary school , which has 400 pupils between 12 and 18 .
' Unreal '
Kim Kiuru , a Jokela teacher , said the head teacher announced over the school public announcement 's system just before noon ( 1000 GMT ) that all students should remain in their classrooms .
" I stayed in the corridor to listen to more instructions having locked my classroom door , " Mr Kiuru told Finland 's YLE radio .
" After that I saw the gunman running with what appeared to be a small calibre handgun in his hand through the doors toward me after which I escaped to the corridor downstairs and ran in the opposite direction . "
" It felt unreal - a pupil I have taught myself was running towards me , screaming , a pistol in his hand . "
Mr Kiuru said he saw a woman 's body as he fled the building .
He said he then told his students to " jump out of the windows ... and all my pupils were saved " .
' My war '
The gunman had posted a video called " Jokela high school massacre 11/7/2007 " on YouTube in the past two weeks .
The killings have shocked the community
The video showed a picture of a building by a lake and photos of him holding a gun .
Going by the username Sturmgeist89 , he called himself a " social Darwinist " who would " eliminate all who I see unfit " .
" Sturmgeist " means storm spirit in German .
The video has now been removed from the website .
He had also reportedly posted on another website a rambling manifesto .
In it he said : " death and killing is not a tragedy ...
Not all human lives are important or worth saving . "
He wrote that he was acting alone and nobody is to blame for his actions .
" This is my war : one man 's war against humanity , governments and weak - minded masses of the world . "
Capture the motion of the stars with a long exposure night time shot .
Technically simple and visually stunning , learn how to shoot them here .
Night photography has long been a favourite of mine .
I love the fascinating colours , textures , and shapes that are revealed under limited lighting conditions , and you can experiment with long exposures to add even more interest to your shots .
Star trails are one of the most beautiful subjects you can photograph .
They produce some fascinating patterns , and can give a landscape a truly abstract , almost surreal edge .
They are certainly one of the most challenging subjects to shoot , as they require meticulous planning and require you to stay up for hours on end while everyone else is tucked up in bed .
However , they are certainly worth the effort as they can make for some truly breathtaking photos .
Where To Shoot
Choose a spot as far away from any cities as possible , or at least point the camera away from that area to reduce light pollution .
Avoid shooting star trails during a full moon - the light will overpower the starlight in a matter of minutes .
Long exposure star trails will drain your camera 's battery in no time , and the effect is even worse if you are using in - camera noise reduction .
If possible , shoot near a power supply so that you can hook up your camera using an extension lead , or alternative take a portable power source ( e.g. one that can run off a car battery ) .
Remember to choose a clear night or you wo n't actually be able to see any stars !
Setting Up Your Equipment
You 'll need a camera that can take very long exposure photos .
An SLR or digital SLR with Bulb Mode is perfect .
Use the lowest ISO setting available ( e.g. ISO 100 ) on your camera to reduce the amount of noise in your final photo .
A tripod is absolutely essential .
The sturdier the better , particularly on a windy night .
Use a wide aperture to ensure you capture plenty of light .
This will give you brighter trails .
Wrap insulation around your lens to prevent it fogging ( particularly bad on very long exposures on cold nights ) .
An ideal , cheap solution is to wrap socks around it and hold them in place with elastic bands .
Optionally , take a star chart or planisphere along to help you identify the North or South star ( see below ) .
Finally , you may want to take a warm coat , a flask of coffee and a good book to while away the time !
Composing Your Photo
The Earth rotates around the north and south poles , so all star trails are centred above them .
If you want to position this centre point exactly you 'll need to locate the North Star , Polaris ( northern hemisphere ) or the South Star , Sigma Octantis ( southern hemisphere ) .
Your star trails will form a circle around this point , so position it appropriately in your scene .
Long exposure star trails on their own make stunning photos , but you may also want to include some foreground objects .
be sure not to place them too close though or they will be out of focus thanks to the wide aperture .
If you do use foreground objects , the ambient light will often illuminate them nicely , but if not consider using them as silhouettes instead .
Exposure Time
Exposure time is really a matter of trial and error - it can be anything from a few minutes to several hours depending on the conditions .
It is worth bearing in mind that a longer exposure will produce longer star trails , but will also usually dim the brightness of the trails .
The stars complete one full rotation in 24 hours , or 15 degrees every hour , but my advice is to concentrate on getting a good exposure , and not worry too much about the length of your star trails .
Start with an exposure time of 5 minutes and keep doubling it until you get a good result .
Once you get close to the right exposure time , use your judgement and previous results to decide whether to increase or decrease the exposure time .
That 's all there is to it .
Long exposure star trail photos are technically quite easy to shoot - the hardest part is staying awake !

Al Gore 's Oscar - winning documentary on global warming , An Inconvenient Truth , was yesterday criticised by a high court judge who highlighted what he said were " nine scientific errors " in the film .
Mr Justice Barton yesterday said that while the film was " broadly accurate " in its presentation of climate change , he identified nine significant errors in the film , some of which , he said , had arisen in " the context of alarmism and exaggeration " to support the former US vice - president 's views on climate change .
The film was broadly welcomed by environmental campaigners and scientists on its release last year , and while they did point out that it contained mistakes , these were relatively small and did not detract from the film 's central message - that global warming was a real problem and humans had the technology to do something about it .
The judge made his remarks when assessing a case brought by Stewart Dimmock , a Kent school governor and a member of a political group , the New party , who is opposed to a government plan to show the film in secondary schools .
The judge ruled that the film can still be shown in schools , as part of a climate change resources pack , but only if it is accompanied by fresh guidance notes to balance Mr Gore 's " one- sided " views .
The " apocalyptic vision " presented in the film was not an impartial analysis of the science of climate change , he said .
The judge also said it might be necessary for the Department of Children , Schools and Families to make clear to teachers some of Mr Gore 's views were not supported or promoted by the government , and there was " a view to the contrary " .
He said he had viewed the film and described it as " powerful , dramatically presented and highly professionally produced " , built around the " charismatic presence " of Mr Gore , " whose crusade it now is to persuade the world of the dangers of climate change " .
The mistakes identified mainly deal with the predicted impacts of climate change , and include Mr Gore 's claims that a sea - level rise of up to 20ft would be caused by melting in either west Antarctica or Greenland " in the near future " .
The judge said : " This is distinctly alarmist and part of Mr Gore 's ' wake - up call ' . "
He accepted that melting of the ice would release this amount of water - " but only after , and over , millennia . "
Despite his finding of significant errors , Mr Justice Barton said many of the claims made by the film were supported by the weight of scientific evidence and he identified four main hypotheses , each of which is very well supported " by research published in respected , peer - reviewed journals and accords with the latest conclusions of the IPCC [ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ] . "
The nine points : fact or fallacy ?
· The film claimed that low - lying inhabited Pacific atolls " are being inundated because of anthropogenic global warming " - but there was no evidence of any evacuation occurring
· It spoke of global warming " shutting down the ocean conveyor " - the process by which the gulf stream is carried over the north Atlantic to western Europe .
The judge said that , according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , it was " very unlikely " that the conveyor would shut down in the future , though it might slow down
· Mr Gore had also claimed - by ridiculing the opposite view - that two graphs , one plotting a rise in C02 and the other the rise in temperature over a period of 650,000 years , showed " an exact fit " .
The judge said although scientists agreed there was a connection , " the two graphs do not establish what Mr Gore asserts "
· Mr Gore said the disappearance of snow on Mt Kilimanjaro was expressly attributable to human - induced climate change .
The judge said the consensus was that that could not be established
· The drying up of Lake Chad was used as an example of global warming .
The judge said : " It is apparently considered to be more likely to result from ... population increase , over - grazing and regional climate variability "
· Mr Gore ascribed Hurricane Katrina to global warming , but there was " insufficient evidence to show that "
· Mr Gore also referred to a study showing that polar bears were being found that had drowned " swimming long distances to find the ice " .
The judge said : " The only scientific study that either side before me can find is one which indicates that four polar bears have recently been found drowned because of a storm "
· The film said that coral reefs all over the world were bleaching because of global warming and other factors .
The judge said separating the impacts of stresses due to climate change from other stresses , such as over - fishing , and pollution , was difficult
· The film said a sea - level rise of up to 20ft would be caused by melting of either west Antarctica or Greenland in the near future ; the judge ruled that this was " distinctly alarmist "
· This article was amended on Friday October 12 2007 .
A panel in the article above listing the significant errors found by a high court judge in Al Gore 's documentary on global warming was labelled
The nine points , but contained only eight .
The point we omitted was that the film said a sea - level rise of up to 20ft would be caused by melting of either west Antarctica or Greenland in the near future ; the judge ruled that this was " distinctly alarmist " .
The missing point has been added .

lol . fun
Thats how we get it right - Grand work !
Oh man , So cute !
Nice depth - of - field and composition :)
SOOOO NICE !
i love this pic !
you really deserve your ribbon !
hope nothing bad happenned to this cute mouse ;)
I love this picture !
You can imagine how shocked I was to see this , as I had actually thought of doing the same thing !!
My difference would have been a mouse instead of a rat .
However , my cats are no where near as well behaved as yours .
My photo would have been similar to an action shot in a war zone -- protect the mouse , hold the camera , keep the cat in frame , etc .
Glad this worked out so well for you !
Congratulations on the ribbon !
It is well deserved .
That is fantastic .
OMG . . . I was on vacation and missed seeing this one !
WOW !
That 's about the cutest thing I 've ever seen .
.. and thanks for the reassurance that no animals were hurt during your award winning photo project :)
Way to go being selective and waiting until you had the winner .
Maybe every challenge you enter will be a ribbon winner :)
MEGA CONGRATULATIONS !!!!

Post processing :
Crop , color adjustment , noise reduction , sharpen , contrast .
I never thought this would do so well , I almost didn�t enter it .
Wow , my first contest here and I get a ribbon ?!?!
Hooray !!!!
Here�s hoping it�s not all down hill from here on out ...
This was hard and frustrating !!!.
And no , no animals were hurt making this , although the dog felt a neglected .
hehe .
I was a little nervous at first .
I didn�t know how the cats would react to a rat in the house .
No worries , they could care less about it .
I guess that explains the mice problem ;)
Treats , that �s a whole different story .
The cat I originally wanted in this , felt sleeping was in order .
Plan B. Recast .
This was one of the last photos , by then the cat was full of treats and joined the other for nap time .
Wow , that rat�s fast !
Oh , btw , this cat always looks hungry .
This is quite creepy when you wake up in the morning and you see him staring at you like that from the edge of the bed .
Thanks to my sister for supplying the rat and for her support .
She told me to enter it .
I�m glad I listened .
Thanks for the comparison to one of the great photographers here .
I wish I was that good !
That �s the best compliment I could receive .
Wow !
Your first entry not only gets a ribbon but is also the highest scoring pic with your camera .

Comments Made During the Challenge
This is probably going to get the real blue ribbon because it is simply a perfect take on the challenge , but just in case it does n't , I 'll give it a Posthumous Blue Ribbon .
And yes , I know what I 'm risking here .
After all this could be scalvert .
And that title is trying too hard .
And I have two other brilliant photos to give this ribbon to .
But the tension here is incredible .
The hunger in that cat 's eyes ...
Posthumous Blue Ribbon
LOL - good job handling these tough models .
The composition is a little lopsided , but still one of the top entries .

Definitely the most creative shot in this challenge .
Looking forward to reading how you pulled this off .
The Pirate Party of the United States , a sister organization to the Swedish Piratpartiet , has officially announced that it is forming a state party in Utah .
This is the first state that this burgeoning political party has announced it is forming in .
With the focus on the mine collapse in Utah high in the news right now , cynics might say that this is nothing more than a cheap attempt to gain publicity , at the expense of others .
To that , Ray Jenson , the interim administrator for the Utah party responded “ We ’ve actually been working for quite a long time on this–over a month–and the timing really could n’t be helped .
It was ready when it was ready .
If it had been two days , or two weeks from now , I ’m sure we still would have had the same result . ”
He also added , “ It ’s a tragedy .
Our best wishes are with those miners and their families , wherever they might be . ”
Utah is , of course , no stranger to debate on copyright and its infringement .
Some of the most controversial statements and proposals on dealing with it have come from Utah Senator Orrin Hatch .
Mr Jenson commented “ In general , he seems as though he sincerely believes what he ’s doing is the right thing .
I hope that some education on the issue can alert him to the fact that what he ’s been proposing is not always in the best interests of the public . ”
Indeed , it ’s hard to say how destroying people ’s computers could be in the public interest , especially when there is no way of definitively proving , even after months of court discovery , that someone was infringing , and as we all know , it turned out that his campaign site was itself infringing copyright .
Mr Jenson has no plans , however , for running for any offices at this time , saying “ one step at a time , we ’re concentrating on getting the party and it ’s issues recognized at the present ” .

The assumption that we prefer taller presidential candidates has become modern gospel .
But is it valid ?
Not exactly .
Since 1972 alone , three shorter candidates have won the presidency : Richard Nixon , Jimmy Carter , and George W. Bush ( twice ) .
This is n't to say that physical stature does n't matter politically .
In the upcoming presidential campaign , as in so many , the relative size of candidates will be taken into account along with their positions on gay marriage and free trade .
Height matters .
But the way it matters is far more nuanced than we might imagine .
At the upper end , if handled gracefully , tallness can enhance an aura of presidential stature .
Our consensus two top presidents – George Washington and Abraham Lincoln – stood well over six feet tall .
Little John Adams once complained that Washington , like King Saul , was " chosen because he was taller by the head than the other Jews . "
There is no inherent advantage to being tall , however .
Some smaller candidates capitalized on their short stature by creating a feisty persona .
Think Teddy Roosevelt .
Think Harry Truman .
During his campaigns for the presidency , George W. Bush successfully leveraged his less - than - 6 - foot stature into an image for himself as one of the folks , not a wealthy product of Phillips and Yale .
When confronted with two taller opponents , Mr. Bush wrapped himself in the little guy 's mantle : often underestimated , seldom vanquished .
During the debates in 2000 , it was assumed that Texas ' governor would be demolished by the taller , smarter , better informed Vice President Al Gore .
Just the opposite happened .
Mr. Gore 's condescension , sighs , and larger size created sympathy for his smaller opponent .
When Gore strode across the stage to hover over Bush for no apparent reason other than to call attention to their height disparity , anyone who 's ever had to confront a glowering bully identified immediately with his opponent .
A similar situation helped Bush undercut John Kerry four years later .
Senator Kerry 's commanding 6 foot , 4 inch height reinforced his popular image as an aloof Brahmin , above it all , talking down to his smaller opponent , and – by implication – the rest of us .
Unusually tall men such as Kerry then , and 6 foot , 5 inch Fred Thompson today , must learn how to put at ease those straining to make eye contact with them .
Mr. Thompson 's laconic manner is an asset in this regard .
It tempers his tallness .
During the 1988 vice - presidential debate , big Lloyd Bentsen took a different tack .
Without being overtly imperious , Mr. Bentsen patronized Dan Quayle just enough to make his smaller opponent shrink in stature .
Eight years earlier Ronald Reagan did the same thing to Jimmy Carter .
( " There you go , again . " )
Until Mr. Reagan cut him down to size , President Carter had effectively dealt with his short stature by implying that he was larger .
Rather than stand ramrod straight , like a strutting banty rooster , Carter slouched a little – as if he had an inch or two to spare .
That 's why it took us a while to realize just how short Carter was ( 5 feet 8 or so ) .
Having to stand beside 6 - foot Gerald Ford blew his cover .
On the eve of his 1976 debate with Mr. Ford , Carter 's negotiators first demanded that the two stay seated .
Losing on this point , they settled on having the candidates ' lecterns placed far enough apart that the difference in the two men's size would n't be so apparent .
( In return the Democrats agreed to a background pale enough to camouflage Ford 's lack of hair . )
When the two finally squared off , Carter made their moment of physical proximity as brief as possible – sticking his arm out stiffly to hold the president at bay , grasping his hand momentarily , then dropping it like a live hand grenade before scurrying to the safety of his lectern .
Who today is managing his or her height effectively ?
With her calmly assertive manner , Hillary Clinton looms larger than her mid-five - foot stature might warrant .
As a war hero John McCain – who is not much taller than Hillary in heels – need n't worry about bringing diminutive Michael Dukakis to mind .
Senator McCain also comes across as feisty , a fighter in the mold of his hero , Teddy Roosevelt .
By contrast , six - footers such as Barack Obama and Mitt Romney can relax and let their height speak for itself .
For the sake of the American electorate , the best matchup next fall might be Clinton - McCain , or Obama - Romney .
Such contests would effectively neutralize height as a campaign concern .
Clinton - Thompson , on the other hand , would be a horse race of a different color .
Whether Senator Clinton could cut her far taller opponent down to size would be a test of her ability to project strength , just as Thompson 's ability to call attention to his stature without looming like a bully would be a measure of his political agility .

I do n’t know what genius political consultant has advised the Democratic leadership that it ’s a bad idea to spend hours of prime time on the floor of the Congress reminding the country that Mr. 11 % Approval Rating is a bad guy , of whom they disapprove and who they would like to see held accountable .
It ’s supposed to be Politics 101 that you associate yourself with good things and you are seen to frequently and rabidly denounce bad things .
I do n’t know what weird Beltway consultant dictionary does n’t have a picture of Dick Cheney under the entry for “ bad things . ” 
It just seems like a really shortsighted move by the Democratic leadership .
The Health Care Mess : A Brief History
Do you regularly read the Marginal Revolution blog ?
If you care much about actual economics , and especially if you are a student of the same ( either literally or figuratively ) , you would be wise to do so .
This typically excellent post offers a brief review of a book called Money - Driven Medicine , by Maggie Mahar , whose argument Tyler Cowen summarizes thusly :
I interpret the basic story as this : the American health care cost spiral comes from suppliers and their entrepreneurial abilities to market expensive and highly specialized services of dubious medical efficacy .
Medical care starts off as ambiguous in value and hard to measure in quality .
Customers are cowed by doctors and other family members into accepting or even demanding what is offered to them .
Third - party payments make the problem worse , and government intervention has stoked rather than checked the basic dynamic .
You end up with massive expenses , lots of stupidity , and — because of its expense — radically incomplete coverage .
Every now and then the extra services do pay off , but not frequently enough to boost American stats on health care quality .
Cowen calls the book “ the most coherent , supportable , and fleshed out anti-market story I ’ve seen , ” while acknowledging that it does not dovetail precisely with his own view .
( FWIW , here is another interesting and longer review of the same book . )
Regardless , Cowen ’s brief review is studded with points that we all recognize ( “ massive expenses , lots of stupidity , and — because of its expense — radically incomplete coverage , ” e.g. ) , and which , to my mind , crystallizes what many , many smart people have been thinking about health care for the past 10 or 20 years .
The comments are also very informative , including a long and thoughtful response from Maggie Mahar .

NBC : Republican candidates cannot ' wait and ride this war out '
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday July 20 , 2007 Print This Email
This NBC considered on Friday how the Iraq War and President Bush 's 29 % approval rating might " affect his party 's prospects in the upcoming elections . "
White House correspondent David Gregory pointed out that , if historical trends hold true , a president as unpopular as Bush is unlikely to be succeeded by another Republican .
However , the dilemma for potential candidates is that the president remains popular among Republican primary voters , making it difficult for them to distance themselves from him .
Tim Russert said there was nothing the president could do to improve Republican prospects in 2008 short of " a dramatic turnaround " in Iraq , politically as well as militarily , because the Democrats are not allowing the Republicans any middle ground .
" You see what 's happening in the Senate , " Russert explained .
" While those Republicans have broken publicly with the president , saying we need a change of policy , the Democrats are n't having anything of the sort .
They 're forcing them to vote simply ' withdraw ' or ' not withdraw . ' "
Russert concluded that although the president just wants to run out the clock , Congressional Republicans will have to face the voters in 2008 .
" They cannot wait and ride this war out , " he said .
The following video is from NBC's Today Show , broadcast on July 20 .
Here is a story about mathematical deduction that I love , mainly because it is said to be true , and because it had an impact ( albeit small ) on the outcome of the second world war .
It is the story of how a simple statistical formula successfully estimated the number of tanks the enemy was producing , at a time when this could not be directly observed by the allied spy network .
By 1941 - 42 , the allies knew that US and even British tanks had been technically superior to German Panzer tanks in combat , but they were worried about the capabilities of the new marks IV and V .
More troubling , they had really very little idea of how many tanks the enemy was capable of producing in a year .
Without this information , they were unsure whether any invasion of the continent on the western front could succeed .
One solution was to ask intelligence to guess the number by secretly observing the output of German factories , or by trying to count tanks on the battlefield .
Both the British and the Americans tried this , but they found that the estimates returned by intelligence were contradictory and unreliable .
Therefore they asked statistical intelligence to see whether the accuracy of the estimates could be improved .
The statisticians had one key piece of information , which was the serial numbers on captured mark V tanks .
The statisticians believed that the Germans , being Germans , had logically numbered their tanks in the order in which they were produced .
And this deduction turned out to be right .
It was enough to enable them to make an estimate of the total number of tanks that had been produced up to any given moment .
The basic idea was that the highest serial number among the captured tanks could be used to calculate the overall total .
The German tanks were numbered as follows : 1 , 2 , 3 ... N , where N was the desired total number of tanks produced .
Imagine that they had captured five tanks , with serial numbers 20 , 31 , 43 , 78 and 92 .
They now had a sample of five , with a maximum serial number of 92 .
Call the sample size S and the maximum serial number M. After some experimentation with other series , the statisticians reckoned that a good estimator of the number of tanks would probably be provided by the simple equation ( M - 1 ) ( S+1 ) / S.
In the example given , this translates to ( 92 - 1 ) ( 5+1 ) / 5 , which is equal to 109.2 .
Therefore the estimate of tanks produced at that time would be 109
By using this formula , statisticians reportedly estimated that the Germans produced 246 tanks per month between June 1940 and September 1942 .
At that time , standard intelligence estimates had believed the number was far , far higher , at around 1,400 .
After the war , the allies captured German production records , showing that the true number of tanks produced in those three years was 245 per month , almost exactly what the statisticians had calculated , and less than one fifth of what standard intelligence had thought likely .
Emboldened , the allies attacked the western front in 1944 and overcame the Panzers on their way to Berlin .
And so it was that statisticians won the war - in their own estimation , at any rate .
ANKARA – Tension between Turkey , Iraq and the United States went up another degree as Turkish artillery continued Wednesday and Thursday to shell civilian targets and Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) positions across its border , while army helicopters launched several raids along the border separating Turkey from northern Iraq .
The attacks , reported by state - controlled Anadolu and private Dogan Turkish news agencies , and confirmed by western wires , seem to be the prelude to an incursion into Iraqi Kurdistan , a probable course of action by Ankara following the approval the government received last week from the Turkish parliament .
Turkey ’s intent is to disrupt PKK ’s activities against Turkish military bases and patrols in the region , which , according to Ankara , are organized with the support of Iraqi Kurds , and the tolerance of Baghdad .
The guerrilla conflict has so far cost 30,000 lives in both camps .
It is estimated that 3,000 Turkish Kurds are engaged in PKK operations in the zone .
PKK , formed in 1984 , was initially a movement aiming to form an independent state , but has in recent years limited its claims to becoming an autonomous region of Turkey .
Although PKK combatants consider themselves freedom fighters , they are listed as terrorists by Turkey , the European Union and the US
Escalation in hostilities has increased since the beginning of the year , causing dozens of deaths weekly , particularly amongst Turkish soldiers .
The high command of the Turkish Armed Forces ( TSK ) has since the spring been putting Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan under pressure to authorize punitive actions on Iraqi soil in order to dismantle the PKK .
In spite of the parliament ’s decision last week by 507 votes to 19 to let TSK have its way , Erdogan is still reluctant to press the button .
His preference all along has been for a peaceful , negotiated solution involving the rebels , Washington and Baghdad .
But his hands are tied , and he may have to give in soon under bellicose public and press opinion , and bitter feelings of officers .
The PM ’s strategy has so far been to loudly ask the Iraqi government to police the PKK , and for the US to ensure that such policing take place .
This is , of course , a maneuver to appease his citizens , who , although they supported him during the July legislative elections , nourish unconditional solidarity with their army .
Meanwhile , a semi- promise to invade can give secularist TSK a sweet pill after the appointment of Abdullah Gul as President of the republic , against fierce opposition by the General Staff of the army .
Gul and Erdogan are leaders of the Islamist - origin Justice and Development ( AK ) Party .
Erdogan knows that Baghdad can , or is willing to , do very little .
Northern Iraq has since the end of the first Gulf war been outside its military jurisdiction , as law enforcement and defense have become the prerogative of the local Kurdish forces , the Peshmerga .
The latter ’s affinities are closer to their autonomy - seeking brothers from Turkey than to Iraq ’s central government , and their loyalty lies with Massoud Barzani , president of autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan .
Moreover , the President of Iraq , Jalal Talabani , is also a Kurd , born in Kelkan and educated in Arbil and Kirkuk , which are located in the area targeted by TSK .
Talabani has since 1961 led various Kurdish separatist movements against Baghdad .
In the 1980s , during the Iran - Iraq war , he sided with the Iranians in order to further his people ’s cause .
Although he has kept friendly relations with Turkey , having been protected by former Turkish president Turgut Ozal when he was persecuted by Saddam Hussein , it is unlikely that he will turn a blind eye to a Turkish invasion of his homeland .
At a press conference called on the weekend to calm down the Turkish government after a PKK ambush that killed 12 TSK soldiers , Talabani threatened to close down their bases and offices , but categorically refused to hand over any PKK member to the Turks .
Barzani , who addressed the press conference along with Talabani , warned that the regional administration will defend itself against any attack by its neighbor .
" We are not going to be caught up in the war between PKK and Turkey , but if ( Iraqi ) Kurdistan is targeted , then we are going to defend our citizens , " Barzani said .
He had earlier secured a motion of 183 to 92 by the Iraqi national assembly condemning Turkey ’s threat to cross over to northern Iraq .
What should be read between the lines , however , is that an invasion of Iraq could prompt armed participation in the combat by other Iraqi guerrilla factions , something that neither the Kurds , nor Baghdad , Ankara or Washington would like .
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki will be particularly careful not to provoke the Kurds , as his government ’s survival relies on their political support .
The hopes of Ankara for a solution that excludes an incursion have , as a result , now been narrowed down to the White House ’s willingness , or ability , to exert influence on the Iraqi leadership .
The White House is stuck in a series of dilemmas in its own right .
The Iraqi Kurds have been strong allies in the two wars staged against Saddam ’s regime , and were given encouragement and promises of autonomy , and possibly independence .
They can not be left in the cold if their territory is invaded .
But the US also needs its Turkish ally , albeit not as much as it did during the Cold War .
Turkey is right now useful because of a large base the US Army has at Incirlik in south - eastern Turkey , which is vital for the logistics enabling the occupation of Iraq , and which would be suitable for its evacuation .
This base has been leveraged by Erdogan to gain support from US President Geroge W. Bush to counter the initiative by the US House of Representatives , which resulted this month in a non-binding resolution acknowledging the massacre of up to 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 - 1916 by the Ottoman Turks as genocide .
Bush ’s administration is therefore in a weaker negotiating position with Ankara than it would have liked .
With the new , tougher sanctions by the US against Teheran announced Thursday , and chilly relations with Damascus , Bush is likely to avoid frustrating Turkey in a war against the PKK , while preserving the loyalty of Kurds , not only in Iraq but also in Iran and Syria .
There are no verified figures about Kurdish populations , but international agencies , researchers and the US Central Intelligence Agency estimate that there could be as many as 37 million ethnic Kurds worldwide .
Of these , approximately 12 to 19 million live in Turkey , spread in 17 of the country ’s 81 provinces , five to six million in Iraq , about as many in Iran , and two to three million in Syria .
The total contiguous territorial surface inhabited by Kurds would be about 500,000 square kilometers , more than double the size of the United Kingdom .
Any impulsive action by Turkey could set the clock for another time bomb in the entire region .
Admitting it is failing some students of colour , the Toronto public board could open a black - focused school as early as next fall .
Two community meetings are planned in the next week to discuss the idea of an " African - centred alternative school " from junior kindergarten to Grade 8 that would have more black teachers , black mentors , more focus on students ' heritage and more parent involvement .
A staff report is expected later this month with details on how the concept would work .
If trustees approve such a school , it would be a first for Ontario and possibly Canada , although there are some in the United States in cities such as Detroit , Washington and Kansas City .
" Whatever is being used in the system at this moment is failing a lot of students – and more specifically a lot of black students , " said Donna Harrow , a community worker who is behind the push for such a school , along with Etobicoke parent Angela Wilson .
Black - focused schools have been a lightning rod issue both inside and outside Ontario 's black community since they were first proposed in 1995 by the province 's Royal Commission on Learning as a way to address lower graduation rates among black students .
Two years ago a call for black - focused schools in Toronto caused an uproar between those who warned they smack of segregation and those who believe that black students who study more black authors , scientists and thinkers ; have more black teachers as role models ; and attend schools that set clear , high expectations of black students can fight the alienation some black teens say leads them to drop out of mainstream schools .
" For us , it 's important to try something else , " said Harrow .
" Many parents from the Islands or from Africa , they 've actually gone through an Africentric way of teaching " back home which includes using mentors from the community .
" It 's building up students ' self - esteem by showing them that there are other black people in the neighbourhood who are successful , who are doing well and who will care for them in a supportive manner . "
Harrow said the Toronto District School Board is " very supportive and interested in working toward having a school up and running in September , " and that possible locations are being scouted .
The board has been piloting several " Africentric " social studies units in Grades 6 , 7 and 8 at a handful of schools in the northwest part of the city and has run an Africentric summer camp near Jane and Finch in recent summers .
At the summer camp last year , for example , students learned that Picasso based much of his work on masks from the Congo , that Africa had a university long before Europe – in Morocco – and students based a math grid on the patterns of lush " kente " cloth from Ghana 's royalty .
The Toronto board already has a grade school and high school for First Nations students and an alternative high school for gay and lesbian teens .
Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty opposed the notion of black - focused schools in 2005 , after more than 500 parents and students called for such schools at a public forum on black achievement in Toronto .
Noting he was " not comfortable with that concept , " McGuinty said at the time : " I 'm much more comfortable with the concept of bringing children from a variety of backgrounds together . "
At a Toronto school board discussion of the idea in June , some trustees warned it could fracture the school system , but Education Director Gerry Connelly insisted the status quo is n't working .
" We are not serving our African students well , " Connelly told trustees .
" There is evidence having a school of this kind does make a difference . "
The school would teach the Ontario curriculum , but parents have asked that it emphasize leadership , have a strong mentoring program and prepare students to see university as their first choice , as well as have an Africentric focus .
Parents have asked the board for three such schools – in the east , west and south ends of Toronto – with at least one eventually going from kindergarten to Grade 12 , with the hope older students would mentor younger ones .
Sociology professor George Dei , one of Canada 's top researchers on black achievement , calls the idea of an experimental black - focused school " long overdue . "
" Let 's try it and see if it works , and if it does , let 's transfer those lessons to mainstream schools , " said Dei , chair of Equity In Education Studies at the University of Toronto 's Ontario Institute for Studies in Education .
Not all teachers would have to be black , he noted , but black teachers are important role models and would be less likely to have lower expectations for black students – a problem he says is " huge " in mainstream schools .

" Black students tell us that teachers often give up on them so easily ; they do n't treat them as serious students , " said Dei yesterday in a telephone interview from Ghana , where he is on sabbatical .
" It 's not about hiring just any teacher who is black , but you do want teachers willing to go the extra mile , and it is crucial to have more black role models in positions of power . "
The community meetings will be held Thursday at 7 p.m. at North Albion Collegiate on Kipling Ave. north of Finch Ave. W. , and Monday at 7 p.m. at Northview Heights Secondary School on Finch Ave. W .
Women have high expectations for nearly every area of their lives , but when it comes to sex , they settle for less .
And most women keep their dissatisfaction with sex a secret , leaving their partners ( let alone their doctors ) in the dark , said Anita Clayton , a psychiatrist who focuses on women 's sexuality at the University of Virginia Health System .
" Whereas men , if they have trouble with sex , it 's a crisis .
They run to the doctor and say ' I need something for this . '
Women do n't do that .
They just sort of stuff it down and push it further down on the list , " Clayton said .
With surveys and years of clinical experience , Clayton has compiled a vast collection of data on women 's sex lives .
Often , she said , a female patient would visit her with issues like marital problems or depression , and only when directly asked about sex , the patient would divulge dissatisfaction .
Clayton attributes several factors to a woman 's lack of sexual satisfaction , including :
Sex gets shoved to the bottom of the " to do " list for women .
And when they do have sex it becomes just another task .
Women are not getting their emotional needs met during sex .
An orgasm might not be the point .
Many women strive for unrealistic physical perfection seen in the media and are unhappy with some aspect of their physical bodies .
Women do n't ask for what they want in bed , fearing their partner will be hurt or leave them .
Medications such as antidepressants can reduce a woman 's libido and ability to reach orgasm .
What women want
Some women did complain about difficulty reaching orgasm or lack of sexual desire , but frequently they just felt an overall letdown regarding sex , Clayton said .
Video : Aspirin and Sex Drive
What is mediocre sex ?
" It tends to be this feeling that they 're not satisfied and a lot of times that 's on an emotional level .
They might have had an orgasm .
But many women do n't feel like [ an orgasm is ] the end - all , be - all every time they have sex , " Clayton explained .
Not knowing why they feel so deflated after sex , women assume it 's their fault or they just do n't bring up the topic to their partner .
Plus , Clayton said women do n't have a clear awareness of their sexual desires because of social , cultural or religious beliefs that label such female wants as shameful .
Outside pressures impact a woman 's view of her body , which can make having sex even less appealing .
" Women are so obsessed with our physical appearance , and we really are trying to achieve some idealized woman 's body that we see in the media .
We always feel like we 're lacking , " Clayton told LiveScience .
Instead , they focus on the ever - growing to - do list and sex becomes another task at the very bottom of the list .
" Work and family come first .
We end up putting sex low on the priority list , " Clayton said .
" Then when our partner initiates sex , it 's just another task .
I really believe that we as women accept a level of dissatisfaction that we do n't need to accept . "
Tips for success
To ramp up sexual satisfaction , Clayton suggests both partners can play a role .
For one , women should know that the perfect body does n't equal good sex .
" You do n't have to be a sexy bombshell - looking person to have great sex .
It 's really not about that .
We might think that Victoria 's Secret models have a great sex life , but their sex life is no better than anybody else 's , " Clayton said .
A confident , sexy attitude and an openness to explore sensuality can breathe life into lackluster sex .
Also , women can give a higher priority to sex , holding the laundry for another day .
Guys can be more open to talking about what a woman wants in bed , to the point of initiating the conversation , Clayton said .
And to make more time for sex , she said , men can help a girlfriend or wife with tasks around the house .
Cellular phone service in the US is a mixed bag .
While US residents enjoy the widespread availability of 3G networks and gadget candy like the iPhone , there is also a confusing morass of fees , contracts , and phones tethered to their providers via locking .
The new Cell Phone Empowerment
Act of 2007 aims to change much of that .
Introduced late last week by Sen. Amy Klobuchar ( D - MN ) and Sen. Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) , the consumer - friendly bill would force cellular providers to change some of their ways .
First off , companies would be barred from charging any fees beyond those mandated by local , state , and federal governments .
That means no more hidden fees , as overage charges would be listed separately .
Early termination fees would also be prorated , with customers looking to get out of their contracts only forced to pay half of the termination fee at the halfway point of the contract .
Speaking of contracts , cell phone companies would have to begin notifying customers of changes to their contracts in writing .
In fact , contract extensions would not be valid unless the cellular company provides point - of - sale notice and gives the customer 30 days to cancel .
Cellular subscribers would also get a 30 - day grace period at the beginning of a contract during which they could opt out for any reason .
Members of the US military would also be able to terminate their contracts if they are deployed outside of the US for longer than 90 days .
Consumers would also have more data at their fingertips as they decide which cellular carrier to sign on with .
Providers would need to provide maps of their coverage areas , detailed enough so that consumers would be able to determine whether they can get service at their homes .
The Federal Communication Commission would also keep tabs on dropped calls and coverage gaps ; that data would be publicly available .
Sen .
Klobuchar believes that the bill would bring much - needed change to the cellular industry .
" The rules governing our wireless industry are a relic of the 1980s , when cell phones were a luxury item that fit in a briefcase instead of a pocket , " Sen .
Klobuchar said in a statement .
" Early termination fees are a family budget - buster ; families should be able to terminate service without outrageous fees ; know if their cell phone will work on their drives and in their home and office ; and understand what to expect in their monthly bills once you pile on charges and fees .
It 's a simple matter of fairness . "
The cellular industry is opposing the bill .
" It is disappointing and unfortunate that Senators Klobuchar and Rockefeller intend to introduce legislation based on incomplete and misleading data .
The truth is that complaints about wireless service to the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) are infrequent and declining , " said CTIA president Steve Largent in a statement .
Largent also said that the bill would ultimately be harmful to consumers .
" The Klobuchar - Rockefeller bill is unnecessary and , if enacted , threatens to increase the cost of wireless service and reduce the number of choices available to American consumers . "
A recent report from free - market advocacy group The American Consumer Group painted a glowing picture of the cellular phone market , one that Largent echoed .
" Between 2003 and 2006 , the number of contract - related complaints dropped from 15 for every one million subscribers , to just nine for every one million subscribers , " said Largent " In that same period of time , the number of total complaints decreased by 19 percent .
All of that occurred while 75 million new subscribers were choosing wireless service , an increase of nearly 50 percent . "
As we pointed out in our coverage of the ACG 's cell phone report , the cell phone industry 's data does n't jibe too well with either data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development or the experiences of many American consumers .
If it passes , the Cell Phone Empowerment
Act would address some of those problems without causing the kind of problems envisioned in the CTIA 's dire warnings .
Want to convince your readers to do something or agree with your point of view ?
OK , that was a silly question .
Of course you do .
Persuasion is generally an exercise in creating a win -win situation .
You present a case that others find beneficial to agree with .
You make them an offer they ca n’t refuse , but not in the manipulative Godfather sense .
It ’s simply a good deal or a position that makes sense to that particular person .
But there are techniques that can make your job easier and your case more compelling .
While this list is in no way comprehensive , these 10 strategies are used quite a bit because they work .
Repetition
Talk to anyone well versed in learning psychology , and they ’ll tell you repetition is crucial .
It ’s also critical in persuasive writing , since a person can’t agree with you if they do n’t truly get what you ’re saying .
Of course , there ’s good repetition and bad .
To stay on the good side , make your point in several different ways , such as directly , using an example , in a story , via a quote from a famous person , and once more in your summary .
Reasons Why
Remember the power of the word because .
Psychological studies have shown that people are more likely to comply with a request if you simply give them a reason why … even if that reason makes no sense .
The strategy itself does make sense if you think about it .
We do n’t like to be told things or asked to take action without a reasonable explanation .
When you need people to be receptive to your line of thinking , always give reasons why .
Consistency
It ’s been called the “ hobgoblin of little minds , ” but consistency in our thoughts and actions is a valued social trait .
We do n’t want to appear inconsistent , since , whether fair or not , that characteristic is associated with instability and flightiness , while consistency is associated with integrity and rational behavior .
Use this in your writing by getting the reader to agree with something up front that most people would have a hard time disagreeing with .
Then rigorously make your case , with plenty of supporting evidence , all while relating your ultimate point back to the opening scenario that ’s already been accepted .
Social Proof
Looking for guidance from others as to what to do and what to accept is one of the most powerful psychological forces in our lives .
It can determine whether we deliver aid to a person in need , and it can determine whether we muster the courage to kill ourselves .
Obvious examples of social proof can be found in testimonials and outside referrals , and it ’s the driving force behind social media .
But you can also casually integrate elements of social proof in your writing , ranging from skillful alignment with outside authorities to blatant name dropping .
Comparisons
Metaphors , similes and analogies are the persuasive writer ’s best friends .
When you can relate your scenario to something that the reader already accepts as true , you ’re well on your way to convincing someone to see things your way .
But comparisons work in other ways too .
Sometimes you can be more persuasive by comparing apples to oranges ( to use a tired but effective metaphor ) .
Do n’t compare the price of your home study course to the price of a similar course — compare it to the price of a live seminar or your hourly consulting rate .
Agitate and Solve
This is a persuasion theme that works as an overall approach to making your case .
First , you identify the problem and qualify your audience .
Then you agitate the reader ’s pain before offering your solution as the answer that will make it all better .
The agitation phase is not about being sadistic ; it ’s about empathy .
You want the reader to know unequivocally that you understand his problem because you ’ve dealt with it and / or are experienced at eliminating it .
The credibility of your solution goes way up if you demonstrate that you truly feel the prospect ’s pain .
Prognosticate
Another persuasion theme involves providing your readers with a glimpse into the future .
If you can convincingly present an extrapolation of current events into likely future outcomes , you may as well have a license to print money .
This entire strategy is built on credibility .
If you have no idea what you ’re talking about , you ’ll end up looking foolish .
But if you can back up your claims with your credentials or your obvious grasp of the subject matter , this is an extremely persuasive technique .
Unify … Selectively
Despite our attempts to be sophisticated , evolved beings , we humans are exclusionary by nature .
Give someone a chance to be a part of a group that they want to be in — whether that be wealthy , or hip , or green , or even contrarian — and they ’ll hop on board whatever train you ’re driving .
This is the technique used in the greatest sales letter ever written .
Find out what group people want to be in , and offer them an invitation to join while seemingly excluding others .
Address Objections
If you present your case and someone is left thinking “ yeah , but … ” , well , you ’ve lost .
This is why direct marketers use long copy — it ’s not that they want you to read it all , it ’s that they want you to read enough until you buy .
Addressing all the potential objections of at least the majority of your readers can be tough , but if you really know your subject the arguments against you should be fairly obvious .
If you think there are no reasonable objections to your position , you ’re in for a shock if you have comments enabled .
Storytelling
Storytelling is really a catch - all technique — you can and should use it in combination with any and all of the previous nine strategies .
But the reason why storytelling works so well lies at the heart of what persuasion really is .
Stories allow people to persuade themselves , and that ’s what it ’s really all about .
You might say that we never convince anyone of anything — we simply help others independently decide that we ’re right .
Do everything you can to tell better stories , and you ’ll find that you are a terribly persuasive person .

Bob Stella , 70 , and Bill Niland , 73 , are enjoying their golden years .

Bob Stella , 70 , and Bill Niland , 73 , are enjoying their golden years .
Almost every day they show up at the Portsmouth Country Club to get in 18 holes of golf .
And every day , for about two years , someone — uninvited — waits for them to show up .
� Well , I went up to take my shot , � said Niland .
� And there was this frog , holding on to me . �
� So , I grabbed him , placed him in the bushes , and thought that was that , � said Stella .
� But the next day , he was back in the golf cart .
He crossed the entire green , and came back to our golf cart . �
The frog , nicknamed Froggy , has been a mainstay ever since .
For two years , the frog has been riding around with the two men as they make their way around the course .
� I don�t know where he goes in the winter , � said Niland .
� We cover up our golf cart with a tarp , which I guess would cover him from the snow , but it is n�t very warm . �
The frog has become something of a celebrity around the golf course .
� People always ask about him , if he�s on the cart , � said Stella .
� My granddaughters came to see him , � said Niland .
� They thought he was cute . �
Normally the frog sits behind the seat cushion , and spends the night in a basket behind the seat , nestled in a tarp .
� I�ve also seen him in the ball washer , soaking up the water , � said Niland .
� He climbs all over the cart . �
Sometimes the frog even sits on the bench seat , next to Stella as he makes his way around the course .
Niland and Stella bought the golf cart a few years back from a friend .
It was only after their purchase that the frog started renting cart number three .
� I don�t know what draws him in , � said Niland .
� But there he is , every day . �
� I don�t know what he eats , � said Stella .
� I guess there are mosquitoes around .
Every night I pile some grass up around him . �
Mike Pennington , a friend of both Stella and Niland , sees the frog differently .
� Many of Bob�s friends have noted the frog�s facial features and personality match Bob�s to a tee , � said Pennington .
� I�ve never seen a frog like that before , � said Niland .
� I don�t know what kind he is .
The elusive green frog .�
Stella and Niland are sure that it is the same frog that keeps returning .
� He could have quintuplets , � said Niland .
� But why would they keep coming back to our cart ? �
And why does the frog hang around a golf course ?
� Maybe because he plays golf better than us , � said Niland .
� Or maybe because we�re so good at golf he wants to be around us . �
General Musharraf , in his memoir , “ In the Line of Fire , ” published last year , did not discuss any equipment , training or technology offered then , but wrote : “ We were put under immense pressure by the United States regarding our nuclear and missile arsenal .
The Americans ’ concerns were based on two grounds .
First , at this time they were not very sure of my job security , and they dreaded the possibility that an extremist successor government might get its hands on our strategic nuclear arsenal .
Second , they doubted our ability to safeguard our assets . ”
General Musharraf was more specific in an interview two years ago for a Times documentary , “ Nuclear Jihad : Can Terrorists Get the Bomb ? ”
Asked about the equipment and training provided by Washington , he said , “ Frankly , I really do n’t know the details . ”
But he added : “ This is an extremely sensitive matter in Pakistan .
We do n’t allow any foreign intrusion in our facilities .
But , at the same time , we guarantee that the custodial arrangements that we brought about and implemented are already the best in the world . ”
Now that concern about General Musharraf ’s ability to remain in power has been rekindled , so has the debate inside and outside the Bush administration about how much the program accomplished , and what it left unaccomplished .
A second phase of the program , which would provide more equipment , helicopters and safety devices , is already being discussed in the administration , but its dimensions have not been determined .
Harold M. Agnew , a former director of the Los Alamos weapons laboratory , which designed most of the United States ’ nuclear arms , argued that recent federal reluctance to share warhead security technology was making the world more dangerous .
“ Lawyers say it ’s classified , ” Dr. Agnew said in an interview .
“ That ’s nonsense .
We should share this technology .
Anybody who joins the club should be helped to get this . ”
“ Whether it ’s India or Pakistan or China or Iran , ” he added , “ the most important thing is that you want to make sure there is no unauthorized use .
You want to make sure that the guys who have their hands on the weapons ca n’t use them without proper authorization . ”
In the past , officials say , the United States has shared ideas — but not technologies — about how to make the safeguards that lie at the heart of American weapons security .
The system hinges on what is essentially a switch in the firing circuit that requires the would - be user to enter a numeric code that starts a timer for the weapon ’s arming and detonation .

A counter - intuitive proposal for a mechanism of lifespan extension comes from Schulz et al. , who contend that glucose restriction extends worm lifespan by increasing mitochondrial respiration and thereby the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) .
Wait , you thought that ROS were deleterious ?
Welcome to the topsy - turvy world of hormesis , the biological equivalent of Was mich nicht umbringt , macht mich stärker , in which a little bit of a bad thing is actually a very good thing .
Hormesis is observed in a variety of stress responses , following the general template that low “ priming ” doses of some stress can increase resistance to subsequent higher “ challenge ” doses .
In the life extension business , some view exercise as a hormetic stress , pushing the body ’s limits so that those limits might be further expanded in future ; calorie restriction itself has already been proposed to act via hormesis .
Here , the authors propose that decreased glucose causes worms ( their model organism ) to rely increasingly on mitochondrial respiration .
More flux through the mitochondria means more production of ROS .
Chronic production of ROS , usually thought to cause aging , here results in hormetic protection — at least , in the authors ’ model .
In support of their theory , various types of antioxidants actually prevent the life extension that results from glucose deprivation .
I ’m going to admit that I find this confusing .
“ The ” mechanism of hormesis ( which may or may not be unitary ; hence the quotes ) is not yet well understood ; one can imagine that goosing the machinery of a given stress response machinery might potentiate it in some way , or that low - level activation of a stress response pathway might end up stocking the cell with various sorts of protective molecules ( ranging from chaperones or antioxidant enzymes to noncatalytic “ cushions ” like trehalose ) .
Usually , however , hormesis comes from acute exposure to stress : even if it ’s repeated , there ’s a chance for the cells ( or the body ) to recover before the next challenge .
What I ’m having a tough time wrapping my head around is how a chronic stress ( i.e. , elevated ROS levels resulting from lifelong glucose deprivation ) could protect the body from another chronic stress that is essentially identical ( i.e. , elevated ROS levels pursuant to aging ) .
For the model to hold true , it seems that either the system must be exquisitely tuned and the authors were lucky to hit a very narrow “ sweet spot ” , or ROS production must be increasing resistance to other stresses that are more relevant to C. elegans lifespan than oxidation .

Students at many of the country 's most prestigious colleges and universities are graduating with less knowledge of American history , government , and economics than they had as incoming freshmen , with Harvard University seniors scoring a " D+ " average on a 60 - question multiple - choice exam about civic literacy .
According to a report released yesterday by the Intercollegiate Studies Institute , the average college senior at the 50 colleges and universities polled did not earn a passing grade .
" At the most expensive colleges , they actually graduate knowing less , " the executive director of the Jack Miller Center at the Intercollegiate Studies Institute , Michael Ratliff , said .
" Colleges and universities are not directing students to the courses that would educate them .
We want to know whether after getting $ 300 billion to do their work , universities are actually educating their students . "
At universities such as Princeton , Yale , Cornell , Duke , and Berkeley , seniors scored lower on the test , available here , than freshmen , living proof of the broadening relevancy of the old Harvard adage that the university is a storehouse of knowledge because " the freshmen bring so much and the seniors take away so little . "
The average foreign student studying in an American college learned nothing about the country 's history and its civic institutions , according to the study .
The low scores indicate a looming crisis in American citizenship , officials at the institute said yesterday , as students who increased their knowledge of American history in college were more likely to register to vote and to participate in civic activities as adults .
The study , titled " Failing Our Students , Failing America , " was conducted by researchers at the department of public policy at the University of Connecticut .
The exam was distributed to 14,000 college seniors at 50 institutions of higher education across the country .
The researchers hand - picked 25 " elite " schools , and randomly selected 25 schools from all four - year American colleges and universities to poll .
The multiple - choice questions were written by specialists in each field .
A professor of American history at Columbia University , Eric Foner , said that a multiple - choice exam testing factual knowledge of history could exaggerate student ignorance of American history .
" The study of history has changed enormously , " Mr. Foner said .
" It 's become much more broad and diverse .
The study of facts about particular battles has diminished , but maybe students are in a better position to answer questions about the abolition of slavery . "
Some of the questions in the exam were strictly factual , asking students to identify which battle ended Revolutionary War , or the dates when President Lincoln was in office .
Other questions tested their understanding of different forms of government , or of the basic theories of philosophers such as Plato .
" History has a pragmatic value , " Mr. Foner said .
" You are acquiring skills that are desired by employers  an ability to write , analyze material , and produce your own point of view . "
The chairman of the history department at Princeton University , Jeremy Adelman , said that providing students with a foundation in American history and governance should not be the sole mission of any institution of higher education .
" You have to ask what is the social function of the university ? " Mr. Adelman said .
" If you 're in chemical engineering , why study history ?
Should we require students to study history ?
I do n't think if you polled the history department faculty there would be unanimity on the question . "
Students at Princeton are required to take one history class , he said .
The course does not have to be in American history .
Less than half of the students who participated identified the phrase " We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal " as a line from the Declaration of Independence .
Many of them identified its source as " The Communist Manifesto , " or said that it was an inscription on the Statue of Liberty .
Cornell and Princeton spokeswomen said the institutions would not comment on the report .
A Harvard spokesman did not return a call for comment .
A spokeswoman for Yale pointed out that history is the most popular major at the college , and that last year , 3,586 students out of about 5,200 students registered to take a history course .
The Intercollegiate Studies Institute was founded in 1953 with William Buckley Jr. as its president .
Its mission is to cultivate the values of democracy and of a free society among American college students .
This is the third year that the institute has issued the report on civic knowledge among American college students .

The Age of the Dragon China 's Conquest of Africa
China is conquering Africa as it becomes the preferred trading partner of the continent 's dictators .
Beijing is buying up Africa 's abundant natural resources and providing it with needed cash and cheaply produced consumer goods in return .
Officials said the tidal surge peaked at dawn on Friday morning
Despite some flooding along Britain 's North Sea coast , authorities said the peak of the surge had passed without major incident .
A tidal surge in 1953 killed more than 2,000 people in the two countries .
Overnight , thousands of people were evacuated in England and surge barriers closed at the Dutch port of Rotterdam .
Several oil platforms were closed off the Norwegian coast and gales are forecast in Germany and Denmark .
Peak
Thousands of people were told to leave their homes along the south - eastern coast of England on Thursday night in preparation for a predicted peak surge of up to 3 m ( 10ft ) .
The UK Environment Agency warned of " extreme danger to life and property " in parts of Norfolk , Suffolk , Kent and Essex and issued eight severe flood alerts .
The Met Office meanwhile warned of gusts of up to 145 km/h ( 90 mph ) for the Orkney and Shetland islands in Scotland .
As the storm surge goes down the coast we think it will reduce in size and have less impact
Baroness Young
UK Environment Agency
Around 500 people spent the night at refuge centres set up at local schools , local police said .
Many others spent the night on the upper floors of their houses .
However , when the tides peaked between 0700 GMT and 0800 GMT this morning , officials reported no major breaches of flood defences .
Further surges are expected to hit the English coast around Kent and London , but they will not coincide with high tide .
The Thames Barrier is already being raised and the Thames has been declared all clear .
The environment agency 's chief executive , Baroness Young , said the worst appeared to be over .
" It has peaked at about 20 cm less than we'd thought , which has just meant that vulnerable towns like Yarmouth have not flooded substantially , though the roads have flooded through seepage , " she said at a news conference .
" As the storm surge goes down the coast we think it will reduce in size and have less impact . "
After chairing a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee at 0600 GMT , UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said his government stood ready to help local communities along the North Sea coast .
" We will be able to assess what is happening over the course of the next few hours , " he said .
Barrier closed
In the Netherlands , maritime traffic in Rotterdam was halted as the authorities closed the giant Maeslant surge barrier , which guards the entrance to the largest port in Europe , for the first time since its construction in the 1990s .
It took half - an - hour for the two doors of the barrier across the Nieuwe Waterweg to meet , spanning a channel 360 m ( 1181 ft ) wide .
The barrier protecting Rotterdam 's port was closed for the first time
Rotterdam 's port will remain closed until 1700GMT on Friday , a spokesman said .
Surveillance operations will continue along the northern Dutch coast , although other parts of the country have been told they are no longer at risk .
One - third of the land mass of the Netherlands is under sea level .
The Dutch transport ministry said this was the first time since 1976 the whole North Sea coast was under alert .
Severe gale warnings were issued in Germany and Denmark , with wind gusts of up to 125 km /h ( 80 mph ) forecast .
In Germany , regions around the Elbe and Elm rivers were under flood warnings .
The North Sea storm has also affected oil industry in Norway , the fifth largest exporter of crude in the world , as it was forced to close several oil platforms off its coast .
Norway 's oil production of 220,000 barrels per day is expected to be slashed by 10 % possibly leading to increases in the price of crude , already at record levels , experts say .

The romance of searching for pirate treasure has been celebrated in dozens of stories since Robert Louis Stevenson 's Treasure Island .
But is there really any buried treasure to be found ?
Maybe so … on Oak Island .
TREASURE ISLAND
In 1795 , a teenager named Daniel McGinnis discovered an unusual , saucer - shaped depression on Oak Island , a tiny island off the coast of Nova Scotia .
Next to the hole was an ancient oak tree with sawed off limbs .
And , according to legend , a ship 's tackle hung from the tree directly over the depression - as if it had been used to lower something very heavy into the hole .
McGinnis was certain he had found buried pirate treasure , and with the help of two friends he began digging for it .
Within minutes they hit rock - which turned out to be a flagstone buried two feet below surface .
They hit another barrier made of oak logs at 10 feet deep ; another at 20 feet , and a third at 30 feet .
McGinnis and his friends kept digging - but they never found any treasure and eventually gave up .
Still , word of their discovery spread .
SECOND TRY
In 1803 , a wealthy man named Simeon Lynds took up the search .
The diggers he hired found another platform at 40 feet , and found several more deeper down .
Finally , at 90 feet , the workers found a large stone with strange symbols carved into it .
No one could decipher what the stone said , but the workers were convinced they were close to treasure and kept digging .
( The stone was later stolen . )
At 98 feet deep , their shovels struck what felt like a wooden chest .
But the sun was going down , so they stopped for the night .
By the time the workers got back the next morning , the hole had flooded to the top with seawater .
And it somehow kept refilling , even as the workers tried to bail it out .
They never were able to drain the pit enough to finish digging .
Like McGinnis , Lynds had hit a dead end .
AMAZING DISCOVERIES
Franklin Roosevelt and others at the Money Pit. Lynds was n't the last person to dig for treasure on Oak Island .
In fact , so many excavations have been attempted that the precise location of the original hole - known as the " Money Pit " because so much money has been spent trying to solve its mysteries - has been forgotten because so many other holes have been dug nearby .
Even young Franklin D. Roosevelt supervised a dig in 1909 ( he followed Oak Island 's progress even as president ) .
And the search continues today .
Some findings :
There 's at least some gold down there .
In 1849 , treasure hunters sank a drill to the 98 foot level .
Like Lynds , they hit what felt like a wooden chest .
They dug through the top into what felt like " 22 inches of metal in pieces ( possibly gold coins ) , " through more wood , and into another 22 inches of metal .
When they pulled the drill back to the surface , three links of gold chain were stuck to it .
In nearly 200 years of digging , that 's all the treasure that 's been found .
In 1897 , another group of drillers dug down to 155 feet .
They pulled up a half - inch - square piece of parchment - but that 's not all .
They also hit what they thought was a heavy iron plate at 126 feet , but could n't pull it up .
Money Pit inscription and cipher at The Active Mind In 1987 , an IBM cryptologist finally deciphered an engraving of Lynds ' lost stone .
The message read : " Forty feet below , two million pounds are buried . "
Image : George Bates Maritime map set ( The Oak Island Mystery ) HIGH SECURITY
Whoever dug the original pit went through a great deal of trouble to do it .
In 1850 , explorers resting on a nearby beach noticed that the beach " gulched forth water like a sponge being squeezed . "
So they dug it up - and discovered it was a fake .
The beach was actually a manmade network of stone drains that filtered seawater and fed it into the Money Pit .
The drains - designed to flood the pit whenever treasure hunters got close to the treasure - had been buried in sand to avoid detection .
The Money Pit may even be protected by poison gas .
On August 17 , 1965 , treasure hunter Bob Restall blacked out and fell into the pit he had dug .
His son and four others tried to rescue him , but they also blacked out and fell in .
Restall , his son , and two of the workers were killed .
The autopsy finding : death by " marsh - gas poisoning and / or drowning . "
TODAY
In 1977 , the Montreal - based Triton Alliance , Ltd. , a consortium of 49 investors headed by David Tobias , bought the 128 - acre Oak Island for $ 125,000 .
They have spent more than $ 3 million digging for treasure .
During one drill , Triton 's workers found bits of china , glass , wood , charcoal - even cement .
But no treasure .
Perhaps the strangest incident associated with Oak Island occurred in 1971 when Tobias ' partner Dan Blankenship lowered an underwater video camera into a water - filled cavity at the bottom of a shaft .
On the monitor , Blankenship suddenly saw what looked like a human hand .
Horrified , he called over three crew members , who later verified his story .
Asked by Smithsonian magazine about the legitimacy of his hand - sighting , he answered , " There 's no question about it . "
WHAT'S DOWN THERE ?
Oak Island 's " treasure , " if there is one , could be worth over $ 100 million .
Among the many theories of what the Money Pit could be hiding : 1 . The missing crown jewels of France .
The Nova Scotia area was frequented by pirates in the 16th and 17th centuries - when the jewels were stolen .
The local Mahone Bay takes its name from the French word mahonne , a craft used by Mediterranean pirates .
2 . Inca gold plundered by Spanish galleons and later pirated by Sir Francis Drake .
A carbon analysis of wood samples recovered from the area dated them back to 1575 , around the time of Drake 's explorations .
However , there is no record of Drake ever having been to Nova Scotia .
3 . Captain Kidd 's buried treasure .
Some believe Kidd buried his treasure there before being extradited and later hanged by the British .
Before Kidd was executed in1701 , he offered a deal : " He would lead a fleet to the spot where he had hidden his East Indian treasure , if the authorities would put off his execution .
The deal was refused - and Kidd 's treasure has never been found . "
There is , however , no evidence that Kidd was ever near Oak Island .
Others have their doubts .
Some feel that the Money Pit is merely an elaborate decoy and that the treasure is actually buried in a nearby swamp .
Others think it 's just a sinkhole .
Many doubt whether pirates had the resources and engineering know - how to construct such an elaborate trap .
POSTSCRIPT Similar Money Pits are rumored to have been found in Haiti and Madagascar , although these discoveries have not been confirmed by archaeologists .
Democrats mull ' criminal contempt ' charges for White House in ' Attorneygate ' probe Michael Roston
Published : Friday June 22 , 2007 Print This Email
This A Democratic Congressman who is helping to lead the investigation into the firing of 8 US Attorneys by the Justice Department made it clear he was contemplating contempt charges if the White House ignores subpoenas that were issued by the House and Senate Judiciary Committees last week .
" Both the House and the Senate Judiciary Committees have issued subpoenas to the White House and several former White House officials for documents and testimony in the controversy that 's before us , " Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) , Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , stated in a Thursday hearing .
" And we 're still hopeful that they may cooperate .
But it is possible that enforcement action may need to be taken . "
Conyers continued , asking Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty how he would go about supporting any need for enforcement actions .
" Would you help us bring charges of criminal contempt if these subpoenas are resisted ?
Because that may likely be the next step , " he said to McNulty .
The Deputy Attorney General stated that he would need to recuse himself from the considerations , as he is participating in the current investigation .
According to a Thursday report in Roll Call , " If the House passes a contempt motion  a rare occurrence  the matter would , ironically , be referred to the U.S. attorney of the District of Columbia .
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales would then be charged with enforcing the motion . "
As the Attorney General and his top deputy have both recused themselves from many matters in the US Attorneys controversy due to the Justice Department 's internal investigation , the next officer in the department 's hierarchy is the Solicitor General , Paul Clement .
The current round of subpoenas set a deadline of June 28 for compliance .
The subpoenas seek White House documents and testimony from two former White House staff : Harriet Miers , once Bush 's Counsel , and Sara Taylor , who served as Karl Rove 's top deputy .
White House Counsel Fred Fielding has generally stated that Bush 's staff are protected by executive privilege from the Congressional probe , and has only offered off the record interviews with the Judiciary Committees ' targets .
The Judiciary Committees ' chairmen have rejected the offers .
NASA 's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity used its navigation camera during the rover 's 1,278th Martian day , or sol , ( Aug. 28 , 2007 ) to take the images combined into this view .
Aftersurviving near fatal dust storms on Mars , NASA 's Opportunity rover is gearingup for its long - awaited trek inside an expansive crater on the red planet ' ssurface .
Opportunity could begin descending down into Mars 'giant Victoria Crater by Sept. 11 after spending two months hunkered down to waitout sunlight - blotting storms that nearly starvedthe solar - powered rover and its robotic twin , Spirit .
The rover spent thisweek rolling ever closer to entry point into Victoria Crater .
" Opportunitymight be ready for that first ' toe dip ' into the crater as early as nextweek , " said John Callas , project manager for the Mars rover mission at the JetPropulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , in a Fridaystatement .
Victoria isthe largest crater visited by Opportunity during a 43 - month trek across its MeridianiPlanum landing site .
A bright layer of exposed rock inside the 2,400 - foot wide ( 730 - meter wide ) crater may yield tantalizing clues of interactions betweenMars ' surface and atmosphere millions of years ago , mission researchers said .
To preparefor the descent into Victoria Crater , Opportunity 's handlers will send the rovertoan entry point that will allow clear access to the bright band of rockabout 40 feet ( 12 meters ) blow the depression 's rim .
The rover will then backout a bit to check how much it may slip during the descent .
" Wechose a point that gives us a straight path down , instead of drivingcross - slope from our current location , " said JPL rover driver PaoloBellutta .
" The rock surface on which Opportunity will be driving will provide good traction and control of its path intothe crater . "
Spirit , meanwhile , climbed atop a rock plateau dubbed " Home Plate ' on Wednesday .
The plateau had been a long - time destination for Spirit as the rover exploresits Gusev Crater landing site .
Healthchecks planned
But beforeOpportunity can begin its crater descent , scientists on Earth will check thehealth of two vital instruments to ensure the months - long martian dust stormshave n't crippled their ability to collect data .
If the duststorms have not impacted a microscope - like camera on Opportunity 's robotic arm , mission managers will use it to inspect a crucial mast - mounted mirror .
The mirrorreflects infrared light into the rover 's Miniature Thermal EmissionSpectrometer ( Mini - TES ) , allowing scientists to determine the minerals presenton the martian surface .
Some data from the spectrometer 's last use hinted thatthe mirror , which can also swivel to cover a mast opening as a dust guard , maynot be moving properly .
" Itwould be the first permanent loss of an instrument on either rover , " saidrover science principal investigator Steven Squyres , of Cornell University inIthaca , N.Y .
" But we 'll see . "
The dust woes of Opportunity and Spirit began in late June , when astronomers spottedgrowing dust storms on the red planet 's surface .
The storms swelled to blotout much of the sunlight on the planet 's surface , leading some mission managersto worry that the solar - powered rovers could starve from lack adequate energysupplies .
By lateAugust , the storms had subsided enoughto allow Opportunity and Spirit to once more explore Mars .
Opportunity , which weathered the storms while perched on the rim of Victoria , resumed preparations to enterthe crater .
All - weatherrovers
Originallyslated to spend three Earth months exploring Mars , Spirit and Opportunity arenow in their fourth year of red planet roving .
The two robots have uncoveredevidence of the planet 's ancient watery past , scaled hills and studied amartian meteorite among their manyscientific exploits .
While dustis still settling from Mars ' recent storms , wind gusts have been aidingOpportunity ?s recovery by blowing away dust particles from its solar arraysalmost as fast as they are deposited , mission managers said .
" Theserovers are tough , " said Alan Stern , NASA 's associate administrator forscience missions , in a Friday statement .
" They faced dusty winds , powerstarvation and other challenges -- and survived . "
Sept. 2 , 2007  --
School begins again , and we read more about the intrusion of pseudoscience into school science curricula in this country , particularly into the study of biology and evolution .
The motive , despite the claims of proponents of intelligent design and other bogus " disciplines , " has been religious .
Although some of the creation scientists ' arguments presented have a probabilistic flavor , the mathematics curriculum has seemed somewhat resistant to this trend .
Recently a number of readers have sent me course descriptions from various schools that suggest otherwise , however .
The issue is complicated ( perhaps too complicated for a column ) , but I 'll also briefly discuss the relevance of evolution to a more defensible , but still flawed argument relating religion and mathematics .
Religion in the Math Curriculum
Consider first a Baptist school in Texas whose description of a geometry course begins :
Students will examine the nature of God as they progress in their understanding of mathematics .
Students will understand the absolute consistency of mathematical principles and know that God was the inventor of that consistency .
They will see God 's nature revealed in the order and precision they review foundational concepts while being able to demonstrate geometric thinking and spatial reasoning .
The study of the basics of geometry through making and testing conjectures regarding mathematical and real - world patterns will allow the students to understand the absolute consistency of God as seen in the geometric principles he created .
I wonder if the school teaches that non-Euclidean geometry is the work of the devil or at least of non-Christians .
The Web site 's account goes on like this for a while and then is followed by similar descriptions for algebra and pre-calculus .
The blurb for the calculus course states :
Students will examine the nature of God as they progress in their understanding of mathematics .
Students will understand the absolute consistency of mathematical principles and know that God was the inventor of that consistency .
Mathematical study will result in a greater appreciation of God and His works in creation .
The students will understand the basic ideas of both differential and integral calculus and its importance and historical applications .
The students will recognize that God created our minds to be able to see that the universe can be calculated by mental methods .
I do n't know what books this particular school uses , but I should mention such risible texts such as " Precalculus for Christian Schools . "
The latter attempts to draw parallels between the fundamental theorem of calculus and the fundamentals of Christianity , between infinity and life after death , et cetera .
Everyone 's heard of church schools and Madrassas , but another example of this phenomenon from a quite different religious perspective is the Maharishi University in Iowa , whose course titles and descriptions are similarly bizarre .
Here are some on their Web site :
Infinity : From the Empty Set to the Boundless Universe of All Sets -- Exploring the Full Range of Mathematics and Seeing its Source in Your Self
Intermediate Algebra : Using Variables to Manage the Total Possibility of Numbers and Solve Practical Problems
Its New Age calculus sequence is described thus :
Calculus 1 : Derivatives as the Mathematics of Transcending , Used to Handle Changing Quantities
Calculus 2 : Integrals as the Mathematics of Unification , Used to Handle Wholeness
Calculus 3 : Unified Management of Change in All Possible Directions
Calculus 4 : Locating Silence within Dynamism
Evolution , a Counterargument to the Divine Nature of Mathematics
Of course , there are more sophisticated ideas that are vaguely similar , and there have been first - rate scientists who have taken mathematics to be some sort of divine manifestation .
One of the most well - known such arguments is due to physicist Eugene Wigner .
In his famous 1960 paper , " The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences , " he maintained that ability of mathematics to describe and predict the physical world is no accident , but rather is evidence of a deep and mysterious harmony .
But is the usefulness of mathematics really so mysterious ?
There is a quite compelling alternative explanation why mathematics is so useful .
We count , we measure , we employ basic logic , and these activities are stimulated by ubiquitous aspects of the physical world .
The size of a collection ( of stones , grapes , animals ) , for example , is associated with the size of a number and keeping track of it leads to counting .
Putting collections together is associated with adding numbers , and so on .
Another metaphor associates the familiar realm of measuring sticks ( small branches , say , or pieces of string ) with the more abstract one of geometry ,
The length of a stick is associated with the size of a number ( once some segment is associated with the number one ) , and relations between the numbers associated with a triangle , say , are noted .
( Scores of such metaphors underlying more advanced mathematical disciplines have been developed by linguist George Lakoff and psychologist Rafael Nunez in their book , " Where Mathematics Comes From . " )
Once part of human practice , these various notions are abstracted , idealized and formalized to create basic mathematics , and the deductive nature of mathematics then makes this formalization useful in realms to which it is only indirectly related .
The universe acts on us , we adapt to it , and the notions that we develop as a result , including the mathematical ones , are in a sense taught us by the universe .
That great bugbear of creationists , evolution has selected those of our ancestors ( both human and not ) whose behavior and thought are consistent with the workings of the universe .
The usefulness of mathematics is thus not so unreasonable .
There are , of course , many other views of mathematics ( Platonism , formalism , et cetera ) , but whatever one 's philosophy of the subject , the curricula cited above and others like them are a bit absurd , even funny .
In private schools they 're none of our business .
This is not so if aspects of these " creation math " curricula slip into the public schools , a prospect no doubt devoutly wished for by some .
John Allen Paulos , a professor of mathematics at Temple University , is the author of the bestsellers " Innumeracy " and " A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper , " as well as of the forthcoming ( in December ) " Irreligion . "
His " Who 's Counting ? " column on ABCNews.com appears the first weekend of every month .
Fluorescent lights that flicker imperceptibly are used in up to 80 % of classrooms due to misguided policy moves , the study of 90 classrooms said .
These should be replaced with higher frequency light bulbs or turned off - with natural light used instead , an education conference in London heard .
Poor classroom design and the position of equipment could also add to glare .
The findings could also help to explain why some children found reading easier when they use coloured overlays on top of books to reduce the brightness of the page , the study by a team fom the universities of Cambridge and Essex said .
We found that neither artificial light nor daylight could be adequately controlled
Dr Mark Winterbottom
The researchers measured the flicker and lighting levels in 90 classrooms at 11 secondary schools in six local authority areas .
They claimed that nine out of 10 classrooms were excessively bright .
Dr Mark Winterbottom said : " We found that neither artificial light nor daylight could be adequately controlled due to classroom design , positioning of equipment , and the poor state of Venetian blinds .
" A quarter of classrooms did not have blinds , and in half of those that did , blinds were either broken or at least one was missing . "
' Safety advice '
He added that wall - mounted white boards and ceiling mounted projectors were also directing excessively bright light into pupils ' eyes .
" Wherever possible , such boards should be tilted so that such reflected glare is directed towards the ceiling , " he said .
A spokesman for the Department for Children , Schools and Families pointed out there was very comprehensive guidance on lighting and classroom design on its websites for teachers .
" These outline simple measures to take to ensure that equipment is being used appropriately and safely .
In addition , guidance material has been distributed to all local authorities . "
The research was presented at the annual conference of the British Educational Research Association at the Institute of Education in London .
Half a step forward , two steps back : after hiring an interim president recently , the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine is losing its chief scientific officer , Arlene Y. Chiu .
She 'll step down at the end of October " to return to her home in Los Angeles , " and continue consulting for the institute for at least six months .
She said in a press release :
I joined the CIRM with twin goals : move stem cell research forward in an environment where funding was difficult , and work with Dr. Zach Hall to build a new granting agency .
Both goals have been met .
With the end of the litigation that delayed our funding , CIRM enters a new phase , as do I .
It ’s a good time to return to my Los Angeles home and pursue new professional directions .
After I leave my day - to - day responsibilities , I have committed to working with Dr. Murphy to continue building on the CIRM ’s scientific momentum , by recruiting new additions to our scientific team and developing a strong scientific agenda for 2008 .
Insiders suspect
Chiu 's resignation is at least partly related to frustration over the difficulty the agency has had in finding a permanent president .
After an unsuccessful seven - month search for a permanent replacement for former president Zach Hall , CIRM hired Richard Murphy as interim president earlier this month .
UPDATE : Dale Carson , the communications director at CIRM just sent a statement from Zach Hall that makes it even more clear what a big loss Chiu is :
Having grown up in a Communist country , I was always curious about capitalism .
The Communist propaganda was very critical of capitalism , which made those of us who had never experienced it think that capitalism had to be a very good thing .
After all , we hated communism , and certainly rightly so .
What we did not realize at the time was that we really hated communism because of its dictatorial nature , not because of economy .
Our freedoms were severely restricted , and that was bad .
It really was .
But because of that , we hated everything about communism , including the good things that we did not even realize we had , at least not until the brief period of socialism with a human face .
At any rate , I have to say that after spending close to two decades in the capitalism as lived in the US , I have found capitalism not a good thing .
I love the freedom of the US .
But I have to say , if I were young and knew what I know now , I would choose a different country .
I would be looking for a country with freedom , that is an absolute must .
But I would also look for a country that gives a hoot about its citizens .
For a country that emphasizes the individual , I am shocked how little an individual means in the US economic and political system :
All you hear about is what is good for " business " .
The theory behind capitalism is that it presumably gives everyone equal opportunity .
This is not true in my experience .
For one , not everyone has the same talents and gifts .
Besides , the educational system seems deliberately designed not to teach you how to make it in the capitalist society .
Good education is no guarantee of economic success .
When I lost my job as a programmer in Pittsburgh almost a decade ago , I could not find employment because I was " overqualified " .
What kind of nonsense is that ?
How can I be overqualified ?
I either can do my job or I cannot .
I finally got a job as a food packer in a warehouse of a company that owned many vending machines in the Pittsburgh area .
It did not bother them that I could do other things .
I truly liked the company , though , of course , I was paid a lot less than back when I was a programmer .
Then I moved to Wisconsin .
Ever since then I have been working the most menial jobs you can imagine :
For a while I was even sorting through other people 's garbage in a recycling plant .
No one needs a programmer in the town I live in .
Of course , I continued programming .
I wrote many a program , I have taught many people how to program through my web sites .
I receive messages from people all over the world thanking me for my contribution .
Yet , I often can not afford to eat .
My current employer has just decided to cut my hours to two days a week , after I have worked there for five years .
So much for opportunity .
Where does this leave me ?
I guess I have to learn to live in a society motivated by greed , something that is totally foreign to me .
I have to market my software instead of giving it away .
Ironically , when I started marketing a piece of sotware I wrote , someone quickly released a password generator for it .
I contacted him , and he was surprised who I was :
He learned assembly language from me !
He removed the password generator from his site , but damage was already done .
I have seen people arguing for capitalism saying that it motivates creativity .
I say it does not .
I say it kills creativity .
Just consider my own field : Software engineering .
Who gets rich here ?
Not the creative programmers who write quality software , but companies that create mediocre software .
In a less capitalist society where you are guaranteed that your basic needs are met you are free to be creative , you are free to create your best .
But under capitalism you have to spend so much personal energy to just survive that you have little left to create .
I am not interested in money markets .
I am not interested in stocks , bonds , mutual funds , and similar things .
Yet , I spent considerable amount of time learning about them .
Out of necessity .
I really wish I could spend more time writing quality software than worrying about survival .
That is why , if I could do it all over again , I would go to a less capitalist country .
We live in the era of specialists .
I find it silly that in the US we do not have specialists whose job it is to make sure everyone in the country is economically independent .
I feel I am not truly free if I am stuck living in a small town driving an old car .
Please understand , I have nothing against small towns .
I just would like to have the freedom of moving elsewhere now .
But because I cannot afford it , I do not have that freedom .
And because I am getting older , and my health is failing ( I have diabetes and cannot even afford proper diet ) , quite frankly , I fear I will die in this town , and I will die years before I would if I still lived under socialism .
And that is why I find capitalism quite disappointing .
WHEN it comes to computing power , the gap between Africa and the broadband world is still a Grand Canyon .
Only 4 % of Africans have access to the internet .
They pay the most in the world , around $ 250-300 a month , for the slowest connection speeds .
E-commerce barely exists .
Nigeria 's 140 m - odd people have but a few hundred decently trafficked websites in their domain .
Blogging is a vibrant but peripheral activity .
If sub -Saharan Africa were scaled according to its available internet connectivity , it would be about the size of Ireland .
Of its 48 countries , the 28 in central and eastern Africa are connected to the web by only the flimsiest of satellite technology .
Apart from the occasional internet hook - up at a diamond mine or UN camp , whole regions of Congo and Sudan , sub -Saharan Africa 's two largest countries , have no connection at all .
Even countries like Uganda , which are go - ahead about the internet , start from a very low base .
Research by Microsoft found only one in 200 Ugandans regularly uses e-mail .
The number is higher in west Africa , where the more robust SAT - 3 undersea cable provides for higher speeds and lower costs .
The Eastern Africa Submarine Cable System , better known as EASSY , which runs 9,900 km ( 6,152 miles ) along the Indian Ocean floor from South Africa to Sudan , is meant to speed up connections in east and central Africa in the next few years but is not yet operating .
African users must also cope with obsolete systems , irregular electricity and a stultifying lack of local content .
Interfaces are being written in a number of African languages , but even the clearest instructions in Wolof or Yoruba as to how to use Windows presume a fair degree of literacy .
Then there is the high graphical content of the rich world 's web : videos and social networking are unworkable in the snail - slow dial - up offered in most African internet cafés .
All of this would be worse for Africans if state telecom monopolies had kept their grip .
But fortunately they have been cast aside by leaner and more transparent mobile - phone companies , which the World Bank says may have poured $ 25 billion into Africa in the past ten years .
The continent remains an enormous investment prospect , not least in internet offerings .
A UN call in 2005 for “ digital solidarity ” has so far amounted to little .
A big conference called Africa Connect , to be held in Rwanda later this month , is meant to give a boost .
It says it will be “ pure business ” , not charity .
African governments will face pressure , from the World Bank and the African Development Bank among others , to slash red tape and encourage technology firms in the hope of cutting the cost of going online by two - thirds and getting ministries , hospitals and schools onto the internet by 2012 .
In my previous article Architecting for Deployability , I wrote about the importance of deployability - how reliably and easily software can be deployed from development into the production environment .
To accomplish this , one approach I recommended was to encapsulate differences between environments to isolate them from the majority of the application , and thus simplify deployment .
This is assuming , of course , that these differences cannot be eliminated .
The technology ( language and platform ) you are using and the type of environmental difference you need to deal with will influence the specific techniques available to manage the difference .
Differences between environments that you are likely to encounter are :
Database connections
Third - party service connections ( i.e. for a web service , or naming service )
Logging settings
Performance tuning settings ( i.e. database storage options )
Security settings ( i.e. user ids , passwords )
Directory paths ( i.e. for installed programs or libraries )
Based on my experience , there are three design approaches to dealing with these environmental differences .
They are discussed below in the order in which I feel they should be used : i.e. only use the second approach if the first does not work out , and only use the third when the first two approaches are not appropriate .
Use support provided by the platform - but only when it makes sense
The platform you are basing your development on - whether an application server , operating system , or set of language libraries - may have built - in support for dealing with certain environmental differences .
Rather than building your own solution ( which the other two approaches cover ) , it is often easiest to use the provided functionality .
I have a number of examples involving a variety of platforms , including an example that shows why you should not necessarily use the built - in support if it has been badly designed .
The Java Enterprise Edition ( Java EE ) platform provides several options for dealing with environmental differences .
One of the essential pieces is JNDI - the Java Naming and Directory Interface , which provides an environmentally - neutral way to lookup basically anything , ranging from simple strings to fully configured services .
JNDI works great for looking up a DataSource as per the following sample code :
Context rootContext = new InitialContext ( ) ; String jndiDataSourcePrefix = " java : / " ; // Varies by application server String dataSourceName = " myDataSource " ; DataSource dataSource = ( DataSource ) rootContext.lookup ( jndiDataSourcePrefix + dataSourceName ) ;
This not only hides the environment - specific details concerning the actual database connection , but also hides details concerning connection pooling which often vary between environments as well .
The specifics concerning the database connection and connection pooling are specified within the application server for each environment .
The code can therefore be promoted between environments without change .
Java EE also allows for simple strings to be stored in JNDI essentially like environment variables .
The retrieval of these values is much like the retrieval of a DataSource as the following code shows :
Context rootContext = new InitialContext ( ) ; Context envContext = ( Context ) rootContext.lookup ( " java:comp/env " ) ; String supportEmail = ( String ) envContext.lookup ( " support.email " ) ;
Unfortunately , this approach is not well suited to handling environmental differences .
The values for such variables are specified in the deployment descriptor - ejb - jar.xml for EJBs or web.xml for web applications - as shown below :
< env-entry > < description > Support Email Address </ description > < env-entry - name>support.email</env-entry-name > < env-entry - type>java.lang.String</env-entry-type> < env-entry - value>support@company.com </env-entry-value >
</env-entry >
The problem is that the deployment descriptor also contains important configuration information that does not vary per environment .
Worse , the deployment descriptor file is bundled into the EJB jar file or WAR file for deployment .
So how exactly can you specify different values for environment variables , without complicating your deployment process ?
You cannot .
The deployment descriptor represents a good idea but a flawed design .
The creators of the Java EE specification envisioned multiple roles , including not just a developer role , but also an application assembler role and a deployer role .
The idea was that the developer could specify the default value for the environment variable , and it could be overridden by either the assembler or deployer .
However , the specification does not specify an easy way to do this override , and implies that the assembler or deployer would have to directly modify the deployment descriptor or use the proprietary administration interface of the application server as is necessary for configuring datasources and connection pools .
The other flaw with this design is the idea of these separate roles .
In practice , the developers are also the assemblers and often the deployers as well .
When there are separate individuals doing the deployment , they typically know nothing about the application and could only override settings based on instructions provided by the developers .
The Java EE platform provides good support for data sources , but other types of environmental differences are really not supported well .
I recommend not using the environment variable mechanism provided in Java EE , as it does not address the requirement of easily deployable software .
My next example involves Ruby on Rails , a web application framework for the Ruby language that has been receiving a lot of attention and hype in the last few years .
One of the attractions of Rails is that it provides built - in support for many of the common features of web applications , including handling of environmental differences .
Rails explicitly defines the notion of an environment via the RAILS_ENV environment variable , and even comes pre-configured with three : development , test , and production .
Specifying environment - specific settings is extremely simple .
There is a common file shared between environments ( config / environment.rb ) , and one configuration file per environment ( config / environments / < env >.rb ) .
Since the configuration files are Ruby scripts , any type of setup can be done - you are not limited as in the case of Java EE deployment descriptor XML files .
Rails is a clear winner over Java EE when it comes to deployability for multiple environments .
Parameterize and lookup differences by environment
If the platform you are using does not provide the support you need for multiple environments , then the next design approach is to implement your own support for multiple environments within the platform .
While the specific mechanisms can vary , conceptually such support requires a parameter representing the environment ( like the RAILS_ENV environment variable ) , and a lookup mechanism to retrieve environment - specific values based on this parameter ( like the config / environments / *.rb files in Rails ) .
The lookup mechanism can be as simple as settings in a property file named after the environment , or can involve properties in a database table keyed by the environment .
A more sophisticated mechanism is to use a configuration interface with a factory to create the appropriate environment - specific subclass based on the environment .
This allows for any type of setup to be implemented , rather than being limited to strings or other primitive types .
The catch with using this approach is that the parameter representing the environment must be handled using whatever support the platform provides for dealing with environmental differences .
For a Java EE application this is not a big deal - there are several different options I have used .
One approach is to store the environment in a special database table .
Since Java EE handles the data source fine , the code can retrieve the data source and then query the environment table to determine the environment .
Another approach is to use a Java system property or even an environment variable like Rails does .
A third approach I have used is to have an environment specific directory ( i.e. config / prod / ) holding one or more property files or other resources .
The classpath is defined within each application server to include the appropriate environment - specific directory .
The code simply loads the property files or other resources from the classpath , which resolves correctly to the desired version of the files .
This works especially well for log4j configuration files .
For platforms that provide absolutely no support for handling environmental differences , this design approach will not work .
That is when the third approach becomes useful .
Generate per environment
This design approach is most appropriate when the platform provides no support for handling environmental differences .
The most common example of this I have encountered is database DDL statements , which can have environment - specific storage settings but do not support variables that would allow one to parameterize these settings .
If you want to fully script database changes , then it is necessary to have these DDL scripts be environmentally neutral .
The solution is to use file generation to produce a different version of the script for each environment from a template using the appropriate values to substitute into the template for each environment .
I provide a software utility called EnvGen on my Software page that performs environment - specific file generation .
EnvGen is an Ant task for generating different versions of the same file parameterized for different environments ( i.e. development , test , and production ) .
File generation is done using FreeMarker , a template engine with a full - featured templating language .
You specify environment - specific properties in a CSV file ( comma separated value spreadsheet ) .
You can read more about EnvGen in the EnvGen Release Documentation .
For all of these approaches , no matter what language or platform you are using , the underlying concept remains the same : separate the settings and code that changes across environments from that which remains the same to achieve the goal of reliably and easily promoting the code into the production environment .

With Apple 's announcement Monday that it shipped 1.12 million iPhones in the three months after its launch , the gadget 's apparent popularity rivals some PCs .
That has security experts warning of trouble , following revelations that Apple built the iPhone 's firmware on the same flawed security model that took rival Microsoft a decade to eliminate from Windows .
" It really is an example of ' those who do n't learn from history are condemned to repeat it ' , " says Dan Geer , vice president and chief scientist at security firm Verdasys .
It was n't long after Apple released the iPhone in June that researchers discovered that every application on the device – from the calculator on up – runs as " root , " i.e. , with full system privileges .
As a result , a serious vulnerability in any of these applications would allow hackers to gain complete control of the device .
The same problem in Windows played a big role in stoking a plague of internet malware - production that began with the Melissa virus in 1999 , and continues with the malicious Storm worm today .
With the limited bandwidth of the iPhone , malicious code would be unlikely to slow portions of the internet .
But malware could wreak creative havoc of a different kind .
It might , for example , cause a phone to call numbers without the user 's knowledge , seize text messages and a list of received and sent calls , turn the phone into a listening device , track the user 's location through nearby WiFi access points , or instruct the phone to snap photos of the user 's surroundings – including any companions who may be in view of the camera lens .
Apple announced last week that it plans to release a software - development kit in February , to open the way for third - party developers to create applications for the iPhone .
More applications , though , invariably means more attack routes for hackers .
Apple CEO
Steve Jobs said in his announcement that the company was taking time to release the SDK to deal with security issues , suggesting that a future operating system update to the phone might only run applications approved and digitally signed by Apple .
But this would n't solve all of the security problems .
" As long as everything runs as root , there are going to be bugs and people are going to find them ( to take over the device ) , " says Charlie Miller , principal security analyst for Independent Security Evaluators , who , with colleagues , discovered the first reported bug with the iPhone earlier this year .
The bug , found in its Safari browser , would have allowed hackers to take control of a phone .
The researchers criticized Apple in their paper ( .pdf ) for designing iPhone applications to run as root .
Although Apple issued a fix for the Safari vulnerability in July , the company never responded to criticism about the root problem with its phones .
Apple also did n't respond to calls from Wired News for this story .
Last week , H.D. Moore , a security researcher who developed the Metasploit Framework security and hacking tool , posted information on his blog about a vulnerability in the iPhone 's tiff library that is used by the phone 's e-mail , browser and music software .
He also supplied detailed instructions on how to write code to exploit the bug and provided an exploit to gain remote control of an iPhone .
Computer security professionals call the iPhone design flaw a fundamental mistake , and say that Apple should have known better .
" The principle of ' least privilege ' is a fundamental security principle , " says Geer .
" Best practices say that if you need minimal authority to do ( something on a system ) , then you do n't need to have more authority than that to get it done . "
Microsoft has been roundly criticized for years for releasing early versions of its Windows operating system with administrative privileges automatically enabled .
This gave hackers who gained access to Windows machines complete privileges to modify the operating system and take control of the machine .
It took a while for the company to get the message , but Redmond finally closed the hole with its Vista operating system this year , which included a User Account Control feature to control the level of privileges required for various functions on a Vista machine .
" I guess Apple had n't learned those lessons and is now going to learn them the hard way , " says Geer .
Miller says that Apple will need to redesign the entire firmware to fix the problem – which would require owners to install a pretty hefty update .
" If you start from the beginning with security in mind and you design your product thinking about security as you go , it 's not really any harder to design a secure product than an insecure product , " he says .
" Once you 've already got it out in everyone 's hands , it 's a little harder to go back and add security .
And that 's really what they need to do at this point . "

Apple 's Not ' Bricking ' Hacked IPhones for Revenge
The Perils of Taking the IPhone Mainstream
RDX is a common military explosive , and it ’s dangerous not just because it explodes - it ’s also toxic .
Places where RDX is used , produced , or stored often present a serious hazardous waste problem , such at the Massachusetts Military Reservation on Cape Cod , where the local aquifer has been contaminated with RDX .
A group of researchers from the University of York in the UK and Canada ’s Biotechnology Research Institute have shown how it might be possible to clean up RDX with explosives - eating transgenic plants .
Plants that use man-made explosives as a nitrogen source are not so easy to find in nature .
In this case , the researchers genetically engineered two key bacterial proteins into the thale cress Arabidopsis thaliana .
Plants that produce these proteins are able to take up RDX from soil and metabolize it .
But how did these researchers find such useful bacterial proteins ?
The answer is that they searched in the obvious place - contaminated soil where bacteria that metabolize explosives are likely to evolve .
Bacteria reproduce extremely quickly and live in fairly large populations , thus it is not uncommon for a bacterium with just the right mutation to turn up and outcompete its peers in a new environment .
The researchers found a bacterial strain ofthat was able to use RDX as its sole nitrogen source .
Explosives are nitrogen - rich compounds , so this bacterial strain has evolved to take advantage of an abundant nutrient in its environment .
And it turns out that not many mutational changes were required to make this strain ofan explosives - eater .
All organisms contain many versions of a versatile class of electron - shuttling proteins called .
This class of proteins is involved in some of the most sophisticated chemistry in the cell , including the synthesis of steroids and various vitamins .
These cytochromes have been tweaked by evolution to perform an astounding range of chemical jobs .
The explosives - degradingharbors a variant cytochrome P450 that is able to break an N - NO2 bond , something rarely encountered in nature but present in RDX .
Once they had the bacterial gene in hand , the researchers attempted to express it in the Arabidopsis plant .
Since the plant itself has plenty of cytochrome P450s , it was easily able to properly synthesize the bacterial version in quantities large enough to start metabolizing RDX from the soil .
This was a straightforward use of evolution and biochemistry to create a useful genetically engineered organism .
It 's possible that this approach could be successful a range of environmental problems .
Given the chemical sophistication and diversity of the metabolic pathways found in nature , the chances of finding a solution to other pollution problems like this one are good .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. broadcaster CBS settled its termination dispute with fired radio shock jock Don Imus on Tuesday , a possible step toward Imus reviving his multimillion - dollar career with a rival broadcaster .
Radio talk - show host Don Imus ( L ) speaks with Rev. Al Sharpton during Sharpton 's radio show , in New York , April 9 , 2007 .
CBS has settled its termination dispute with the fired shock jock , a company spokesman said on Tuesday .
REUTERS / Chip East
Imus was fired in April after referring to a mostly black university women ’s basketball team as “ nappy - headed hos , ” a racial slur that generated a storm of controversy and led CBS Radio to cancel his “ Imus in the Morning ” show .
“ Don Imus and CBS Radio have mutually agreed to settle claims that each had against the other regarding the Imus radio program on CBS .
The terms of the settlement are confidential and will not be disclosed , ” CBS and Imus ’s lawyer said in a joint statement .
The Imus show was produced and broadcast by CBS - owned WFAN radio station in New York and syndicated on some 60 stations across the country .
The show was also simulcast on cable television ’s MSNBC .
CBS and MSNBC first suspended Imus ’s show for two weeks in April , but as calls to fire Imus grew , notably from New York civil rights leader Al Sharpton , MSNBC canceled the Imus show and CBS did so the next day .
“ Nappy ” is an antiquated term referring to coarse , curly hair and “ ho ” is slang for whore .
WFAN announced on Tuesday that Imus ’s old morning time slot was being taken over by former NFL quarterback Boomer Esiason and talk radio host Craig Carton .
Imus had threatened to sue CBS for $ 120 million for breach of contract through his famed lawyer , Martin Garbus , who once represented politically incorrect comedian Lenny Bruce in the 1960s .
Garbus would only confirm a settlement had been reached , offering no other comment .
The Drudge Report Web site reported Imus would receive $ 20 million .
CBS shares fell nearly 4 percent to close at $ 29.81 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday .
WHERE NEXT FOR IMUS ?
With the settlement done , focus shifted to who might hire Imus , who was on a 5 - year , $ 40 million contract when fired .
Unconfirmed media reports have mentioned Sirius Satellite Radio and New York radio station WABC , which is owned by Citadel Broadcasting , as possible suitors .
But Steve Borneman , the general manager at WABC , said no one at WABC , Citadel nor ABC had been in talks with Imus .
“ I wish Mr. Imus well , but we are happy with our morning show ( hosted by Curtis Sliwa and Ron Kuby ) , ” Borneman said .
A Sirius spokesman declined comment on Tuesday , but CEO Mel Karmazin , a former top executive at CBS , told Fox News Channel last week : “ The fact that he had been fired would n’t stop me from having Don work for me again .
He makes you a lot of money . ”
Despite the negative publicity , Imus is capable of generating tens of millions of dollars in advertising revenue a year through high ratings , experts say .
“ If someone is in negotiations with him , they have done enough due diligence with their advertisers to know revenues will increase and advertisers will support it , ” said employment and entertainment lawyer Barry Peek , a partner in the law firm Meyer , Suozzi , English & Klein , P.C .
“ I would think it ’s going to be quick , ” Peek said of an Imus comeback .
“ For Imus , time is of the essence .
Out of sight , out of mind . ”
In any case , Sharpton said he would be watching .
“ Wherever he resurfaces , we at National Action Network and other groups will be watching and monitoring him , ” Sharpton said in a statement .
“ Mr. Imus has the right to work but we have the right to make sure that this repeat offender does not return and continue what he has done historically . ”
Skype 's
Instant messaging client has once again been misused as a vector to spread malware .
The Pykse - A worm is spreading via Skype instant messages , posing as a chat message linking to a website featuring racy picture of a young , scantily - clad woman .
Clicking on these messages does display pics of a model wearing black lingerie , but only after an attempt has been made to infect PCs using a Trojan downloader that installs other items of malware .
Infected PCs spread the infection by sending a variety of short messages promoting soft - core smut to an infected user 's online friends using the Skype API .
The plausibility of the attack is increased because infected messages likely come from a target 's list of known contacts , though the abrupt dialogue it generates from infected machines might trigger a few alarm bells .
The malware sets the infected Skype user 's status to DND ( Do Not Disturb ) , another factor that might cause doubts about the authenticity of the bogus messages .
" Once it 's up and running , the Pykse worm attempts to connect to a number of remote websites , presumably in an attempt to generate advertising revenue for them by increasing their number of ' hits ' , " said Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant for Sophos .
The malware is far from the first to use Skype 's instant messaging client to spread .
None of these attacks have proved particularly successful in the past .
Anti-virus researchers reckon there 's nothing about Pykse that will make it any more prolific .
Most security firms consequently rate Pykse as a low risk threat . ®
Was am 11 .
September 2001 in New York und Washington passierte war ein inszenierter Angriff auf die Bevölkerung der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika .
Was seit März 2020 passiert ist ein inszenierter Angriff auf die Bevölkerung der ganzen Welt .
Die Fake - Pandemie ist die globale 9/11 - False - Flag .
Warum sage ich False - Flag und Fake - Pandemie ?
Im März haben sie uns erzählt , der Lockdown wäre notwendig , um die Corona - Kurve niedrig zu halten , damit die Spitäler nicht überrannt werden .
Sie wurden nicht überrannt und es gab keine erste Welle .
Was es gab war ein Mangel an Patienten , leere Betten und Kurzarbeit in den Spitälern .
Und jetzt , sie testen und finden Hunderttausende angeblich " positive " , was aber zu praktisch keinen Spitalaufenthalten führt .
Sie stellen die Infektionen in den Vordergrund , unterdrücken die Krankheits - und Todesfälle die zu Null tendieren .
Nur die Zahlen der Kranken und Toten sagen was aus und nicht die Zahl der Infizierten die nicht erkranken .
Sie merken gar nichts vom Virus , so wie die meisten von uns und " Super - Spreader " sind wir auch nicht .
Deshalb , eine zweite Welle wird es nicht geben .
Entweder war der befohlene Lockdown die grösste Fehldiagnose , Fehlentscheidung und Fehlalarm aller Zeiten oder sie haben bewusst ohne Grund einen Machtmissbrauch durchgezogen .
Egal was , es ist ein riesen Betrug , eine gross angelegte Täuschung und gigantische Lüge , was einen unermesslichen Schaden anrichtet hat .
Wir können den fast 20 - jährigen
Weg von 9/11 bis zur COVID - 19 - Pandemie anhand der Freiheiten und Rechte nachvollziehen , die wir auf diesem Weg verloren haben .
Der
Weg ist übersät mit den Trümmern unserer einstmals gepriesenen Freiheiten .
Es ist ein Weg zur Tyrannei geworden .
" Lass niemals eine Krise ungenutzt verstreichen " , hat Obamas Stabschef im Weissen Haus , Rahm Emanuel , 2009 gesagt und damit eine politische Taktik ausgesprochen , welche Regierungen schon immer angewendet haben , um ihre Macht zu erweitern und die Freiheiten einzuschränken .
Bundestagspräsident Wolfgang Schäuble ( CDU ) hat die Nutzung der Krise in einem Interview am 20 .
August bestätigt .
Die Corona - Krise sei eine grosse Chance was den EU - Superstaat betrifft , weil der Widerstand gegen Veränderungen in der Krise geringer werde .
" Wir können die Wirtschafts - und Finanzunion , die wir politisch bisher nicht zustande gebracht haben , jetzt hinbekommen " , erklärte er .
Und sie haben es getan , mit dem sogenannten 750 Milliarden Euro Hilfspaket gibt es die Haftungsunion , heisst , der deutsche Steuerzahler haftet für alle Schulden der EU - Mitgliedsländer , oder , Deutschland muss die Unfähigkeit , Misswirtschaft und Korruption der Südstaaten ausbaden .
Die freuen sich riesig , können sie doch jetzt ihre Schuldenwirtschaft ungehindert fortsetzen .
Die Politiker produzieren Krisen mit Angst und Schrecken , um dann ihre " Lösung " widerstandslos durchdrücken zu können .
Den Menschen sagt man , sie müssen ihre Freiheiten aufgegeben , damit der Staat für ihre Sicherheit sorgen kann .
Nur , dabei verliert man beides , Freiheit und Sicherheit .
Hitler hat es mit dem selbst inszenierten Reichstagsbrand getan und mit der Verabschiedung der Notstandsgesetze durch den Reichstag wurde er 1933 Diktator .
Nach 9/11 verabschiedete der Kongress den Patriot Act , Notstandsgesetze die den totalen Polizei - und Überwachungsstaat in den USA einführte .
Redefreiheit , das Recht zu protestieren , das Recht , Fehlverhalten der Regierung anzufechten , ein ordentliches Gerichtsverfahren , die Unschuldsvermutung , das Recht auf Selbstverteidigung , Rechenschaftspflicht und Transparenz in der Regierung , körperliche Unversehrtheit , all dies und mehr sind zu Opfern im andauernden Krieg der Regierung gegen das Volk geworden .
Was die letzten 20 Jahre bewiesen haben , ist , dass die US - Regierung und auch die aller anderen westlichen Industriestaaten , eine grössere Bedrohung für unsere individuellen und kollektiven Freiheiten und unsere nationale Sicherheit darstellt als jede terroristische , ausländische Bedrohung oder Pandemie .
Ich zitiere deshalb George Orwell : " Niemand ergreift jemals die Macht mit der Absicht , sie abzugeben .
Macht ist kein Mittel ; sie ist ein Zweck . "
Die COVID - 19 - Pandemie mit ihren Lockdown , Maskenpflicht , Überwachungen , Bespitzelung und der verschleierten Androhung von Zwangsimpfungen hat den Antidemokraten und Hassern der Freiheit die in allen Ländern lauern die Gelegenheit geboten , ihr wahres Gesicht zu zeigen .
Die Ratten sind hervorgekrochen und haben nach massiver Freiheitseinschränkung gerufen und sie ohne Widerstand in den Parlamenten durchgesetzt .
Die Grundrechte wurden mit einem Federstrich über Nacht mit der Ausrede des Infektionsschutzes ausser Kraft gesetzt .
Wer für die Grundrechte sich einsetzt und sich auf die Verfassung beruft ist ein Staatsfeind .
Wer aber für die Abschaffung der Rechte im eigenen Land ist , wird von oben gefeiert und gelobt .
Für BLM in den USA darf demonstriert werden , für Freiheit und gegen Diktatur in Deutschland nicht .
Die Werte sind völlig auf den Kopf gestellt .
Am 6 . Juni haben die Behörden in München eine Black Lives Matter Demo am Königsplatz mit mehr als 25'000 Teilnehmern genehmigt , ohne Abstandspflicht und Beschränkung der Teilnehmerzahl , obwohl damals die " Infektionsgefahr " viel höher war als heute .
Die selbe Behörde hat die Demo von " Querdenker 089 " unter dem Motto " Frieden , Freiheit und Gesundheit " für diesen Samstag verboten .
Die Stadt München erlaubt oder verbietet Demonstrationen je nach Gesinnung , abhängig ob der Staat sie gut oder schlecht findet , verordnet Auflagen oder keine , abhängig vom Veranstalter , was völlig rechtswidrig ist , denn vor dem Gesetz müssen alle gleichbehandelt werden .
( Update : Nur der Gang vor dem Bayerischen Verwaltungsgerichtshof hat eine Demo unter strengen Auflagen ermöglicht .
Eine Versammlung auf der Theresienwiese darf mit nur 1000 Teilnehmern stattfinden , ist aus Infektionsschutzgründen eingeschränkt . )
Wie nach 9/11 , wo die Medien mit Panikmache vor dem Phantom der Terroristen gewarnt haben , die überall und nirgends sind , wird jetzt vor einem Virus uns Angst gemacht , der , wenn überhaupt , nicht mehr als eine Grippe verursacht .
99 Prozent der Menschen passiert gar nichts .
Nach 9/11 wurden wir alle zu Terroristen erklärt .
Der " Krieg gegen den Terror " , den George W. Bush ausgerufen hat , wurde tatsächlich ein Krieg gegen uns alle , mit massiver Demontage unserer Rechte und Eingriff in die Privatsphäre .
In diesem Jahr sind wir alle Verbreiter des Virus , die man generell einsperren muss .
Früher wurden nur Kranke unter Quarantäne gestellt , für alle anderen ging das Leben normal weiter .
2020 passierte es mit uns allen , zu Hause einsperren , Abstand halten , Maske tragen , nicht mehr Arbeiten , kein normales Leben mehr führen , egal ob wir den Virus haben und krank sind oder nicht .
Es ist nicht zu glauben aber in Kanada , Australien und auch in Neuseeland werden sogenannte Quarantänebrecher verhaftet und in Internierungslager eingesperrt .
Die Behörden in Quebec City , Kanada , haben angekündigt , dass sie " unkooperative " Bürger in einer Coronavirus - Einrichtung isolieren werden , deren Standort geheim bleibt .
Dr. Jacques Girard , der die öffentliche Gesundheitsbehörde von Quebec City leitet , bestätigte bei einer Pressekonferenz , dass der Staat auch Menschen wegen Verletzung der Quarantäne zu Hause aufspürt und sie gewaltsam in die geheime Einrichtung bringt .
" Weil wir Menschen zu Hause isoliert haben .
Und dann sahen wir , dass die Person nicht zu Hause war .
Also gingen wir zu ihrer Wohnung und sagten ihnen dann , dass wir sie dort isolieren , wo wir sie haben wollen " , sagte Girard .
" Es sei darauf hingewiesen , dass nicht behauptet wird , dass jemand tatsächlich an dem Coronavirus erkrankt ist .
Aber der Staat hat die Macht , einen Bürger trotzdem in die Isolation zu zwingen " .
Das selbe soll mit den Menschen passieren , die sich nicht einer Zwangsimpfung unterziehen wollen .
Da sie als Volksschädlinge und Infektionsverbreiter deklariert werden , kann man sie aus " Sicherheitsgründen " einsperren , ihnen alle Rechte verweigern und ihre Kinder wegnehmen .
Ist euch nicht aufgefallen , dass die Antwort des Staates auf jedes Problem mehr Staat beinhaltet - entweder auf Kosten der Steuerzahler - oder weniger individuelle Freiheit ?
Von den " Terroranschlägen " 2001 über die Finanzkrise 2008 bis zur COVID - 19 - Pandemie 2020 , jede Krise - ob fabriziert oder anderweitig - ist zu einer Gelegenheit für die Regierungen geworden , ihre Reichweite und ihre Macht auf Kosten der Steuerzahler auszuweiten und gleichzeitig unsere Freiheiten auf Schritt und Tritt einzuschränken .
Das für mich fatale dabei ist , es gibt viele Menschen die das gut und richtig finden , die noch mehr Staat wollen .
Sie verteidigen die Diktatur sogar .
Besonders wollen sie mehr Gratisgeschenke , wollen den Sozialismus der sie voll versorgt .
Sie können mit Freiheit und Selbstverantwortung nichts anfangen .
Besonders jetzt in Europa ist der Virus des Sozialismus , des Kommunismus und Marxismus wegen der Wirtschafts - und Finanzkrise sich am ausbreiten .
Der Staat soll alles regeln , alles finanzieren und alle Pleitekandidaten retten , also Geld an die sterbenden Branchen und fürs Nichtstun verteilen .
Der Corona - Lockdown ist ja toll , weil man Zuhause sitzt .
Das missverstehen viele dann als Freiheit , weil man nicht mehr arbeiten muss und seinem " Hobby " nachgehen kann .
Aber wie Johann Wolfgang von Goethe sagte - " Niemand ist mehr Sklave , als der sich für frei hält , ohne es zu sein . "
Wie die Geschichte zeigt , bedeutet Sozialismus und Planwirtschaft nicht Wertvermehrung sondern Wertvernichtung , den Raub des Staates von Vorhandenen um es zu verteilen , bis es nichts mehr zu verteilen gibt .
Alle sozialistischen Gesellschaftsformen sind gescheitert , Gelddrucken hilft da nichts .
Denkt dran , ein Staat der gross genug ist , euch alles zu geben , was ihr wollt , ist ein Staat , der gross genug ist , euch alles zu nehmen , was ihr habt .
Sozialismus bedeutet , Gefangener in einem Gefängnis zu sein , mit Grundversorgung von drei Mahlzeiten und einem Bett , von sicheren Mauern umgeben .
Schon die DDR vergessen ?
Deshalb , wir stehen mit der Hygiene - Diktatur vor einer Entscheidung .
Wie ich schon oft geschrieben habe , 9/11 war ein Wasserscheideereignis , mit einer Zeit davor und einer danach .
Jetzt sind wir in einer gleichen Situation .
Nichts wird mehr so sein wie es war und schlimme Zeiten stehen bevor .
Wer nicht vorgesorgt hat wird die grösste aller Depressionen nicht überleben !!!
Glaubt
Ihr wirklich , sie werden ihre Macht die sich selber gegeben haben wieder aufgeben ?
Siehe Orwell oben .
Meint ihr , sie werden von Despoten zu Demokraten sich zurück verwandeln ?
Nein , sie werden immer neue Gründe finden den Notstand zu verlängern und zu einem Dauerzustand machen .
Entweder stehen wir auf und kämpfen für unsere Freiheit und Rechte , fegen die kriminelle Bande am Ruder weg , besinnen uns was eine demokratische Gesellschaft wirklich ist , stellen sie her und reduzieren den Staat auf ein Minimum , oder wir werden in noch mehr Sklaverei enden , die den ganzen Planeten zu einem Gefängnis macht .
Die Fake - Pandemie ist das globale 9/11 .
Am 29 .
August hat " JFK "s Neffe Robert Francis Kennedy Jr. in Berlin bei der Querdenker - Demo gesagt :
" Heute ist Berlin wieder die Front gegen Totalitarismus " .
Er erklärte genau das was ich in diesem Artikel beschreibe .
" Regierungen lieben Pandemien und sie lieben sie aus den gleichen Gründen wie sie den Krieg lieben - weil es sie in die Lage versetzt , Kontrollmechanismen zu installieren , die wir sonst niemals akzeptieren würden . "

Neunzehnhundertvierundachtzig ( 1956 ) — oder doch 2020 ?
Oct. 23 , 2007  --
When Ray Manygoats describes his childhood -- playing with marbles , messing around with his brother , visiting his father at work and grilling his family 's livestock -- one might mistake his stories for fond memories of growing up in the Navajo Nation .
But today , these memories are nothing more than evidence of the damage done to him and his family by uranium mining on Navajo lands during the Cold War , all part of an effort to provide the federal government with the uranium yellowcake it needed for nuclear weapons .
" We cooked on grills my father brought back from the mill .
These grills had been used to sift the yellowcake uranium , " Manygoats told Congress at a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on Tuesday .
" My brother Tommy and I would often bring lunch to my father at the mill .
Yellow stuff was always everywhere .
We would play in the yellowcake sand at the mill , jumping and rolling around in it .
We also found small metal balls at the mill .
The balls were used to crush and process the uranium .
We played marbles with them and had contests to see how far we could throw them . "
Living on Poisoned Land
It was n't until years later that the damage done became horrifyingly clear .
In his testimony to the committee , Manygoats blames the illnesses on uranium .
" Our land today is poisoned .
Today I am a man who has lost his health , his family and his ancestral way of life because of uranium , " he told the committee .
Manygoats described the devastating details of living on poisoned land .
" My father began to have trouble breathing , " he recounted .
" His breathing troubles never went away , even after the mill was closed .
I have always had problems with my ears and eyes .
I have had surgery three times to remove growths from my eyes and often have sores on my ears . "
Although no comprehensive study has ever been done on the health problems resulting from uranium mining in the Navajo nation , researchers believe that exposure to mining almost certainly triggered a dramatic rise in cancer among the Navajo .
Manygoats blamed the widespread illnesses among his family and his community on the uranium .
" Our land today is poisoned , " he told Congress .
" Today I am a man who has lost his health , his family , and his ancestral way of life because of uranium . "
Echoes of the Cold War
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , between 1944 and 1986 nearly 4 million tons of uranium ore were mined from the Navajo Nation , an area larger than the state of West Virginia , which occupies parts of Arizona , New Mexico and Utah .
These mines have since been shut down .
At present , the EPA says there are 520 abandoned uranium mines in the Navajo Nation , while the Southwest Research and Information Center estimates there may actually be as many as 1,200 abandoned mines and related sites on Navajo land .
Although the mines are no longer operational , Manygoats and other Navajos are upset that the surface and groundwater contamination from the mines continues to plague the Navajo population .
" My family 's land is poisoned , " says Manygoats .
" But no one helps us to remove the poison .
I am here on behalf of my community to ask for your help . "
George Arthur represented the Navajo Nation government at the hearing .
" Uranium mining and milling on and near the reservation has been a disaster for the Navajo people , " Arthur said .
" We are still undergoing what appears to be a never - ending federal experiment to see how much devastation can be endured by a people and a society from exposure to radiation in the air , in the water , in the mines , and on the surface of the land .
We are unwilling to be the subjects of that ongoing experiment any longer . "
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were outraged .
Committee chairman Henry Waxman , D - Calif. , called the government 's behavior " absolutely unacceptable " and a " modern American tragedy " .
Federal Government Defends Cleanup Efforts
Officials from various federal agencies also testified , highlighting their respective efforts to solve the problem .
Wayne Nastri of the Environmental Protection Agency cited an investigation of uranium mining areas on Navajo lands from 1994 to 2007 that built an inventory of the 520 abandoned sites , an inventory now being used by the Navajo Nation government to prioritize the mine sites .
Nastri said the EPA is taking action at sites that " present an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health or the environment " and providing a total of $ 3.9 million annually through 11 grant programs .
Nastri also added that over the last 16 years the EPA has provided $ 7.8 million for the Navajo Nation Superfund program , legislation that makes polluters pay for the remediation of toxic sites .
David Geiser of the Department of Energy noted that DOE has remediated four inactive uranium milling sites on Navajo land , including the Tuba City , Arizona mill at which Ray Manygoats ' father worked .
But many lawmakers were far from satisfied with the responses from the various officials .
Accusing the agency officials of having " a conspiracy of silence and do - nothingness " , Rep. Elijah Cummings , D - Mary . , demanded that they do better in the future .
" These are human beings they share this land with us , " Cummings said , " And it 's just not right .
And if there 's not more empathy for our fellow human beings , then maybe somebody 's got to replace you guys . "
The outrage of the lawmakers was matched by the sadness of the Navajo representatives .
Nuclear Waste's Effects Linger
Edith Hood still sees the remains of the uranium mining every morning .
" As I pray in the early morning dawn , there is a man -made mesa of radioactive and hazardous waste about a quarter of a mile northeast of my residence .
In the other direction , to the south about 1,000 feet away , is another mound of uranium mining waste , " Hood said .
Hood and her family have also experienced serious health problems .
" I was diagnosed with lymphoma in the summer of 2006 .
My father has a pulmonary fibrosis .
My mother was diagnosed with stomach cancer .
My grandmother and grandfather died of lung cancer .
Many of my family members and neighbors are sick , " she says .
Hood describes a community ravaged by uranium .
" Mining has already contaminated the water , the plants and the air .
People are sick and dying all around us , " she says .
Hood , Manygoats and other Navajo such as Phil Harrison , whose father died of lung cancer and whose brothers and sisters all have thyroid problems and disorders , want the government to take action .
" Assist my people and my land in recovering from the devastation caused by short - sighted and in some cases mean - spirited people who put their own private interests first and ignored the fact that their choices and decisions would result in an inhumane experiment being conducted on an indigenous people , " Harrison will tell the committee .
Harrison suffered kidney failure in 1999 , only to receive a kidney transplant from his sister .
" You have the power to change things , " Harrison told Congress .
" You have the power to end this tragic experiment . "
" It 's been about 25 years since the last mines closed , " Harrison concluded .
" My people should n't have to wait another 25 years for the federal government to accept a responsibility it should have accepted many years ago . "
ABC News ' Tom Shine contributed to this report .
Heiress Paris , missing for months , has reappeared back in the news , safe and sound , and protesting drunken elephants in India .
Elephants apparently get drunk on farmer 's rice beer and rampage local villages .
Ms. Hilton thinks that is not such a good idea .
Conservationists in India applaud her thoughts and Nobel Prize winner Al Gore , upon hearing of Paris ' pathetic pachyderm plight , chimed in with , " Drunken elephants are a major contributor to global warming . "
Paris herself said , " I know about being drunk and going on rampages ; I did that for years . "
It appears that the simple - minded star of Simple Life has latched on to a new globally important cause ; arresting elephants for DUI .
What do you do with a drunken elephant in India ?
Same as in Hollywood ; levy a fine , give it probation , and send it to rehab !

U.S. Army Sgt. Evan Vela spoke in a low voice Thursday at the court - martial for his fellow soldier .
Tears slid down the 23 - year - old ’s cheeks and the judge prompted him to talk louder .
On May 11 , Vela ’s sniper team had detained an Iraqi man near Jarf Sakhr , Vela testified .
Staff Sgt. Michael A. Hensley undid the ropes that had pinned the prisoner ’s arms and asked Vela whether he was ready , he said .
The dark - haired Idaho native told the court he was n’t sure what his superior meant at the time .
Vela said Hensley cradled the Iraqi ’s head , straightened his headdress , then moved away from Vela , who gripped a 9 - millimeter pistol .
“ I heard the word ‘ shoot . ’
I do n’t remember pulling the trigger .
I just came to and the guy was dead .
It took me a second to realize the shot came from the pistol in my hand , ” Vela said .

Vela is one of three soldiers from the same sniper team who are accused of premeditated murder in three shootings this spring .
Their cases have provided a picture of mentally exhausted troops and the role they allegedly played in a “ baiting program , ” in which snipers are believed to have planted fake weapons and bomb - making materials , then killed anyone who picked them up .
The alleged tactic was revealed in a hearing in July that eventually sent Hensley and Spc. Jorge G. Sandoval Jr. to face court - martial on murder charges .
The Pentagon refuses to speak publicly about baiting or other such tactics , but insists that military practices are within the law .
“ My client is no murderer .
He is a victim , ” said James Culp , Vela ’s civilian defense attorney , who suspects that baiting contributed to the slaying of the Iraqi man on May 11 .
“ The rules of engagement are difficult on the best day .
The rules for snipers are twice as difficult , ” Culp said .
“ You ca n’t expect to muddy the waters of the rules of engagement for snipers without consequences . ”

Vela made his surprise confession Thursday on the second day of Sandoval ’s court - martial on charges of murder , dereliction of duty and poor conduct .
Sandoval also faces murder charges in the shooting of another Iraqi man in the same region south of Baghdad ; he ’s accused of placing a detonation wire on the body .
Like Vela and Hensley , he faces a possible life sentence .
Vela , who was flown from a detention facility in Kuwait to testify in Sandoval ’s defense , told the court that Sandoval was standing guard at a nearby pump station at the moment of the Iraqi man ’s execution .
Vela has been promised that his statements in the Sandoval case wo n’t be used against him when he faces legal proceedings in connection with his alleged role in the slaying .
But Vela ’s first hearing has been delayed by his struggles with post - traumatic stress disorder .
He said he suffers flashbacks and hallucinations , and is taking antipsychotic and antidepressant medications

Vela ’s account Thursday portrayed a unit that had lost sleep and lost control .
In three days , he said , he had closed his eyes for less than four hours .
The mission , to watch the house of a suspected militant and to support nearby troop operations , started on May 8 , Vela said .
The terrain south of Baghdad near Jarf Sakhr is a mix of swamps , sewage - filled canals and tall grass .
The five men carried rucksacks , which they called “ sucks , ” weighing up to 150 pounds .
After two days , Vela said , one soldier was sent to the rear after twice receiving intravenous treatment for heat exhaustion .
Vela said he was in a daze the morning of May 11 .
He could n’t recall Thursday how the Iraqi had shown up where the troops were sleeping .
The man seemed to just materialize , he said .

Vela did n’t know what to do , so he woke up Sandoval , who told him to hold the man at gunpoint while Sandoval woke the others , Vela testified .
They placed the man on the ground and searched him , he said .
Hensley appeared agitated after waking up , and slammed his knee into the man ’s back , Vela said .
Then Hensley grabbed the man by the mouth and threatened to kill him , he said .
Hensley then strung the Iraqi ’s arms behind his back , and sent Sandoval and his colleague off to guard a pumping station nearby , he said .
Vela said he heard Hensley call his platoon commander on the radio and say he had seen a man running , carrying an automatic rifle .
A child wandered up to their camp , and Hensley briefly held the child on the ground , holding a poncho over his head , Vela said .
He eventually released the boy , who looked at the Iraqi man and called him “ father . ”
Then the boy fled .

Vela said he thought they were going to free the man , but Hensley called their platoon commander and said he saw a “ suspicious national ” moving toward their position .
Hensley then asked for permission to shoot to kill , Vela recalled .
“ At this point , I was really confused about what he was saying , ” Vela said .
The only other soldier on the scene was so exhausted that he slept through the commotion , Vela said .
Hensley then gave Vela the order to shoot the Iraqi , Vela said .

Once it was done , Vela testified , he watched Hensley grab an AK - 47 rifle from his backpack and place it beside the dying man .
Hensley radioed his captain and told him that they had engaged AIF , military jargon for firing on insurgents .
The Iraqi man convulsed .
Blood covered his face and beard .
“ Sgt. Hensley was kind of laughing about it .
He hit him in the throat and said shoot him again , which I did , ” Vela told the judge .
Addressing the court , Vela ’s voice dropped nearly to a whisper and his tears continued to stream , so the judge gave him a break .
Advertisement
The court called Sgt. 1st Class Tarrol Peterson , the man in charge of the U.S. Army sniper school in Fort Benning , Ga .
“ As snipers we look through a scope , we see a face , ” he said .
“ It ’s a lot different than shooting someone 100 meters away with an ordinary rifle .
When snipers break , they break bad . ”

1080 p vs 720 p ( 1080i ) .
Is 1080 p worth it ?
by Jack Burden , Senior Reviewer
The question I am most frequently asked about this resolution comparison is , " Should I get 1080 p resolution in my LCD Television ? "
There are a few obvious questions I ask in response :
What size is the TV ?
Do you have a Sony Playstation 3 or XBox 360 for gaming ( both consoles have 1080 p games and the PS3 is also a Blu Ray player ) ?
Do you have a Blu Ray player ?
Are you using it for professional editing ?
The question will usually be answered by the marketplace as 90 % of today 's TVs are 1080 p .
There are a few plasma and CFL backed LCDs still on the market , and these days they are generally of poorer quality and make .
One example is last years Panasonic X1 series plasma ( see review here ) .
We were disappointed with the black levels and contrast of this TV and it received a poor rating from us .
So recently , manufacturer 's are just introducing these 720 p resolution LCDs or plasmas as a cost savings measure that will be accompanied by many other cost savings techniques such as a poorer quality video processing chip set , and backlighting and phosphor quality in plasmas .
Therefore , our answer to this question has changed over the past couple of years and we no longer recommend purchasing a 720 p plasma or LCD .
The costs have come down so dramatically on 1080 p panels that it 's worth it to go ahead and opt for the higher resolution .
As far as the technology difference ; 720 p is an older but still used HD picture resolution which provides 720 progressive lines of resolution .
The specification for 720 p is actually 1280 X 720 lines of resolution .
1080P is what all HD programming aspires to be ( but is many times just 720 p or 1080i ) and the actual specification is 1920 X 1080 progressive lines of resolution .
1080 I resolution is 1920 X 1080 interlaced lines of resolution .
For all intents and purposes 1080 p is the prevalent resolution for TVs in the marketplace .
If your incoming signal is 1080 i or 720 p ( which cable broadcasts in many times ) then your TV will upscale the signal to the native resolution of the panel .
Likewise for a 720 p TV .
If the incoming signal source is 1080 p ( Blu Ray or prime time program ) then the TV will downscale the resolution to fit the 720 p screen size and pixel dimension .
Which looks better often is determined more by the signal source than by the resolution of the TV .
But purists will insist that a if the resolution of the incoming signal matches perfectly with the panel lines of resolution your picture will be better .
From our experience , this is not always the case as some TVs are superior to others in contrast , brightness , color rendition and other factors .
But regardless , in sum in today 's market I do not trust the 720 p resolution specification for TVs due to the cheapness of other facets of the manufacturer of the TV .
TOM BACHTELL
At first glance , next year ’s Presidential election looks like a blowout .
But it might not be .
Luckily for the incumbent party , neither George W. Bush nor Dick Cheney will be running ; indeed , the election of 2008 will be the first since 1952 without a sitting President or Vice - President on the ballot .
At the moment , survey research reflects a generic public preference for a Democratic victory next year .
Still , despite everything , there are nearly as many polls showing particular Republicans beating particular Democrats as vice versa .
So this election could be another close one .
If it is , the winner may turn out to have been chosen not on November 4 , 2008 , but five months earlier , on June 3rd .
Two weeks ago , one of the most important Republican lawyers in Sacramento quietly filed a ballot initiative that would end the practice of granting all fifty - five of California ’s electoral votes to the statewide winner .
Instead , it would award two of them to the statewide winner and the rest , one by one , to the winner in each congressional district .
Nineteen of the fifty - three districts are represented by Republicans , but Bush carried twenty - two districts in 2004 .
The bottom line is that the initiative , if passed , would spot the Republican ticket something in the neighborhood of twenty electoral votes — votes that it would n’t get under the rules prevailing in every other sizable state in the Union .
The Tuesday after the first Monday in June is California ’s traditional Primary Day .
But it ’s not the one that everybody will be paying attention to .
Five months ago , the legislature hastily moved the Presidential part up to February 5th , joining a stampede of states hoping to claim a piece of the early - state action previously reserved for Iowa and New Hampshire .
June 3rd will be an altogether sleepier , low - turnout affair .
There may be a few scattered contests for legislative nominations , but the only statewide items on the ballot will be initiatives .
More than two dozen have been filed so far , ranging from a proposal to start a state - run Internet poker site to pay for filling potholes to a redundant slew of anti-gay - marriage measures .
Few will make it to the ballot .
Many are not even intended to ; they ’re a feint in some byzantine negotiation , or just a cheap attempt to get a little attention — for a two - hundred - dollar fee , anyone can file one .
( Actually getting one on the ballot requires more than four hundred thousand signatures , and the outfits that collect them usually charge a dollar or two per signature . )
Initiative No. 07-0032 — the Presidential Election Reform Act — is different .
It ’s serious .
Its backers have access to serious money .
And it could pass .
Nominally , the sponsor of No. 07-0032 is Californians for Equal Representation .
But that ’s just a letterhead — there ’s no such organization .
Its address is the office suite of Bell , McAndrews & Hiltachk , the law firm for the California Republican Party , and its covering letter is signed by Thomas W. Hiltachk , the firm ’s managing partner and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s personal lawyer for election matters .
Hiltachk and his firm have been involved in many well - financed ballot initiatives before , including the recall that put Arnold in Sacramento .
They specialize in initiatives that are the opposite of what they sound like — the Fair Pay Workplace Flexibility
Act of 2006 , for example .
It would have raised the state minimum wage slightly — by a lesser amount than it has since been raised — and , in the fine print , would have made it impossible ever to raise it again except by a two - thirds vote in both houses of the legislature , while , for good measure , eliminating overtime for millions of workers .
“ Equal Representation ” sounds good , too .
And the winner - take - all rule , which is in force in all but two states , does seem unfair on the face of it .
( The two are Maine and Nebraska , which use congressional - district allocation .
But they are so small — only five districts between them — and so homogeneous that neither has ever split its electoral votes . )
It would be obviously unjust for a state to give all its legislative seats to the party that gets the most votes statewide .
So why should Party A get a hundred per cent of that state ’s electoral votes if forty per cent of its voters support Party B ?
No wonder Democrats and Republicans alike initially react to this proposal in a strongly positive way .
To most people , the electoral - college status quo feels intuitively wrong .
So does war .
But that does n’t make unilateral disarmament a no - brainer .
If California does what No. 07-0032 calls for while everybody else is still going with winner take all by state , the real - world result will be to give Party B ( in this case the Republicans ) an unearned , Ohio - size gift of electoral votes .
In a narrow sense , that ’s good if you like Party B , but not so good if you like Party A ( in this case the Democrats ) .
Or if you think that in a democracy everybody ought to play by roughly the same rules .
Nor , by the way , is Party B the only offender .
Last week , the Democratic - controlled legislature of North Carolina , a state that has gone Republican in every Presidential election since 1976 , enthusiastically took up a bill to do the same mischief as the California initiative .
The grab would be smaller — it would appropriate perhaps three or four of North Carolina ’s fifteen electoral votes for the Democrats — but the hands would be just as dirty .
The California initiative flunks even the categorical - imperative test .
Imagine , as a thought experiment , that all the states were to adopt this “ reform ” at once .
Electoral votes would still be winner take all , only by congressional district rather than by state .
Instead of ten battleground states and forty spectator states , we ’d have thirty - five battleground districts and four hundred spectator districts .
The red - blue map would be more mottled , and in some states more people might get to see campaign commercials , because media markets usually take in more than one district .
But congressional districts are as gerrymandered as human ingenuity and computer power can make them .
The electoral - vote result in ninety per cent of the country would still be a foregone conclusion , no matter how close the race .
California Initiative No. 07-0032 is an audacious power play packaged as a step forward for democratic fairness .
It ’s the lotusland equivalent of Tom DeLay ’s 2003 midterm redistricting in Texas , except with a sweeter smell , a better disguise , and larger stakes .
And the only way Californians will reject it is if they have a chance to think about it first . ♦
Senator seeks tax on pimps , prostitutes Grassley : ' It 's a no - brainer to have the IRS go after sex traffickers '
By Jonathan Schienberg
CNN
Sen . Charles Grassley , R - Iowa , says the tax code should be used to fight sex trafficking .
YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) Labor Legislation Senate Iowa or or Create Your Own NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa is hoping to stamp out the sex trade by taxing pimps and prostitutes , then jailing them when they do n't pay .
The Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday morning approved a bill sponsored by committee chairman Sen. Charles Grassley , R - Iowa , authorizing at least $ 2 million toward the establishment of an office in the IRS criminal investigation unit to prosecute unlawful sex workers for violations of tax laws .
The bill 's approval gives the IRS harsh new criminal penalties for use against those in the underground criminal economy .
According to Grassley 's office , the majority of the victims of sex trafficking -- those who are often smuggled in from other counties and virtually imprisoned in a house set up for prostitution -- are girls ages 13 to 17 .
' A no-brainer ' " It 's a no - brainer to have the IRS go after sex traffickers , " Grassley said .
" Prosecuting tax code violations can get these guys off the street and yank from their grasp the girls and women they exploit .
This crime is right under our noses in the United States , and it 's especially horrible when under - age girls are being held prisoner .
The thugs who run the trafficking rings are exploiting society 's poorest girls and women for personal gain . "
Asked Tuesday about whether taxing sex workers would somehow lend legitimacy to them , a spokesman for Grassley said that the goal of the legislation would not be to legitimize the individuals but rather to find " yet another alternative to track the money flowing in this industry to get at potential criminals . "
The bill also calls for more jail time for sex workers .
According to Grassley 's office , in the past , the IRS has been saddled with having to prove how much income a sexual worker earned in order to show that he or she has not been paying enough income tax .
Grassley 's proposal will help overcome those obstacles .
For example , if a trafficker has failed to file W - 2s for five women ( employees ) , the maximum penalty would be 10 years in prison per failure to file , a total of 50 years .
Grassley used the example of gangster Al Capone , who was eventually jailed on tax evasion charges .
The bill , according to a spokesman for Grassley , will use the federal tax code to shut down illegal sex workers who are hard to get by way of other federal criminal laws and are not targeted by state law enforcement .
" For the first time ever , the tax code would help put behind bars the criminals who are making money in the underground economy by selling sexual access to girls and women , " the spokesman said in an e-mail statement .
Strip clubs a target ?
Carol Leigh , a representative of BAYSWAN , a San Francisco
Bay area sex worker advocacy network , criticized the legislation as being shortsighted .
" Forced labor , kidnapping should be targeted , but this legislation broadly targets the sex trade in general , and could target your local strip club , " Leigh said .
" Those of us who work in the industry understand that this does nothing to improve conditions in our industry .
" We want laws enforced against those who abuse us , against those who are violent , and enforcement of labor regulations .
That is the only truly effective way to protect the welfare of the women who work in the industry . "
The sex trafficking bill proposed by Grassley was part of a scheduled Senate Finance Committee good government tax bill .

“ They ’re cute , furry , and more dangerous than you think , ” one command bulletin this year said , speaking of cats and dogs .
Maj . Robert A. Goodman , chief of veterinary services for the Army ’s 248th Medical Detachment , highlighted the rabies threat .
“ There ’s nothing compassionate about compassionate feeding , ” he said .
“ They ’re increasing the risk of disease . ”
Still , many troops in Afghanistan and Iraq ignore the ban .
Other bulletins from the American command have reviewed the ethics of feeding strays , saying that animal lovers among the troops do more harm than good when they accustom cats and dogs to a regular supply of food and affection — only to abandon them when they rotate home , leaving the animals depleted in their instinct to fend for themselves .
At The Times ’s compound , too , we have never been certain how long we will remain in Iraq .
But in my mind , at least , the benefits to the cats and our own morale outweighed the longer - term concerns , the more so because conditions beyond our walls seemed to offer scant prospects that most of them , denied our shelter , would survive for long anyway .
On that bitter night in 2005 , I went a step further .
Making my way to a veranda overlooking the spot where the kitten was crying , I “ bombed ” it with a feather duvet off an absent colleague ’s bed before it could scoot into an inaccessible recess in a garden wall .
Thus did we acquire Scooter — white , with flecks of ginger and tabby , a female of extraordinary agility , who found a way , when still no bigger than the palm of my hand , to leap and claw her way out of a cardboard packing case five feet high .
Watching her , and the two litters of kittens she had over the following 18 months , offered we humans a new reaction to the cacophony of the war .
The bloodiest suicide bombings , even miles away , have the sound and feel of the apocalypse , causing humans to freeze , no matter how often they experience it .
Cats need to hear it only once .
As they skitter to the safety of trees and bushes , they enter the blast and the tremor on the hard drive of their brains .
On the next occasion , come the blast , they barely stir .

Iraqs strays inherit land said to have given rise to all domestic cats .
Credit ... Joao Silva for The New York Times
Mongrels though they are , our Baghdad cats , we learned from a recent study in the journal Science , have a noble lineage of their own — as inheritors of the same terrain occupied by the felines that were the forebears of all domestic cats , wild families that lived along the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates more than 10,000 years ago .
But Scooter had her own ticket out of Iraq booked from the moment I clutched her in the duvet ’s folds .
By August of this year , she had three 12 - week - old kittens , each bearing the name of an American war machine — Apache ( Patch , for short ) , Bradley and Stryker .
The names were chosen , in part , in the hope that we might eventually find American veterans of the war , now home , to adopt them .
We already have a cat in England , Scuzzie , who joined the family when he strayed into our home in New Delhi 13 summers ago to escape a monsoon , and he exhibits claws - out hostility to any other cat entering his domain .
Jammie Thomas was said to have shared more than 1,700 songs A court in the US has ordered a woman to pay $ 222,000 ( £ 109,000 ) in damages for illegally file - sharing music .
The jury ordered Jammie Thomas , 32 , from Minnesota , to pay for offering to share 24 specific songs online - a cost of $ 9,250 per song .
Record companies said she had illegally shared a total of 1,702 songs .
Ms Thomas , who denied the charges , was the first person accused of illegal file - sharing who decided to fight the case in court .
Accused woman defends her actions in court Each year , millions of households illegally share music files , and the music industry takes it as a serious threat to its revenue .
About 26,000 lawsuits have been filed against alleged file - sharers , but most defendants settle privately by paying damages amounting to a few thousand dollars .
Industry defiant However , contesting the charge and losing will cost Jammie Thomas almost a quarter of a million dollars .
Thomas denied using Kazaa to share copyrighted material Her lawyer , Brian Toder , told the Associated Press that Ms Thomas was reduced to tears by the verdict .
" This is a girl that lives from pay cheque to pay cheque , and now all of a sudden she could get a quarter of her pay cheque garnished for the rest of her life , " he said .
The US record industry said investigators located an individual with the screen name " tereastarr@KaZaA " , using the Kazaa file - sharing software program .
" This individual was downloading copyrighted sounds recordings from other users of the Kazaa network , and was distributing copyrighted sound recordings stored on her computer to other Kazaa users , " the plaintiffs said .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The art form has been traded in for a bottom line
Tavie Meier , Boulder , USA
Send us your comments A spokesman for the record companies said he hoped people would understand the verdict .
Richard Gabriel , a lawyer for the music companies , said the verdict was important .
" This does send a message , I hope , that downloading and distributing our recordings is not okay , " he told AP .
Our message is : we do n't want to litigate - do n't leave yourself exposed to litigation
John Kennedy , chief executive of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industries
He said no decision had yet been made about what the record companies would do , if anything , to pursue collecting the money from Ms Thomas .
John Kennedy , chief executive of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industries , which represents record labels , said they were " reluctant litigators " .
" We do everything possible to persuade people not to leave themselves exposed to litigation .
We educate , we warn , we even try and settle before a case gets to court . "
He said he hoped the fine would prove a deterrent to others .
" Our message is : we do n't want to litigate - do n't leave yourself exposed to litigation , " he added .

Chronic back pain can cause misery to sufferers
A team found patients with the condition also had microstructural changes in the pain - processing areas of their brains .
The scientists said the work provided evidence that the condition was real and it could aid treatment research .
The research was presented at the Radiological Society of North America 's annual meeting , in Chicago .
A major problem for patients with chronic pain is making their condition believable to doctors , relatives and insurance carriers
Dr Jurgen Lutz
To study the condition , the researchers used a technique called diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) to look at the differences between sufferers ' and healthy volunteers ' brains .
They discovered the brains of patients with chronic back pain had a more complex and active microstructure compared with the healthy volunteers ' brains .
The changes occurred in regions of the brain associated with pain - processing , emotion and stress response .
Cause or result ?
Lead researcher Dr Jurgen Lutz , a radiologist at Ludwig - Maximilians University in Munich , Germany , said : " A major problem for patients with chronic pain is making their condition believable to doctors , relatives and insurance carriers .
DTI could play an important role in this regard .
" With these objective and reproducible correlates in brain imaging , chronic pain may no longer be a subjective experience .
For pain diagnosis and treatment , the consequences could be enormous . "
However , the researchers said more research would be needed to determine whether the physical changes were a cause or result of the pain .
Co-author Gustav Schelling , from the Department of Anaesthesiology at Munich University , said : " It 's difficult to know whether these are pre-existing changes in the brain that predispose an individual to developing chronic pain , whether ongoing pain creates the hyperactivity that actually changes the brain organisation , or if it is some mixture of both .
" DTI may help explain what 's happening for some of these patients , and direct therapeutic attention from the spine to the brain . "
Dr Alison McGregor , a back pain expert from Imperial College London , said : " Eighty percent of the population suffer from back pain at some point in their lives , and quite often you cannot find a physical cause for that . "
She said the study added to a growing body of research that revealed chronic pain was associated with physical changes in the brain .
" We are gradually getting more of an understanding on whether the central nervous system is involved in back pain - however we are not really sure what the physical changes mean . "
Exhaustion and combat stress are besieging US troops in Iraq as they battle with a new type of warfare .
Some even rely on Red Bull to get through the day .
As desertions and absences increase , the military is struggling to cope with the crisis
Lieutenant Clay Hanna looks sick and white .
Like his colleagues he does not seem to sleep .
Hanna says he catches up by napping on a cot between operations in the command centre , amid the noise of radio .
He is up at 6 am and tries to go to sleep by 2 am or 3 am .
But there are operations to go on , planning to be done and after - action reports that need to be written .
And war interposes its own deadly agenda that requires his attention and wakes him up .
When he emerges from his naps there is something old and paper - thin about his skin , something sketchy about his movements as the days go by .
The Americans he commands , like the other men at Sullivan - a combat outpost in Zafraniya , south east Baghdad - hit their cots when they get in from operations .
But even when they wake up there is something tired and groggy about them .
They are on duty for five days at a time and off for two days .
When they get back to the forward operating base , they do their laundry and sleep and count the days until they will get home .
It is an exhaustion that accumulates over the patrols and the rotations , over the multiple deployments , until it all joins up , wiping out any memory of leave or time at home .
Until life is nothing but Iraq .
Hanna and his men are not alone in being tired most of the time .
A whole army is exhausted and worn out .
You see the young soldiers washed up like driftwood at Baghdad 's international airport , waiting to go on leave or returning to their units , sleeping on their body armour on floors and in the dust .
Where once the war in Iraq was defined in conversations with these men by untenable ideas - bringing democracy or defeating al - Qaeda - these days the war in Iraq is defined by different ways of expressing the idea of being weary .
It is a theme that is endlessly reiterated as you travel around Iraq .
' The army is worn out .
We are just keeping people in theatre who are exhausted , ' says a soldier working for the US army public affairs office who is supposed to be telling me how well things have been going since the ' surge ' in Baghdad began .
They are not supposed to talk like this .
We are driving and another of the public affairs team adds bitterly : ' We should just be allowed to tell the media what is happening here .
Let them know that people are worn out .
So that their families know back home .
But it 's like we 've become no more than numbers now . '
The first soldier starts in again .
' My husband was injured here .
He hit an improvised explosive device .
He already had a spinal injury .
The blast shook out the plates .
He 's home now and has serious issues adapting .
But I 'm not allowed to go back home to see him .
If I wanted to see him I 'd have to take leave time ( two weeks ) .
And the army counts it .'
A week later , in the northern city of Mosul , an officer talks privately .
' We 're plodding through this , ' he says after another patrol and another ambush in the city centre .
' I do n't know how much more plodding we 've got left in us . '
When the soldiers talk like this there is resignation .
There is a corrosive anger , too , that bubbles out , like the words pouring unbidden from a chaplain 's assistant who has come to bless a patrol .
' Why do n't you tell the truth ?
Why do n't you journalists write that this army is exhausted ?'
It is a weariness that has created its own culture of superstition .
There are vehicle commanders who will not let the infantrymen in the back fall asleep on long operations - not because they want the men alert , but because , they say , bad things happen when people fall asleep .
So the soldiers drink multiple cans of Rip It and Red Bull to stay alert and wired .
But the exhaustion of the US army emerges most powerfully in the details of these soldiers ' frayed and worn - out lives .
Everywhere you go you hear the same complaints : soldiers talk about divorces , or problems with the girlfriends that they do n't see , or about the children who have been born and who are growing up largely without them .
' I counted it the other day , ' says a major whose partner is also a soldier .
' We have been married for five years .
We added up the days .
Because of Iraq and Afghanistan we have been together for just seven months .
Seven months ...
We are in a bad place .
I do n't know whether this marriage can survive it . '
The anecdotal evidence on the ground confirms what others - prominent among them General Colin Powell , the former US Secretary of State - have been insisting for months now : that the US army is ' about broken ' .
Only a third of the regular army 's brigades now qualify as combat - ready .
Officers educated at the elite West Point academy are leaving at a rate not seen in 30 years , with the consequence that the US army has a shortfall of 3,000 commissioned officers - and the problem is expected to worsen .
And it is not only the soldiers that are worn out .
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have led to the destruction , or wearing out , of 40 per cent of the US army 's equipment , totalling at a recent count $ 212bn ( £ 105bn ) .
But it is in the soldiers themselves - and in the ordinary stories they tell - that the exhaustion of the US military is most obvious , coming amid warnings that soldiers serving multiple Iraq deployments , now amounting to several years , are 50 per cent more likely than those with one tour to suffer from acute combat stress .
The army 's exhaustion is reflected in problems such as the rate of desertion and unauthorised absences - a problem , it was revealed earlier this year , that had increased threefold on the period before the war in Afghanistan and had resulted in thousands of negative discharges .
' They are scraping to get people to go back and people are worn out , ' said Thomas Grieger , a senior US navy psychiatrist , told the International Herald Tribune in April .
' Modern war is exhausting , ' says Major Stacie Caswell , an occupational therapist with a combat stress unit attached to the military hospital in Mosul .
Her unit runs long group sessions to help soldiers with emerging mental health and discipline problems : often they have seen friends killed and injured , or are having problems stemming from issues at home - responsible for 50 to 60 per cent of their cases .
One of the most common problems in Iraq is sleep disorders .
' This is a different kind of war , ' says Caswell .
' In World War II it was clear who the good guys and the bad guys were .
You knew what you would go through on the battlefield . '
Now she says the threat is all around .
And soldiering has changed .
' Now we have so many things to do ...'
' And the soldier in Vietnam , ' interjects Sergeant John Valentine from the same unit , ' did not get to see the coverage from home that these soldiers do .
We see what is going on at home on the political scene .
They think the war is going to end .
Then we have the frustration and confusion .
That is fatiguing .
Mentally tiring .'
' Not only that , ' says Caswell , ' but because of the nature of what we do now , the number of tasks in comparison with previous generations - even as you are finishing your 15 months here you are immediately planning and training for your next tour . '
Valentine adds : ' There is no decompression . '
The consequence is a deep - seated problem of retention and recruitment that in turn , says Caswell , has led the US army to reduce its standards for joining the military , particularly over the issue of no longer looking too hard at any previous history of mental illness .
' It is a question of honesty , and we are not investigating too deeply or we are issuing waivers .
The consequence is that we are seeing people who do not have the same coping skills when they get here , and this can be difficult .
' We are also seeing older soldiers coming in - up to 41 years old - and that is causing its own problems .
They have difficulty dealing with the physical impact of the war and also interacting with the younger men . '
Valentine says : ' We are not only watering down the quality of the soldiers but the leadership too .
The good leaders get out .
I 've seen it .
And right now we are on the down slope . '
' War tsar ' calls for return of the draft to take the strain
America's ' war tsar ' has called for the nation 's political leaders to consider bringing back the draft to help a military exhausted by wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
In a radio interview , Lieutenant General Douglas Lute said the option had always been open to boost America 's all - volunteer army by drafting in young men in the same way as happened in Vietnam .
' I think it makes sense to consider it , ' he said .
Lute was appointed ' war tsar ' earlier this year after President Bush decided a single figure was needed to oversee the nation 's military efforts abroad .
Rumours of a return to the draft have long circulated in military circles as the pressure from fighting two large conflicts at the same time builds on America 's forces .
However , politically it would be extremely difficult to achieve , especially for any leader hoping to be elected in 2008 .
Bush has previously ruled out the suggestion as unnecessary .
Lute , however , said the war was causing stress to military families and , as a result , was having an impact on levels of re-enlistment .
' This kind of stress plays out across dinner tables and in living - room conversations within these families .
Ultimately the health of the all - volunteer force is going to rest on those sorts of personal family decisions , ' he said .
A draft would revive bad memories of the turmoil of the 1960s and early 1970s when tens of thousands of young men were drafted to fight and die in Vietnam .
Few other policies proved as divisive in America and the memories of anti-war protesters burning their draft cards and fleeing to Canada are still vivid in the memory .

6. Nicolae Ceausescu
On December 25 , Ceausescu and his wife were condemned to death by a military court on charges ranging from illegal gathering of wealth to genocide , and were executed in Târgovi?te , Romania .
Before they were shot dead , Ceau?escu sang part of “ The Internationale ” and proclaimed that history would judge him well .
His wife was screaming at everyone to go to hell .
7. Mao Tse - Tung
Mao Tse - Tung was a Chinese military and political leader , who led the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) to victory against the Kuomintang ( KMT ) in the Chinese Civil War , and was the leader of the People ’s Republic of China ( PRC ) from its establishment in 1949 until his death in 1976 .
Under his leadership , China suffered the Cultural Revolution , a struggle for power within the Communist Party that manifested into wide - scale social , political , and economic chaos , which grew to include large sections of Chinese society and eventually brought the entire country to the brink of civil war .
There are estimates of up to 500,000 deaths as a result of Mao ’s policies .
8. Saddam Hussein
Saddam was hanged on the first day of Eid ul - Adha , December 30 , 2006 , despite his wish to be shot ( which he felt would be more dignified ) .
The execution was carried out at “ Camp Justice , ” an Iraqi army base in Kadhimiya , a neighborhood of northeast Baghdad .
The execution was videotaped on a mobile phone , showing Saddam being taunted before his hanging .
The video was leaked to electronic media , becoming the subject of global controversy .
9. Vladimir Lenin
Lenin died on January 21 , 1924 , aged 53 .
Rumors of Lenin having syphilis sprang up shortly after his death .
The official cause given for Lenin ’s death was cerebral arteriosclerosis , or a fourth stroke .
But out of the 27 physicians who treated him , only eight signed onto that conclusion in his autopsy report .
Therefore , several other theories regarding his death have been put forward .
10 . Hermann Goering
Goering ( second in charge of Nazi Germany ) was found guilty on four counts raised against him : of conspiracy to wage war , crimes against peace , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
No mitigating circumstances were found and he was sentenced to death by hanging .
He asked to be executed by firing squad – the request was refused .
On 15th October 1946 , two hours before his execution was due to take place , Goering committed suicide in his Nuremberg cell , taking a capsule of poison that he had succeeded in hiding during his imprisonment .

If you drive a car - and you know who you are - you have invariably come upon the dreaded dilemma of refueling .
When the needle on your gas gauge wavers over the unseemly ' E , ' you have to ask yourself one question - Do I stop at the next gas station or press on , hoping for a fuel oasis somewhere down the road ?
But what if you need to motor somewhere three billion - plus miles off the beaten path - somewhere where neither regular nor premium unleaded have so far feared to tread ?
Such is the case for NASA 's latest deep space explorer , Dawn .
The 2,600 pound spacecraft 's mission is to reconnoiter the asteroid belt 's two biggest occupants - the massive asteroid Vesta and the even more massive dwarf planet Ceres .
To do so , Dawn will not just scream past its prey snapping off a flurry of images as it zooms by .
No , not this spacecraft .
" Dawn will be history 's first mission to go out into the solar system , orbit and explore a distant body , and then go on to a totally different celestial body and explore that one , " said Dawn project manager Keyur Patel of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
" To do all that you need a spacecraft with a lot under the hood .
" What Patel considers a lot under the hood is definitely not the exo-atmospheric equivalent of a muscle car 's 426 Hemi engine .
After all , it is about a different type of performance up there - the kind where smooth , reliable operation and gas mileage count more than the capability to burn rubber .
What it takes up there is a deep - space qualified engine , a whole bunch of juice and the same kind of gas used in photographic flash bulbs and some car headlights .
The engine is called NASA Solar Electric Propulsion Technology Applications Readiness .
Most people in the deep space exploration business just refer to it as " ion propulsion . "
The juice is , of course , electricity , courtesy of 54 feet of electricity - producing solar array .
The gas is xenon , an inert , colorless gas that is four times heavier than air and is the propellant of choice for asteroid explorers everywhere .
" Each of our three ion engines weighs in at 20 pounds and is about the size of a basketball , " said Patel .
" From such a little engine you can get this blue beam of rocket exhaust that shoots out at 89,000 miles per hour .
The fuel efficiency of an ion engine is an order of a magnitude higher than chemical rockets and can reduce the mass of fuel onboard a spacecraft up to 90 percent .
It is a remarkable system .
" Praise like that does raise an important question .
If ion engines are so hyper - efficient , how come NASA does not use them for all their rockets and spacecraft ?
" For the same reason a drag racer would not use a fuel efficient Prius to compete in the quarter mile , " said John Brophy , Dawn 's ion propulsion systems manager .
" Not enough get up and go .
" The kind of get up and go Brophy is talking about is power - horsepower to hurtle a top fuel dragster down the track , or the massive amounts of thrust to give a rocket enough get up and go to go - out there .
" We have a powerful rocket to cover those initial 175 miles , " added Brophy .
" Our Delta II Heavy will give the Dawn spacecraft enough energy to leave Earth 's atmosphere and its gravitational sphere of influence .
But getting into space is just the beginning .
There will still be a lot of motoring ahead .
" A lot of motoring is right .
Over the course of its eight year mission , first to Vesta and then off to Ceres , Dawn 's three ion engines will accumulate 2,000 days of operation - that is 5.5 years of happy motoring !
Why so much engine time ?
It is as simple as a plain piece of paper .
" Hold a piece of notebook paper in your hand .
The weight of that paper pushing against your hand is the same as the thrust provided by one of Dawn 's ion engines -- at full throttle I might add , " said Brophy .
" If you had an ion engine firing here on Earth , it would not be able to push a skateboard across a sidewalk !
" Lucky for Dawn there are no sidewalks in space - and as far as we know no skateboards .
What there is up there is plenty of space , so soon after the spacecraft escapes Earth 's gravity , one of its ion engines can kick in and begin the long , efficient chase of its first asteroid belt target , Vesta .
At first glance , Dawn 's full throttle , pedal - to - the - metal , performance is a not - so - inspiring 0 - to - 60 mph in 4 days .
But consider this - because of its incredible efficiency , it expends only 40 ounces of xenon propellant during that time .
And then take into consideration that after those four days of full - throttle thrusting , it will do another four days - and then another four .
By the end of 12 days the spacecraft will have increased its velocity by over 180 miles per hour , with more days and weeks and months of continuous thrusting to come .
After a year Dawn 's ion propulsion system will have increased the spacecraft 's speed by 5,500 mph while consuming the equivalent of only 15 gallons of fuel .
By the end of its mission Dawn will have accumulated more than 5 years of total thrust time , giving it an effective change in speed of about 23,000 mph .
"
In the end it is about the science , " added Patel .
" What we find when Dawn gets to Vesta and Ceres will re-write the history books on the beginning of our solar system .
But how we get there is almost as remarkable , 1.8 billion miles to Vesta , months flying around it performing science adjusting our orbits as we go .
Then we travel another billion miles to Ceres where we do it all over again .
That is a lot to ask of a beam of blue light .
" Those space aficionados who want to keep their " ion " the mission should note the launch period for Dawn 's voyage to Vesta and Ceres opens September 26 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station 's Pad 17 - B .

Happy human Humanist logo , white and golden version ( Photo credit : Wikipedia )
And this is for the sake of this life , in this world , where we suffer and find joy , where we can help one another , and where we need one another 's help : the help of the living human hand and heart .
A great deal of that help has to be targeted at the other side of what the human heart is - the unkind , angry , hostile , selfish , cruel side ; the superstitious , tendentious , intellectually captive , ignorant side - to defeat or mitigate it , to ameliorate the consequences of its promptings , to teach it to be different ; and never with lies and bribes .
These are fellow human beings , and humanists profoundly wish them well ; which means too that they wish them to be free , to think for themselves , to see the world through clear eyes .
If only , says the humanist , they would have a better knowledge of history !
If only they would see what their own leaders think of the simple version of the faiths they adhere to , substituting such sophistry in its place !
For whereas the ordinary believer has a somewhat misty notion of a father - cum - policeman - cum - Father Christmas - cum - magician personal deity , their theologians deploy such a polysyllabic , labyrinthine , intricate , sophisticated , complexified approach , that some go so far as to claim ( as one current celebrity cleric does ) that God does not have to exist to be believed in .
The standard basis of religious belief - subjective certainty - is hard enough to contest , being non-rational at source , but this is beyond orbit .
It is hard to know which are worse : the theologians who are serious about what they say in these respects , and those who know it for a game .
It is a mistake to think that people who are not religious lack a functioning moral system .
Asrecently noted , secular humanism provides nonbelievers with just such an ethical system , " ... all the richer indeed for being the result of reflection as opposed to conditioning ... "
Simply put , a secular humanist is someone whose ethical system is not rooted in a particular religious tradition .
An excellent example of secular morality is the so - called Golden Rule .
This moral precept , that one should treat others as one would like to be treated , predates the Abrahamic religions , effectively shredding the claim made by many Christians that their bible is somehow the source of all morality .
When considering whether a particular act would be immoral , one can consider its likely impact on others without needing to attempt to cherry pick from one 's " holy " text .
As Grayling points out , humanists are unconcerned with threats of supernatural punishment or reward , focusing instead on the only life any of us will ever have .
One of the things that matters to most secular humanists is truth .
Thus , humanists are likely to reject belief systems based on fanciful desire alone , preferring to consider systems grounded in reality .
As Grayling implies , this is one of the factors that may motivate some humanists to reach out to others blinded by religious dogma .
Humanism may not be for everyone because it requires a certain tolerance for ambiguity .
Unlike religion , humanism is not going to provide one with many unchanging certainties .
Humanists are far more likely to recognize and accept uncertainties and unanswered questions that believers who combat uncertainty with faith .
For many , this intellectual freedom is part of the appeal of humanism .
Those who insist that humanism is moral relativism , that it is evil , or that it cannot provide an adequate form of morality are mistaken and should be encouraged to learn more about what they are determined to criticize .
Those who claim that humanism is arrogant need to look in the mirror and examine the arrogance entailed by belief in a personal god who has any concern for their welfare .
Finally , those who see humanism as void of emotion , passion , or awe are going to need the most help in overcoming their religious indoctrination .
Only then may they be able to experience the joy of living in accordance with reality
It was in either kindergarten or first grade that I was first asked to pray , given a transliteration of a Hebrew prayer .
I asked what the words meant .
I was told that so long as I prayed in Hebrew , I did n't need to know what the words meant , it would work anyway .
That was the beginning of my break with Judaism .
As you read this , some young man or woman is sitting at a desk in a university , earnestly studying material they have no intention of ever using , and no interest in knowing for its own sake .
They want a high - paying job , and the high - paying job requires a piece of paper , and the piece of paper requires a previous master 's degree , and the master 's degree requires a bachelor 's degree , and the university that grants the bachelor 's degree requires you to take a class in 12th - century knitting patterns to graduate .
So they diligently study , intending to forget it all the moment the final exam is administered , but still seriously working away , because they want that piece of paper .
Maybe you realized it was all madness , but I bet you did it anyway .
You did n't have a choice , right ?
A recent study here in the Bay Area showed that 80 % of teachers in K - 5 reported spending less than one hour per week on science , and 16 % said they spend no time on science .
Why ?
I 'm given to understand the proximate cause is the No Child Left Behind Act and similar legislation .
Virtually all classroom time is now spent on preparing for tests mandated at the state or federal level .
I seem to recall ( though I can't find the source ) that just taking mandatory tests was 40 % of classroom time in one school .
The old Soviet bureaucracy was famous for being more interested in appearances than reality .
One shoe factory overfulfilled its quota by producing lots of tiny shoes .
Another shoe factory reported cut but unassembled leather as a " shoe " .
The superior bureaucrats were n't interested in looking too hard , because they also wanted to report quota overfulfillments .
All this was a great help to the comrades freezing their feet off .
It is now being suggested in several sources that an actual majority of published findings in medicine , though " statistically significant with p<0.05 " , are untrue .
But so long as p<0.05 remains the threshold for publication , why should anyone hold themselves to higher standards , when that requires bigger research grants for larger experimental groups , and decreases the likelihood of getting a publication ?
Everyone knows that the whole point of science is to publish lots of papers , just as the whole point of a university is to print certain pieces of parchment , and the whole point of a school is to pass the mandatory tests that guarantee the annual budget .
You do n't get to set the rules of the game , and if you try to play by different rules , you 'll just lose .
( Though for some reason , physics journals require a threshold of p<0.0001 .
It 's as if they conceive of some other purpose to their existence than publishing physics papers . )
There 's chocolate at the supermarket , and you can get to the supermarket by driving , and driving requires that you be in the car , which means opening your car door , which needs keys .
If you find there 's no chocolate at the supermarket , you wo n't stand around opening and slamming your car door because the car door still needs opening .
I rarely notice people losing track of plans they devised themselves .
It 's another matter when incentives must flow through large organizations - or worse , many different organizations and interest groups , some of them governmental .
Then you see behaviors that would mark literal insanity , if they were born from a single mind .
Someone gets paid every time they open a car door , because that 's what 's measurable ; and this person does n't care whether the driver ever gets paid for arriving at the supermarket , let alone whether the buyer purchases the chocolate , or whether the eater is happy or starving .
From a Bayesian perspective , subgoals are epiphenomena of conditional probability functions .
There is no expected utility without utility .
How silly would it be to think that instrumental value could take on a mathematical life of its own , leaving terminal value in the dust ?
It 's not sane by decision - theoretical criteria of sanity .
But consider the No Child Left Behind Act .
The politicians want to look like they 're doing something about educational difficulties ; the politicians have to look busy to voters this year , not fifteen years later when the kids are looking for jobs .
The politicians are not the consumers of education .
The bureaucrats have to show progress , which means that they 're only interested in progress that can be measured this year .
They are n't the ones who'll end up ignorant of science .
The publishers who commission textbooks , and the committees that purchase textbooks , do n't sit in the classrooms bored out of their skulls .
The actual consumers of knowledge are the children - who can't pay , can't vote , ca n't sit on the committees .
Their parents care for them , but do n't sit in the classes themselves ; they can only hold politicians responsible according to surface images of " tough on education " .
Politicians are too busy being re-elected to study all the data themselves ; they have to rely on surface images of bureaucrats being busy and commissioning studies - it may not work to help any children , but it works to let politicians appear caring .
Bureaucrats do n't expect to use textbooks themselves , so they do n't care if the textbooks are hideous to read , so long as the process by which they are purchased looks good on the surface .
The textbook publishers have no motive to produce bad textbooks , but they know that the textbook purchasing committee will be comparing textbooks based on how many different subjects they cover , and that the fourth - grade purchasing committee is n't coordinated with the third - grade purchasing committee , so they cram as many subjects into one textbook as possible .
Teachers wo n't get through a fourth of the textbook before the end of the year , and then the next year 's teacher will start over .
Teachers might complain , but they are n't the decision - makers , and ultimately , it 's not their future on the line , which puts sharp bounds on how much effort they 'll spend on unpaid altruism ...
It 's amazing , when you look at it that way - consider all the lost information and lost incentives - that anything at all remains of the original purpose , gaining knowledge .
Though many educational systems seem to be currently in the process of collapsing into a state not much better than nothing .
Want to see the problem really solved ?
Make the politicians go to school .
A single human mind can track a probabilistic expectation of utility as it flows through the conditional chances of a dozen intermediate events - including nonlocal dependencies , places where the expected utility of opening the car door depends on whether there 's chocolate in the supermarket .
But organizations can only reward today what is measurable today , what can be written into legal contract today , and this means measuring intermediate events rather than their distant consequences .
These intermediate measures , in turn , are leaky generalizations - often very leaky .
Bureaucrats are untrustworthy genies , for they do not share the values of the wisher .
Miyamoto Musashi said :
" The primary thing when you take a sword in your hands is your intention to cut the enemy , whatever the means .
Whenever you parry , hit , spring , strike or touch the enemy 's cutting sword , you must cut the enemy in the same movement .
It is essential to attain this .
If you think only of hitting , springing , striking or touching the enemy , you will not be able actually to cut him .
More than anything , you must be thinking of carrying your movement through to cutting him .
You must thoroughly research this . "
( I wish I lived in an era where I could just tell my readers they have to thoroughly research something , without giving insult . )
Why would any individual lose track of their purposes in a swordfight ?
If someone else had taught them to fight , if they had not generated the entire art from within themselves , they might not understand the reason for parrying at one moment , or springing at another moment ; they might not realize when the rules had exceptions , fail to see the times when the usual method wo n't cut through .
The essential thing in the art of epistemic rationality is to understand how every rule is cutting through to the truth in the same movement .
The corresponding essential of pragmatic rationality - decision theory , versus probability theory - is to always see how every expected utility cuts through to utility .
You must thoroughly research this .
C. J. Cherryh said :
" Your sword has no blade .
It has only your intention .
When that goes astray you have no weapon . "
I have seen many people go astray when they wish to the genie of an imagined AI , dreaming up wish after wish that seems good to them , sometimes with many patches and sometimes without even that pretense of caution .
And they do n't jump to the meta - level .
They do n't instinctively look - to - purpose , the instinct that started me down the track to atheism at the age of five .
They do not ask , as I reflexively ask , " Why do I think this wish is a good idea ?
Will the genie judge likewise ? "
They do n't see the source of their judgment , hovering behind the judgment as its generator .
They lose track of the ball ; they know the ball bounced , but they do n't instinctively look back to see where it bounced from - the criterion that generated their judgments .
Likewise with people not automatically noticing when supposedly selfish people give altruistic arguments in favor of selfishness , or when supposedly altruistic people give selfish arguments in favor of altruism .
People can handle goal - tracking for driving to the supermarket just fine , when it 's all inside their own heads , and no genies or bureaucracies or philosophies are involved .
The trouble is that real civilization is immensely more complicated than this .
Dozens of organizations , and dozens of years , intervene between the child suffering in the classroom , and the new - minted college graduate not being very good at their job .
( But will the interviewer or manager notice , if the college graduate is good at looking busy ? )
With every new link that intervenes between the action and its consequence , intention has one more chance to go astray .
With every intervening link , information is lost , incentive is lost .
And this bothers most people a lot less than it bothers me , or why were all my classmates willing to say prayers without knowing what they meant ?
They did n't feel the same instinct to look - to - the - generator .
Can people learn to keep their eye on the ball ?
To keep their intention from going astray ?
To never spring or strike or touch , without knowing the higher goal they will complete in the same movement ?
People do often want to do their jobs , all else being equal .
Can there be such a thing as a sane corporation ?
A sane civilization , even ?
That 's only a distant dream , but it's what I 've been getting at with all these blog posts on the flow of intentions ( aka expected utility , aka instrumental value ) without losing purpose ( aka utility , aka terminal value ) .
Can people learn to feel the flow of parent goals and child goals ?
To know consciously , as well as implicitly , the distinction between expected utility and utility ?
Do you care about threats to your civilization ?
The worst metathreat to complex civilization is its own complexity , for that complication leads to the loss of many purposes .
I look back , and I see that more than anything , my life has been driven by an exceptionally strong abhorrence to lost purposes .
I hope it can be transformed to a learnable skill .
July 1 , 2007  --
A secret U.S. law enforcement report , prepared for the Department of Homeland Security , warns that al Qaeda is planning a terror " spectacular " this summer , according to a senior official with access to the document .
" This is reminiscent of the warnings and intelligence we were getting in the summer of 2001 , " the official told ABCNews.com .
U.S. officials have kept the information secret , and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said today on ABC News ' " This Week with George Stephanopoulos " that the United States did not have " have any specific credible evidence that there 's an attack focused on the United States at this point . "
As ABCNews.com reported , U.S. law enforcement officials received intelligence reports two weeks ago warning of terror attacks in Glasgow and Prague , the Czech Republic , against " airport infrastructure and aircraft . "
The warnings apparently never reached officials in Scotland , who said this weekend they had received " no advance intelligence " that Glasgow might be a target .
Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff declined to comment specifically on on the report today , but said " everything that we get is shared virtually instantaneously with our counterparts in Britain and vice versa . "
Unlike the United States , officials in Germany have publicly warned that the country could face a major attack this summer , also comparing the situation to the pre-9/11 summer of 2001 .
ATCHISON , Kan . —
The main still of the High Plains liquor company here was scraped together from junked parts of an old food processing plant .
The tubing for the bottling equipment had been used to milk cows , and one of the tanks was actually an industrial vacuum cleaner .
The whole clanking operation , headquartered on a farm northwest of Kansas City , looks like a patchwork contraption out of the imagination .
And that is basically what it was two years ago when Seth Fox , a cattle rancher down on his luck , decided to get a license to distill some vodka and a little whiskey .
“ I talked to banks , told them I wanted to make vodka on my farm here , and they said , ‘ Yeah , right you are , ’ ” recalled Mr. Fox , whose company went on to become the first distillery in Kansas since Prohibition .
“ Well , I had a million dollars in sales last year . ”
“ I ’m the seventh generation to be in alcohol , ” he said proudly .
“ Just the first to do it legally . ”
On the heels of the microbrewing boom , new microdistilleries are thriving from coast to coast .
And some of the latest and quirkiest entrants to the industry are in places like Iowa , Indiana , Illinois , Michigan and Mr. Fox ’s barn .
Your Creation Museum Report
Yes , finally , ladies and gentlemen , I present you with your Creation Museum report !
Thank you for your patience .
Our report today has two parts :
The first part is a photographic tour , with all the snarktasticness you ’ve been no doubt hoping for .
Click on the first picture and cruise on through .
It ’s long — 101 pictures — but , hey , you guys paid top dollar , so I do n’t want to skimp .
The second part , a think piece , if you will , is directly below .
It ’s no less snarky ( as you will soon discover ) , but also somewhat more thoughtful .
Enjoy .
ON THE CREATION MUSEUM
By John Scalzi
Here ’s how to understand the Creation Museum :
Imagine , if you will , a load of horseshit .
And we ’re not talking just your average load of horseshit ; no , we ’re talking colossal load of horsehit .
An epic load of horseshit .
The kind of load of horseshit that has accreted over decades and has developed its own sort of ecosystem , from the flyblown chunks at the perimeter , down into the heated and decomposing center , generating explosive levels of methane as bacteria feast merrily on vintage , liquified crap .
This is a Herculean load of horseshit , friends , the likes of which has not been seen since the days of Augeas .
And you look at it and you say , “ Wow , what a load of horseshit . ”
But then there ’s this guy .
And this guy loves this load of horseshit .
Why ?
Well , really , who knows ?
What possesses someone to love a load of horseshit ?
It ’s beyond your understanding and possibly you do n’t actually want to know , even if you could know ; maybe it ’s one of those “ on that path lies madness ” things .
But love it he does , and he ’s not the only one ; the admiration for this particular load of horseshit exists , unaccountably , far and wide .
There are advocates for this load of horseshit .
And so this guy who loves this load of horseshit decides that he ’s going to do something ; he ’s going to give it a home .
And not just any home , because as this is no ordinary load of horseshit , so must its home be no ordinary repository for horseshit .
And so the fellow builds a temple for his load of horseshit .
The finest architects scope this temple ’s dimensions ; the most excellent builders hoist columns around the load of horseshit and cap them with a cunning and elegant dome ; and every surface of the temple is clad in fine - grained Italian marble by the most competent masons in a three - state radius .
The load of horseshit is surrounded by comfortable seats , the better for people to gaze upon it ; docents are hired to expertly describe its history and features ; multimedia events are designed to explain its superior nature , relative not only to other loads of horseshit which may compete in loadosity or horseshittery , but to other , completely unrelated things which may or may not be loads of anything , much less loads of horseshit .
The guy who built the temple , satisfied that it truly represents his beloved load of horseshit in the best possible light , then opens the temple to the public , to attract not only the already - established horseshit enthusiasts , but possibly to entice new people to come and gaze on the horseshit , and to , well , who knows , admire its moundyness , or the way it piles just so , to nod in appreciation of the rationalizations for its excellence or to clap in delight and take pictures when an escaping swell of methane causes the load of horseshit to sigh a moist and pungent sigh .
When all of this is done , the fellow turns to you and asks you what you think of it all now , now that this gorgeous edifice has been raised in glory and the masses cluster in celebration .
And you say , “ Well , that ’s all very nice .
But it ’s still just an enormous load of horseshit . ”
And this is , in sum , the Creation Museum .
$ 27 million has purchased the very best monument to an enormous load of horseshit that you could possibly ever hope to see .
I enjoyed my visit , admired the craft with which the whole thing was put together , and was never once convinced that what I was seeing celebrated was anything more or less than horseshit .
Popular horseshit ?
Undoubtedly .
Horseshit hallowed by tradition and consecrated by time ?
Just so .
Horseshit of the finest possible quality ?
I would not argue the point .
And yet , even so : Horseshit .
Complete horseshit .
Utter horseshit .
Total horseshit .
Horseshit , horseshit , horseshit , horseshit .
I pity the people who swallow it whole .
***
So that is the key to understanding the Creation Museum .
But what is the enormous load of horseshit that sits , squat yet moundy , at its very center ?
It ’s simple : That the Bible is the literal and inerrant Word of God .
If the Creation Museum does n’t have that , it does n’t have anything .
So what it does — and very cleverly — is to position the Word of God as a non-threatening and accommodating given right from the start .
In the first room of the Creation Museum tour there ’s a display of two paleontologists unearthing a raptor skeleton .
One of them , a rather avuncular fellow , explains that he and the other paleontologist are both doing the same work , but that they start off from different premises :
He starts off from the Bible and the other fellow ( who does not get to comment , naturally ) starts off from “ man ’s reason , ” and really , that ’s the only difference between them : “ different starting points , same facts , ” is the mantra for the first portion of the museum .
The rhetoricians in the crowd will already see how a card has been palmed here .
The Museum is casually trying to establish an equivalence between science and creationism by accrediting them both as legitimate “ starting points ” for any discussion of biology , geology and cosmology .
This would cause any scientist worth his or her salt to have a positively cinematic spit take , because it ’s horseshit , but if you do n’t know any better ( say , if you ’ve been fed a line of crap your whole life along the lines of “ science is just another religion ” ) it sounds perfectly reasonable .
And so if you buy that , then the next room , filled with large posters that offer on equal footing the creationist and scientific takes on the creation of the universe and evolution , seems perfectly reasonable , too :
Heck , we can both have our theories !
They ’re both okay .
The problem with this is that creationism is n’t a theory , it ’s an assertion , to wit :
The entire universe was created in six days , the days are 24 - hour days , the layout for the creation and for the early history of the planet and humanity is in the first chapter of Genesis and it is exactly right .
Everything has to be made to conform to these assertions , which is why creationist attempts at science are generally so damn comical and refutable .
This is also why the “ different starting points , same facts ” mantra is laughably false on its face — creationism has to have different facts to explain the world .
It ’s a little idiotic to establish as a “ fact ” that both science and creationism acknowledge , say , that apes exist , but to paper over the difference in the set of “ facts ” that explain how the apes got here , or to imply that a creationist assertion ( apes created on the fifth day ) is logically or systematically equivalent to decades of rigorous scientific process in the exploration of evolution .
But none of this is immediately obvious stuff and certainly the Creation Museum is n’t going to go out of its way to point it out ; quite the opposite , in fact , since everything relies on the audience swallowing that whopping load of horseshit right up front .
Thus the avuncular fake paleontologist at the start of the tour , looking all squinty and trustworthy and setting forth his load of utter horseshit in a tone of calm sincerity .
Why would n’t you believe him ?
He ’s a scientist , after all .
Once you buy the initial premise , the rest comes easy , or , well , easier , anyway .
***
Let me say this much : I have to admit admiration for the pure balls - out , high - octane creationism that ’s on offer here .
Not for the Creation Museum that mamby - pamby weak sauce known as “ Intelligent Design , ” which tries to slip God by as some random designer , who just sort of got the ball rolling by accident .
Screw that , pal : The Creation Museum ’s God is hands on !
He made every one of those animals from the damn mud and he did it no earlier than 4004 BC , or thereabouts .
It ’s all there in the book , son , all you have to do is look .
Indeed , every single thing on display in the Creation Museum is either caused by or a consequence of exactly three things :
1 . The six - day creation ;
2. Adam eating from the tree of life ;
3. Noah ’s flood .
Really , that ’s it .
That ’s the Holy Trinity of explanations and rationalizations .
And thus we learn fascinating things .
Did you know , for example , that Adam is responsible not only for the fall of man , but also for the creation of venom ?
It did n’t exist in the Garden of Eden , because , well .
Why would it ?
Weeds ?
Adam ’s fault .
Carnivorous animals ( and , one assumes , the occasional carnivorous plant ) ?
Adam again .
Entropy ?
You guessed it : Adam .
Think about that , wo n’t you ; eat one piece of fruit and suddenly you ’re responsible for the inevitable heat death of the universe .
God ’s kind of mean .
The interplay of this Holy Trinity of explanations comes to its full realization when the Creation Museum considers what really are its main draw : Dinosaurs .
Are dinosaurs 65 million years old ?
As if — the Earth is just six thousand years old , pal !
Dinosaurs were in the garden of Eden — and vegetarians , at least until the fall , so thanks there , Adam .
They were still around as late as the mid-third millenium BC ; they were hanging with the Sumerians and the Egyptians ( or , well , could have ) .
All those fossils ?
Laid down by the Noah ’s Flood , my friends .
Which is not to say there were n’t dinosaurs on the Ark .
No , the Bible says all kinds of land animals were on the boat , and dinosaurs are a subset of “ all kinds . ”
They were there , scaring the crap out of the mammals , probably .
Why did they die off after the flood ?
Well , who can say .
Once the flood ’s done , the Creation Museum does n’t seem to care too much about what comes next ; we ’re in historical times then , you see , and that ’s all Exodus through Deuteronomy , ie . , someone else ’s problem .
But seriously , the ability to just come out and put on a placard that the Jurassic era is temporally contiguous with the Fifth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of Egypt — well , there ’s a word for that , and that word is chutzpah .
Because , look , that ’s something you really have to sell if you want anyone to buy it .
It ’s one thing to say to people that God directly created the dinosaurs and that they lived in the Garden of Eden .
It ’s another thing to suggest they lived long enough to harass the Minoans , and do it with a straight face .
It ’s horseshit , pure and simple , but that ’s not to suggest I ca n’t admire the hucksterism .
***
I ’m quite clearly immune to the ideological charms of the Creation Museum , but then , I never was the prime audience for the place .
How were other people grokking the museum the day I was there ?
Honestly , it ’s hard to say .
The place was certainly crowded ; I and the friends I went with had to wait in line an hour and a half to get into the place ( there ’s a bottleneck in the middle of the museum in the form of a short film about the six days of creation ) .
No one I could see was getting sloppy over the place ; people just more or less shuffled through each room , looked at the displays , read the placards and moved on .
My friends occasionally heard someone say “ oh , come on , ” when one of the placards tested their credulity ( there ’s apparently only so much of “ T - Rexes were vegetarian ” propaganda any one person should be obliged to take ) , but for my part I just noticed people looking , reading and moving on .
There have to be people who believe this horseshit unreservedly , but I suspect that perhaps the majority of the visitors I saw were Christians who may not buy into the whole “ six days ” thing , but are curious to see how it ’s being presented .
To be clear , the “ horseshit ” I ’ve been speaking of is not Christianity , it ’s creationism , which to my mind is a teleological quirk substantially unrelated to the grace one can achieve through Jesus Christ .
Now , the Creation Museum rather emphatically argues that a literal reading of the Bible is essential for true Christianity — it ’s got a whole red - lit section that suggests the ills of society are directly related to folks deciding that maybe some parts of the Bible are , you know , metaphorical — but that ’s just more horseshit , of a slightly different flavor .
There are lots of Christians who clearly do n’t need to twist their brain like a pretzel to get around the idea that the universe is billions of years old and that we ’ve evolved from earlier forms .
For those folks , the Creation Museum is probably about culture , to the extent any installation largely created by someone who previously worked for Universal Studios can be about culture .
At the very least , this is high - quality stuff on the level of production .
There are lots of things here that are cheesy , but there ’s not much that ’s chintzy ; you can see where the $ 27 million went .
Whether this will all age well will be an interesting question , although I do n’t plan on returning in five years to find out .
Here and now , it ’s all pretty damn slick , and I think that in itself may be a draw for mainstream Christians .
Christian culture has only recently ramped itself up into being something other than a wan and denatured version of pop culture ( this is evidenced in part by the fact that many evangelical Christian teens now dress as badly as the rest of their peers ) , and this is another high - production - value offering for this particular lifestyle choice .
Will these folks find the arguments they find at the Creation Museum convincing ?
Again , you got me .
I certainly hope not , but more to the point I would hope that these folks do n’t come away feeling that their love of Christ obliges them to swallow heaping mounds of horseshit from people who are phobic about metaphor .
I really do n’t think Jesus would care if you think that you and a monkey have a common ancestor ; I think he would care more that you think you and your neighbor have a common weal .
What about non-Christians ?
I ca n’t imagine that anyone who was n’t strongly religious or already inclined to agree with creationist ideas would be converted by this place .
Between blaming Adam for everything from poisons to sweating and T - Rexes eating coconuts and a particularly memorable placard explaining why in early Biblical times it was perfectly fine to have sex with your close relatives , it ’s just way too over the top .
***
Indeed , it ’s over the top enough that I never could actually get angry with the place .
Not that I was planning to ; I admit to dreading coming to the place , but that ’s primarily because I thought it would bore and annoy me , not make me angry .
In fact , I was never bored , and was genuinely annoyed only by the “ paleontologist ” at the start of the walk - through .
The rest of the time I enjoyed it as I suspect anyone who is not some stripe of creationist could enjoy it :
As camp .
At some point — specifically the part where the Scopes Monkey Trial was presented as the end of decent Christian civilization as we know it — I just started chuckling my way through .
By the time I got to the Dinosaur Den , with its placards full of patent misinformation about how soft tissue fossilization strongly suggested a massive , worldwide flood , I was a little loopy .
It was just so ridiculous .
And I ’m happy about that .
In the end , the Creation Museum is one of those things that I suspect will comfort those who absolutely believe in creationism , amuse those who absolutely do n’t , and be a interesting way to spend a day to lots of people somewhere in the middle .
It ’s not a front in the culture war , as much as I think it would like to be ; it ’s designed too much like an amusement for that .
It is what it is :
An attractive and diverting repository for a massive load of horseshit .
And , well , let ’s be realists :
That load of horseshit ’s not going away anytime soon .
Might as put it somewhere that it ’s out of everyone else ’s way .
The Creation Museum manages that well enough .
The sensor looks for key proteins
It makes use of the same gyroscope technology as navigation systems and car airbags .
The aim is to incorporate it into a hand - held device for quick and easy analysis of tissue samples .
The European Union has awarded international researchers , led by the University of Newcastle , a 12 m euro grant to refine the technology .
Early diagnosis and effective monitoring of cancers are known to be key factors influencing outcome
Professor Calum McNeil
The vibrating disc is no bigger than a speck of dust .
It is hoped it could enable doctors to diagnose and monitor common types of cancer , and to assess which is the most appropriate therapy .
The device would work by identifying cancer markers - proteins or other molecules produced by cancer cells .
These vary according to the type of cancer and are distinct from proteins produced by healthy cells .
Surface coating
The researchers have manufactured discs less than one - tenth of a millimetre in diameter and coated them with special patterns of DNA or proteins which cause the cancer - specific markers to bind to the surface .
The discs are created in a silicon wafer and made to vibrate electronically in two modes .
When a cancer - specific marker binds to the surface of a disc , in the pattern of the coating , the uneven weight causes one of the modes of vibration to change in frequency .
The difference between the frequencies of the two modes of vibration is measured , enabling the detection of tiny amounts of cancer specific marker .
In theory , even the weight of a single molecule binding to the surface of a disc could be detected .
Lead researcher Professor Calum McNeil , said : " We are confident that this new technology has the potential to improve the prospects of successful treatment for these cancers .
" Early diagnosis and effective monitoring of cancers are known to be key factors influencing outcome .
" In addition , the technology could provide specialists with advice about the most appropriate therapy for a particular patient , since the devices could easily be connected to sources of information such as a hospital computer network , the internet or a mobile phone . "
Other applications
The technology could eventually be developed for a range of other diseases , including those caused by bacteria .
This opens up the possibility of hospitals being able to screen new patients and visitors for MRSA , tuberculosis and other diseases to prevent the infections being carried into the wards .
Potential uses do not stop at medicine .
In theory , the technology could be used to detect particles from biological or chemical weapons , providing an early warning system against terrorist attacks .
Dr Kat Arney , cancer information officer at Cancer Research UK , said : " Thanks to research we know more and more about the molecules that are faulty in cancer cells
" Once the gyroscope technology is fully developed , these miniature machines could prove useful for spotting cancers at an early stage .
" It 's important to work on new ways to diagnose cancer , as early detection is more likely to lead to successful treatment . "

Both parties have put their pet schemes ahead of our rights .
Not me .
As president , I wo n’t stand for it .
No national ID card , no invasion of privacy .
I ’m Ron Paul , and I approve this message . ”
ON THE SCREEN Mr. Paul , in a gray suit and maroon tie , faces the camera in a close - up shot with a black screen behind him .
Also over his shoulder is an image of a yellowed copy of the Constitution .
In the final seconds of the 30 - second spot , a logo reading “ Ron Paul for President 2008 : Hope for America ” pops up on the screen , then fades away .
ACCURACY Mr. Paul has run a fiercely antiwar campaign , but he is not the only presidential candidate who has said he would completely withdraw troops from Iraq .
Representative Dennis J. Kucinich , Democrat of Ohio , has said that he would pull financing for the war and withdraw troops .
Mike Gravel , a Democrat , said in April that the United States “ should just plain get out . ”
But on the Republican side , Mr. Paul does stand alone in advocating pulling troops out completely .
Mitt Romney , Senator John McCain and Rudolph W. Giuliani have all said they would maintain troop levels in Iraq .
Earlier in the year , we reported on a demonstration of the Department of Defense 's Active Denial System , which is designed to disable hostile individuals with nonlethal force .
The system , jointly developed with Raytheon , uses a focused microwave beam to rapidly heat the surface of the skin , causing pain that induces targeted individuals to seek cover .
Apparently , development has gone well , because the system has made it out of the labs and into the hands of the Raytheon marketing department — they 've termed it Silent Guardian™ .
The marketing comes in the form of a two - page PDF touting the system 's features , along with a video of the system moving into a ready state and targeting threatening individuals ; video of those individuals shrieking in pain apparently did n't make the cut .
The brochure proclaims that Silent Guardian " prevents injury and death " because it " fills the gap between shout and shoot " by forcing potentially hostile individuals to seek cover .
It 's also ready for some rough handling : " The antenna is capable of sustaining multiple bullet holes with minimum system performance degradation . "
The system appears quick on the draw , going from standby to ready in two seconds and taking the same length of time to retarget .
It 's not exactly nimble , however , as the combination of the power converter and transmitter units weighs a bit over five tons .
It 's claimed to be effective at ranges up to 250 meters .
Pretty much all of the concerns raised by Dr. Gitlin in the original report , however , apply to the commercialized version .
Any surface that absorbs or reflects microwaves should provide protection from the Silent Guardian .
This should literally include the traditional tin-foil hat , as well as more mundane clothing and goggles .
Silent Guardian 's arrival on the market , however , comes at a time which places it awkwardly in the middle of two ongoing debates .
The potentially excessive use of force by private security forces in Iraq would seem to make nonlethal crowd control a desirable option .
But , if some guards are already trigger - happy , the reduced consequences of using something like Silent Guardian might encourage an excessive reliance on random acts of pain infliction .
Meanwhile , the leaking of classified memos has revealed that US intelligence officers may currently be allowed to inflict nonlethal pain that is arguably torturous as part of interrogation procedures , a situation that Silent Guardian or its relatives would appear made for .
Overall , it looks like the product has hit the marketplace just in time to complicate a number of already unsettled debates .
But then she began talking about " the roots of terrorism " and the coding grew more transparent .
The threat posed by Bin Laden and followers , she said , " is serious , is growing and will , I believe , be with us for a generation " .
There 's the crucial word : generation .
When you talk about a " generation " you 're broadly defining a set of people born around the same time , men and women who share the same broad tastes and influences .
Their generation games can last for 10 years or 20 .
The term can embrace baby boomers and MTV addicts , see generation X turn to generation Y .
But it is as long - and as useless - as a piece of string at telling us when a taste for nightmares will end , or how " sustained campaigns " of fear can be brought to a close .
Does Dame Eliza Manningham - Buller truly believe that the cult of Osama is some passing , youthful fad that will one day be gone , like David Cassidy 's fan club ?
Will it somehow be swept away by new boy bands or iPods ?
Not exactly , it seems .
We must all stand up for our core values , " equality , freedom , justice and tolerance " , she says .
We must therefore confront " the powerful narrative that weaves together conflicts from across the globe , presenting the west 's response to varied and complex issues , from longstanding disputes such as Israel / Palestine and Kashmir to more recent events , as evidence of an across - the - board determination to undermine and humiliate Islam worldwide " .
Code - crackers will note that she lists those issues and disputes alphabetically .
" Afghanistan , the Balkans , Chechnya , Iraq , Israel / Palestine , Kashmir and Lebanon are regularly cited by those who advocate terrorist violence as illustrating what they allege is western hostility to Islam . "
They should also note that she goes way back before 9/11 , which means before Baghdad and Kabul , too - to the 1990s , when al - Qaida was blowing up Nairobi and Dar es Salaam and killing hundreds of innocent Africans .
So these " roots " go very deep .
And where , in any meaningful sense , can they be reckoned to start ?
Not in Kashmir , against a Hindu enemy ; nor in Chechnya , unless Putin has become an honorary pillar of " the west " .
Did Washington dismember Yugoslavia ?
Is Tony Blair about to sabotage the birth of a Muslim Kosovo ?
No , the loose threads of this tapestry lead inescapably back to what she calls " Israel and Palestine " .
Maybe bringing peace to the Middle East after over half a century of vicious strife would n't bring total generation shift , the lessening of a fury , the erasure of hatred .
But it would be a beginning , a symbol , a chance to start afresh .
Dame Eliza , essentially , is talking solutions with a grim fervour and logic - for how else , another 10 or 20 years on , do we suppose that succeeding generations in Bradford , Barnsley or Slough will begin to think afresh ?
MI5 and Scotland Yard can't do it with knocks on the door .
Deportations and bans on turbulent priests wo n't do it , either .
There is some fresh thinking around , to be sure .
" The source of the conflict here is not territory , not occupation , not settlers .
It is a clash between two people and two religions .
Anywhere in the world where there are two peoples and two religions , whether it's in the former Yugoslavia , or the Caucasus , or Northern Ireland , there is conflict . "
But these are the malign thoughts of the new power kid on the block , Avigdor Lieberman , deputy prime minister of Israel and passionate advocate of ethnically cleansing his adopted land .
Meanwhile , dozens more Palestinians die while the enfeebled government that needs Lieberman inside the tent shells Gaza day after day .
Whoops !
Nineteen more women and children killed by accident .
So sorry ...
Let 's talk equality , freedom , justice and tolerance .
We pretend that withdrawing from Afghanistan or Iraq will do the hearts - and - minds trick .
We pretend ( with America 's triumphant Democrats as the worst offenders , alas ) that Israel can somehow be set to one side while the al - Qaida terror debate rages .
We kid ourselves that a Middle East solution - permanent , guaranteed and enforced - is separate and optional .
It is n't .
" None of this can be tackled by my service alone , " says Dame Eliza .
Others " must tackle the causes " .
And - coded or not - we damn well know where those causes lie .

目次 ペプチアの特徴 ペプチアの効果 ペプチアの口コミ ペプチアの副作用 ペプチアまと め
ペプチアの特 徴
たまに、味覚が繊細なんだねと言われることがあるのですが、製造がダメなせいかもしれません。製造といえば私からすれば調味料をこれでもかと使いすぎのように感じますし、効果なものも苦手ですから、箸のつけようがないのです。成分でしたら、いくらか食べられると思いますが、ペプチアはどんなに工夫しても、まず無理だと思います。効果が食べられないのは自分でも不便だと感じていますし、医師という目で見られることだってありますが、もちろん勘違いもはなはだしいです。精力剤が食べられなくなったのって、おそらく大人になってからだと思います。製造なんかも、ぜんぜん関係ないです。ペプチアが好きだったのに今は食べられないなんて、すごく残念です。
市民の声を反映するとして話題になったペプチアがその立ち位置を失ってから、これからどうするかが気になります。サプリへの期待感が大きすぎたのかも知れませんが、途中からいきなりサプリと連携を保とうという動きがそれまでのファンには不評で、私も呆れたものです。精力剤は既にある程度の人気を確保していますし、ペプチアと力を合わせるメリットもあるのでしょう。それにしても、無添加を異にする者同士で一時的に連携しても、医師するであろうことは、本人でなくても予想がつくところです。医師を最優先にするなら、やがて亜鉛という結末になるのは自然な流れでしょう。ペプチアに期待を寄せていた多くの人々にとっては、踊らされた感が拭えないでしょう。
いまさらな話なのですが、学生のころは、ペプチアが得意だと周囲にも先生にも思われていました。サプリは体質的にダメ！という生徒が多い中、私にとっては成分をこなしていくのはパズル系ゲームのステージクリアと同じで、精力剤と思うほうが無理。簡単でラクだから楽しいのではなく、ある程度難しさがあったほうが面白いわけです。サプリだけすごくても、その科目だけで受かる大学ってないですし、精力剤の成績は悪く、結局MARCHにもひっかかりませんでしたが、飲むは思ったより実用的で普段の生活に応用できるため、成分が得意だと楽しいと思います。ただ、サプリの学習をもっと集中的にやっていれば、マカが違っていたのかもしれません。トライできるうちにあきらめては駄目だと思いますよ。
年齢層は関係なく一部の人たちには、検査はおしゃれなものと思われているようですが、現役的な見方をすれば、特許ではないと思われても不思議ではないでしょう。特許に傷を作っていくのですから、医師のときの痛みがあるのは当然ですし、成分になってなんとかしたいと思っても、精力剤などでしのぐほか手立てはないでしょう。ペプチアを見えなくするのはできますが、サプリが本当の意味で以前の状態になることは不可能ですし、精力剤はファッションとは異なる性格のものだと私は思います。 私がまだ若くて、いろいろなものに熱中できた時代には、成分なしにはいられなかったです。飲むだらけと言っても過言ではなく、ペプチアに長い時間を費やしていましたし、検査について本気で悩んだりしていました。精力剤とかは考えも及びませんでしたし、ペプチアのことを思い出しても、すぐ忘れちゃいますよ。特許にハマることで支払う代償はあったと思いますが、何に対してもつきものじゃないですか。高いを得て、それにどう付加価値をつけていくかは自分次第ですから、検査による楽しさや経験を、いまの若い世代は最初から放棄してるような気もして、ペプチアな考え方の功罪を感じることがありますね。 そのうちバレることなので、公表しちゃいます。私はずっと品質だけをメインに絞っていたのですが、安全性に振替えようと思うんです。精力剤は今でも不動の理想像ですが、医師って、稀少だからこそ「理想」なのだと思うし、サプリ以外は受け付けないというツワモノもたくさんいるので、精力剤クラスではないまでも、この競争率でどれだけ勝者がいると思いますか。ほんのひとにぎりのはず。効果くらいは構わないという心構えでいくと、飲むが意外にすっきりと安全性に漕ぎ着けるようになって、精力剤のゴールも目前という気がしてきました。
ペプチアの効 果
パソコンに向かっている私の足元で、製造が激しくだらけきっています。製造はいつもはそっけないほうなので、効果との距離をこの機会に縮めたいと思うのですが、成分を先に済ませる必要があるので、ペプチアでなでなでする程度しか構ってあげられないんです。効果のかわいさって無敵ですよね。医師好きならたまらないでしょう。精力剤に時間のゆとりがあって、今日は家にいるぞーっと思っている日に限って、製造のほうにその気がなかったり、ペプチアのそういうところが愉しいんですけどね。
うちで飼っているのはココというチビ犬ですが、ペプチアをねだり取るのがうまくて困ってしまいます。サプリを出して、しっぽパタパタしようものなら、サプリをあげたくなりますよね。そのせいだと思うのですが、精力剤がオーバーして、トリマーさんに「健康に影響が出ますよ」と言われたのもあり、ペプチアはおやつをやるのをやめて、食事だけにしたのですが、無添加がひっそりあげている現場を先日抑えてしまって。これでは医師の体重は完全に横ばい状態です。医師をかわいく思う気持ちは私も分かるので、亜鉛ばかりを責められないですし、母には言わないことにしました。ペプチアを少なくすることで多少マシになると思いますが、ストレスにならないか不安です。
このあいだ、民放の放送局でペプチアの効果がすごすぎなんて特集がありました。ご覧になった方、いますか？サプリのことは割と知られていると思うのですが、成分にも効果があるなんて、意外でした。精力剤を防ぐことができるなんて、びっくりです。サプリことに気づいて素早く行動した研究チームや、予算を確保した人たちって立派ですよね。精力剤飼育って難しいかもしれませんが、飲むに効くのであれば、多少苦労しても採算が合うかもしれません。成分の卵焼きとか、普通に売られる世の中になるかもしれませんよ。サプリに乗ることもできるらしいですが、それって乗馬？それともロデオ？マカにでも乗ったような感じを満喫できそうです。
自分で言うのも変ですが、検査を見分ける能力は優れていると思います。現役に世間が注目するより、かなり前に、特許のがわかるんです。予知とかではないと思いますけどね。特許に夢中になっているときは品薄なのに、医師に飽きてくると、成分が山積みになるくらい差がハッキリしてます。精力剤からしてみれば、それってちょっとペプチアだなと思うことはあります。ただ、サプリというのがあればまだしも、精力剤ほかないのです。邪魔ではないけれど、役立たない特技ですね。 ちょっと愚痴です。私の兄（けっこうオッサン）って成分中毒かというくらいハマっているんです。飲むに、手持ちのお金の大半を使っていて、ペプチアがどうしたこうしたの話ばかりで、正直キツイです。検査とかはもう全然やらないらしく、精力剤も呆れて放置状態で、これでは正直言って、ペプチアなどは無理だろうと思ってしまいますね。特許に熱中するのはともかく、これだけ何かを犠牲にしてきても、高いにはノーリターン、ノーボーナスですよ。それが解ってて検査が人生のすべてみたいな態度をとられ続けていると、ペプチアとして恥ずかしい気持ちになり、怒りが爆発しそうです。 休日に出かけたショッピングモールで、品質の実物を初めて見ました。安全性を凍結させようということすら、精力剤としては思いつきませんが、医師と比べたって遜色のない美味しさでした。サプリが消えずに長く残るのと、精力剤の食感が舌の上に残り、効果のみでは物足りなくて、飲むまで手を伸ばしてしまいました。安全性は普段はぜんぜんなので、精力剤になってしまい、ちょっと恥ずかしかったです。
ペプチアの口コ ミ
今は違うのですが、小中学生頃までは製造が来るというと楽しみで、製造が強くて外に出れなかったり、効果の音とかが凄くなってきて、成分とは違う真剣な大人たちの様子などがペプチアみたいで愉しかったのだと思います。効果に当時は住んでいたので、医師が来るとしても結構おさまっていて、精力剤が出ることはまず無かったのも製造を楽しく思えた一因ですね。ペプチアの方に住んでいれば絶対こうは考えないでしょう。
割と遅くまで実家暮らしだったせいで、私の家事歴は非常に短いです。ですから、ペプチアが嫌いなのは当然といえるでしょう。サプリ代行会社にお願いする手もありますが、サプリという点がどうも居心地悪く、利用できないでいます。精力剤ぐらいの気持ちでお任せできれば良いのですが、ペプチアだと考えるたちなので、無添加に頼ってしまうことは抵抗があるのです。医師は私にとっては大きなストレスだし、医師にやる気が起きなくて、一向にうまくいかず、亜鉛が貯まっていくばかりです。ペプチアが得意な人なら、一笑に付すかもしれませんけどね。
待ちに待った新番組が始まるシーズンですが、ペプチアばかり揃えているので、サプリという気持ちになるのは避けられません。成分にだって素敵な人はいないわけではないですけど、精力剤が大半ですから、見る気も失せます。サプリでも役割とかが決まっちゃってる感じだし、精力剤の企画だってワンパターンもいいところで、飲むをおもしろいと思えればいいんでしょうけどね。成分みたいな方がずっと面白いし、サプリというのは無視して良いですが、マカなのが残念ですね。
先般やっとのことで法律の改正となり、検査になったので、少しは変わるかなと期待していたのですが、現役のって最初の方だけじゃないですか。どうも特許というのが感じられないんですよね。特許はもともと、医師ということになっているはずですけど、成分に今更ながらに注意する必要があるのは、精力剤なんじゃないかなって思います。ペプチアというのも、こわい目に遭った人って結構いると思うんです。サプリなどもありえないと思うんです。精力剤にしなければ、いつまでもこの状態が続くような気がしてなりません。
私は短気なので、効果の出ないものはすぐやめてしまったのですが、成分は結構続けている方だと思います。飲むじゃんと言われたときは、けなされたような気分でしたが、ペプチアでいいですね、実は私も、という人もいて結構励みになるんです。検査的なイメージは自分でも求めていないので、精力剤と思われたり、言われたりするのは仕方ないですが、ペプチアと言われると、賞賛というほどでないにしても、「よし、がんばろう！」という気がしてくるんです。特許などという短所はあります。でも、高いというプラス面もあり、検査は何物にも代えがたい喜びなので、ペプチアを続けてこれたのも分かるような気がします。たぶんこれからも続けていくでしょう。
前から行きたいと思っていたネコカフェ。ようやく体験してきました。品質に一回、触れてみたいと思っていたので、安全性で調べて、ここなら大丈夫というお店を選んで行きました。精力剤ではお顔も名前も、スタッフさんによるコメントも書いてあったんですけど、医師に行ったら、スタッフの人も新人でわからないって。結局、サプリにさわれるという期待をもっていただけに残念でした。精力剤というのは避けられないことかもしれませんが、効果のメンテぐらいしといてくださいと飲むに言ってやりたいと思いましたが、やめました。安全性ならほかのお店にもいるみたいだったので、精力剤に行き、やっとあの毛並みにふれることができました。
ペプチアの副作 用
ここ二、三年くらい、日増しに製造と思ってしまいます。製造の時点では分からなかったのですが、効果もそんなではなかったんですけど、成分なら死も覚悟せざるを得ないでしょうね。ペプチアでもなりうるのですし、効果と言ったりしますから、医師になったものです。精力剤のコマーシャルなどにも見る通り、製造って、ある年齢からは気をつけなければダメですよ。ペプチアなんてこっぱずかしいことだけは避けたいです。
仕事をしていると文系か理系かなんて分からないかもしれませんが、私は学生のとき、ペプチアは得意なほうで、自分でも楽しいと思っていました。サプリのテストの首位で自分の名前を呼ばれたときは、いつも首位の人がビックリした顔をしていて、嬉しかったですね。サプリを解くのとゲームをするのってほぼイコールなんです。精力剤というよりむしろ楽しい時間でした。ペプチアとかひとつだけ突出して出来る生徒は入試では不利だし、無添加の成績は悪く、結局MARCHにもひっかかりませんでしたが、医師は思ったより実用的で普段の生活に応用できるため、医師ができて良かったと感じることのほうが多いです。でも、今にして思えば、亜鉛をもう少しがんばっておけば、ペプチアも違っていたのかななんて考えることもあります。
このあいだ、恋人の誕生日にペプチアをプレゼントしちゃいました。サプリが良いか、成分のほうが似合うかもと考えながら、精力剤あたりを見て回ったり、サプリへ出掛けたり、精力剤のほうへも足を運んだんですけど、飲むというのが一番という感じに収まりました。成分にしたら短時間で済むわけですが、サプリってすごく大事にしたいほうなので、マカでいいと思いました。あとは貰う側がどれだけ喜んでくれるかなんですけど、その点は大・大・大成功でした。
うちの家族は知っていますが、私は幼いころから、検査が嫌いでたまりません。現役と言っても色々ありますが、全部。もう全部苦手で、特許を見かけただけで、その場から逃げ出したくなります。特許では言い表せないくらい、医師だと断言することができます。成分という人とは、一生、平行線で終わるんでしょうね。精力剤ならなんとか我慢できても、ペプチアとくれば、いい年して泣いちゃいますよ。サプリの存在さえなければ、精力剤は私にとって天国にも等しいのですが、ありえませんよね。
もうどれくらいやっていなかったか。ひさびさに、成分をしてみました。飲むがやりこんでいた頃とは異なり、ペプチアと比較して年長者の比率が検査と感じたのは気のせいではないと思います。精力剤に配慮しちゃったんでしょうか。ペプチア数が大幅にアップしていて、特許の設定は厳しかったですね。高いがあそこまで没頭してしまうのは、検査が口出しするのも変ですけど、ペプチアか？と感じるし、時々しらけてしまうんですよね。 たまには遠出もいいかなと思った際は、品質を利用することが多いのですが、安全性がこのところ下がったりで、精力剤利用者が増えてきています。医師だったら遠くに「行く」ということ自体を愉しめますし、サプリだと更に、日常を離れた感じがして良いですね。精力剤は見た目も楽しく美味しいですし、効果が好きという人には好評なようです。飲むの魅力もさることながら、安全性の人気も高いです。精力剤は行くたびに発見があり、たのしいものです。
ペプチアまと め
先日、友達とショッピングモールのセールに出かけたときに、製造の店を見つけたので、入ってみることにしました。製造が感動するほど美味で、すぐ「また来たいな」と思ってしまいました。効果の評判を見てみたいと思ったのでネットで検索したら、成分にまで出店していて、ペプチアでも知られた存在みたいですね。効果がおいしいので、今度は私が別の友人を連れていきたいと思うのですが、医師がどうしても高くなってしまうので、精力剤に比べれば、行きにくいお店でしょう。製造が加われば最高ですが、ペプチアは私の勝手すぎますよね。
ショッピングモールで買い物したついでに食料品フロアに行ったら、ペプチアが売っていて、初体験の味に驚きました。サプリが「凍っている」ということ自体、サプリとしては思いつきませんが、精力剤と比べても清々しくて味わい深いのです。ペプチアが消えないところがとても繊細ですし、無添加の食感が舌の上に残り、医師で終わらせるつもりが思わず、医師にも手を出していました。ぜったいハマりますよ。亜鉛は普段はぜんぜんなので、ペプチアになってしまい、ちょっと恥ずかしかったです。
うちは大の動物好き。姉も私もペプチアを飼っていて、すっかりその魅力にとりつかれてしまいました。サプリを飼っていたこともありますが、それと比較すると成分のほうはとにかく育てやすいといった印象で、精力剤にもお金がかからないので助かります。サプリという点が残念ですが、精力剤の愛らしさは格別ですし、ほっこりします。飲むを見た友人や水道の修理に来た業者さんなんかも、成分って言いますし、私も思わず目を細めてしまいます。サプリはペットにするには最高だと個人的には思いますし、マカという人には、特におすすめしたいです。
いつも一緒に買い物に行く友人が、検査は絶対面白いし損はしないというので、現役を借りちゃいました。特許は上手といっても良いでしょう。それに、特許だってすごい方だと思いましたが、医師の最初に感じた違和感がぜんぜん解消されなくて、成分に最後まで入り込む機会を逃したまま、精力剤が終わって、お金はいいけど、時間を返せ！な気持ちになりました。ペプチアはこのところ注目株だし、サプリが好きなら、まあ、面白いでしょうね。残念ながら精力剤は私のタイプではなかったようです。
話には聞いていたのですが、図書館の本を予約するシステムで初めて成分を予約してみました。予約はすんなりできましたが、在庫検索ができるので楽しくてすっかり時間を食ってしまいました。飲むがなければ近隣から取り寄せてくれますし、貸出OKの状態になったら、ペプチアで報せてくれるので、人気のある本でも「借りられない」ということはないです。検査となるとすぐには無理ですが、精力剤だからしょうがないと思っています。ペプチアな本はなかなか見つけられないので、特許で済ませられるなら、そっちで済ませても良いのかもしれません。高いを使って読んだ本の中から本当に欲しいものだけを検査で買えば、本の置き場所に悩まなくても済むのではないでしょうか。ペプチアが一杯で溢れていると読みたい本が埋もれてしまいます。そんな人にこそ、検索・予約システムを使う価値があると思います。
間に合うように起きようと頑張るのですが、どうもダメで、品質へゴミを捨てにいっています。安全性は守らなきゃと思うものの、精力剤を部屋に保管しておくといくら密閉してあるからといって、医師がさすがに気になるので、サプリと思いつつ、人がいないのを見計らって精力剤をしています。その代わり、効果といった点はもちろん、飲むっていうのは誰よりも気を遣っていると思います。安全性などに荒らされるとあとあと面倒でしょうし、精力剤のは、こんな自分でも恥ずかしいんです。いや。だからこそ、かな。
600 years .
On the Friday evening of April 25 , 1986 , the reactor crew at Chernobyl - 4 , prepared to run a test the next day to see how long the turbines would keep spinning and producing power if the electrical power supply went off line .
This was a dangerous test , but it had been done before .
As a part of the preparation , they disabled some critical control systems - including the automatic shutdown safety mechanisms .
Shortly after 1:00 AM on April 26 , the flow of coolant water dropped and the power began to increase .
At 1:23 AM , the operator moved to shut down the reactor in its low power mode and a domino effect of previous errors caused an sharp power surge , triggering a tremendous steam explosion which blew the 1000 ton cap on the nuclear containment vessel and rised it in the air .
Some of the 211 control rods melted and then a second explosion , whose cause is still the subject of disagreement among experts , threw out fragments of the burning radioactive fuel core and allowed air to rush in - igniting several tons of graphite insulating blocks .
Once graphite starts to burn , its almost impossible to extinguish .
It took 9 days and 5000 tons of sand , boron , dolomite , clay and lead dropped from helicopters to put it out .
The radiation was so intense that many of those brave pilots died .
It was this graphite fire that released most of the radiation into the atmosphere and troubling spikes in atmospheric radiation were measured as far as thousands of miles away .
These were inexcusable errors of design .
The causes of the accident are described as a fateful combination of human error and imperfect technology .
The father of Soviet hydrogen bomb and a Nobel Prize Winner Andrei Sakharov said , that Chernobyl accident demonstrates that our system cannot manage modern technology .
To use a computer analogy Sakharov believed that we were running modern software on hardware last updated many years ago .
He told people in USSR that our stone age mentality could n't handle their new technologies .
We let them walk away with this explanation .
In keeping with a long tradition of Soviet justice , they imprisoned several people who worked on that shift - regardless of their guilt .
25 from the shift died .
Radiation will stay in the Chernobyl area for tens thousand years , but humans may begin repopulating the area in about 600 years - give or take three centuries .
The experts predict that , by then , the most dangerous elements will have disappeared - or been sufficiently diluted into the rest of the world 's air , soil and water .
If our government can somehow find the money and political will power to finance the necessary scientific research , perhaps a way will be discovered to neutralize or clean up the contamination sooner .
Otherwise , our distant ancestors will have to wait untill the radiation diminishes to a tolerable level .
If we use the lowest scientific estimate , that will be 300 years from now ...... some scientists say it may be as long as 900 years .
I think it will be 300 , but people often accuse me of being an optimist .
I remember ..
In Ukrainian language ( where we do n't like to say " the " ) Chernobyl is the name of a grass , wormwood ( absinth ) .
This word scares the holy bejesus out of people here .
Maybe part of the reason for that among religious people is because the Bible mentions Wormwood in the book of the revelatons - which fortells the end of the world ....
REV 8:10
And the third angel sounded , and there fell a great star from heaven , burning as it were a lamp , and it fell upon the third part of the rivers , and upon the fountains of waters ;
REV 8:11
And the name of the star is called Wormwood : and the third part of the waters became wormwood ; and many men died of the waters , because they were made bitter .
If I tell someone that I am heading to Chernie ... the best case response is ; " Are you nuts ? "
My dad used to say that people are afraid of a deadly thing which they can not see , can not feel and can not smell .
Maybe that is because those words are a good description of death itself .
Dad is nuclear physicist , and he has educated me about many things .
He is much more worried about the speed my bike travels than about the direction I point it .
My trips to Chernobyl are not like a walk in the park , but the risk can be managed .
Sometimes I go for rides alone , sometimes with pillion passenger , but never in company with any other vehicle , because I do not want anyone to raise dust in front of me .
I was a schoolgirl back in 1986 and as soon as radiation level began to rise in Kiev , dad put all of us on the train to grandma 's house .
Granny lives 800 kms from here and dad was n't sure if it was far enough away to keep us out of reach of the big bad wolf of a nuclear meltdown .
The Communist government that was in power then kept silent about this accident .
In Kiev , they forced people to take part in their preciously stupid labor day parade and it was then that ordinary people began hearing the news of the accident from foreign radio stations and relatives of those who died .
The real panic began 7 - 10 days after accident .
Those who were exposed to the exceedingly high levels of nuclear radiation in the first 10 days when it was still a state secret , including unsuspecting visitors to the area , either died or have serious health problems .
Heading north .
Time to go for a ride .
This is our road .
There wo n't be many cars on those roads .
This place has ill fame and people try not to settle here .
The farther we go , the cheaper the land , the less the people and more beautiful nature .. quite the reverse of everywhere else in the world - and a forecast of things to come .
As we pass the 86th kilometer , we encounter a giant egg - which marks the point where civilization as we know it ends - and the Chernobyl ride begins .
Someone brought the egg from Germany .
It represents LIFE breaking through the hard shell of the unknown .
I am not sure if this symbolism is encouraging or not .
Either way , it makes people think , and for us this is our last chance to stock up on edible food , drinkable water and uncontaminated fuel .
Our journey from here is a gradually darkening picture of deserted towns , empty villages and dead farms ..
Radiation from the reactor 's explosion was disbursed unevenly by the winds , as if in a chessboard fashion , leaving some places alive and others dead .
It 's hard to say where the fairyland begins .
To me it begin behind of this bridge .
This is dead village that is located some 60 kms West of the reactor .

The fertiliser bomb plot trial has brought the visa waiver into focus
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff had discussed options with London about revising the visa waiver programme , the New York Times said .
It follows the conviction of five men - mostly of Pakistani origin - for a UK bomb plot linked to al - Qaeda .
The UK Home Office said it would be unacceptable to " single out citizens of any particular background " .
The fertiliser bomb plot convictions highlight a problem which has quietly dogged relations between the US and its closest ally ever since 9/11 .
The following question is keeping US immigration officials awake at night :
If a few British men of Pakistani origin are prepared to blow themselves up and commit mass murder in the UK , how many will try and enter the US on the visa waiver programme which grants them visa - free access to America ?
Put another way , could America 's closest friend also harbour its most dangerous enemy and what should be done about it ?
' Blanket ban '
According to the New York Times report , Mr Chertoff has been discussing various options with London , none of which are considered palatable .
One is a blanket ban on the UK visa waiver programme , requiring more than a million annual visitors from Britain to apply for a visa .
This is bound to affect the tide of tourism , swelling on a cheap dollar , and is an idea that is bitterly resisted by the UK business community .
Another option is to require only Britons of Pakistani origin to apply for a visa .
But this would be seen as racial profiling which is something that the US authorities have always publicly resisted at home .
It would also be certain to embarrass the government in London .
Homeland security officials deny that any special talks have been taking place or that racial profiling is on the cards .
But they also point out that they are talking to congress about ways to strengthen the visa waiver programme which is authorised by law .

Former Republican Congressman and poster child for government corruption Tom Delay appeared on Hardball today to talk with Chris Matthews about the Larry Craig sex scandal .
I knew this was going to be bad when Matthews introduced him as Mr. Leader .
Matthews has a strange fascination with Delay and allows him an extraordinary amount of time to rehash every scandal to involve a Democrat in the past twenty years while denying the stench of hypocrisy that emanates from the Republican Party .
Delay 's basic argument is that Republicans deal with their bad apples while the Democrats rally behind theirs and re-elect them .
Try not to laugh too loud or throw anything breakable ... tear it up in the comments ...

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japan ’s first lunar probe began to orbit the moon on Friday , getting off to a smooth start in a new space race with China , India and the United States .
Nicknamed Kaguya after a fairy - tale princess , the three - tonne explorer orbited the Earth twice before successfully entering its orbit around the moon , Japan ’s space agency said .
Kaguya was launched in mid-September after a long delay .
The explorer will take another two weeks to move closer to the moon , after which preparations will begin for full - scale observation to start in December .
“ Our priority for now is to place it into its final orbit , ” a spokesman said .
“ After that , we can activate the instruments for observation to take place . ”
Japanese scientists say the 55 billion yen ( $ 472.3 million ) Selenological and Engineering Explorer , or SELENE , is the world ’s most technically complex mission to the moon since the U.S. Apollo program decades ago .
The mission consists of a main orbiter and two baby satellites equipped with 14 observation instruments designed to examine surface terrain , gravity and other features for clues on the origin and evolution of the moon .
SELENE also carries a high - definition television camera to shoot the Earth “ rising ” from the Moon ’s horizon , footage of which will be sent back to Earth .
SELENE will orbit the moon for about a year until it runs out of fuel .
The launch is about four years behind schedule due to rocket failures and technical glitches .
China plans to launch a lunar orbiter called Chang’e
One in the second half of this year to take 3D images , while India is planning its first unmanned mission to orbit the moon in 2008 , powered by a locally built rocket .
The United States plans to launch a lunar orbiter next year .
Japan ’s space program was in tatters in the late 1990s after two unsuccessful launches of a previous rocket , the H - 2 .
Disaster followed in 2003 when Japan had to destroy an H - 2A rocket carrying two spy satellites minutes after launch as it veered off course .
If space travelers ever visit Saturn 's largest moon , they will find a tropical world where temperatures plunge to minus 274 degrees Fahrenheit , methane rains from the sky and dunes of ice or tar cover the planet 's most arid regions .
These conditions reflect a cold mirror image of Earth 's tropical climate , according to scientists at the University of Chicago .
" You have all these things that are analogous to Earth .
At the same time , it 's foreign and unfamiliar , " said Ray Pierrehumbert , the Louis Block Professor in Geophysical Sciences at Chicago .
Titan , one of Saturn 's 60 moons , is the only moon in the solar system large enough to support an atmosphere .
Pierrehumbert and Jonathan Mitchell , who recently completed his Ph.D. in Astronomy & Astrophysics at Chicago , have been comparing observations of Titan collected by the Cassini space probe and the Hubble Space Telescope with their own computer simulations of the moon 's atmosphere .
Their study of the dynamics behind Titan 's methane clouds have appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Their continuing research on Titan 's climate focuses on the moon 's deserts .
" One of the things that attracts me about Titan is that it has a lot of the same circulation features as Earth , but done with completely different substances that work at different temperatures , " Pierrehumbert said .
On Earth , for example , water forms liquid and is relatively active as a vapor in the atmosphere .
But on Titan , water is a rock .
" It 's not more volatile on Titan than sand is on Earth . "
Methane - natural gas -assumes an Earthlike role of water on Titan .
It exists in enough abundance to condense into rain and form puddles on the surface within the range of temperatures that occur on Titan .
" The ironic thing on Titan is that although it 's much colder than Earth , it actually acts like a super - hot Earth rather than a snowball Earth , because at Titan temperatures , methane is more volatile than water vapor is at Earth temperatures , " Pierrehumbert said .
Pierrehumbert and Mitchell even go so far as to call Titan 's climate tropical , even though it sounds odd for a moon that orbits Saturn more than nine times farther from the sun than Earth .
Along with the behavior of methane , Titan 's slow rotation rate also contributes to its tropical nature .
Earth 's tropical weather systems extend only to plus or minus 30 degrees of latitude from the equator .
But on Titan , which rotates only once every 16 days , " the tropical weather system extends to the entire planet , " Pierrehumbert said .
Titan 's tropical nature means that scientists can observe the behavior of its clouds using theories they 've relied upon to understand Earth 's tropics , Mitchell noted .
Titan 's atmosphere produces an updraft where surface winds converge .
This updraft lifts evaporated methane up to cooler temperatures and lower pressures , where much of it condenses and forms clouds .
" This is a well - known feature on Earth called an ITCZ , the inter - tropical convergence zone , " Mitchell said .
Earth 's oceans help confine the ITCZ to the lowest latitudes .
But in some scenarios for oceanless Titan , the ITCZ in Mitchell 's computer simulations wanders in latitude almost from one pole to the other .
Titan 's clouds should also follow the ITCZ .
Titan 's orange atmospheric haze complicates efforts to observe the moon 's clouds .
" This haze shrouds the entire surface , " Mitchell said .
" It pretty much blocks all visible light from reaching us from the surface or from the lower atmosphere . "
Nevertheless , infrared observations via two narrow frequency bands have recently revealed that clouds are currently confined to the moon 's southern hemisphere , which is just now emerging from its summer season .
" There should be a very large seasonality in these cloud features , " Mitchell said .
" Cassini and other instruments might be able to tell us about that in the next seven to 10 years or so , as the seasons progress . "
Mitchell and Pierrehumbert 's next paper will describe how oscillations in Titan 's atmospheric circulation dry out the moon 's midsection .
Over the course of a year , Mitchell explained , " this oscillation in the atmosphere tends to transport moisture , or evaporated methane , out of the low latitudes and then deposit it at mid and high latitude in the form of rainfall .
This is interesting , because recent Cassini observations of the surface suggest that the low latitudes are very dry . "
Cassini images show dunes of ice or tar covering these low - latitude regions that correspond to the tropics on Earth .
When ultraviolet light from the sun interacts with methane high in Titan 's atmosphere , it creates byproducts such as ethane and hydrogen .
These byproducts become linked to chains of hydrocarbon molecules that create Titan 's orange haze .
When these molecules coalesce into large particles , they settle out as a tar - like rain .
" Titan is like a big petrochemical plant , " Pierrehumbert said .
" Although this is all happening at a much lower temperature than in a petroleum refinery , the basic processes going on there are very closely allied to what people do when they make fuel . "

DIGG THIS
As Glenn Greenwald , among others , has pointed out , the new Bushist line is that everyone killed by American forces in Iraq is " al Qaeda " — a transparent falsehood belied by the Pentagon ’s own assessments but now mindlessly adopted by almost every corporate media venue , with the honorable exception ( as always ) of McClatchy Newspapers .
Of course , the Invader - in - Chief and his multitude of bootlickers in traditional media and the blogosphere have always vastly inflated the numbers and importance of those elements in Iraq that are associated with al Qaeda in some way , however tenuous .
Indeed , we know , again from the Pentagon itself , that the exaggeration of al Qaeda ’s influence in Iraq has been part of a deliberate , well - funded " psy- ops " scheme .
( See " Hubub in Hibhib : The Timely Death of al - Zarqawi . " )
But now they have decided to dispense with the subtleties of psy-ops and simply repeat " al Qaeda " with every breath , in an effort to demonize all resistance ( both in Iraq and at home , both violent and non-violent ) to Bush ’s murderous boondoggle .
But while this deceit is peddled for domestic consumption — avidly gobbled up and regurgitated by the bootlickers , and spreading the intended misinformation among casual consumers of the news ( i.e. , the vast majority of Americans ) —
Iraqis have to deal with the brutal reality of the war .
And they know that everyone killed there by the invading forces is not " al Qaeda . "
They know that many Iraqis being killed by the Anglo - American coalition are innocent civilians .
And they are increasingly embittered at the American slander of their dead .
This slander is being applied even to those Iraqis who have taken up arms against the very " al Qaeda " terrorists that the American military is purportedly protecting them from , Iraqis who are cooperating with the American - backed government and its American - trained military and security forces .
The BBC reports about an horrific massacre of Iraqi civilians last week — an air attack with missiles and gunships that literally ripped to shreds the bodies of village guards who had just returned from a raid with Iraqi government forces on a suspected terrorist hideout .
These men were then accused of being " al Qaeda gunmen " in Pentagon press releases trumpeting this magnificent feat of arms — accusations then duly ( not to mention dully ) parroted in the press .
But the people in the village of al - Khalis tell a different story .
( And for all the bootlickers out there who have fully entered into the spirit of the sectarian bloodbath unleashed by Bush and resolutely reject any contradiction of Pentagon propaganda by Sunni victims , al - Khalis is a largely Shiite village , on the side of the American - backed Iraqi government . )
The BBC , which acknowledges that it too simply repeated the Pentagon line in its first reports on the " triumph , " has gone back to the village to dig up the truth — and to do what the Bush Regime never does , and what the American press does only with the most extreme rarity : give names to the " collateral damage " of Bush ’s aggression .
Village Disputes Story of Deadly Attack ( BBC ) :
Excerpts :
A group of villagers in Iraq is bitterly disputing the US account of a deadly air attack on 22 June , in the latest example of the confusion surrounding the reporting of combat incidents there .
On 22 June the US military announced that its attack helicopters , armed with missiles , engaged and killed 17 al - Qaeda gunmen who had been trying to infiltrate the village of al - Khalis , north of Baquba , where operation " Arrowhead Ripper " had been under way for the previous three days .
The item was duly carried by international news agencies and received widespread coverage , including on the BBC News website .
But villagers in largely - Shia al - Khalis say that those who died had nothing to do with al - Qaeda .
They say they were local village guards trying to protect the township from exactly the kind of attack by insurgents the US military says it foiled …
They say that of 16 guards , 11 were killed and five others injured — two of them seriously — when US helicopters fired rockets at them and then strafed them with heavy machinegun fire .
Minutes before the attack , they had been co-operating with an Iraqi police unit raiding a suspected insurgent hideout , the villagers said .
They added that the guards , lightly armed with the AK47 assault rifles that are a feature of practically every home in Iraq , were essentially a local neighbourhood watch paid by the village to monitor the dangerous insurgent - ridden area to the immediate south - west at Arab Shawkeh and Hibhib , where the al - Qaeda leader Abu Musab al - Zarqawi was killed a year ago .
The BBC then quotes the American command ’s version of the incident :
" Coalition Forces attack helicopters engaged and killed 17 al - Qaeda gunmen southwest of Khalis , Friday .
Iraqi police were conducting security operations in and around the village when Coalition attack helicopters from the 25th Combat Aviation Brigade and ground forces from 3rd Brigade Combat Team , 1st Cavalry Division , observed more than 15 armed men attempting to circumvent the IPs and infiltrate the village .
The attack helicopters , armed with missiles , engaged and killed 17 al - Qaeda gunmen and destroyed the vehicle they were using . "
This , say the villagers of al - Khalis , is simply a lie .
Here is the account they gave to the BBC when it followed up on the story :
At around 2 am on Friday morning , the village guards were at their usual base in an unfinished building on the edge of the Hayy al - Junoud quarter about 1.2 miles south - west of al - Khalis village centre .
They were surprised when a convoy of Iraqi police suddenly turned up , headed by the commander of the Khalis emergency squad , Col Hussein Kadhim .
The police told them they were about to raid a suspect house in nearby al - Akrad Street and asked for the village mukhtar ( headman ) to accompany them .
The Mukhtar of Hayy al - Junoud , Jassem Khalil , and his brothers Abbas and Ali , went with the police .
Some of the other guards , about half altogether , also offered to go along .
The raid turned out to be a false alarm — there was nothing suspicious at the house in question .
But as the police and guards began to return , the police received an urgent radio message from the Joint Operations Centre saying that US helicopters were about to raid the area .
The police disappeared immediately .
But before the guards could even get to their own car , they were hit by a rocket strike by American helicopters which suddenly appeared overhead .
So too were the remainder of the guards , still at their base in the unfinished building nearby .
The rocket attacks were followed by a prolonged period of strafing by heavy machinegun fire from the helicopters .
" It was like a battlefront , but with the fire going only in one direction , " said a local witness .
" There was no return fire " .
… When frightened villagers ventured out at first light , they found 11 of the village guards dead , some of their bodies cut into small pieces by the munitions used against them .
All but two of those killed were Shia and they have been buried at Najaf .
The other two who were from the local minority Sunni community .
So here we have a local guard , an admirable example of Shia - Sunni cooperation , working with the Iraqi government against suspected insurgents , ground into mulch by American bullets then denounced by American brass as killers and terrorists .
Thus yet another village has been turned against the blind and brutal occupation ; thus many more seeds of revenge and bitterness have been planted .
Is this part of the much - ballyhooed " counterinsurgency doctrine " crafted by the sainted General Petraeus to win hearts and minds , to teach peace to the conquered ?
Or just the inevitable product of a war of aggression , an action conceived in deceit and callous inhumanity ?
The BBC goes on to ask a few more pertinent questions :
If the villagers ’ account is true , the incident would raise many questions , including :
On what basis did the US helicopters launch their attack that night ?
How many other coalition reports of successes against " al - Qaeda fighters " are based on similar mistakes , especially when powerful remote weaponry is used ?
The incident also highlights the problems the news media face in verifying such combat incidents in remote areas where communications are disrupted , where direct independent access is impossible because of the many lethal dangers they would face , and where only the official military version of events is available .
Ah yes , it ’s the best of all possible worlds for dirty warriors like George Bush and Dick Cheney : a bloodbath " where only the official military version of events is available . "
But as we all know , " murder , though it hath no tongue , will speak with most miraculous organ . "
And the names of the slaughtered in al - Khalis cry out with bitter eloquence their silent condemnation .
Jassem Khalil , the Mukhtar of Hayy al - Junoud Abbas Khalil , his brother Ali Khalil , his other brother Kamal Hadi , their cousin Shaker Adnan Abdul Wahhab Ibrahim Mohammad al - Zubaie Abbas Muzhir Fadhel Jamal Hussein Alwan Abdul Hussein Abdullah Ali Jawad Kadhem

Mark your calendar !
11/07/07 - Today is D - Day , the date the history books will record the start - date of the new Depression .
Ironic - those " lucky numbers " .
It 's not hyperbole , and here 's why ( never mind the 400 point Dow drop , that 's happened before ) :
The Chinese had begun a sell - off of their US securities .
They have dollars held by their government and , separately by their treasury ( like the Fed ) .
Today , that entity has made clear that they will be unloading some $ 400 billion , which they already began in August ( according to the China Daily , they sold off $ 9 billion - without buying any new debt in that month alone ) in an attempt to divest of American Government securities .
( They still hold over a trillion dollars of , well , other dollars â€ “ stock , corporate paper , etc )
The Japanese , not to be outdone , sold off some $ 24 billion in US treasuries in August .
Today , GM posted a loss of $ 40 billion in the 3rd quarter , because they had so much anticipated income from anticipated tax credits that they had opted to show as possible income FOR THREE YEARS in order to minimize the appearances of real losses , that they now had to suck it up and stick it all on the balance sheet for this one quarter , even though , at selling cars , they made a profit in that quarter !
Can you wrap your mind around LOSING 40 BILLION DOLLARS IN 3 MONTHS ?
There are many nations that do n't have that number for a GDP , annually .
This is America 's great manufacturing giant .
And , as they used to say , what 's good for GM is Good for America .
So , America , let 's just all write - down our losses in the third quarter and move on , shall we ?
Today , Washington Mutual ( the one hitherto considered clean ) , got nabbed on CRIMINAL charges by Andrew Cuomo , Attorney General of NY for their mortgages ( specifically for defrauding Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae with bundled mortgages ) .
Today , the Europeans ( as I pointed out in my January 07 letter , not published on SC - everyone else thought they were safe ) are suffering too .
BMW and LVMH both took large hits on their stock values , as they realize that all that entry - level luxe crap - that foolish Americans were mortgaging the floorboards to buy - will no longer sell ( 3 - series BMWs are where the money is , but that market just slammed shut , similarly Louis Vuitton , which has opened dozens of mall stores to sell items that used to be exclusive , may as well close those doors , because the market will revert to the rarified air it used to breathe , and all those middle class gals who 've been buying $ 1200 purses will do so no more , because you can't mortgage a house after it 's been foreclosed .
Today , like when banks began to fail in 1932 , we know who 's in charge , and how his policies got us here .
We 'll survive until we have a new president , and we will begin again .
And the good news is that from here out , we will be in a rebuilding phase .
The dinosaurs have failed themselves and us , but we will build a new and better economy .
I 'll tell you all about it ...

When discussing the upcoming ASP .
NET MVC framework , one of the key benefits I like to tout is how this framework will improve testability of your web applications .
The response I often get is the same question I get when mention patterns such as Dependency Injection , IoC , etc …
Why would I want to do XYZ just to improve testability ?
I think to myself in response
Just to improve testability ?
Is n’t that enough of a reason !
That ’s how excited I am about test driven development .
Testing seems enough of a reason for me !
Of course , when I ’m done un - bunching my knickers , I realize that despite all the benefits of unit testable code , the real benefit of testable code is how it helps handle the software development ’s biggest problem since time immemorial , managing complexity .
There are two ways that testable code helps manage complexity .
​ 1 . It directly helps manage complexity assuming that you not only write testable code , but also write the unit tests to go along with them .
With decent code coverage , you now have a nice suite of regression tests , which helps manage complexity by alerting you to potential bugs introduced during code maintenance in a large project long before they become a problem in production .
​ 2 . It indirectly helps manage complexity because in order to write testable code , you have to employ the principle of separation of concerns to really write testable code .
Separating concerns within an application is an excellent tool for managing complexity when writing code .
And writing code is complex !
The MVC pattern , for example , separates an application into three main components : the Model , the View , and the Controller .
Not only does it separate these three components , it outlines the loosely coupled relationships and communication between these components .
Key Benefits of Separating Concerns
This separation combined with loose coupling allows a developer to manage complexity because it allows the developer to focus on one aspect of the problem at a time .
Martin Fowler writes about this benefit in his paper , Separating User Interface Code ( pdf ) :
A clear separation lets you concentrate on each aspect of the problem separately — and one complicated thing at a time is enough .
It also lets different people work on the separate pieces , which is useful when people want to hone more specialized skills . \
The ability to divide work into parallel tracks is a great benefit of this approach .
In a well separated application , if Alice needs time to implement the controller or business logic , she can quickly stub out the model so that Bob can work on the view without being blocked by Alice .
Meanwhile , Alice continues developing the business layer without the added stress that Bob is waiting on her .
Bring it home
The MVC example above talks about separation of concerns on a large architectural scale .
But the same benefits apply on a much smaller scale outside of the MVC context .
And all of these benefits can be yours as a side - effect of writing testable code .
So to summarize , when you write testable code , whether it is via Test Driven Development ( TDD ) or Test After Development , you get the following side effects .
A nice suite of regression tests .
Well separated code that helps manage complexity .
Well separated code that helps enable concurrent development .
Compare that list of side effects with the list of side effects of the latest pharmaceutical wonder drug for curing restless legs or whatever .

AMC Pacer
Life span : 1975 - 80
The main selling point of the American Motors ' Pacer wagon was its extreme width .
Compact cars were n't popular in the early ' 70s , so AMC made the Pacer as wide as a Cadillac of the same era .
In the fuel - starved America of the time , a small car with lots of interior space no doubt seemed smart , and the Pacer did find a ready market in its early days .
Unfortunately , the bulbous , blobby Pacer is remembered today as the ultimate example of " the nerdy car my parents drove . "
( Its starring role in the 1992 geeksploitation flick " Wayne 's World " did n't help . )
Introduced in 1975 the Pacer met with initial success , but sales dwindled quickly and the model was phased out after only five years .
Among its odder features was a passenger side door that was four inches longer than the driver 's side door
The idea was to allow easier access to the rear seats .
Almost 40 percent of the car 's total surface area was glass , leading to " fishbowl on wheels " wisecracks .
Today , the AMC Pacer is seeing some interest as a collectible icon of the ' 70s .
McKeel Hagerty , president of Hagerty Insurance , the collector car insurance company that did the " Questionable cars " survey , owns one himself .
PORABARI , Bangladesh ( Reuters Life ! ) -
They ’ve dodged deadly kisses , orchestrated mesmerizing dances and healing sessions , but Bangladesh ’s snake charmers are now a dying breed .

Bangladesh has an estimated 500,000 snake charmers , who rove the country like gypsies or live in riverboats .
Some 5,000 have settled with their families in Porabari village , 32 km ( 20 miles ) from Dhaka , where every household boasts a basket full of snakes , even though few charmers are teaching their children their art .
“ This is not because we no longer love snakes or dislike to play them for a living , ” said Alamgir Hossain , 45 , who holds the title of “ sorporaj ” or “ snake king ” , the highest honor in the community .
“ I grew up with the snakes , played with cobras , and , maybe you can say , romanced with them , ” said the father of six .
“ So did most members of the clan .
They play snakes to crowds of villagers for money .
But those days have changed . ”
Now many of Porabari ’s charmers have taken other professions with more predictable incomes , like pulling rickshaws or growing rice and vegetables .
Most send their children to school .
Urbanization , deforestation and other environmental changes have also decreased Bangladesh ’s snake population .
Even though the government has banned the killing of snakes , villagers often kill serpents that have bitten or killed others .
Hossain won his title after many years of devotion , practice and training in Bangladesh and India ’s Assam state .
Today , few have the patience or inclination to do the same .
He said he was one of only six living “ sorporaj ” in the country -- five of his predecessors were killed by snake bites .
In Porabari , children play with snakes without fear , draping them around their necks like garlands .
Female snake charmers often sell talismans and “ medical ” advice to illiterate villagers .
Male charmers are often called upon to cure people who have been bitten by poisonous snakes and are seen as “ ujhas ” or paramedics .
Hossain said Porabari ’s charmers make most of their money from selling snakes to the other charmers who descend on the village for the weekly snake market .
“ I try to buy nearly 100 snakes in each consignment , for 400 or 500 taka ( $ 6 - 7 ) each , and then sell them for a minimum profit , ” Hossain said .
“ But high quality snakes , like the king cobra , are rarely found and cost nearly 5,000 taka a piece . ”
Despite his elevated position in the community , Hossain said he had no intention to allow his children to follow in his “ risky ” footsteps .
“ But we can not live without snakes , ” he said .
“ We love them like we love our children . ”
" I think that the attack of 9/11 has n't seen the last of its victims , not even remotely .
There 's going to be victims for many years to come , unfortunately .
I just hope that the government would decide to look into this and maybe give back the money that they 've taken from New York City and start looking into some respiratory health for everyone .
Right now there 's at least some for adults .
There 's nothing for children .
We all need to be checked . "
CLEAR LAKE , Iowa , July 4 —
As thousands of people cheered along the Fourth of July parade route here , it was the tall man with the familiar white hair who made the crowd go truly gaga .
“ Bob Barker !
It ’s Bob Barker ! ” two women shrieked upon seeing the former president , Bill Clinton , in the distance , as he and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York marched hand - in - hand .
When the women realized who it really was , they seemed just as thrilled , shouting , “ Ohhhh ! ” and clapping madly .
A game - show - host - turned - two - term - president : how can anyone , even Mrs. Clinton , compete ?
No matter how much he tries to blend in , Mr. Clinton is one Oscar - worthy supporting actor who can sometimes upstage his leading lady simply by breathing .
The Clintons ’ political stagecraft — and their goal of shifting the spotlight to her — has been a work in progress since her presidential campaign began in January .
This week , her husband ’s first campaign jaunt on her behalf showed him in stages of adjustment — relaxed and jokey at times , a bit unpolished at others .

Does your current life leave you unfulfilled ?
Are you convinced that you possess talents far beyond those you ’re putting to use ?
Is your purpose in life being trampled by the stresses of a “ 9 to 5 ” job ?
Are n’t you capable of so much more ?
If you answered “ Yes ” to any of these questions , I welcome you to change your life .
Acknowledging your desire for positive change is easy — the difficult task is of course , where do you begin ?
A good first step is to assess where you are in life .
Is there something specific causing you to feel unsatisfied , powerless , or insignificant ?
Do you feel like this all the time , or only some of the time ?
Can you pick out a pattern in your emotions ?
For example , do you feel great on Friday afternoons before the weekend but then feel horrible on Monday mornings when you must return to work ?
If that pattern sounds familiar , you may be suffering from job stress .
This does n’t necessarily mean you ’re experiencing “ burn out ” at a high - demand job .
Maybe you ’re sauntering along , unchallenged at a job where your workday is spent in a state of boredom — and the stress results from watching the clock all day .
Or maybe your employer does n’t respect your personal contributions and fails to fully compensate you for your hard work .
Then again , it could simply be that your job is seemingly unimportant in the grand scheme of the world , and it would have no serious impact whether you choose to work 60 hours a week or only six hours a week .
I ’m not suggesting that your job is the sole reason you are unsatisfied with the life you ’re leading — other aspects of life certainly come into play .
The reason I am focusing specifically on changing your life by changing your job is because a large majority of people equate the two .
Are you someone who equates your life and your job ?
If so , do n’t feel ashamed of feeling this way — you ’re certainly not alone in your thinking , as there are many logical reasons that cause your brain to make this connection .
The two most obvious reasons you would believe your job is your life are :
Nearly 40 % of your waking life is spent working a full - time job .
When asked what you do , you identify yourself using your job title .
In addition to these , there is often an underlying idea in your subconscious making the same connection .
If your true calling is to be a musician , but you work bagging groceries , then this subconscious desire is contributing to your feeling of discontent .
You know in your heart that what you ’re doing to earn a living is not what you truly want to do with your life , and consequently your desire is longing for you to do what you love instead .
The desire makes you question your current existence and dream of a better life for yourself .
Consequently , what you do as your occupation has significant influence over who you are as an individual .
If you are n’t passionate about the work that you do , you may be miserable because of it .
Your job is therefore likely to be the most fundamental area of your life that requires positive change .
So what ’s the next step ?
Get another job , right ?
Unfortunately , you ca n’t be so quick to believe starting a new job is the best solution .
In my case , it certainly was n’t .
After college I began working full time as “ the computer guy . ”
It seemed like the logical step to take .
While working towards my degree in Computer Science , I gained some experience in the computer industry interning at a computer consulting firm .
The work was challenging , the demand for work was high , and I was good at it .
Something was n’t right , though .
I struggled to get out of bed every morning , I was unmotivated at work , and I was generally unhappy with my life .
Within one year , I left the consulting firm in search of something better .
At the time , I was looking in the wrong places .
Under the belief that I could deliver my talents directly , I began doing freelance computer support .
The strange thing was , whenever business opportunities came my way , I did n’t pursue them .
I would later learn this was due to a lack of passion for the work involved — I preferred to ignore the opportunities because I did n’t enjoy doing freelance work .
With the hope that I could make money quickly , I tried a short stint as a professional gambler .
One month later I was several grand in the hole , and decided to cut my losses and return to the low - risk , low - reward lifestyle of “ the computer guy . ”
Since I quit my previous job outright , I was too embarrassed to ask for my old job back .
Consequently , I spent nine months interviewing for positions in the computer industry .
My unenthusiastic demeanor during interviews often put me out of the running for the position , and I eventually had to accept a job in local government with a pathetic starting salary .
My point is that job - hopping was not the answer to my problem .
In fact , the problem was never even at the fault of the jobs I worked — it was always my inability to be true to myself .
I knew I did n’t enjoy working in the computer industry .
I tried it , but did n’t like it .
Why then , would I believe that I could find happiness through a different computer job ?
Why did n’t I try something else ?
Because I was naive , comfortable , confused , and afraid .
I did n’t want to step outside of my comfort zone .
I did n’t want to start over and have to discard everything I ’d already done .
I did n’t want to begin as an amateur and risk the embarrassment of being booed off stage .
I was terrified of actually living .
It took two more years working as “ the computer guy , ” hiding from life , before I understood what would happen if I kept it up : I would continue growing older , and the opportunity to change my life would continue getting shorter .
Aware of how my life would not improve unless I began creating positive change on my own , I left home with a plan to reinvent myself .
I ’m a writer now — or at least , it ’s my goal to be one .
I want to write things that people can relate to .
I want my writings to help people recognize how it ’s never too late to change direction in life .
I want to help inspire people to create positive change in their own lives , follow their true calling , and experience a more fulfilling lifestyle every day .
So if your current life leaves you unfulfilled , if your talents are n’t being put to use , or if your purpose in life is being trampled by your job , then tell yourself that you ’re capable of so much more .
Remember , acknowledging the need for change is only the first step .
The next step involves choice .
Do yourself a favor and choose to start living — once I made this choice , I only wished I made it sooner .

Condoleezza Rice said Washington saw the task of stabilising Iraq as not simply improving security within its borders but " to begin to have American forces in lower numbers turn to other responsibilities " .
She said " the territorial security of Iraq " with regard to its neighbours - especially Iran - was among them .
" Iran is a very troublesome neighbour , " she told NBC's Today show .
Tehran has said it is prepared to " fill the vacuum " if the US leaves Iraq .
" That is what is at stake here , " Ms Rice added .
The secretary of state 's comments came a day after General David Petraeus , the top US commander in Iraq , and the US ambassador to Baghdad , Ryan Crocker , finished two days of gruelling testimony on Capitol Hill .
Gen Petraeus said he would recommend that the extra 30,000 troops sent to Iraq this year be withdrawn next summer , bringing numbers down to 130,000 - the same as at the start of the year .
In its first response to the Petraeus - Crocker testimony , Iran said the troop reduction would not " save America from Iraq 's swamp " and repeated its call for a full US withdrawal .
The US president , George Bush , is set to accept the recommendation in a 15 - minute speech tomorrow .
However , the prospect of a large US military presence for the foreseeable future has angered Democrats and unsettled more Republicans .
Nancy Pelosi , the Democratic House speaker and a strong opponent of the war , met Mr Bush yesterday and has sharply criticised the president 's approach as " an insult to the intelligence of the American people " .
Ms Pelosi said everything she had heard " sounds to me like a 10 - year , at least , commitment to an open - ended presence and war " .
Mr Bush 's determination to keep 130,000 troops in Iraq at least until next summer could lead to more wobbling in the Republican ranks .
Senator Elizabeth Dole , who has stuck by the administration on Iraq , yesterday said she would now support " what some have called action - forcing measures " .
Congressional opponents of the conflict still lack enough votes to cut off funding for it or set deadlines for a US withdrawal .
However , fresh moves are afoot to pass legislation calling for a change of the US mission away from combat to training that would reduce the troop presence to between 50,000 and 60,000 soldiers .
Meanwhile , the Democratic senator , Barack Obama , called for the withdrawal of all US combat troops from Iraq by the end of next year .
Mr Obama , one of the Democratic frontrunners for the White House , will urge the US to adopt a clear timetable starting with an immediate reduction in combat brigades until they are all out by the end of 2008 .
" Our drawdown should proceed at a steady pace of one or two brigades each month , " he is expected to say in a speech at Ashford University in Clinton , Iowa .
" If we start now , all of our combat brigades should be out of Iraq by the end of next year . "
By arguing that only combat brigades should be withdrawn - there are 20 in Iraq , including five sent in January - Mr Obama appeared to suggest that other US troops could remain .
In Baghdad , the Iraqi national security adviser , Mowaffaq al - Rubaie , said foreign troop levels in Iraq could drop to less than 100,000 by the end of 2008 if the country 's own forces were ready and security threats had diminished .
With six weeks until the most important election in a generation , Oliver Laughland and Tom Silverstone are crossing the US to uncover the political fault lines that underpin American politics .
In the vital swing state of Florida , the race for the White House is tightening by the day
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Police in Japan are investigating allegations that four U.S. Marines raped a 19 - year - old Japanese woman , media and officials said , the latest episode to plague the U.S. military ’s relations with local communities .

“ I have received a report of a Japanese woman being raped by several men in the early morning of October 14 in the city of Hiroshima , ” Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura told a news conference on Friday .
“ The Hiroshima police are proceeding with the investigation in cooperation with U.S. forces in Japan , ” he said .
“ Of course , if it is true it is unforgivable . ”
Public broadcaster NHK reported that four U.S. Marines from Iwakuni Marine Corps Air Station in southwest Japan had raped a 19 - year - old woman in a car at a car park in nearby Hiroshima City after meeting her at an event hall .
The mayor of Iwakuni had suggested this week he was willing to discuss the expansion of the Marine base .
Major G.A. Canedo , public affairs officer at the base , said four Marines had been confined there .
“ We are aware of the allegations .
The matter is being investigated and we are cooperating fully with local authorities , ” Canedo said , but declined to give further details .
Police in Hiroshima confirmed that an investigation was under way but declined to say whether they would demand that the four Marines be handed over into their custody .
A U.S. - Japan pact governing the conduct of U.S. military personnel in Japan does not require the transfer of military suspects until they are charged , but Washington has agreed to favorably consider pre-indictment transfers in cases of suspected rape , murder and other heinous crimes .
Japan is host to about 50,000 U.S. military personnel as part of the U.S. - Japan security alliance , but friction often occurs with local communities near the bases because of concern about crime , accidents and noise .
The 1995 rape of a Japanese schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen on the southern island of Okinawa sparked huge protests .
Last year voters in Iwakuni rejected in a non-binding referendum a plan to expand the nearby Marine base by moving carrier - based planes and personnel from Atsugi naval base near Tokyo .
The Middletown Press —
The city Democratic Committee unanimously passed a resolution calling for he impeachment of President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney in an effort to make a statement that Bush has committed serious enough crimes to be removed from office , said Councilman Gerald Daley .
While the resolution wo n’t actually result in the president ’s impeachment , Daley said he hopes it will make a statement that will influence not only city residents , but future decisions made by the congressional delegation on a national level .
“ This is intended to bring awareness among the public as well as our congressional delegation , ” Daley said .
“ There was a vote in the senate yesterday that would require that deployments in Iraq be no longer than the respites between tours and it fell short by four votes . ”
“ Joe Lieberman was one of the votes .
Maybe this will make him think twice about doing something like that the next time a similar vote comes up .
People have to get engaged in this – the future is at stake here . ”
The only other councilman in attendance , Robert Santangelo , said the resolution shows that “ people are not pleased with the way things are being done . ”
Santangelo applauded Daley for bringing the resolution forward , adding that this resolution gives the Democrats a voice and that the Democratic Committee has not been vocal enough in the past .

Consumerism is as American as cherry pie .
Plasma TVs , iPods , granite countertops : you name it , we ’ll buy it .
To finance the national pastime , Americans have been borrowing from abroad on an increasingly stunning scale .
In 2006 , the infusion of foreign cash required to close the gap between American incomes and consumption reached nearly 7 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) , leaving the United States with a deficit in its current account ( an annual measure of capital flows to and from the rest of the world ) of more than $ 850 billion .
In other words , the quantity of goods and services that Americans consumed last year in excess of what we produced was close to the entire annual output of Brazil .
“ Brazil is the tenth largest economy on the planet , ” points out Laura Alfaro , an associate professor of business administration who teaches a class on the current account deficit at Harvard Business School ( HBS ) .
“ That is what the U.S. is eating up every year — a Brazil or a Mexico . ”
Whether this practice is sustainable — and if not , how it might end — are questions that divide scholars and investors alike .
We have borrowed so much from abroad — between half a trillion and a trillion dollars a year for the past six or seven years — that in 2006 , our investment balance with the rest of the world ( what we pay foreign investors on their U.S. assets versus their payments to us on our investments abroad , historically nearly equal ) tipped to became an outflow for the first time in more than 50 years .
We are a debtor nation swiftly heading deeper into debt .
The global imbalances created by this dynamic of American borrowing and foreign lending appear stable for now , but if they slip suddenly , that could pose serious dangers for middle - and working - class Americans through soaring interest rates , a crash in the housing market , and sharply higher prices for anything no longer made domestically .
Harvard economists and political scientists see possible threats to globalization ( the opening of markets and trade that has made the economy a world phenomenon ) : the risk of rising protectionism ; the potential for a world recession if market forces unwind the imbalances too quickly ; and even the possibility that political considerations could trump shared economic interests , causing nations to use their international financial positions as weapons .

That last idea — that nations can wield power through their accumulation of currency reserves — is rooted in our own history .
When President Dwight D. Eisenhower learned in 1956 that Britain , in collusion with France and Israel , had invaded Egypt without U.S. knowledge , he was infuriated .
“ Many people remember Suez , ” notes Jeffrey Frankel , Harpel professor of capital formation and growth at the Kennedy School of Government ( KSG ) , but few recall “ the specific way that Eisenhower forced the British to back down . ”
At the time , there was a run on the pound sterling and he blocked the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) from stabilizing the currency .
With sterling on the verge of collapse , says Frankel , “ Eisenhower told them , ‘ We are not going to bail out the pound unless you pull out of Suez . ’ ”
Facing bankruptcy , the British withdrew .
This incident , notes Frankel , “ marked the end of Great Britain ’s ability to conduct an independent foreign policy . ”
Putting international politics aside for a moment , “ When a country gets a capital inflow [ such as the United States has now ] , generally speaking things are pretty good , ” observes Jeffry Frieden , Stanfield professor of international peace .
“ It allows you to invest more than you save , and consume more than you produce .
There is nothing necessarily wrong with that , ” he notes .
Firms do it all the time , and so do households .
They borrow on the expectation that they will be more productive and better able to pay the money back in the future .
The United States , for example , was “ the world ’s biggest debtor for a hundred years , ” Frieden notes , “ but the money was used to build the railroads and the canals and the factories and to improve the ports and to build our cities .
It was used productively , and it worked .
The question to ask now is not , ‘ Is the country living beyond its means ? ’
The question is , ‘ Is the money going to increase the productive capacity of the economy ? ’
Because if it just goes to getting everybody another iPod , ” he warns , “ then unless iPods make people more productive , there is going to be trouble down the road when the debt has to be serviced . ”

Trouble struck Mexico in 1995 , Thailand , Malaysia , and other countries in 1997 , and Argentina in 2001 , after those countries borrowed vast sums in the international marketplace .
Argentina before the crash had been a model developing nation and a darling of the IMF , closely following the fund ’s economic prescription for integration into the global system of finance and trade .
But even the IMF could not save the country from the destabilizing effects of international capital flows .
When global investors realized that Argentina ’s debt load was unsustainable , they sold their assets , called in their loans , and exited the country .
Overnight the Argentine peso plummeted in value against the dollar , the currency in which debt had been issued , and staggering obligations suddenly became unpayable .
Argentines who had financed their mortgages in dollars lost their homes .
There was a run on the banks , and the government imposed a limit on cash withdrawals .
In a country abounding with wheatfields and cattle ranches , starving people began raiding garbage bags in wealthy neighborhoods .
Paul Blustein , a financial reporter for the Washington Post who wrote And the Money Kept Rolling In ( and Out ) , describes a vivid scene after the crash when a truck carrying Angus steers overturned on a highway : a crowd of machete - wielding shantytown residents slaughtered and butchered them , fighting each other for the bloody chunks of meat .
He recounts stories of middle - class families riding a government - provided train into Buenos Aires each night to pick through garbage , searching for bottles , cardboard , and newspapers — anything that could be sold for recycling .
This — in a country that had been prosperous , with no inflation and 6 percent annual economic growth .
Despite the differences between Argentina ’s borrowing and our own ( especially the fact that we borrow in our own currency , eliminating exchange - rate risk ) , Blustein finds unsettling “ the manner in which the flow of foreign capital into the United States has rendered its policymakers complacent about the nation ’s budget and trade deficits … . "
Official assurances " that foreigners will continue to provide the funding the United States needs as long as the country remains a good place to invest bear eerie similarities , " he writes , " to the logic employed by Argentine policymakers . "
Drowning in Liquidity ?
Money flowing into the United States injects purchasing power into the economy unevenly — it affects certain sectors , such as housing , more than others .
“ Assume the world is divided into things that are tradable and things that are not , ” says Jeffry Frieden .
Hard goods , clothing , and most foods are tradable : they are transported easily across borders and are therefore subject to international competition .
Haircuts , housing , medical care , restaurant food , and public transportation , on the other hand , are consumed where they are produced .
Because these kinds of goods and services ca n’t be exported or imported , they are considered non-tradable .
When foreigners are buying our currency , the dollar appreciates , making international goods relatively inexpensive .
That leaves consumers with even more money to spend on non-tradables , such as housing and land .
And because housing and land are not subject to foreign competition , their price goes up .
Relative price indices from 1980 to 1985 , a period characterized by large capital inflows resulting from the huge Reagan - era federal deficits , show that the price of industrial commodities , finished goods , and motor vehicles rose between 18 and 28 percent , but the price of non-tradables rose two to three times faster .
“ Relative price trends over the last seven years show a similar phenomenon , ” Frieden reports .
“ It drives me crazy , ” he adds , “ when I read in Business Week or the Wall Street Journal all the idiosyncratic reasons that people come up with to explain why the cost of housing has been going up .
The reason is because the dollar has been rising ” as capital has flowed into the country and kept interest rates down .
“ Rising housing prices have a substantial follow - on effect , ” Frieden explains , “ when middle - class Americans , whose principal asset is their home , realize that their wealth has increased and they can therefore increase consumption . ”
This is not just a psychological thing , he points out .
Houses increased in value , so people borrowed more , stopped saving as much , and cashed out the equity in their homes when they refinanced .
When a house that cost $ 200,000 in 1999 swelled in value to $ 450,000 in 2005 , lenders extended credit of up to 100 percent of the equity in that home .
The sums involved are enormous .
In a 2006 article in Foreign Affairs , Baker professor of economics Martin Feldstein wrote that “ the increase in consumer spending as a result of increased wealth has been reinforced by the process of mortgage refinancing ....
In the past five years , the value of U.S. home mortgage debt has increased by nearly $ 3 trillion .
In 2004 alone , it increased by almost $ 1 trillion .
Net mortgage borrowing not used for the purchase of new homes that year amounted to nearly $ 600 billion , or almost 7 percent of disposable personal income . ”
Says Frieden , “ Rising home prices have led to feelings of well - being and an expansion of consumer credit , and , therefore , consumption . ”
So have rising equities , as people have watched their retirement portfolios double in value and concluded that they do n’t need to save as much .
The Loser 's Perspective
But momentary feelings of well - being are not the whole story .
Virtually any economist will tell you that globalization is good , but that it creates winners and losers .
The benefits of global trade accrue from what economists call “ comparative advantage , ” the theory that a country gains from specializing in production activities at which it is relatively better ( even if it is not the absolute best at producing anything ) .
All of the countries that do this are better off than they would be without international trade .
But even though it is possible to prove mathematically that this is true for nations , it is not true for every group of people within nations .
These , Frieden says , are globalization ’s losers : firms that will be driven out of business ; workers whose wages will go down or whose jobs will be displaced by foreign competition ; mortgage holders who will be foreclosed upon by foreigners ; corporations that will be bought by foreigners and , like Chrysler , discarded .
When a country runs a large current - account deficit , as the United States does now , foreign manufacturers and holders of dollar debt come into focus as their factories supply American stores and their financiers buy more iconic American assets .

“ Part of the reason people are spending beyond their means , ” says Rawi Abdelal , an associate professor of business administration at HBS , “ is because they are — in a way — witnessing the end of the American dream . ”
Between 2000 and 2005 , even as the U.S. economy grew 14 percent in real terms , and worker productivity increased a remarkable 16.6 percent , workers ’ average hourly wages were stagnant .
The median family income fell 2.9 percent .
Though these trends — which signal rising income inequality — concern economists , few people are complaining at the moment .
“ When money is flowing into an economy , ” as it is into the United States now , “ people feel pretty good about the way things are going , ” notes Frieden .
Homeowners can easily establish home - equity lines of credit that , for the time being , let them use their residences like an ATM .
Some people have refinanced their mortgages three or four times to buy cars , swimming pools , and other luxuries .
“ It seems like we are borrowing to have a party , ” says Abdelal .
Brazil , Mexico , Argentina , Taiwan , Korea , Indonesia — all these developing countries have gone through this stage , says Frieden , and no one really complained about the borrowing while it was happening because it was making more capital available for investment and consumption .
“ But if you borrow , ” says Abdelal , “ you have to have a theory about why it is sensible .
It is not obvious that the U.S. government has a theory about why it is sensible to borrow , and I feel very nervous that the American public does not have a good theory about why they are borrowing so much money , either .
We are not taking all this money and investing it . ”
Less than 30 years ago , the interest rate on home mortgages ran to 13 percent or more .
Inflation was in the double digits , and the prime rate that credit cards use to set interest charges rose above 15 percent .
If that happened again , investment would plummet and there could be huge social costs .
Says Frieden , “ It is one thing to say there was a big decline in the price of mansions in Silicon Valley , but if a million middle - and working - class families are forced out of their homes , that is a real social cost .
What will happen to our relationship with the rest of the world when the constraints start to bind ? ” he asks .
“ What will happen when they go from allowing us to run these deficits to forcing us to tighten our belts ? ”
A resurgence of protectionism is one concern .
Says Abdelal , “ I think the public ’s view has been turning away from the idea that we actually benefit from these cheap Chinese imports .
Of course , economists always say , ‘ Look , we can do the cost - benefit analysis and when you buy your cheap stuff at Wal - Mart , that is good for [ American consumers ] ’….
So we can talk about ‘ comparative advantage , ’ but what is important …is whether or not the commitment to open markets is politically sustainable . ”
He sees warning signs that it may not be : “ drumbeating about China ” ; “ the rising riskiness of middle - class life in the United States , for which people , rightly or wrongly , blame the globalization of goods markets ” ; the debate about how big the wall should be between the United States and Mexico , not whether we should have one ; the Dubai ports episode ; the scuttling of a Chinese company ’s offer to buy American oil company Unocal .
“ Here we are with the biggest current account deficit ever — we require foreign capital — but if it is Arab or Chinese foreign capital going into a sector that we might be worried about , we tell them , ‘ No , no , no , we only want you to buy Treasuries . ’
What would happen to the American commitment to openness , ” Abdelal wonders , “ if we had a real recession or a real crisis ? ”
Absent protection for globalization ’s losers , history suggests that they will become the core of opposition movements .
“ There is a commonality to their demands , ” Frieden says .
“ They typically argue in favor of protecting [ those ] people who are doing poorly in international competition from the ravages of the global economy . ”
Pat Buchanan is an American example of a convinced protectionist .
“ He says , ‘ Let ’s protect the workers in North Carolina and farmers in Kansas and to hell with Wall Street and Silicon Valley , ’ ” says Frieden — “ a very popular message outside Wall Street and Silicon Valley . ”
Sometimes we do protect the losers : price supports for domestically produced sugar cause Americans to pay two to three times the world market price .
Without the supports , Americans as a whole might be better off , but “ several thousand sugar producers and maybe a hundred thousand farm workers would go out of business .
Even if we could all agree that globalization is good for the economy as a whole and good for the majority of Americans , ” says Frieden , “ there will still be a non-trivial minority for whom it is not good . ”
He wonders , “ Is any political system up to the task of compensating losers in order to generate benefits for society as a whole ? ”
Protectionism is a legitimate concern stemming from global financial imbalances , agrees the Kennedy School ’s Jeffrey Frankel .
“ That is what happened in 1971 and 1985 when Americans became worried about trade deficits that were indeed alarming , but drew some incorrect conclusions .
We economists always explain that the deficit is the result of macroeconomic forces , and that we need to cut the federal budget and depreciate the dollar , but to your average congressman and your average man in the street , that does n’t seem very tangible .
There is a temptation for scapegoating , ” he explains .
“ It was Japan in the 1980s and now it is China and , on outsourcing , India . ” Adds former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers , the Eliot University Professor , “ I think there are enormous potential losses — in terms of consumer well - being and the real incomes of workers , and ultimately , in terms of the ability to maintain a stable global system — that come from the threat of protectionism , and so I think containing that threat is enormously important . ”
The Foreign Dimension
Our own openness to international flows of goods and capital is only half the equation .
On the other side of American borrowing is lending by foreign agencies , banks , and governments , which continue to accumulate massive reserves of U.S. currency , frequently in the form of low - yielding government bonds .
( China holds more than $ 1 trillion in currency reserves , mostly denominated in dollars ; Japan is a close second . )
This flow of funds from emerging economies to the developed world ( the United Kingdom and Australia run current account deficits , too ) is a startling reversal of the usual pattern , in which developed nations have loaned money through institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank to emerging economies that need investment in their own nascent growth .
Furthermore , as Summers points out , the real returns on these reserve investments , measured in those countries ’ local currency and after adjusting for inflation , are close to zero .
Why these countries are sending us their money — while choosing investments with returns so low that they could easily turn negative if the dollar were to depreciate significantly — is , he says , “ a very profound question , in my judgment . ”
How these lenders to the industrialized world decide to act in the future has large implications for whether the imbalances sort out gradually or violently .
Although their desire to lend and export is aligned for the moment with our consumerism , we cannot expect that they will want to keep accumulating dollar - denominated debt forever .
The “ rational reason ” for reserve accumulation by countries like China , says Kenneth Rogoff , Cabot professor of public policy and professor of economics at the KSG , “ is that they are terrified of having a financial crisis and , by stocking up on Treasury bills , the government puts itself in a position to bail out banks and bail out companies in an emergency . ”
Free trade may be good , but financial - market liberalization can be destabilizing , because it exposes small economies to massive flows of capital , measured in billions of dollars daily , that crisscross the globe at the speed of light .
These flows are the sum of the actions of investors worldwide , and can subject countries to the capricious swings of free markets .
If investors lose confidence in Thai investments , for example , and all pull their money from the country at once , their sudden withdrawals can precipitate a collapse of the currency , followed by dire effects on citizens ’ standard of living .
This is what happened during the Asian financial crisis of 1997 to 1998 .
After a series of emerging - market meltdowns , says Abdelal , accumulation of reserves has become the way developing countries can “ self - insure against a crisis — a kind of national insurance within the international system , ” without the loss of face and autonomy associated with a bailout by the IMF .
But the argument that countries such as China want to avoid a crisis probably explains only “ the first couple hundred billion ” of reserve accumulation , says Rogoff .
“ What they are doing now goes far beyond that — and has a corrupting aspect , because if banks and state - owned firms know they are going to get bailed out , they keep doing the same things they were doing to get in trouble in the first place . ”
Summers believes that the reserve accumulation going on now “ is , in significant part , because they want to maintain an export - led growth strategy . ”
In 1999 , he observed that the global economy depended on the U.S. economy ( which accounts for almost 30 percent of global economic output , and an even higher proportion of final demand ) , and that the U.S. economy depended on American consumers ( whose consumption is equivalent to 70 percent of GDP ) .
Consumption had become what Summers has called the “ single American engine ” propelling the world economy .
In such an environment , keeping exports inexpensive has been a rewarding strategy among our trading partners for maintaining their economic growth .
China ’s purchases of dollars keep that country ’s currency weak relative to ours , making Chinese goods inexpensive for American consumers .
“ The reserves are not objectives in and of themselves , ” Summers says .
“ They are a means to maintaining an exchange rate at which their exports will be extremely competitive , and so are a kind of subsidy to domestic industry . ”
“ What the Chinese have been doing works , they feel , ” says Rogoff — and it does work “ for the one - third of people who live on the coast … [ even though it ] has worked a lot less well for everybody else in China .
If you go into rural China , there are 150 million people who are effectively unemployed .
Large sections of the rural population live in something most of us would call poverty . ”

The reserve policies of China and other developing East Asian nations “ are very costly , ” notes HBS ’s Laura Alfaro .
“ When we talk about this in class , our students say , ‘ This is an economy growing at 10 percent a year .
It is impossible not to come up with projects [ for domestic investment ] that will generate greater returns — even just 1 percent higher — than the U.S. Treasury interest rate . ”
But even though in principle there are a lot of good , productive investments there , Rogoff says , much social and institutional change needs to take place to make rural China look like the coast .
Instead of increasing domestic investment to better balance the world economy , the Asian economies should concentrate on fostering domestic consumption , Rogoff believes .
“ Consider the fact that in China they invest more than 40 percent of GDP .
That means they are not consuming it , so their standard of living could be much higher .
This is very much a political - economy problem , because the elites enjoy a perfectly fine standard of living , ” he says .
In broad terms , “ The Asian currencies need to appreciate , and the Asian economies need to become less dependent on export - driven growth by cultivating domestic demand , which means raising living standards in these countries . ”
Developing countries are not the only ones accumulating reserves .
Oil exporters are buying Treasuries for a different reason : they are “ raking money in hand over fist with the sky - high oil prices , and are having trouble spending it as fast as they are earning it , ” Rogoff says .
“ Mind you , these are countries which are very poor , and in many of them there are a very small number of very rich people who do n’t know what to do with the money .
Saudi Arabia is one example , where even with today ’s oil prices , average per-capita income is only $ 7,000 to $ 8,000 — and even that is misleading because the royal family controls about half of the total income .
So people are hardly rich there , and if it was a democracy , I do n’t think they would have any trouble figuring out how to spend the money . ”
Rogoff suggests that they “ need to strengthen their education systems , social - safety nets , and invest in the core of lower - income [ people ] , where there is a huge scope for greater expenditures .
Whether the elites will approve of that , I ca n’t say , but that would certainly help reduce risk from current global account imbalances . ”
The causes of the U.S. current account deficit , in other words , extend well beyond the sphere of our own national control .
Because they are rooted in a system that is international in scope , solving the problem without sacrificing global growth will require international cooperation .
The Contrarian
But what if our current account deficit is a side effect of globalization that is not going to go away ?
Richard Cooper , Boas professor of international economics , takes a much more relaxed view about this possibility than his colleagues do .
In theory , he says , the deficit could persist forever , as long as it eventually stops increasing as a percent of the U.S. GDP .
Cooper , who was undersecretary of state for economic affairs from 1977 to 1981 , and chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston from 1990 to 1992 , sees global imbalances as a natural consequence of a decline in investment “ home bias . ”
“ What do we mean by globalization ? ” he asks .
“ What we mean is that everyone around the world thinks beyond [ his or her own ] national boundaries when it comes to allocating their savings . ”
Americans used to invest almost 100 percent in the United States , but now allocate a portion of their portfolios abroad .
“ That is a process that is going on worldwide : foreigners are investing more abroad , too , but foreigners save more than Americans do . ”
Because the United States is 30 percent of the world economy , a world with no home bias would see foreigners investing 30 percent of their savings in the United States and Americans investing 70 percent of their savings outside the country .
“ If you apply those two numbers to actual savings levels , ” Cooper says , “ you get a $ 1.1 trillion current account deficit in the year 2005 , with foreigners investing $ 2.3 trillion in the U.S. on savings of over $ 8 trillion , and Americans investing $ 1.2 trillion abroad .
The difference between those two is $ 1.2 trillion . ”
International diversification of investments , in other words , causes the current account gap .
“ Of course we are not there yet , ” Cooper notes .
“ Actual foreign investment was about $ 1.2 trillion in 2005 , and U.S. investment abroad was less than half that .
That means that in getting from here to there — what economists call the stable state — the deficit could actually grow as a share of GDP , ” he explains .
“ It ca n’t grow forever as a share of GDP , but it could grow for a while , as it has been doing in the last decade . ”
How high could it go ?
Rogoff says that , at least in an accounting sense , we could handle deficits “ until the debt level gets as high as 100 percent of GDP without breaking a sweat at today ’s interest rates . ”
For his part , Cooper believes that the deficit will eventually stabilize at an absolute level , and that as long as the American economy continues to grow , the deficit will slowly decline as a percentage of GDP .
Larger deficits over the medium term may arise as a consequence of what Cooper calls “ a demographic revolution . ”
Pension funds in countries such as Japan and Germany ( the second - and third - largest economies in the world ) are purchasing large quantities of U.S. securities because their populations are aging more rapidly than that of the United States .
Everywhere , he points out , people are living longer , but in many developed countries they are also having fewer babies .
“ There has been a lot of discussion in the U.S. about how we are going to finance social programs , but our problems are trivial compared with the European countries and Japan , ” Cooper argues .
“ The U.S. is a big demographic outlier .
All the other rich countries , and all of the East Asian countries , have had a crash in the total fertility rate . ”
“ For a society just to reproduce itself , the number of children per couple has to be slightly above two , to allow for infant and child mortality , ” Cooper notes .
By this measure , the United States is roughly reproducing itself , he says , but “ in Spain , Italy , Japan , and Russia , the number is around 1.2 , way below the reproduction rate , and in the other rich countries it is somewhere in between . ”
In addition , the United States has about a million immigrants arriving each year ( more , if illegal migrants are included ) .
Consequently , 20 - and 50 - year projections find the U.S. population and labor force continuing to grow .
“ All these other countries are expected to peak and decline , ” he says .
“ Japan actually peaked in 2005 , and Germany peaked last year . ”
We have no experience managing economies where the number of young adults is actually declining , he adds ( the singular phenomenon of World War I excepted ) , so “ We will all learn from the Japanese and the Germans , who are leading the way .
They will experience less new household formation , less demand for housing , less demand for equipping new members of the labor force , less demand for schools and other public services , and more demand for healthcare . ”
Faced with less investment required for population growth , and aware that they wo n’t have as large a workforce to support their growing numbers of retirees , these peoples are deliberately saving a lot of money .
“ If I ’m running a pension fund or a life - insurance company representing an aging population , where would I put my investments ? ” Cooper asks .
“ I want good yields and I want high security . ”
Emerging markets offer the best returns , but financial shocks in Russia , Argentina , and other countries have “ taught us that foreign investments are very risky . ”
In the United States , by contrast , “ property rights are secure , and the dispute settlement system is reasonably fair and efficient , so it looks like a good place to put your money .
Put those two arguments , globalization and demographic changes , together and it means that the U.S. is just a very attractive place to invest .
Looking ahead , it is a more vigorous economy than those of the other rich countries . ”
Thus , Cooper argues , the main cause of the current account deficit is foreign investment in the United States .
“ Conceptually , the current account is just the negative of net foreign investment in the United States , ” he points out .
Furthermore , “ There is all the difference in the world between ” this recycling of dollars and “ the government of Brazil or Argentina going out and borrowing in the world interbank or capital market . ”
For one thing , U.S. debt is in our own currency , he says .
“ When Argentina and Brazil borrow in London , they typically borrow in dollars , yen , or euros , so they are exposed to currency risk if exchange rates shift . ”
That is what sank Argentina in 2001 .
Although magnitudes of debt are not unimportant , he adds , the structure of the debt is more important in assessing viability .
Most of our debt is also long - term , Cooper says , and therefore manageable in a growing economy .
And “ although central banks buy a lot of short - term Treasuries , the truth is that , on the scale they require , they have no place else to go . ”
Cooper doubts that eliminating the U.S. current account deficit is even possible , because in order to do so , other countries would have to move in the opposite direction , sustaining a huge decline in their current account surpluses .
“ The world is a closed economy , ” he points out , “ so if we go from a huge deficit to zero , somebody has to be on the other side to the tune of the whole $ 850 billion .
Who is it going to be ?
It has got to be the big economies : China , Germany , Japan , and others . ”
Because these economies are internally less flexible than the United States , and are “ export dependent , ” their people and leaders wo n’t stand for it , he says , and will adopt policies that prevent it from happening .
Living with the " Financial Balance of Terror "
Although Cooper ’s arguments have impressed his colleagues , they do n’t share his relaxed view .
If he is correct that the current account deficit is primarily a consequence of investment , what would happen , they wonder , if world investors changed their minds about parking their capital in U.S. government debt or mortgage - backed securities ?
Former Treasury Secretary Summers thinks the weakness of the “ diversification finance ” argument is that “ it relies a lot on psychology of the kind that could prove to be quite fragile .
The U.S. is borrowing at a rate that is unsustainable , ” he says .
“ The question is whether the adjustment will be a gradual one , in which case it is not likely to be terribly disruptive , or will be a sudden one .
If there was a sudden interruption , that would complicate the system of economic management in the United States and around the world ” — in ways that might be far less benign than Summers ’s language suggests .
Kenneth Rogoff agrees : “ The real danger is that the current account might change very rapidly . ”
The United States would have a harder time adjusting than did other countries cut off by foreign lending in the past , he says , because its exports are a smaller percentage of GDP .
Instead of having to increase exports 10 percent to make up for the lost flow of capital , for example , exports might need to increase twice as much , implying a hefty depreciation of the dollar .
Rogoff has estimated that in a sudden adjustment , the dollar might lose as much as 40 percent of its value compared to 2005 levels , with the result that “ the dollar would fall like a rock and interest rates would skyrocket . ”
The price of imported goods would go up almost overnight , as happened to Mexico within a few months in 1994 .
Gasoline , food , foreign parts for cars , tools , toys , and television sets would cost so much more that it would put an enormous strain on middle - and lower - income Americans .
And even though the United States has a robust financial system , a hard landing would mean reduced economic activity .
This , says Summers , “ would in turn reduce confidence , lead to larger budget deficits , lead to more pressure on interest rates , and so there are a variety of vicious cycles that could kick in . ”
In such a situation , the Federal Reserve Board would face “ a difficult dilemma , ” he continues , “ because on the one hand you want to provide liquidity [ by reducing interest rates ] at a moment when foreigners are withdrawing assets , and on the other hand you want to strengthen the currency and strengthen credibility [ by raising rates ] , and you ca n’t both ease and tighten with one policy instrument . ”
Nor could the federal government easily help , given that it is already running annual budget deficits of about $ 270 billion and facing increasing interest costs ( $ 406 billion in 2006 ) to service the national debt of $ 8.8 trillion — $ 2 trillion of it held by foreigners .
A dollar crisis for the United States would be in nobody ’s interests , of course .
If the currency dropped 40 percent , nations holding dollar reserves would see the value of their holdings drop by a like amount .
Doing anything that might precipitate a dollar crisis , including suspending purchases of dollar debt , would therefore hurt everyone .
( Summers refers to this as a “ financial balance of terror . ” )
But that is not enough to guarantee that such a thing might not happen , either by accident or as the result of a diplomatic crisis , says the Business School ’s Rawi Abdelal .
“ World politics is about countries doing things that are not in their narrow economic interests , but that serve some political agenda , ” whether a crisis like Suez , or the long - term maintenance of export - related jobs .
“ The nightmare scenario , ” says Mohamed El - Erian , who as chief executive officer and president of Harvard Management Company ( HMC ) oversees the investment of Harvard ’s $ 30 - billion endowment , “ includes the possibility , for example , that Taiwan does something to upset China ; the U.S. allies itself fully with Taiwan ; and you have a political crisis with economic implications . ”
A conflict over the Taiwan Strait , agrees Abdelal , “ could lead China to diversify quickly out of dollars .
I think that things could turn out very badly , very quickly . ”
The most important domestic remedy , says Jeffrey Frankel , who served as a member of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton , and on its staff under Martin Feldstein during the Reagan administration , is to try to raise the national savings rate , in order to reduce our need to borrow from abroad .
The difficulty is that the biggest single driver is a decline in private savings .
Households that used to be saving about 10 percent of their income as recently as two decades ago are now saving nothing .
But , says Richard Cooper , “ We do n’t know how to make Americans save more . ”
Summers allows that , “ While , arithmetically , a great deal is explained by the changes in private savings , we have much more effective policy methods for changing public saving than we do for changing private savings . ”
That means running a federal budget surplus , either by raising taxes or cutting spending .
This is the one remedy on which virtually everyone agrees .
But national policy cannot provide a complete solution ( see “ Not Your Daddy ’s Deficit , ” page 48 ) to a problem that is global in nature .
If the current account deficit can be managed , that will occur only as the result of international collaboration — but there is little immediate incentive for any country to move .
Notes El - Erian , “ It is the classic ‘ prisoner ’s dilemma . ’
Whoever moves first [ in adjusting exchange rates upward , for example ] , without assurances that others will also move , could be worse off .
The good outcome requires collaboration , but we do n’t have adequate mechanisms for that right now . ”
For El - Erian , the problem is not hypothetical : he and his HMC colleagues want to take advantage of investment opportunities in what he calls “ a global growth handoff , ” but they must think carefully about how best to hedge against the risk that a market accident or a policy mistake could unwind the imbalances chaotically .
In a class El - Erian taught at the business school , he worked with his students to construct investment portfolios based on two different scenarios : portfolio A , which assumes the global imbalances are sustainable , and portfolio B , which assumes they are not .
“ Then we said , ‘ In a world where the imbalances are sustainable , the first portfolio returns in the 20 to 30 percent range , while the second portfolio returns in the 2 to 3 percent range because it is very defensive .
But in a world where the imbalances are not sustainable , in portfolio A you lose a lot of capital , and in B you do n’t . ’”
Which do you choose ?
“ The problem is that there are not enough facts right now for you to have sufficient conviction about what will happen , ” El - Erian continues , “ so you have to be open to the possibility of incorporating more information as you go forward .
So we position ourselves to explicitly allow for different states of the world to play out .
The reality is that we think there are arguments for both .
So we try to benefit from what we do know and manage the risks of what we do n’t know . ”
Frankel says the current situation is frequently compared to the Bretton Woods system as it worked in the 1960s .
“ There were constant meetings then among the U.S. , the Europeans , and Japan where everybody agreed not to sell dollars .
They realized , ‘ If any one of us sells dollars , we are going to bring the whole thing tumbling down . ’”
That worked for a time .
But back then , Frankel says , the European central bankers “ met with each other every other month and looked each other in the eye and agreed not to sell .
Today , there is no agreement at all .
The Asian countries and the oil exporters do n’t meet each other regularly , they are not political allies , and there is no sense of propping up the system .
The Chinese and the Japanese , the two biggest holders , are kind of at odds .
And then you throw in Saudi Arabia and a whole diversity of countries that have nothing in particular in common , and you could argue that , even if they all got together and came to an agreement not to sell dollars , there would still be a huge temptation at some point to defect .
But , ” he adds , “ they are not even trying to agree .
That says to me that at some point , somebody is going to start selling .
Ideally , we would negotiate a coordinated policy package , but at the moment , in practical terms , that is , ” says Frankel , “ unthinkable . ”
Alfaro , who is originally from Costa Rica , has a distinctly personal perspective on the ramifications of the imbalances .
Although she remains optimistic that they can be corrected slowly , “ It is the impact in the rest of the world that worries me , ” she says .
“ The U.S. has n’t had a real recession for a while . ”
In a contraction , “ There would be bankruptcies .
Some Americans would lose their houses , and many people would have to adjust their standard of living .
But the U.S. will still be the richest country on earth .
But for the rest of the world , a 1 or 2 or 3 percent recession in the U.S. would be a catastrophe .
That is the part of the U.S. role in this that I think is really irresponsible — the failure of leadership in the world . ”

John Lennon once sang “ Imagine no possessions — I wonder if you can . ”
After I sold everything I owned and moved out of state , these lyrics represented nearly everyone I met .
“ You sold everything you owned ?
That ’s crazy .
I could never do that . ”
I used to feel the same way .
Parting with personal belongings was difficult because I viewed an item ’s price tag as a solid representation of its value .
I often told myself things like :
I ca n’t afford to lose that , it ’s a — $ 200 stereo , $ 500 television , $ 300 suit .
Incidentally , this materialistic mindset almost cost me my life .
It was the summer of 2000 .
High school was done .
My friends and I celebrated our newfound freedom impractically :
We used our savings to buy Jeeps , and then spent most of the summer off - roading .
It was during one of our off - roading adventures when we discovered “ Gravelly Run . ”
Gravelly Run is a hidden water hole in the middle of the Pine Barrens .
It served as an alternative to the beach when you wanted to go swimming with the added benefit of no parental supervision .
For those who knew about it , Gravelly Run was a haven for teenage rebellion .
It also sets the scene for my most notorious moment of indiscretion .
At the start of the summer , Gravelly Run was an ordinary water hole .
By summer ’s end , resourceful daredevils had transformed it into the most feature - rich water hole in South Jersey .
Self - built add - ons appeared every time we went there : A rope swing was hung from a tall tree branch for killer cannonballs .
Wooden platforms were attached to trees along the water ’s edge for diving .
A zip line suspended 30 feet in the air stretched between the opposing shores for a high - rise thrill .
For the uninformed , a zip line is a steel insulated cable with a trolley on it .
The trolley has handlebars that you use to “ zip ” from one end of the cable to the other .
Once we saw it , we immediately wanted to try it
out .
Unfortunately , whoever set up the zip line did n’t leave the trolley behind .
Without it , the suspended cable loomed high above — clearly teasing us .
Determined to try out the latest addition to Gravelly Run , I improvised : I retrieved a tow rope from my Jeep .
It was a 12 foot long piece of sturdy rope with metal hooks on both ends .
Convinced this could work , I tucked it under my arm and ran back to the water ’s edge .
I climbed the series of two - by - fours that had been nailed into the tree trunk until I reached the zip line .
The treetop swayed easily in the summer breeze with me perched in it .
Fearlessly , I latched the two
metal hooks onto the insulated steel cable , then planted my bare feet into the center of the “ U ” I created with the rope .
Holding the rope near the hooks , I adjusted my weight from the tree limb to the tow rope
— and committed myself to the ride .
I quickly learned that a tow rope is a poor choice of vessel for crossing a zip line .
My weight caused the hooks to dig into the cable insulation .
Consequently , the insulation stripped off as I slid down
the cable .
It bunched up around the metal hooks in a mess of clear plastic as it peeled .
Eventually , I found myself stranded high above the center of the water pit .
The stripped insulation had bunched up to the point where the metal hooks slid no further .
I lost my balance and fell 30 feet into
the water below .
My tow rope remained firmly embedded in the cable .
I swam ashore , looked at the mess I created , and frowned .
Half of the zip line was bare steel cable , half of it was still insulated , and smack in the center was a big knot of plastic that held my tow rope hostage .
I instinctually thought : I ca n’t afford to lose that , it ’s a $ 50 tow rope .
With this thought , I caused myself to do the stupidest thing I ’ve ever done in my life : I attempted to retrieve my tow rope using a makeshift harness made out of towels .
The idea seemed logical when I first imagined it .
It seemed logical as I swam to the other side of the water pit holding the towels above my head .
It still seemed logical as I climbed the tree with the two towels slung around my neck .
It even seemed doable as I sat perched in the tree and tied the towels to the cable .
“ Just like in the Cliffhanger movie , ” I thought .
I foresaw myself sliding along the cable with profound ease while being suspended upside down in the harness .
I foresaw everyone on the shore clapping and cheering as I dislodged the tow rope .
I did not foresee — or even consider the possibility of — falling 30 feet to my death .
I completed the harness .
One towel was wrapped around my back , the other was under my butt .
The idea was that the towels would support me as I laid in a horizontal position , and I could wriggle along the cable easily .
The reality , however , was that I wriggled only five feet from the treetop without incident .
I gasped in fright when the towel that was previously supporting my butt slipped under my knees .
My legs clenched
around the towel hard , and suddenly I understood what might happen if I fell this close to the shore .
I tried to scoot back into the lower towel , but only managed to bunch the higher towel tight beneath my armpits .
I heard my friends shout things from the shore as I stared at the sky feeling trapped .
If I had been given more time , I may have thought of trying to return to the tree .
My ability to make choices ceased , however , when the knot in the towel supporting my torso untied .
With nothing supporting my torso , I toppled backwards out of the harness .
I struck several tree branches during my 30 foot descent and landed in shallow water belly - up .
My butt struck the floor hard .
“ Are you okay ! ? ” someone from the opposite shore shouted .
I waved my arm to signal that I was unharmed , although I had n’t really assessed whether I was or not .
My back hurt , my butt hurt , and I was unable to speak — I was in shock .
If I had landed on the shore , I would have broken bones .
If I had landed head first , I would have been paralyzed .
If I had landed head first on the shore , I would have died .
Luckily , the worst injuries I received from the fall were a scraped - up back and a bruised butt .
More interestingly , I left Gravelly Run that day having learned an important lesson :
Life is more valuable than things .
Looking back on that day , I see two things being put on a scale : a tow rope and a human being .
One of those things can be replaced for a mere $ 50 .
The other , on the other hand , is irreplaceable .
From this perspective , it ’s easy to tell which is worth more .
Do n’t risk your life the way I did in order to learn this lesson .
Know that it ’s not possible to put a price on the human experience — it ’s simply too valuable .
When you find yourself facing a choice that could endanger your life , remember to ask yourself :
How much is your life worth ?

As the world becomes increasingly digital , writing becomes more important .
This is especially true for non-writers .
If you work in an office , the majority of your communications are made with text by email or IM .
Whether you like it or not , your ability to exchange ideas , collaborate with others , and ultimately succeed , hinges on the ability to write effectively .
Earlier this week , K . Stone laid out a process to help you write faster , better , and easier .
To follow up , here are 10 timeless tips to help you improve style and substance , straight from the pens of humanity ’s finest authors .
Writing Tips
1 . Cut the boring parts
I try to leave out the parts that people skip .
~ Elmore Leonard
Unless you ’re writing for personal reasons alone , you need to consider the attention of your readers .
There ’s no point is publishing content that is n’t useful , interesting , or both .
2 . Eliminate unnecessary words
Substitute “ damn ” every time you ’re inclined to write “ very ; ” your editor will delete it and the writing will be just as it should be .
~ Mark Twain
I used to feel that using words like “ really ” , “ actually ” , or “ extremely ” made writing more forceful .
It does n’t .
They only get in the way .
Cut them and never look back .
3 . Write with passion
Fill your paper with the breathings of your heart .
~ William Wordsworth
It ’s not hard to realize that unless you ’re excited about your writing no one else will be .4 .
Paint a picture
Do n’t tell me the moon is shining ; show me the glint of light on broken glass .
~ Anton Chekhov
Simply stating something is fine , but when you need to capture attention , using similes , metaphors , and vivid imagery to paint a picture creates a powerful emotional response .
5 .
Keep it simple
Vigorous writing is concise .
~ William Strunk Jr .
Maybe it was all those late nights , struggling to fill out mandatory 10 page papers , but many people seem to think that worthwhile writing is long and drawn out .
It ’s more difficult ( and effective ) to express yourself in the simplest possible manner .
6 .
Do it for love
Write without pay until somebody offers to pay .
~ Mark Twain
When you ’re just starting out it ’s hard to decide where to begin .
So do n’t .
Just start writing .
A blog is a good place to start .
The most valuable benefit is the feedback .
7 . Learn to thrive on criticism
You have to know how to accept rejection and reject acceptance .
~ Ray Bradbury
Writing means putting yourself at the mercy of anonymous hecklers and shameless sycophants .
Learn to make the most of the insults and distrust the praise .
8 . Write all the time
Quantity produces quality .
If you only write a few things , you ’re doomed .
~ Ray Bradbury
The way you define yourself as a writer is that you write every time you have a free minute .
If you did n’t behave that way you would never do anything .
~ John Irving
9 . Write what you know … or what you want to know
If any man wish to write in a clear style , let him be first clear in his thoughts ; and if any would write in a noble style , let him first possess a noble soul .
~ Johann Wolfgang von Goethe Learn as much by writing as by reading .
~ Lord Acton
Successful writing is all about trust and authority .
It makes sense to write about your area of expertise .
If you do n’t have an expertise , reading and writing is the best way to develop one and put it on display .
10 .
Be unique and unpredictable
I owe my success to having listened respectfully to the very best advice , and then going away and doing the exact opposite .
~ G.K. Chesterton Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative .
~ Oscar Wilde Zest. Gusto .
How rarely one hears these words used .
How rarely do we see people living , or for that matter , creating by them .
Yet if I were asked to name the most important items in a writer ’s make - up , the things that shape his material and rush him along the road to where he wants to go , I could only warn him to look to his zest , see to his gusto .
~ Ray Bradbury
Following what works will only get you so far .
Experiment with new styles , even if it means taking criticism .
Without moving forward , you ’ll be left behind .
( CNN ) -- A Canadian firetruck responding with lights and sirens to a weekend fire in Rouses Point , New York , was stopped at the U.S. border for about eight minutes , U.S. border officials said Tuesday .
The U.S. - Canadian border is more than 5,000 miles long .
Fire officials battling the blaze called for help from fire departments in nearby Quebec , using a longstanding and often - used mutual aid agreement .
But the first truck that arrived at the small Rouses Point border crossing was delayed as officials checked documentation of the firefighters and their truck , officials confirmed .
Two other trucks that arrived at the crossing next were cleared in less than two minutes each , a time that one fire official said was still too long considering the situation .
" It 's embarrassing , " said Chris Trombley , chief of the Champlain [ New York ] Volunteer Fire Department and deputy fire coordinator for Clinton County Emergency Services .
" We 're calling for help from another country and the first roadblock they hit is at our border . "
The Canadian firefighters " were asked for IDs , " Trombley said .
" I believe they even ran the license plate on the truck to make sure it was legal . "
In the past , firetrucks on emergency calls cleared border checkpoints in 30 seconds or less , Trombley said , although he said identification is sometimes checked upon their return .
A U.S. Customs and Border Protection official said the eight - minute delay at the Rouses Point crossing was caused " when one of the firefighters ' admissibility was brought into question . "
He declined to elaborate , citing immigration and privacy laws .

A government source familiar with the case said one firefighter had a criminal record , raising questions about whether he could enter the United States .
Kevin Corsaro of the border protection 's Buffalo field office said the agency 's primary responsibility is to protect the homeland .
He called the event an " isolated incident " and said agency officials were meeting with local fire officials to " develop a plan to prevent the possibility of any delays . "
No one was seriously injured in the fire , but The Anchorage Inn restaurant -- a landmark in the village of Rouses Point -- was destroyed .
A firefighter who suffered minor smoke inhalation was treated at the scene , said Michael LeBlanc , chief of the Rouses Point Volunteer Fire Department .
The cause of the blaze has not been determined , he said .
Ten fire departments , including the Canadian departments , responded to the fire .
" Would it [ quicker passage at the border ] have changed the outcome of the fire ? "
Trombley asked .
" Would the building have been burned ?
Of course it would . "
But he said firefighters were getting fatigued fighting the fire and relief was delayed .
" Just the fact that it could happen and it could happen again is what has us worried , " he said .
Clinton County has mutual aid agreements with fire departments in Vermont and Quebec , Trombley said , and the county requests help from Quebec fire departments about 30 times a year .
It sends help to Canada a similar number of times , he said .
Trombley and LeBlanc said they planned to meet with authorities on Wednesday to discuss the incident .
LeBlanc declined to comment .
" I do n't have all the facts and I do n't want to mistake what happened , " he said .
" We 've had a mutual aid system in place since the '50s and I can't remember anything like this happening , " said Trombley .

The Tories say Britain 's public services are overstretched
The Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) had estimated the net increase in population due to migration would be 145,000 a year .
But it has revised that upwards by about a third to 190,000 migrants annually over the next 20 years .
The ONS also predicts life expectancy will rise further than anticipated .
Sir Andrew Green , chair of Migrationwatch UK , said : " The result is that 86 % of our population increase will now be due to immigration , which will add 7.2 million to our population between 2004 and 2031 . "
Migration is bringing new wealth but also new worries to Britain
Liam Byrne
Immigration Minister
Shadow immigration minister Damian Green told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " This involves a population of a city the size of Liverpool being added to our population every five years or so , and obviously our public services , our infrastructure , housing demand and so on cannot cope . "
The Conservatives wanted " an explicit annual limit " on the number of people allowed to enter the UK , he added .
' Sweeping changes '
The ONS said the amended estimate was partly due to factoring in record net immigration in 2004 and 2005 , mainly from eastern Europe .
Changes to the way migration figures were calculated also played a part .
Immigration Minister Liam Byrne said : " This report shows what could happen unless we take action now .
The challenge is to ensure we can continue to reap the benefits of migration at the same time as building cohesive communities
Danny Sriskandarajah , IPPR
" Frankly , it underlines the need for swift and sweeping changes to the immigration system in the next 12 months .
" Migration is bringing new wealth but also new worries to Britain .
That means we need to drive through radical action now to make sure our borders policy is fit for the future . "
Nick Clegg , the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman , said : " Immigration is enormously important to Britain , but these figures highlight the need to plan for its impact instead of indulging in the usual mix of media - driven populism and administrative incompetence . "
His party has proposed a " selective amnesty " for some illegal immigrants , making them eligible for citizenship after 10 years ' residency .
Danny Sriskandarajah , from think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research ( IPPR ) , said : " The challenge is to ensure we can continue to reap the benefits of migration at the same time as building cohesive communities . "
Julian Bild , a senior lawyer for the Immigration Advisory Service , said : " Perhaps this is n't immigration as such , but EU nationals exercising the same rights that we have - which is unrestricted freedom of movement around Europe . "
Life expectancy
The ONS also predicts life expectancy for babies born in 2031 will rise to 82.7 years for males and 86.2 years for females , up from 81.4 years and 85.0 years in earlier calculations .
Estimates for how migrants would be distributed across the UK in years to come were also being revised .
England is projected to have 171,500 new migrants a year , over 40,000 more than previous estimates .
Scotland 's new arrivals are put at 8,500 a year compared with 4,000 previously , while Northern Ireland 's population is likely to rise by 500 a year rather than fall by the same number .
Conversely , Wales is now expected to receive 2,000 fewer new migrants overall than previously thought .

Chef Antony Worrall Thompson will host the dinner at the Savoy Hotel in London , which will be attended by celebrities and politicians .
Mr Clark will tell guests that Britain is " developing into a nanny state " .
" When you leave school you are considered to be an adult .
" You should be mature enough to make informed choices about eating , drinking , smoking and other activities that give you pleasure but involve a degree of risk , " he will say .
" Instead , politicians and campaigners are lining up to lecture , harass and insult those of us who choose to smoke a perfectly legal product . "
' Social killjoys '
Claire Fox , director of the Institute of Ideas , will say the ban is a sign of " our small - minded times " .
" These new modern puritans demonise our behaviour and preach illiberalism .
" We are constantly hectored about how anti-social smoking is , but the real social killjoys are those who do n't trust adults to make decisions on their own . "
From Sunday , smoking will be banned in nearly all enclosed public places and workplaces in England , including restaurants , offices , factories , shopping centres and taxi offices .
It follows bans in Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland .
Public Health Minister Caroline Flint said last week that the number of people aware of England 's smoking ban had risen to 95 % .
" A smoke - free England will see the single biggest improvement in public health for a generation , " she said .
Ahhh , e-cards .
Once a fun way to express those delicate emotions in a way that only hundreds of retina - burning animated GIFs and a midi version of Rush 's " Tom Sawyer " can .
Now , a surefire way to get your email added to spammers ' mailing lists .
Still , it 's hard not to smile when you get an e-card .
Years ago , T. I. was working as an intern in the IT department of a small company .
On their web site they offered a free e-card service , built by an outside vendor .
An outside vendor named Frank .
T. I. was tasked with integrating Frank 's e-card infrastructure with the company 's on - site servers .
Frank 's code was n't great , but it was n't so horrible that it'd be featured on this , your favorite web site .
Frank had even taken the time to add some advanced functionality , like scheduling of cards .
For example , if a friend 's birthday was coming up , you could queue a card ahead of time and have it automatically sent on his birthday .
Naturally , this would be a batch process that would run nightly .
T. I. searched and searched , but just could n't find the code that dispatched queued cards .
He checked every batch job scheduler on every server that could possibly send the cards , but found nothing .
Finally , looking through .asp files , he found one that was capable of sending queued cards , but it seemed to be a test script .
Frustrated , T. I. called Frank to find out how the batch job was run .
" There 's a way to schedule tasks ? "
Frank replied , surprised .
" Well , do n't worry about it .
I 've got it covered . "
" What do you mean ' you 've got it covered ? ' " asked T. I .
" I set dispatchqueued . asp as my IE home page .
I'm on the internet practically every day , so do n't worry about it . "
That 's right , Frank going online every day was a key component of this production environment .
More curbs to go , but lockdown to stay , PM hints at CMs meet
PM Modi hinted that a more graded relaxation of the lockdown could be on its way during a lengthy interaction with the CMs .
“ We have a twofold challenge — to reduce the transmission rate of the disease and to increase public activity gradually , while adhering to all the guidelines , ” he said .
Sweetness is about to be the subject of a bitter courtroom fight .
In one corner is the artificial sweetener in the blue packet , Equal ; in the other is its best - selling rival in the yellow packet , Splenda .
The maker of Equal contends that Splenda has been misleading millions of consumers by fostering the notion , through television and print advertising , that Splenda is made from sugar and is natural .
Splenda ’s maker counters that the process to make the sweetener does indeed start with sugar .
Next Monday , a lawsuit brought by the maker of Equal , Merisant , against Splenda ’s maker , McNeil Nutritionals , is scheduled to go before a jury in Federal District Court in Philadelphia .
At stake is leadership of the fiercely competitive $ 1.5 billion artificial sweetener market .
Equal had once dominated the market , finding its way into more than 6,000 consumer products like Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi , the two biggest buyers of artificial sweeteners in the world .

For seven - year - old Javaid Iqbal , the holiday to Florida was a dream trip to reward him for doing well at school .
But he was left in tears after he was stopped repeatedly at airports on suspicion of being a terrorist .
The security alerts were triggered because Javaid shares his name with a Pakistani man deported from the US , prompting staff at three airports to question his family about his identity .
The family even missed their flight home from the U.S. after officials cancelled their tickets in the confusion .
And Javaid 's passport now contains a sticker saying he has undergone highlevel security checks .
Scroll down for more
The ordeal began in Manchester when Naushaba Nadeem , a doctor , and her children Sana and Fareeha , both nine , Javaid and five - year - old Iftikhar , tried to board a flight to Orlando .
Dr Nadeem , 35 , said : " When we arrived at the front counter to check in at Manchester Airport , staff said there was a security block on Javaid 's name .
" I understand and agree security checks are important but he is only seven and a half years old .
" We had to stand at the desk for three hours while they checked everything out .
Eventually , everything was fine and we were given our boarding passes . "
The family enjoyed their eightday holiday earlier this month , taking in Disney World and other attractions before returning to the UK on a route that began with an internal flight from Orlando to Philadelphia .
Dr Nadeem said : " It happened again at Orlando Airport and then Javaid 's name was blocked again at Philadelphia Airport .
Scroll down for more
" This time they had cancelled our tickets by the time they gave Javaid security clearance .
I was all on my own , I do n't know anyone in Philadelphia . "
Javaid said : " All this was about my name .
They said that it had a block on it .
We felt scared and did n't know what was going on . "
His father Nadeem Iqbal , 48 , a consultant anaesthetist , said : " My son is psychologically traumatised by this experience and said he does n't want to fly to America again .
" The problem seems to be isolated to the US because this did not happen when we visited Tenerife .
We do n't want to have to experience anything like this again . "
Javaid 's parents , who moved to Blackburn from Saudi Arabia in 2002 , are now considering changing their son's name .
Dr Nadeem said : " The system should cross reference the name , then a date of birth or some other information . "
The name Javaid Iqbal was blocked and flagged up as a security alert on each airport 's computer system set up by Homeland Security , a US organisation .
A 39 - year - old Pakistani man of that name was arrested in New York two months after the terror attack on the World Trade Centre in 2001 .
He was never charged with any terrorism offences , although he was convicted of fraud for having false papers and deported .
He is seeking compensation from the U.S. government , claiming to have been beaten up by guards during more than a year in detention .
Security sources say that as Iqbal was deported , any attempt to enter the US by someone with a similar name would trigger an alert .
Professor Eric Grove , director of the centre for international security and war studies at Salford University , said : " There are names on file which are checked and there are certain names in combination or singly which put people under scrutiny .
' Intelligence - based analysis has been used to compile the list but it is unlikely a sevenyear - old child is a suicide bomber .
I think there must be a right balance to counter terrorism without alienating people . "
Salim Mulla , secretary of the Lancashire Council of Mosques , said : " It is ridiculous , I 'm shocked .
" They really should have known he was only a seven - yearold child .
I do understand the reasons but this was over the top .
I can understand the safety aspect but it does n't help relationships with different faiths . "
International airports will not discuss security policies and anti-terrorism measures and all those involved refused to comment on this case .
Republican support for the war is probably stronger today than when Democrats took power .
Democrats remain stalled on Iraq debate
As the congressional session lurches toward a close , Democrats are confronting some demoralizing arithmetic on Iraq .
The numbers tell a story of political and substantive paralysis more starkly than most members are willing to acknowledge , perhaps even to themselves .
Advertisement
Since taking the majority , they have forced 40 votes on bills limiting President Bush ’s war policy .
Only one of those has passed both chambers , even though both are run by Democrats .
That one was vetoed by Bush .
Indeed , the only war legislation enacted during this Congress has been to give the president exactly what he wants , and exactly what he has had for the past five years : more money , with no limitations .
Disapproval of the Democratic majority in Congress has risen steadily , albeit with no corresponding increase in enthusiasm for Republicans .
Even more notably , public opinion about the war — while still dominated by opposition to a military adventure most people think was a mistake — has risen modestly in recent weeks , according to several nonpartisan polls .
Democrats plan to spend the December recess reviewing their strategy and determining if they missed opportunities to put limitations , even if they were smaller than war activists were demanding , on Bush ’s war policies .
Some Democratic strategists are warning that congressional leaders are “ muddling through ” with a strategy that carries both political and military risks for the party .
John Podesta , who runs the Center for American Progress , a liberal think tank , is advising Democrats to try to shift war policy around the edges while carefully setting the stage for an easier withdrawal when the next president takes office .
There may well have been paths not taken this year that would have produced better results .
But what the year has mostly highlighted is that Democrats and anti-war activists were in the grip of two illusions after their triumph in the 2006 elections .
The first illusion is that taking power on Capitol Hill was by its very nature — no matter the precise legislation that emerged — something that would alter the basic dynamics of Iraq policy .
Instead , it ’s now clear that even a weakened , and in many ways discredited , president remains the dominant policymaker on Iraq .
For 50 years , legislators of both parties have ceded war - making power to the executive branch , and there is no reversing that in a matter of months — least of all when the opposition party is itself divided over what to do .
What ’s more , it turns out that Washington matters less than many Democrats and even many journalists supposed in determining political momentum in the Iraq debate .
Events on the ground — including regular , if still fragmentary , evidence that security is improving somewhat in the wake of the military ’s “ surge ” policy — matter more .
The second illusion is that Democrats could stall substantively and still prosper politically .
A few months ago , many lawmakers were saying something like this : “ It ’s true we ca n’t force Bush ’s hand on Iraq because we do not have veto - proof majorities .
But the longer he sticks with an unpopular war , the better it will be for Democrats , and eventually the moderates and war skeptics in the GOP will stage a full revolt . ”
This might yet come true by the next election , in 2008 .
For now , it looks like substantive weakness — the failure to drive policy changes on Iraq — has reinforced political weakness .
“ Republicans ( including the president ) have made real progress in swaying opinion to their side , while 10 months of Democratic efforts have failed to persuade citizens that the war continues to be a disaster , ” according to Charles Franklin , a University of Wisconsin political scientist who analyzed public opinion on the nonpartisan Pollster.com .
“ The war of partisan persuasion has tilted towards the Republicans and away from the Democrats , at least in this particular aspect . ”
This surprising turn has prompted a what - if debate among Democratic lawmakers .
Some of them have told us privately that their leaders botched a chance earlier this year — before the surge appeared to have some success — to work with Republicans on modest restrictions on the war .
House Minority Whip Roy Blunt ( R - Mo. ) told us last week his biggest fear early on was that Democrats would seek compromise solutions with moderate Republicans on the war and other issues .
Blunt suggested the strategy probably would have worked .
But once Rep. Brian Baird ( D - Wash . ) , a staunch war opponent , returned from a visit to Iraq and applauded the surge , any chance of a compromise clampdown ended .
Repeated predictions that GOP support was on the verge of collapsing never materialized , and Republican support for the war is probably stronger today than when Democrats took power .
Jim Manley , a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , said the only strategic miscalculation Democrats might have made was “ failing to grasp how much Republicans were willing to stick with the president . ”
Still , he said Republicans pursued unity at their own peril .
“ The Republicans own this thing , lock , stock and barrel . ”
For the first time in years , Republicans are privately telling their members with a straight face that the war , in political terms , may be neutralized for next year ’s election , which would have big ramifications for both sides .
A word of caution before we go into the numbers : Republicans remain broadly disliked , the war remains powerfully unpopular and opinion is prone to shift rapidly with events .
That said , 44 percent of Americans now believe the war is going “ very ” or “ fairly ” well , a high point in the past year , according to The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press , a nonpartisan group .
At the same time , CBS News polling has found U.S. opposition to Bush ’s troop surge softening a bit .
Yes , public opposition to the war remains high .
But there has been a small uptick even in the number of independents and Democrats who are optimistic the surge might work ( though most remain pessimistic ) .
The Democratic base ’s negative view of the war also has lessened of late .
This summer , CBS News found that 57 percent of Democrats thought the war was going “ very badly . ”
Today , the number has fallen by 12 points , to 45 percent .
The changing views probably have little to do with Congress , said Stephen Biddle , a senior fellow for defense policy at the Council on Foreign Relations .
“ You have also had the near absence of the war coverage in the last months , and since the coverage is generally negative , the less coverage , the less negative communications that reaches people ’s living rooms . ”
Pew reported Friday that only 16 percent of Americans name the Iraq war as the news story that first comes to mind today — a huge shift .
In January , when Democrats took office , 55 percent of Americans said Iraq was on the top of their minds .
Pelosi is trying to end the congressional year on a familiar note .
She is pushing for a House vote on legislation that would directly tie new money for the war to specific troop withdrawals .
It would provide Bush only $ 50 billion of the $ 196 billion he requested for war operations .
And it has no chance of becoming law .
Manley said the Senate would push similar legislation , likely next week .
Meanwhile , both sides must contemplate the most dispiriting piece of Iraq arithmetic of all .
At the start of the year , there had been 3,003 U.S. military casualties in Iraq .
Now there have been 3,860 — already making this the deadliest year of the five - year military campaign .
David Paul Kuhn and Avi Zenilman contributed to this story .
UPDATE : The original version of this story inaccurately stated that none of the 40 Democratic efforts to limit the Iraq war cleared Congress .
None were signed into law , but one bill did make it to President Bush for his veto .
The next time Michael Mukasey is called to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee I suggest that he be strapped to a stretcher , a rag placed in his mouth and water poured in the rag until he begins to answer completely and truthfully the questions put to him by the committee .
Now that waterboarding has become an accepted form of interrogation in these United States , I recommend that it be utilized not only with Mukasey , but with all future witnesses before committees of the congress .
I think that there are subpoenas kicking around out there for Condi Rice and other executive department figures who have been less than forthcoming in past appearances , so perhaps as our favorite republican tough guy Rudy Giuliani says , we should question them aggressively .
It might be a good idea if the voting public were able to use the same technique in questioning the presidential candidates on their positions .
For the rest of the debates all candidates should be wheeled in strapped to stretchers and aggressively questioned using this simulated drowning method .
Using these methods we may begin to get the truth from our " public servants " and declared wannabes .
This will not work in Atlanta however , they do n't have enough water at the moment to achieve any kind of satisfactory results .

前回の内容を踏まえて、今回は、Haskellで記述されたアセンブリプログラムをアセンブルして、それを前回述べた方法を用いて実行することを目標とする。
本項で はHaskell上でアセンブリプログラムを記述するための言語を構築し、それに対するアセンブラを作成する。
記述の利便性のため 、Haskell上で構築する言語はモナドで構成する。普通のアセンブラで扱えるような形で記述できればうれしい。
foo :: CodeBlock ( IO Int ) foo = assemble $ do movl eax 777 movl eax ecx movl eax ( mem ( eax ) ) movl eax ( mem ( eax , ebx ) ) movl eax ( mem ( eax , ( ebx , 4 ) ) ) movl eax ( mem( eax , 4 ) ) movl eax ( mem ( eax , ebx ,777 ) ) movl eax ( mem ( eax , ( ebx , 8) ,777 ) ) ret
サイズ指定を容易にするため、gasのようにニモニックでオペランドサイズを指定することにする。そのほかの部分はintel形式を模倣する。このようにコードを記述できてそれを実行できるようにすべく以降で定義をしてゆく。
まず、アセンブリプログラムを表すAsmモナドを定義する。Asmモナドは
type Asm a = RWS ( ) [ Mnemonic ] AsmState a
このように定義した。RWSモナドは、Reader とWriterとStateの能力を持つモナドで、今回のアセンブラではアセンブリの中間コード（上でのMnemonic）を出力するためのWriterと状態を扱うためにStateを利用する。Asmモナドは一塊のコードを示し、これをassembleにかけることによって関数というまとまった単位のコードにアセンブルされるものとする。
Mnemonicは次のように定義した。
data Mnemonic = Imp Mne | Uni Mne Size Operand | Bin Mne Size Operand Operand | Tri Mne Size Operand Operand Operand | Rel Mne LabelID | Abs Mne CodeBlock | Label LabelID
Impはオペランドなしの命令 。Uni , Bin , Triはそれぞれオペランドが1，2，3個の命令。RelとAbsは後述。Labelはラベルの定義。
サイズは、1，2，4，8バイトのいずれか。
data Size = SByte | SWord | SDWord | SQWord deriving ( Show )
x86のオペランドは、レジスタと即値とメモリアドレスがあり、アドレッシングモードは、（ベースレジスタ）＋（インデックスレジスタ）＊（スケール（1,2,4 or 8））＋（ディスプレースメント）の形および、このうち1つ以上が欠けた形を取る。
data Operand = Imm Int | Reg RegName | Mem Address data Address = Address ( Maybe RegName ) ( Maybe ( RegName , Int ) ) Displacement
実際にアセンブリを記述する際はmovlなどのヘルパ関数を用いる。この際、利便性のために引数でオーバーロードしてほしい（数値が書かれていれば即値など）。アドレスを指すためにはmemという関数を用いる。これを用いなくても（eax,(ebx,2),1）のような形であればmovlなどで直接オーバーロードできるが、(eax)というような形は（つまり1-tupleは）eaxと区別できないのでそれらを区別するために用いる。引数をオーバーロードするために次のようなクラスを定義する。
class AddrMode a where toArgument :: a ->
Operand instance Integral a => AddrMode a where toArgument n = Imm $ fromIntegral n instance AddrMode RegName where toArgument r = Reg r instance AddrMode Address where toArgument a =
Mem a instance AddrMode Operand where toArgument o = o
これでmovlが定義可能になる。
movl :: ( AddrMode a , AddrMode b ) => a -> b -> Asm ( ) movl = tell [ Bin Mov SDWord ( toArgument a ) ( toArgument b ) ]
他の命令も同様に定義できる。
ラベルおよびジャンプ命令は次のように記述できるようにする。
hoge = assemble $ do l <- genLabel label l ... jmp l
genLabelでラベルIDを生成して、それを用いてラベル定義やジャンプ、条件ジャンプを記述する。ラベルIDを文字列にしてユーザが指定の文字列でラベルを記述できるようにしてもよかったが、後のことを考えるとこちらのほうが有利と判断した。
call命令に関してはローカルなラベルではなくて、他の関数を呼び出せなければいけない。他の関数はCodeBlock型で示される同じくアセンブラで生成された機械語列であるとする。
foo = assemble $ do ... bar = assemble $ do ... call foo ...
このように定義すると、例えば上の場合だと、barのアセンブルの際にfooの値が必要になる、つまり、fooのアセンブルが終わっている必要がある。あるいは、fooの値はメモリの先頭なのであるから、ポインタの値だけでも決まっている必要がある。これは再帰的に参照している場合に問題になる。それを許す実装も不可能ではないが、必要以上に複雑になるので、ここでは再帰的な参照は許さないものとする。ただし、直接的な再帰は利用される機会も多いのでselfという特別な名前を用いて行えるようにしておく。相互再帰に関しては、今のところおいておく。
このよう にAsmモナドを定義すると、これを実行することによってMnemonicの列が得られる。あとは得られたMnemonicをバイト列にしてやればよい（と一言で言っているが、ここが一番大変）。
そのようにしてできたのがこちらである。命令はごく少数しかサポートしていないのであしからず。
http://fxp.infoseek.ne.jp/tmp/asm/AsmX86.zip
コード例をいくつか示す。
前回手書きしたコードと同じもの。
import AsmX86 bar :: CodeBlock ( IO Int ) bar = assemble $ do movl eax 777 ret
階乗
fact :: CodeBlock ( Int -> IO Int ) fact = assemble $ do l <- genLabel movl eax ( mem( esp , 4 ) ) subl eax 1 jnz l movl eax 1 ret label l pushl eax call self popl ecx addl ecx 1 imull eax ecx ret
呼び出し 例
main = do ret <- exec fact 10 print ret
実行例
$ ghc -- make Main.hs
[ 1 of 2 ] Compiling AsmX86 ( AsmX86.hs , AsmX86.o )
[ 2 of 2 ] Compiling Main ( Main.hs , Main.o )
Linking Main.exe ...
$ ./Main
3628800
このようにごく自然に呼び出せる（くれぐれもx86以外で実行しないように）。
以上のよう にHaskell用インラインアセンブリを定義することができたが、AsmモナドはHaskell上で構築するものであり、その際にはフルスペックのHaskellの能力が利用可能である。つまり、これを用いると一般的なマクロアセンブラの能力あるいはそれ以上に便利な機能が実装できる可能性がある。AsmはモナドでありHaskellで普通に扱えるデータであるので、これを用いてより抽象的なブロックが作れるだろうし、AsmモナドのStateを加えればより便利な機能が実装できるかもしれない。そこで、次回はそちらの方向に話をすすめて、アセンブラをより使いやすいものへと変化させたい。
As governments around the world consider how to respond to the protests in Burma , the BBC News website looks at the aims and influence of key Western and Asian players .
ASEAN Relationship : The Association of South East Asian Nations ( Asean ) has in the past appeared reluctant to condemn a fellow member but member - states appear increasingly uneasy .
Asean foreign ministers meeting in New York urged the Burmese authorities to halt violence against the demonstrators .
Interests : Concern to preserve the unity of the regional bloc needs to be balanced against the desire for regional stability , and pressure from Western countries that wish to secure Asean support for action against the military regime in Rangoon .
Comment : " We hope that the Myanmar [ Burmese ] authorities and all other parties in Myanmar will appreciate the broader implications of their actions on the region as a whole and act accordingly . "
Singapore foreign ministry , current Asean chair CHINA Relationship : A close trading and diplomatic relationship it is seen as the country with the strongest potential to influence events in Burma .
It has blocked UN sanctions against Burma but recently called for " restraint " by " all " parties .
Interests : Burma 's oil and gas reserves are important for a rapidly developing and energy - hungry China but , as a regional power , Beijing also has an interest in ensuring that events in Burma do not lead to regional instability .
Comment : " China hopes that all parties in Myanmar exercise restraint and properly handle the current issue so as to ensure the situation there does not escalate and get complicated , and does not influence the stability of Myanmar and the peace and stability of the region . "
Chinese foreign ministry EUROPEAN UNION Relationship :
While conscious of its lack of leverage over Burma , it is urging India , China and Asean to take a tougher line .
Some sanctions are already in place .
In 1996 the EU banned arms sales and expelled military attaches , and it froze the assets of individuals within the junta .
It withdrew preferential trade status from Burma and subsequently cut off all non-humanitarian aid to the country .
European Parliamentary deputies have called on the EU to work with the US and Asean to prepare measures against the Burmese government , including targeted sanctions .
Interests : Relatively few economic interests in Burma but France remains a major investor , with a joint gas project between the US firm Chevron and French Total .
Comment : " China is the puppet - master of Burma .
The Olympics is the only real lever we have to make China act .
The civilised world must seriously consider shunning China by using the Beijing Olympics to send the clear message that such abuses of human rights are not acceptable . "
Edward McMillan - Scott , vice - president of the European Parliament INDIA Relationship :
It has close economic and diplomatic ties with Burma .
It has expressed concern over the current crisis but generally maintains a careful silence over the situation , describing it as an internal affair of Burma .
Former Defence Minister George Fernandez has described India 's current position as " disgusting " .
Interests : India is concerned above all with protecting its oil interests in Burma , signing a new deep - water exploration deal in the same week that protests got under way .
India also sells arms to the military regime in Rangoon .
But as the world 's most populous democracy , India is under pressure from the West and from activists at home to take a stronger stand in support of democratic forces in Burma .
Comment : " As a close and friendly neighbour , India hopes to see a peaceful , stable and prosperous Myanmar , where all sections of the people will be included in a broad - based process of national reconciliation and political reform . "
Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee RUSSIA
Relationship : While Russia is much less important than China as an ally and trading partner to Burma , Moscow has stood beside Beijing in opposing any attempts to bring foreign pressure to bear on the Burmese government .
Interests : Earlier this year Burma and Russia signed a deal that could lead to the construction of a Russian nuclear research reactor in Burma .
Last year , Moscow offered fighter jets and air defence systems to Rangoon in exchange for access to Burmese oil .
Russian commentators have suggested that a change of government in Rangoon would bring in an administration more susceptible to Western influence than the incumbents .
Comment : " We consider any attempts to use the latest developments to exercise outside pressure or interference in the domestic affairs of this sovereign state to be counterproductive .
We still believe that the processes under way in Burma do not threaten international and regional peace and security . "
Russian foreign ministry UNITED KINGDOM Relationship :
The UK 's status as the former colonial power does not give it any particular influence as economic links have declined and London - in common with other Western governments - has been vocal in its condemnation of the military government .
Interests :
The UK once had major interests in petroleum in Burma but no longer has any large - scale investment in the country .
British companies continue to do business in Burma , with hardwoods being an important import .
Campaigners have complained that UK government policy on trade with Burma is vague and not enforced .
Comment : " I want to see all the pressures of the world put on this regime now - sanctions , the pressure of the UN , pressure from China and all the countries in the region , India , pressure from the whole of the world . "
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown UNITED STATES
Relationship : Washington has called for political change in Burma and expressed support for the recent protests .
In 1997 the US banned new investment in Burma , and in 2003 it banned most Burmese imports and dollar transactions .
It has announced it will impose further sanctions against 14 senior officials in Burma 's government , including the country 's acting prime minister and defence minister .
But in common with the other Western countries , the US realises its influence is weak when compared to that of China , India and Asean .
Interests :
As a result of sanctions few economic interests remain , a major exception being the US share in the Chevron - Total gas project .
Comment : " The world is watching the people of Burma take to the streets to demand their freedom and the American people stand in solidarity with these brave individuals . "
US President George W Bush

CURVIER women may have smart children because hip fat contains polyunsaturated fatty acids critical for the development of the fetus ’s brain .
Using data from the US National Center for Health Statistics , William Lassek at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania and Steven Gaulin of the University of California , Santa Barbara , found a child ’s performance in cognition tests was linked to their mother ’s waist - hip ratio , a proxy for how much fat she stores on her hips .
Children whose mothers had wide hips and a low waist - hip ratio scored highest , leading Lassek and Gaulin to suggest that fetuses benefit from a rich …
One of the great thinkers of the green movement , Paul Hawken , wrote about environmental economics in Natural Capitalism , which Bill Clinton called one of the five most important books in the world today .
And PBS turned his tome Growing a Business into a 17 - part TV series .
His latest book , nearly 10 years in the making , Blessed Unrest : How the Largest Movement in the World Came Into Being and Why No One Saw It Coming , is an exploration of the fragmented world of environmental and social justice organizations , from giant multinational NGOs to four - person internet - based activist groups .
Hawken 's theory is that these organizations , taken collectively , represent the largest social movement in the history of the world .
Though fragmented , he says it 's highly effective .
With no leader , center , organizing system or ideology , the movement Hawken identifies in Blessed Unrest grows organically , crossing borders , class and ethnic differences .
It 's driven mostly by the desire for a common good .
Trying to organize the movement , as well as documenting it , Hawken has created WiserEarth , a collection of wikis that serve as an umbrella for the millions of organizations he has identified and provide a platform for discussion and information sharing .
Wired News : Describe how your bags full of business cards inspired the book .
Paul Hawken :
In the early '90s , I had been giving a hundred speeches or more a year on the environment .
Afterwards people would come up and exchange cards .
I would stuff them into my backpack or pockets and when I got home I would lay them out , look at them , and put them in a drawer .
One day my housekeeper , seeing that the drawer was overflowing , placed them into a gold Bergdorf - Goodman bag in the closet .
When that bag got full , I began to ask myself how many groups there were in the world working on environmental and social issues .
I quickly discovered that no one knew .
So I began to count .
WN : You were asked in 1999 if the WTO protests in Seattle represented a return to the 1960s .
And you said one difference was that the nature of leadership had changed .
Hawken :
It 's difficult for people in the United States to see that there is a massive global movement afoot – what I 'm calling the largest social movement in human history – because it gets no coverage here at all .
A small in - group of charismatic leaders does not represent this movement nor does the movement have a central office or name .
Because there are tens of thousands of leaders of the movement it can be seen as toothless .
Understandable conclusion , but another way to look at it is that we are seeing an entirely new form of leadership that is networked , place - based and task specific .
This is one of the reasons the police were so frustrated during the WTO protests in Seattle .
There was no head to cut off , offices to raid , computers to seize or leader to arrest .
At the 1968 Democratic Convention , the Chicago Seven were arrested and charged with conspiracy and inciting to riot .
Very romantic .
In Seattle , they would have had to arrest the Seattle Seventeen Thousand .
WN : How do the environmental visionaries you write about – Emerson , Thoreau , David Brower – figure in today 's amorphous , sprawling , global eco-social - political movement ?
Hawken :
It is an unwieldy and diverse movement , but then , too , so are the cells in your body when seen up close .
We look at the movement up close and call it amorphous , but we 're unable to step back and see that it might have deeper organizational patterns and functions .
My guess is that this movement is humanity 's immune response to political corruption , economic disease and ecological degradation , but the idea that it arose since Rachel Carson 's Silent Spring just is n't true .
This movement has roots that it is unaware of , cultural memes that have persevered over centuries .
I guess what I 'm saying is that if you 're going to be part of the largest social movement in history , it 's helpful to know your intellectual genetics and spiritual predecessors .
WN : Can you say more about Carson ?
The reaction to 1962's Silent Spring set the stage for how multinationals react to environmental and social justice issues today .
Hawken : Rachel Carson was the first person who used science and nature as a basis to question the rights of business .
You almost have to say it again to get the meaning .
She did not do it overtly , but in elucidating the persistent long - term damage of a new family of pesticides made from chlorinated hydrocarbons , she questioned the assumption that business has greater rights than the environment .
When business realized how responsive the public was to her logic , they went after her with extraordinary vengeance , perfecting techniques that are used to this day , like greenwashing – the creation of industry front groups funded by corporations , the use of paid scientists to attack academic scientists , the manipulation of the media to sow doubt in people ’s minds about complex issues .
The person behind the defaming of Rachel Carson , E. Bruce Harrison , was the same person who helped create the Global Climate Coalition , a so - called nonprofit funded by Chevron , Exxon , General Motors , the American Petroleum Institute and other companies .
Its purpose was to undermine the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol and any other legislation or policy that would limit greenhouse gas emissions .
WN : You quote John Maynard Keynes : " We live under the illusion of freedom but are " slaves to some defunct economist . "
Can you explain why you consider contemporary global economics to be immoral , destructive and impractical ?
Hawken : I do n't use the word immoral .
I think good people can do things that cause harm on a cumulative level , and then be unaware or look the other way , and I have certainly been one of them .
I think there are several fundamentalist movements about in the world , not just Islamic or Christian fundamentalism .
One of them is economic fundamentalism , the idea that unfettered global markets will do a better job in addressing social and economic needs than regulated markets .
Business has spent decades corrupting government using lobbyists and money , ensuring that government became more responsive to bags of money than to social needs and the environment .
It is these bags of money that created our economic policy , not debates in the halls of academia .
WN : So what 's the answer ?
Power remains centralized in these multinationals and in the federal government .
Hawken : I would like to see a lot of power revert to states and city - states because I think that 's where the action is now .
Just as economic globalization has been the biggest game in the world , we are moving into an era where economic localization is going to be the biggest game in our towns and regions .
Governing , whether in business , government or non-profits , is observably more effective when decisions and information are co-located , an insight first made by Friederich Hayek .
This is why the internet is so crucial to both the movement and governance – it can provide the transparency that has been missing in large - scale systems .
WN : You spend a chapter discussing the difference between systems and networks .
How does that apply to your concept of this movement ?
Hawken : I estimate that there are over 1 million organizations in the world addressing the salient issues of our time : poverty , water , climate , oceans , injustice , cities , energy , food security , democracy , women 's rights , etc .
Our living systems are failing and degrading , and human systems are under greater duress and stress .…
( T ) his is the fastest growing movement in the world , and because of communication technologies including texting , cell phones and the internet , it is rapidly connecting up in ways that are both plebian and brilliant , creating a network of activity , transparency and communication that 's unparalleled .
What goes unreported is ( these groups ' ) innovation , design , engineering and social technologies .
This is a movement of ideas . …
It 's an iterative , evolutionary movement .
It 's tens of thousands of ideas with respect to water , buildings , cities , poverty , women , education , climate and carbon neutrality and how all of these relate to people , economics , livelihoods , children and growth .
The sum of these ideas point toward a different world than the one we live in now .
WN : How does the architecture of WiserEarth.org differ from that of Wikipedia ?
Hawken :
Wiser is an open - source platform that is editable like a wiki , but underneath is a taxonomy and underneath that are tags and keywords .
It is an editable relational database , although not as sophisticated as Danny Hillis ' Freebase.com .
We call ourselves Web 1.5 because we believe that the taxonomy , which links all the people , organizations , jobs , events and resources , enhances the search capabilities .
But we also believe that everything should be editable including the structure itself .
WN : Do you have a metaphor or a description of how the internet can serve the movement ?
Hawken : I think this is a movement that does n’t know it is a movement , and that would be fine if the issues being addressed were n't so pressing .
We want to help change that but it is not our purpose to become another hub or pivot point .
WiserEarth is trying to create an information commons if you will , a baseline series of templates for organizations , groups , people , and resources , which can be re-purposed and used by any other organization .
We are designing it so that other organizations can sit on top of our data and pull it up , and hopefully at the same time , refreshing and adding to it .
Robert Metcalfe 101 – the more people that use it the more valuable it becomes .
What we are not trying to do is create another “ green social networking ” site with ads for bamboo shirts .
WN : Any anecdotal evidence that it is having an impact ?
Hawken :
As we speak , Wiser is 12 weeks old .
We are going about this in a deliberate way ....
We are working with users so that the site co-evolves with its base , and they are in over 90 countries .
We do not expect a big impact for at least a year or more .
I sometimes ask an audience how many of them used Wikipedia in its first three years , Jan. 2001 to Jan. 2004 , and few if any raise their hand .
Then I ask how many use it now .
Virtually all raise their hand .
In order to have an impact , Wiser will have to become used by many organizations all over the world .
We see ourselves as a service organization , not a digital nonprofit phenomenon .
We are in active collaboration with over a dozen organizations that are or will write code that will both repurpose and enhance Wiser .
We succeed only if they do .
Seven helicopters were called to the platform
An evacuation was launched from the Thistle Alpha platform , 120 miles north east of Sumburgh , Shetland , after smoke and flames were seen after 0800 GMT .
Seven helicopters and an RAF Nimrod aircraft were alerted and helicopters began carrying those on board to other platforms in the area .
The fire was extinguished by 1045 GMT .
All crew were said to be safe .
Helicopters from the RAF , coastguard and other platforms in the area had earlier been sent to the scene along with two Norwegian helicopters .
A Nimrod was also scrambled from RAF Kinloss to co-ordinate the operation .
A spokesperson for Petrofac , an international service provider to the oil and gas industry , told BBC Scotland a fire was detected in the turbine module at 0807 GMT .
All personnel on board were called to muster and as a precaution , non-essential personnel were taken to the nearby Murchison and Dunlin platforms .
That left 43 essential personnel still on board .
All 159 personnel were said to be " safe and well " after it had been confirmed that the blaze had been extinguished .
A spokeswoman for the Health and Safety Executive ( HSE ) said the platform underwent inspections in May and earlier this month and another one is due in December .
It is not thought that any serious problems were found .
The platform is operated by Swedish - based Lundin Petroleum , which is involved in oil exploration and production across the globe .
The fact they were taken off by helicopter to local platforms suggests it was a precautionary measure
Jake Molloy
OILC union
Rescuer tells of fears
Michael Mulford of RAF Kinloss said he believed the Norwegian helicopters , which were the first to arrive , had been able to land on the platform itself to pick up crew members .
He said it was " quite unusual " for a full evacuation to be ordered so quickly .
Mr Mulford added : " Normally what they will try and do is take off non-essential staff first but they have gone for a fairly major airlift from the first moment . "
He said the Thistle oil field was " just about as remote as it gets - about five or six miles inside the UK search and rescue region " .
Weather conditions in the area had been described as " not great " , with strong north westerly winds and " reasonable " visibility .
The platform is operated by Swedish - based Lundin Petroleum
" Ideally you do n't want people in the water itself .
If they take to the rescue boats that is a different matter but by the sound of it the two Norwegian helicopters have managed to get to the platform itself , " Mr Mulford said .
Jake Molloy , of the OILC union , told the BBC Scotland news website : " I have been trying to contact the guys but it 's difficult .
" The fact they were taken off by helicopter to local platforms suggests it was a precautionary measure .
" The Thistle has a reasonable record over the last few years .
There has been nothing major . "
Graham Tran , of Amicus , said : " They took the decision to evacuate , that gives an indication of concern . "
North Sea oil companies were told last week that more must be done to improve their offshore safety record .
It followed a three - year investigation by the HSE .
Inspectors focused in particular on the safety and integrity of almost 100 offshore installations and their equipment .
Industry body Oil and Gas UK said the report highlighted the need for more work to be done , despite recent investment in maintenance .

The Hoax
CORRECTION
An earlier version of this article quoted from a blog entry purportedly by the Rev. Al Sharpton .
MSNBC.com has determined that the blog is a hoax ...
No .
No .
No , no , stop it .
I swear , " hoax " is rapidly becoming the most intentionally misused word in currency .
The above was taken from an MSNBC article about Michael Vick that included a lengthy quotation taken from Newsgroper.com .
Newsgroper is devoted to " Fake Parody Blogs , Political Humor , [ and ] Celebrity Satire , " a fact stated right in the titlebar .
It makes no attempt to pawn its stories off as real .
Which is , of course , a key component of a hoax : intent .
Merriam - Webster : " hoax , noun .
1 : an act intended to trick or dupe ; 2 : something accepted or established by fraud or fabrication . "
You could argue that the articles on Newsgroper are fabrications .
But how do you justify " SUBSTANCE FOUND AT IKEA PROVES TO BE A HOAX , " the headline on a New Haven city webpage , describing the incident in which a running club sprinkled flour in an IKEA parking lot to guide joggers , only to have local authorities react like it was the season finale of 24 ?
The substance itself was a hoax ?
Someone somewhere had to fabricate the flour , I suppose -- wheat does n't grow on trees , you know -- but where , exactly , is the trick , dupe , or fraud ?
Hoax 's reign as the scapegoat du jour dates back to the Boston " Aqua Teen Hunger Force " debacle in February of this year .
" Two plead not guilty to Boston hoax charges " the CNN headline read , and the Boston authorities used the word " hoax " to describe the incident as often as they could .
The advantages of labeling something like this a hoax are obvious : you did n't massively overreact to a situation that the average person recognized as harmless , you were tricked into doing so !
You did n't just take a quotation from a clearly phony article on a random webpage and build a story around in , you were duped !
You 're not an idiot , you 're just easily gulled !
( This argument reminds me of the Democrats claiming that they voted in favor of the Iraq war because the White House tricked them into doing so ... not that getting outwitted by Bush is any less embarrassing than getting outwitted by flour . )
If you want some example of legitimate hoaxes , you need look no farther than those bandying around the term .
These are the people who intend to trick or dupe , to hide their own culpability behind a malapropism .
Whenever I hear the word " hoax " leave the mouth of someone in power , I like to imagine it wearing a little t- shirt reading " I'm With Stupid . "
Update : The City of New Haven updated their page about an hour ago , changing the headline .

The ingredients of the Belgian cocktail
Finally , here is the promised post on Belgium – delayed not only by personal circumstances , but even more by the time it took me to talk to a dozen of people more knowledge on the Belgian situation .
Writing this post made it very clear that one should never trust one single source when he or she is talking about Belgium – chances are very high that only a partial ( and thereby biased ) analysis is offered .
So I talked to people from both sides of the language border , spent hours on websites from both Flemish and French Belgian newspapers and other media , and tested my draft ideas on Belgians from all persuasions .
Below the fold my list of the main ingredients of the Belgian cocktail ( warning : very long post ! ) .
But I have to start with two disclaimers .
First , there will be virtually no mentioning in what follows of “ the German - speaking community ” : http://www.dgparlament.be/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-991//1633_read-27182/ in Belgium , which comprises about 70.000 inhabitants ; as far as I could see , they are not playing any significant role in the current crisis .
Second , I want to stress that I am not an expert on Belgian politics , federalism , nationalism or any other of these related matters : professionally I have never looked into these issues .
So what follows is written by someone who simply tried to understand what is going on , but who has no personal stake in this ( such as : I have no politically active family members and have no intention to return to Belgium in the foreseeable future so do n’t have to mind my words ) .
And I am more than happy to be corrected for any factual mistakes or significant omissions by those more knowledgeable .
So what are the ingredients of the Belgian cocktail that explain the current crisis and the more structural and long - term political tensions in this country ?
1. Institutional background : Belgium has a complicated institutional structure .
It is a federal state with “ three communities and three regions : ” : http://www.diplomatie.be/en/belgium/belgiumdetail.asp?TEXTID=1586 the Flemish , French and German - speaking communities , and the Flemish , Walloon and Brussels - Capital region .
The federal state is responsible for all affairs that are independent of language , culture and regional territory ( such as foreign affairs , justice , finance , social security and public health ) , the communities are responsible for all issues related to language , culture and education , and the regions for issues related to the territories ( such as the environment and employment policies ) .
Important to note is that the regions and the communities overlap but do not coincide : the French - speaking community lives in the Walloon region and comprises a very large share of the Brussels - Capital region ; the Walloon region entails not only a large share of the French - speaking but also the entire German - speaking community ; and the Flemish community is present in the Flemish region and also ( a little bit ) in the Brussels - Capital region .
There is no German - speaking region : for the regional issues in the areas where the German - speaking Belgians live , the Walloon region has jurisdiction .
And there is no Brussels Community : the people living in Brussels can choose whether they want to rely on Flemish and / or French community institutions , such as schools and cultural centres .
2. Demography :
There are “ 10.5 million inhabitants ” : http://statbel.fgov.be/figures/d21_fr.asp#2 in Belgium .
About 1 million in the Brussels - Capital region , 3.4 million inhabitants in the Walloon region , and well above 6 million inhabitants in the Flemish region .
So the Flemish are the majority group in Belgium ; however , they are only a very small fraction of the inhabitants of the Brussels - Capital region .
I have n’t been able to find official statistics , and have been told by several political scientists that the census no longer asks whether a person considers herself to belong to the Flemish - or Frenchspeaking community , but that the best indicator is the percentage of the votes given to the Flemish parties in the Brussels - Capital region : this would be about 10 % .
In short , the Brussels region belongs to both the French and Flemish communities , but the absolute majority is Francophone – although one should also not forget that a significant share of the inhabitants in Brussels is not Dutch - or Frenchspeaking at all ( they may or may not hold a Belgian passport , but their primary national identities would be non-Belgian ) .
Yet , to complicate matters further , the share of the Flemings among the people who work in Brussels is much higher : many Flemings commute daily to Brussels to work , but do n’t live there .
3 . A federal state without federal political parties :
In Belgium , the parties that take part in the federal elections are the same parties that take part in the regional elections .
There are no Belgian - wide parties : there are only Flemish , French and German parties .
As a consequence , the political agenda of the federal elections is very prone to be influenced by regional interests and agenda’s .
At the last federal elections , several of the main Flemish parties were running on a strong Flemish - interests agenda , and made promises that if elected they would defend some specific Flemish interests that are not in the interests of the French community ( such as splitting the voting district Brussels - Halle - Vilvoorde , see below ) .
As a consequence , the parties that are now negotiating about the formation of the federal government are having regional interests in the backs of their heads .
In addition , this also leads to some remarkable dynamics in the case of the man who got the most votes , Yves Leterme , on which more below .
4 . The Flemish border communes around Brussels : Geographically speaking , Brussels is an enclave in Flanders .
However , in the Flemish border communes around Brussels , the share of inhabitants who do not speak any Dutch is very high .
These are not just francophone Belgians , but also foreigners who are working for the many international organisations and companies based in Brussels – and these people generally speak English and French , but no Dutch at all .
The are often well - paid employees , and prefer to live in the green areas around Brussels , rather than in Brussels itself ; as a consequence , the descendents of the original Dutch - speaking inhabitants of the Flemish border communes claim that they are no longer able to afford living there .
But it should be added that at the personal level this is as much a problem for descendents of the original French - speaking Brussels inhabitants : Eurocrats earn about double the wages of ordinary Belgians in similar functions , and thus they are crowding out the ‘ natives ’ .
Since Eurocrats are much more likely to speak French than Dutch , the area becomes more French - dominated .
Another problem is that in 1962 , when the language border was fixed , certain ‘ facilities ’ ( special rights ) were granted to the French - speaking inhabitants , which formed a minority at that time .
But what has happened , is that these special rights were not , as some argue they should have been , rights that would slowely fade out ; instead , they have basically turned Flemish territory into an area where French inhabitants have special language rights , which took away the incentives for them to learn the official language of that territory – Dutch .
So there is resentment from the Flemings regarding the Flemish border communes around Brussels on several grounds – one being the fact that people live in their territory but do n’t bother to speak Dutch ; the other is that the purchasing power of some of those people is making it impossible for ordinary Flemings to continue living there .
But there is also irritation from the Francophone Belgians .
They argue that the local administrations in those communes are making the lives of those who do n’t speak Dutch unnecessarily difficult , and are enforcing the “ language laws ” very strictly .
These Flemish border communes have been and continue to be the stage of lots of political contestation – as the next point will show …
5. Brussels - Halle - Vilvoorde / Bruxelles - Hal - Vilvorde : Flemish politicians do not like the fact that the increasing number of francophones in the border communes around Brussels are changing the demographic - linguistic profile .
But there is more going on .
According to the 2002 laws concerning the Belgian electoral system , the 19 communes that constitute Brussels and the Flemish communes of Halle and Vilvoorde ( recall , in which live many Francophones ) , together form one election district , called Brussel - Halle - Vilvoorde ( in Dutch ) or Bruxelles - Hal - Vilvorde ( in French ) .
BHV , as it is often abbreviated , has become a pivotal battle ground in the current political crisis .
In 2003 , a Belgian constitutional court “ decided ” : http://www.arbitrage.be/public/n/2003/2003-073n.pdf that the current voting legislation in BHV is unconstitutional , since the inhabitants of the Flemish communes Halle and Vilvoorde can also vote for French parties , which is not possible in other Flemish communes and hence citizens are treated unequally .
So the Flemish parliament has urged the immediate split of BHV , with Halle and Vilvoorde becoming part of the Flemish electoral districts .
This would reinforce ( or perhaps better , restore ) the Flemish character of these communes .
But for the Walloon and Francophone Bruxellois ( inhabitants from Brussels ) this would be an unfavorable development , since it would strenghten the enclaved character of Brussels , and deny what they regard as the rights of the francophones in those communes .
Of course , it is clear that something has to happen , since the unconstitutional nature of the current laws makes it impossible to organise the next elections ( in 2009 ) .
Some francophone politicians are unwiling to negotiate about the split of BHV , others are only willing to negotiate about splitting BHV if the Flemish are willing to talk about compensation , for example they could give up some officially flemish communes around Brussels that are dominated by the francophones , which would be added to the Brussels - Capital region .
Interestingly , the Flemish politicians present this case as if there can be no negotiations , since this is a legal verdict that has to be implemented .
But that is simply not true .
There are a range of different ways to solve the unconstitutional nature of the current situation in BHV , and the Flemish parties present it as if the split of BHV is the only possible solution , and does n’t require any negotiations about compensations ( I ’ll spare you the dizzying details of the other legal solutions that are possible – perhaps someone with a better stomach for electoral laws will be happy to explain more in the comments sections ) .
I ’ve been surprised to see that the Flemish journalists tend to copy this view as if the split of BHV is an unavoidable consequence , that simply follows from a legal verdict ; that seems to be just another instance of the uncritical attitude of the media in Belgium towards anything said by the politicans from their communes ( this , unfortunately , is as much true for the French press , in my experience ) .
The upshot of the incredible complicated case is at least twofold : first , the two communities are basically fighting for territory , and second , it illustrated the key role of Brussels in the Belgian drama .
6. Non-coinciding regional and national elections :
In Belgium five different kinds of elections are held : at the local level , the provincial level , the regional and community level , the federal level , and elections for the European Parliament .
But these do not coincide .
Federal elections are held every 4 years , but elections for the regions and communities every 5 years , together with the European elections .
Local elections are every 6 years .
A possible consequence is that the coalitions formed at one level are different from those at another level : the problem of asymmetric governments .
7. Asymmetric governments : Governments in Belgium , both the federal and the regional ones , are always made up from coalitions .
But these coalitions are not the same in all governments .
In part this is due to the non-coinciding elections , in part this is also due to the fact that the parties do not have the same size at both sides of the language border .
For example , the Flemish Christian democrats are the biggest party in Flanders , but are a rather small party within Francophone Belgium .
Flanders also has a considerable extreme - right seperatist party , Vlaams Belang ( which , ironically , is receiving some votes from Francophones in Brussels thanks to their security and anti-muslim agenda ) , whereas there is no such political factor in Wallonia .
So these asymmetries create difficult situations .
For examples , at the last regional elections the Christian Democratic Parties became part of the regional governments in Flanders and Wallonia , but they were part of the opposition in the Federal Government ( which was made up from the ( Flemish and French ) Social Democratic Parties , and the ( Flemish and French ) Liberal Parties ) .
This can lead to strange party - dynamics , which in the present crisis of the negotiations the federal level are also an explanatory factor why there is still no Belgian government .
For example , the French Christian Democratic Party ( CDH ) is currently part of the government of the Walloon region , together with the French Social - Democratic Party ( PS ) .
But at the last federal elections , the PS ( and its Flemish sisterparty SP ) lost many seats , such that the current negotiations at the federal level are between the Christian Democratic parties and the liberal parties .
This leads to the difficult situations for parties that are in different positions at the different levels .
CDH is part of the center - left coalition at the Walloon regional level , but is negotiating to become part of a center - right government at the federal level .
Since the voters are likely not to make a distinction between whether the acts of parties are made in their capacities as rulers at the federal versus the regional levels , it may be very difficult for any particular party to be in a center - right coalition at one level , and a center - left at another level .
8. Elections 2007 – two cartels :
To make matters even more complicated , the Flemish Christian Democratic party CD&V formed a cartel with NVA , a small nationalist Flemish party ( which , however , should not be confused with Vlaams Blok , the large extreme - right Flemish nationalist party which is not only nationalist but also racist , islamophobic and extremely conservative ) .
At the French side , the French liberal party MR formed a cartel with the small Brussels French Party FDF , which is a radical party defending the interests of the French speaking community in Brussels .
Perhaps this was a voting - maximising strategy for CD&V and MR , but when last month they were trying to negotiate at the federal level , these two smaller radical French and Flemish parties were making the negotiations much more polarised and difficult .
Two small radical parties that are vigorously defending the interests of only one language community are now around the federal negotiation table , and cannot be simply put aside since they established cartels with large Center - parties .
9 . Yves Leterme and the rest of the leadership : Another factor adding to the current crisis are the personal character and behaviour of some key politicians .
The leader of the biggest party , the Flemish Christian Democratic party CD&V , Mr. Yves Leterme , was until recently the prime minister at the Flemish level .
He ran in the last federal elections , and received 800.000 votes behind its name , which is ( even historically ) a lot for a small country like Belgium ( however , he was the head of the list , which means that many people who simply want to vote on the party in general will also have voted for him ) .
But he ran on an explicit Flemish - agenda campagain .
Both his past and a range of statements he has made in the press make it clear that his heart lies in Flanders and not at the federal level ; and even though the Francophone press are doing their best of only highlighting his pro-flemish attitudes , one can reasonably wonder whether someone who is so focussed on the regional level and displays very little sympathy for the perspective of the other community should aspire to be the prime minister of the entire country .
But the problem lies not just with this one man : the present generation political leaders in Belgium are virtually all leaders who developed their careers at the regional level .
Moreover , in the past the politicians of both communities met and talked to eachother frequently ; there was a national political elite , who were trained in making compromises and putting the interests of Belgium first .
Among the new generation politicians , these people are very rare – which also explains why at the federal level the current negotiations are being so difficult at present .
10 . Divided socio-economic worlds : Belgium is an affluent society .
But this aggregate image hides what Flemish politicians have increasingly stressed in the last years : Flanders is doing much better socio-economically than Wallonia .
The previous prime - minister of the Flemish region , Yves Leterme , published a document ( called “ Belgium is doing better thanks to Flanders ” : http://start.vlaanderen.be/actualiteit_belgie_doet_het_goed_dankzij_vlaanderen.php) in which a number of key social and economic indicators were disaggregated by region .
Here are some of these figures ( all amounts are in Euros ) from this report ( page reference of the report between brackets ) :
GDP per head ( purchasing power parity ) in 2005 : Belgium : 27.700 – Brussels 54.905 – Flanders 27.300 – Wallonia 19.800 .
Now this is interesting , since it gives the impression that the really rich people live in Brussels .
But this is a deceiving conclusion : Brussels has many relatively poor people , but it also has many companies whose employees live in the Walloon region and , especially , in Flanders .
And even this needs to be nuanced , since most large Belgian companies who have , say , 2000 offices or shops spread over the country , have their headoffice in Brussels , which is where the sales and profits are officially put into the books .
So these regional GDP figures do need to be interpreted with care .
However , the fact that the inhabitants of Brussels and the Walloon region are on average worse off , can be seen if one looks at other social indicators , such as unemployment and poverty rates :
Unemployment rate early 2007 : Belgium : 11.8 % – Brussels 20,4 % – Flanders 6.9 % – Wallonia 11.8 % ( p. 7 ) .
Long - term unemployment rate in 2005 : Belgium 4.4 % – Brussels 9.2 % – Flanders 2.2 % – Wallonia 6.9 % ( p. 26 ) .
Poverty risk after financial transfers ( 2004 ) : Belgium : 14.9 % – Brussels 27 % – Flanders 11.3 % – Wallonia 17.7 % . ( p. 26 ) .
There are also inequalities in educational performance listed in this document :
Quality of secondary education : according to the results from the PISA study , Belgium has relatively good rankings for mathematics , reading , problem solving and science ( 8 , 12 , 11 and 14th position ) – but these results are much better in Flanders ( 1 , 3 , 4 and 5th position ) than in Wallonia ( 24 , 31 , 24 and 33th position ) .
Percentage of the population between 20 and 24 years old who have finished secondary education ( 2005 ) : Belgium : 81.8 % – Brussels 72.5 % – Flanders 85.1 % – Wallonia 79 % .
What should one make of those figures ?
It ’s unlikely that they are plainly false – the only one where I know there is lots of debate about the actual size will be discussed in the next point ; but what is not unlikely is that the Flemish government has only presented those figures that are positive for her own image .
I have n’t been able to find a similar report on “ the website of the Walloon region ” : http://www.wallonie.be/en/index.html, but invite anyone who has found interesting ( and preferably non-contested ) statistics to add them in the comments section .
In any case , what those figures ( and others that are in scholarly books that are not on - line ) do indicate is that in terms of where people live , Flanders is richer than the Brussels - Capital or Walloon region , but that in terms of productive units , Brussels is the chicken with the golden eggs .
Inhabitants of both Flanders and the Walloon region both profit from the employment ( and thus income generating ) opportunities in Brussels – which , as some argue , is one reason why neither Flanders nor the Walloon region wants to split the country if that means they have to give up Brussels .
11 . Financial transfers and solidarity : Given the inequality in economic welfare , it is not surprising that there are significant financial transfers from Flanders to Wallonia and Brussels .
One way to look at this issue is to look at the total personal taxation revenue collected in the different parts of Belgium : 2.8 Billion is collected from households in Brussels , 9.2 Billion from Wallonia , and 21.3 billion from Flanders ( p. 34 ) .
To the best of my knowledge , this concerns tax incomes for the federal level .
Not surprisingly , the Flemish parties have put on their electoral agenda a partial split of the fiscal system .
In the popular political discourse , the reference is often made to the “ North - South transfers ” within Belgium .
The figure on hears most often in the media is that the financial transfer through the fiscal and social security systems from the Flemish to the Francophone would amount to 12 billion euro annually ; but this figure has been calculated by a separatist group of Flemish entrepreneurs , and its methodology is strongly contested .
Yet this figure is repeated frequently in the Flemish media and thus is shaping the public discourse and political attitudes of the citizens .
I think it is much safer to look at official figures .
According to the above mentioned report by the Flemish government ( p. 10 ) , the transfers from Flanders would be 5.4 billion Euro to Wallonia , and 1.2 billion Euro to Brussels , totalling 6.6 billion Euro in 2003 .
The big question is whether these transfers should be considered large or not .
Most Flemish political parties think that they are too large , and that something needs to be done about them .
For American ( and other ) readers who may perhaps wonder what the fuss is about : these amounts may be peanuts on the budget of a large country such as the USA , yet recall that Flanders has just above 6 million inhabitants , so the “ solidarity from North to South ” ( as it is often called in the press ) amounts to more than 1000 Euro per person annually .
The Flemish nationalist parties , both the democratic ones and the extreme - right one , continue to remind the Flemish electorate of this constantly .
On the other hand , it is far from clear that these are excessive transfers when compared with other inter-regional transfers within Europe .
In addition , there have been occasional references to transfers in the other direction in the past .
But when searching for hard facts , I have n’t been able to find any reference , nor have the people I ’ve asked been able to direct me to a reliable source .
So it remains unclear whether this is a true fact , or rather a myth .
What is certainly the case is that the Walloon region was much more economically prosperous than Flanders around 1850 , and that Flemings were working in the prosperous industrial economy of the Walloon region .
But there was no social security system in place that created direct income transfers between individuals and households .
A final remark on the topic of financial transfers and solidarity : the Flemish political parties who are constantly reminding the electorate of these fiscale transfers never mention that Brussels is indirectly a significant source of welfare generation for both Flanders and the Walloon region , in terms of the employment it provides to flemish and walloon people .
A partial discourse on fiscal transfers may perhaps look different , even politically , if it is complemented with other dimensions of the strong inter-regional interdependence in Belgium .
Of course , job creation is something else than direct financial transfers , but the impression that some Flemish separatists try to create , that Flanders can do everything by itself , is dubious .
If the country would split up and Brussels would no longer be partially part of Flanders , then either those companies and jobs would have to move from Brussels to Flanders , or else the economic welfare of a significant number of Flemings would depend on jobs “ abroad ” .
12 . The politics of language : Language is a strong point of resentment and injury for the Flemish .
In the history of the country , the elite was French - speaking : until 40 years ago , the Flemish students were taught by professors who spoke French .
It was almost impossible to get a job in the federal public service or in politics if one was not able and willing to work in French .
The message that Flemish pupils and students received until not so long ago , was that it was absolutely necessary for one ’s future to be fluent in French .
This situation has not been symmetrical : the French - speaking Belgians often knew very little or no Dutch .
Philippe Van Parijs ( “ p. 38 ” : http://www.law.nyu.edu/clppt/program2003/readings/vanparijs.pdf) cites 1999 data on the linguistic competence of Belgians in the second major Belgian language : francophone Belgians are much less likely to state that they master Dutch compared with Flemish reporting they know French , and among younger generations this divide is only bigger , rather than smaller .
There are signs , though , that the Flemish are investing less in learning French , and are much easier satisfied with their intermediate level of knowledge then in the past .
And figures such as those just mentioned are always a little suspect , since self - reported data can be biased in many ways .
Nevertheless , I think there is little disagreement that many more Flemish master French compared with the knowledge of Dutch among the francophone Belgians .
At the symbolic level , it does n’t help that the royal family , probably the symbol of Belgium , is entirely Francophone , and that many of the key Royals speak rather poor Dutch .
The Flemish are irritated for at least two reasons .
Firstly , they feel as if their language , and thus their culture , is treated with disrespect ( for readers who have no empathy at all for the notion that language can be political and can be an issue of justice , go and read “ Philippe Van Parijs ” : http://www.law.nyu.edu/clppt/program2003/readings/vanparijs.pdf.)
Secondly , the Flemings argue that the Francophone Belgians would improve their employment chances and economic prospects if they would invest more in learning Dutch .
But , as one commentator on the website of “ Le Soir ” : http://www.lesoir.be/ wrote , “ there is nothing in the constitution that obliges us to learn Dutch . ”
13 . Divided worlds : According to some Belgians from both sides of the language borders , including for example “ Wilfried Dewachter ” : http://www.kuleuven.be/emeritiforum/thema/2006-2007/MEERVLAANDEREN211206/identiteit-Vlaanderen-Wallonie%20(prof.%20W.%20Dewachter).doc, a Flemish professor emeritus in political science , the Flemish and French communities in Belgium form different societies .
They hardly know eachother , do n’t watch eachother ’s television or read eachother ’s newspapers , do n’t know about the political and societal agenda’s of the other community .
They have different celebrities , and their prime orientation is towards different parts of the world ( Flanders towards Northern Europe and the anglophone world , French Belgium much more towards France ) .
They do n’t know what plays in eachother ’s cities , and apart from holidays at the Flemish coast or the beautiful Walloon countryside , they do not visit eachother ’s cities .
Some Flemings take political affairs , such as the string of corruption scandales among the Parti Socialiste , as yet another sign that they are simply a different people from the Walloon , not just in terms of language but also in terms of political culture .
In Flanders , there is a widespread perception that the public mismanagement in the Walloon region is also part of a cultural difference , and that this mismanagement is part of what causes the need for the financial transfers – which further explains why these transfers are considered a political issue .
Perhaps the different worlds in which the Flemish and the Francophone live is the greatest threat for the unity of Belgium .
And it also puts the interregional transfers in another daylight , since one could argue that the key strategy for maintaining financial solidarity in culturally diverse countries is ordinary interaction between ordinary citizens of the different cultural / linguistic groups ( as argued in a slightly different context by Phillippe Van Parijs , “ p. 385 ” : http://www.etes.ucl.ac.be/Francqui/Livre/26.VanParijs.pdf).
Apart from those who live or work in Brussels , there is very little such interaction left .
14 . Divided media :
These worlds apart became already painfully visible in December last year in the weeks following “ the media - stunt ” : https://crookedtimber.org/2006/12/16/ceci-nest-pas-la-belgique/ by the RTBF , the French public television , in which they simulated the end of Belgium .
Suddenly the Flemish and French Belgians realised that they really do n’t know eachother very well .
There was an initiative from two newspapers , “ Le Soir ” : http://www.lesoir.be/ and “ De Standaard ” : http://www.standaard.be/ to send journalists to eachother ’s offices and to report about the daily lives at the other side of the language border ; but apart from that initiative , there have been few signals that Belgians from both language communities have made sustained attempts to better understand eachother ’s positions .
A very worrying development in recent weeks has been the reporting on the crisis in the media : the French and Flemish media given often entirely conflicting interpretations of the same events .
When the first coalition negotations were aborted at the end of August , the French media blamed Yves Leterme and the arrogance of the Flemings , whereas the Flemish media blamed the stubborness and unreasonableness of the French , especially of CDH .
Anyone who understands both Dutch and French should spend a few hours reading the readers ’ comments on the websites of Le Soir and De Standaard : there is from both sides almost no understanding , let alone any sympathy , for the position of the other community .
To me , this was perhaps the biggest surprise ( and shock ) when reading in preparation for this post : listening to Francophone and Flemish politicians , or to the French and Flemish media in general , or to the comments by their readers , feels like listening to two spouses who are going to divorce , and blame the other party for everything that went wrong .
A politician who is making reasonable demands or a plausible analysis in the eyes of the media of one language group , is being an extremist or unreasonable person through the eyes of the others .
This fact of divided media has international implications , since there is every reason to think ( as Van Parijs also argues ) that the international arena gets its information on Belgium through the Francophone media , not through the Flemish media .
The logical consequence would be that the reporting on Belgium in the international media is very prone to be as biased as the francophone press – very biased , that is ( it would n’t be any better if they would only read the Flemish press , though ) .
15 . A one - sided divorce ?
Yet the metaphore of the divorce needs to be adapted , since the francophone Belgians are much less supportive of the idea of regional independence or a further shift of responsibilities and rights to the regional levels .
When I asked Belgian friends , one who is francophone and the other who is bilingual with a francophone spouse , both said that from the perspective of the French community Flanders is acting as if it is initiating a divorce that the francophones do n’t want .
Francophone Belgians are much more likely to say that their primary identity is Belgian rather than Walloon or Bruxellois , compared with the Flemish .
They do n’t understand at all why a proportion of the Flemish have the feeling that they are in a forced marriage from which they would like to escape .
They are much more satisfied with the way things are , and do n’t want to be confronted with a new wave of federal state reform every five or ten years that further deconstructs the body of Belgium , and gives powers and prerogatives to the regions and communities .
Many also feel cheated by the Flemings , since every time there has been an agreement on state reform , they think this will now be the last wave – but before too long the Flemings are putting new demands on the table .
Moreover , in the French press there is a strong sentiment that in the past these state reform agreements have been forced upon the frenchspeaking population – in part because their financial needs made them more vulnerable to accept political deals of a state reform that the Flemish wanted in return for financial support for the Francophone Belgians ( such as investments in the Walloon economy or social infrastructure ) .
Finally , quite some francophone Belgians no longer trust the Flemish when they say that they now want to negotiate about a state reform which would be needed to make the economy more competitive and safeguard our level of welfare ; they are worried that there is a hidden agenda of seperatism which is broadly shared among the Flemish politicians , and that their current demands in the formation of the new federal government ( that is , if we will get one ! ) are yet another step on the way to the end of Belgium .
16 . Scenarios for the future :
We are 101 days after the elections , and there is no federal government in sight at all .
The political trust is at what seems an all - time low , and statements in the media do not show any movement towards compromises , from either side .
A poll conducted yesterday by a Flemish newspaper shows that “ almost half of all Flemings ” : http://www.hln.be/hlns/cache/det/art_587028.html?wt.bron=homeBakskes2 want to split up the country , and two thirds believe that it is going to happen sooner or later .
Is this the most likely scenario for the future ?
As far as I can judge , basically anything can happen ( apart from a violent independence , which is extremely unlikely to be the case ) .
At this moment , there is still no federal government in sight , and it remains unclear if and when this crisis will be resolved .
Yet what the current political crisis did put under the spotlights are some structural factors that have remained hidden for too long – such as the growing apart of the two communities , the ( unintended ? ) consequences of the creation of the regions and communities in the 1990s , the slow dissappearance of a truly Belgian ( rather than French or Flemish ) political elite , and the incredible differences in media - coverage .
If we want Belgium to continue to exist in the long run , it is clear that we do need some solutions for these problems too , and not just a new federal government .
Before I go , a closing comment .
Many Belgians have strong feelings about what is going on , but have often biased and partial information , and make little effort to understand the point of view and the feelings of ‘ the other side ’ .
I have tried to avoid this , by spending lot of time to get the most reliable version of all facts , and asking francophone Belgians to explain me their sensitivities , priorities , and points of view ( these are the main reason why it too me so long to write this post ) .
Yet I do not doubt that this post will nevertheless remain subjective , since so many of the sensitivities described above are difficult to understand if one is not part of this particular group .
There are insights that are hard to understand if one has never lived through them .
Moreover , I have no illusions : in this game one will always be suspect for some party .
I invite all those who think that my views as expressed in this post are biased to correct this bias in the comments section – but please :
No shouting , no insults , and no extremist propaganda that is not based on arguments .
Any such comments will be removed without mercy .
Top Bush forestry official faces contempt , possible jail
As if it was n't bad enough for the Bush Administration already , contempt charges are flying in Montana .
The Administration 's top forestry official has been ordered to explain why the US Forest Service failed to analyze the environmental impact of dropping a fish - killing flame retardant on wildfires -- or face contempt of court .
Agriculture Undersecretary Mark Rey would then face jail unless the Forest Service assented to a court order enjoining the environmental review .
" Noting that Rey had blocked implementation of an earlier review , U.S. District Judge Donald W. Malloy ordered Rey to appear in his court Oct. 15 unless the Forest Service completes the analysis before that time , " Associated Press reporter Jeff Barnard wrote .
Forest Service spokesman Joe Walsh told AP the agency was working on the analysis , but could n't say if the Secretary would meet the deadline ; Rey did not respond to requests for comment .
An environmental group , " Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics , " filed the lawsuit in 2003 , after Forestry Service chemicals killed more than 20,000 fish in central Oregon .
Adds Barnard , " In 2005 , Malloy ruled that the Forest Service violated the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy
Act when it failed to go through a public process to analyze the potential environmental harm of using ammonium phosphate , a fertilizer that kills fish , as the primary ingredient in fire retardant dropped on wildfires . "
" It seems as if the government is playing a not too funny game , betting that the court will be forced to grant the additional time and hoping the irony of the timing will be overlooked , " the judge wrote , according to Barnard .

This is the jellyfish Eleutheria dichotoma , genetically modified with two heads ( center ) .
Jellyfish with up to a dozen heads have been created in the laboratory by carefully monkeying with a few genes .
The genetic experiments could shed light on how natural colonies of other multi-headed organisms first originated , including some that build coral reefs .
Researchers targeted so - called Cnox genes , which help control how the bodies of jellyfish are laid out as their embryos develop .
These genes are closely related to Hox genes , which play a similar role in humans .
How they did it
They experimented on the European hydromedusa ( Eleutheria dichotoma ) , collected from the south of France .
( In Greek mythology , the Hydra was a monster with innumerable heads , while Medusa had writhing snakes for hair . )
The researchers designed RNA molecules that specifically only " silenced " Cnox genes in these saltwater critters .
Normally , the saltiness of these animals would prevent the molecules from entering their cells , but the scientists diluted seawater with freshwater enough " where the jellyfish still survived and the RNA got in , " said evolutionary biologist and invertebrate zoologist Bernd Schierwater at the Hanover University of Veterinary Medicine in Germany .
By inhibiting one Cnox gene called Cnox - 3 , two heads often formed , where both were completely functional — regarding food intake , for instance .
By deactivating another , Cnox - 2 , more than two heads usually sprouted — " up to a dozen , " Schierwater told LiveScience .
He and colleague Wolfgang Jakob , also at Hanover , detailed their findings in the Aug. 1 issue of the online journal PLoS ONE .
Twelve heads better than one ?
Animals with many heads are rare in nature , suggesting that two or more heads usually are n't better than one — having more than one head results in costs with no immediate matching benefits .
However , Schierwater noted that corals , which are animals , often form colonies by adding heads to a common stalk , each of which connect to a common gut , just as with the modified jellyfish that the researchers created .
Jellyfish are related to the creatures that build coral reefs — they are both carnivores belonging to a group called cnidarians , which means " stinging nettles , " because of their stingers .
Schierwater conjectured the solitary ancestors of corals and other colonial organisms might have adapted genes related to multiple heads long ago " in such a way that animal colonies were able to emerge . "
Indeed , these findings suggest the suppression of just a few genes could have led to incredible diversity in body plans " from the very beginning , " Schierwater said , shedding light on " the evolution and development of animal life in general . "
HONG KONG ( MarketWatch ) --
Every revolution comes at a price , and as a retail revolution sweeps across India , it is becoming increasingly clear that organized retailers are up against some pretty steep odds .
Reports from last week of a fresh attack on Reliance Fresh ( a retail chain promoted by conglomerate Reliance Industries ) , this time in the central state of Madhya Pradesh , show that of all the challenges modern retailers face in India , the backlash from the so - called unorganized retailers is potentially their biggest yet .
The latest attack on a Reliance Fresh outlet follows similar acts of vandalism against the chain in northern Uttar Pradesh , along with opposition in the eastern states of West Bengal and Orissa .
In each case , politicians either directly supported the agitation or voiced opposition to the spread of organized chains , citing the impact on the mom-and - pop shops in the area .
“ The loss of a livelihood is never an easy issue to deal with , but it will be retrogressive to prevent the evolution of a modern retail network with vandalism and violence . ”
The violence against Reliance 's chain may look like freak incidents sponsored by politicians with their own personal agendas and hungry for headlines .
But the fears surrounding millions of retailers and their employees , of losing jobs or being put out of business , are real .
The country 's retail industry was valued at $ 300 billion in 2006 , according to IndiaRetailBiz.com , and employed 21 million people -- mostly in retail outlets that occupied less than 500 square feet .
As larger , modern retail storefronts open up -- sometimes anchoring the malls that seem to be springing up everywhere -- and sell wares cheaper , offer a wider selection and deliver a better shopping experience , the relatively inefficient and unorganized sector will struggle against the organized chains .
It is likely that there are more occasions for friction in future , not less , and while several jobs will be created , many others will inevitably be lost .
While political will is going to be tested at one level , industry associations probably will have to take a lead in starting a wider debate on the whole issue of modern retailing .
The loss of a livelihood is never an easy issue to deal with , but it will be retrogressive to prevent the evolution of a modern retail network with vandalism and violence .
The timing of the backlash against modern retail could n't have been worse for the organized industry .
Foreign investment into the sector is still restricted , but there is no shortage of local players eyeing a slice of the potential market .
Rentals are reportedly going through the roof as existing chains expand or new ones enter the fray , escalating costs .
Ditto with staff expenses , with the industry working to meet the increasing demand for managerial talent .
Revenue growth for the listed retailers such as Pantaloon Retail and Shoppers '
Stop has been furious over the past several quarters , and analysts expect the growth to continue at a fast pace .
But the industry already works with wafer - thin profit margins -- less than 5 % in fact , while their stocks enjoy premium valuations of more than 50 times forward price - to - earnings estimates .
The last thing either the companies or their investors need is to be targeted for crime .
Daily Show : US forgets past atrocities in exchange for help in the war on terror David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday October 12 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This The Daily Show on Thursday took up President Bush 's promise to veto a non-binding Congressional resolution condemning the Armenian Genocide .
" This resolution is not the right response to these historic mass killings , " Bush stated .
" What is the right response to historic mass killings ? " asked Stewart .
" Historic mass flowers ? "
" To be fair , " Stewart went on , " Bush is but the latest in a long line of presidents to placate Turkey by downplaying the whole Death of 1.5 Million Armenians thing .
But this is a particularly delicate time . "
He then played a clip of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice saying , " The passage of this resolution at this time would indeed be very problematic for everything that we are trying to do in the Middle East . "
" Question , " said Stewart , raising his hand like a reporter at a news conference .
" Uh , what are we trying to do in the Middle East ? "
Stewart then turned to " senior Armeniologist " Aasif Mandvi , who told him , " I think the message here is clear .
You help us with the war on terror .
We 'll see what we can do about your past . "
" It 's not a bad deal , actually , " Mandvi continued .
" When Spain joined the coalition , they were able to get their Inquisition downgraded to a casual Q&A . "
Mandvi told Stewart that Turkey really might withdraw its support for the Iraq War over the resolution .
" If Congress had known the bill they had drafted would have real - world consequences , they 'd never have let it get this far , " he stated .
" The last thing this Congress wants is to do anything that might impact policy -- or people -- or things . "
Stewart and Mandvi further noted that Congress has formally apologized to Japanese - Americans for the World War II internment camps and to Hawaii for overthrowing its queen .
But slavery and Indian genocide , not so much .

September 2007
A few weeks ago I had a thought so heretical that it really surprised me .
It may not matter all that much where you go to college .
For me , as for a lot of middle class kids , getting into a good college was more or less the meaning of life when I was growing up .
What was I ? A student .
To do that well meant to get good grades .
Why did one have to get good grades ?
To get into a good college .
And why did one want to do that ?
There seemed to be several reasons : you 'd learn more , get better jobs , make more money .
But it did n't matter exactly what the benefits would be .
College was a bottleneck through which all your future prospects passed ; everything would be better if you went to a better college .
A few weeks ago I realized that somewhere along the line I had stopped believing that .
What first set me thinking about this was the new trend of worrying obsessively about what kindergarten your kids go to .
It seemed to me this could n't possibly matter .
Either it wo n't help your kid get into Harvard , or if it does , getting into Harvard wo n't mean much anymore .
And then I thought : how much does it mean even now ?
It turns out I have a lot of data about that .
My three partners and I run a seed stage investment firm called Y Combinator .
We invest when the company is just a couple guys and an idea .
The idea does n't matter much ; it will change anyway .
Most of our decision is based on the founders .
The average founder is three years out of college .
Many have just graduated ; a few are still in school .
So we 're in much the same position as a graduate program , or a company hiring people right out of college .
Except our choices are immediately and visibly tested .
There are two possible outcomes for a startup : success or failure — and usually you know within a year which it will be .
The test applied to a startup is among the purest of real world tests .
A startup succeeds or fails depending almost entirely on the efforts of the founders .
Success is decided by the market : you only succeed if users like what you 've built .
And users do n't care where you went to college .
As well as having precisely measurable results , we have a lot of them .
Instead of doing a small number of large deals like a traditional venture capital fund , we do a large number of small ones .
We currently fund about 40 companies a year , selected from about 900 applications representing a total of about 2000 people . [ 1 ]
Between the volume of people we judge and the rapid , unequivocal test that 's applied to our choices , Y Combinator has been an unprecedented opportunity for learning how to pick winners .
One of the most surprising things we 've learned is how little it matters where people went to college .
I thought I 'd already been cured of caring about that .
There 's nothing like going to grad school at Harvard to cure you of any illusions you might have about the average Harvard undergrad .
And yet Y Combinator showed us we were still overestimating people who'd been to elite colleges .
We 'd interview people from MIT or Harvard or Stanford and sometimes find ourselves thinking : they must be smarter than they seem .
It took us a few iterations to learn to trust our senses .
Practically everyone thinks that someone who went to MIT or Harvard or Stanford must be smart .
Even people who hate you for it believe it .
But when you think about what it means to have gone to an elite college , how could this be true ?
We 're talking about a decision made by admissions officers — basically , HR people — based on a cursory examination of a huge pile of depressingly similar applications submitted by seventeen year olds .
And what do they have to go on ?
An easily gamed standardized test ; a short essay telling you what the kid thinks you want to hear ; an interview with a random alum ; a high school record that 's largely an index of obedience .
Who would rely on such a test ?
And yet a lot of companies do .
A lot of companies are very much influenced by where applicants went to college .
How could they be ?
I think I know the answer to that .
There used to be a saying in the corporate world : " No one ever got fired for buying IBM . "
You no longer hear this about IBM specifically , but the idea is very much alive ; there is a whole category of " enterprise " software companies that exist to take advantage of it .
People buying technology for large organizations do n't care if they pay a fortune for mediocre software .
It 's not their money .
They just want to buy from a supplier who seems safe — a company with an established name , confident salesmen , impressive offices , and software that conforms to all the current fashions .
Not necessarily a company that will deliver so much as one that , if they do let you down , will still seem to have been a prudent choice .
So companies have evolved to fill that niche .
A recruiter at a big company is in much the same position as someone buying technology for one .
If someone went to Stanford and is not obviously insane , they 're probably a safe bet .
And a safe bet is enough .
No one ever measures recruiters by the later performance of people they turn down . [ 2 ]
I 'm not saying , of course , that elite colleges have evolved to prey upon the weaknesses of large organizations the way enterprise software companies have .
But they work as if they had .
In addition to the power of the brand name , graduates of elite colleges have two critical qualities that plug right into the way large organizations work .
They 're good at doing what they 're asked , since that 's what it takes to please the adults who judge you at seventeen .
And having been to an elite college makes them more confident .
Back in the days when people might spend their whole career at one big company , these qualities must have been very valuable .
Graduates of elite colleges would have been capable , yet amenable to authority .
And since individual performance is so hard to measure in large organizations , their own confidence would have been the starting point for their reputation .
Things are very different in the new world of startups .
We could n't save someone from the market 's judgement even if we wanted to .
And being charming and confident counts for nothing with users .
All users care about is whether you make something they like .
If you do n't , you 're dead .
Knowing that test is coming makes us work a lot harder to get the right answers than anyone would if they were merely hiring people .
We can't afford to have any illusions about the predictors of success .
And what we 've found is that the variation between schools is so much smaller than the variation between individuals that it 's negligible by comparison .
We can learn more about someone in the first minute of talking to them than by knowing where they went to school .
It seems obvious when you put it that way .
Look at the individual , not where they went to college .
But that 's a weaker statement than the idea I began with , that it does n't matter much where a given individual goes to college .
Do n't you learn things at the best schools that you would n't learn at lesser places ?
Apparently not .
Obviously you can't prove this in the case of a single individual , but you can tell from aggregate evidence : you can't , without asking them , distinguish people who went to one school from those who went to another three times as far down the US News list . [ 3 ]
Try it and see .
How can this be ?
Because how much you learn in college depends a lot more on you than the college .
A determined party animal can get through the best school without learning anything .
And someone with a real thirst for knowledge will be able to find a few smart people to learn from at a school that is n't prestigious at all .
The other students are the biggest advantage of going to an elite college ; you learn more from them than the professors .
But you should be able to reproduce this at most colleges if you make a conscious effort to find smart friends .
At most colleges you can find at least a handful of other smart students , and most people have only a handful of close friends in college anyway . [ 4 ]
The odds of finding smart professors are even better .
The curve for faculty is a lot flatter than for students , especially in math and the hard sciences ; you have to go pretty far down the list of colleges before you stop finding smart professors in the math department .
So it 's not surprising that we 've found the relative prestige of different colleges useless in judging individuals .
There 's a lot of randomness in how colleges select people , and what they learn there depends much more on them than the college .
Between these two sources of variation , the college someone went to does n't mean a lot .
It is to some degree a predictor of ability , but so weak that we regard it mainly as a source of error and try consciously to ignore it .
I doubt what we 've discovered is an anomaly specific to startups .
Probably people have always overestimated the importance of where one goes to college .
We 're just finally able to measure it .
The unfortunate thing is not just that people are judged by such a superficial test , but that so many judge themselves by it .
A lot of people , probably the majority of people in America , have some amount of insecurity about where , or whether , they went to college .
The tragedy of the situation is that by far the greatest liability of not having gone to the college you'd have liked is your own feeling that you 're thereby lacking something .
Colleges are a bit like exclusive clubs in this respect .
There is only one real advantage to being a member of most exclusive clubs : you know you would n't be missing much if you were n't .
When you 're excluded , you can only imagine the advantages of being an insider .
But invariably they 're larger in your imagination than in real life .
So it is with colleges .
Colleges differ , but they 're nothing like the stamp of destiny so many imagine them to be .
People are n't what some admissions officer decides about them at seventeen .
They 're what they make themselves .
Indeed , the great advantage of not caring where people went to college is not just that you can stop judging them ( and yourself ) by superficial measures , but that you can focus instead on what really matters .
What matters is what you make of yourself .
I think that 's what we should tell kids .
Their job is n't to get good grades so they can get into a good college , but to learn and do .
And not just because that 's more rewarding than worldly success .
That will increasingly be the route to worldly success .
Notes
[ 1 ] Is what we measure worth measuring ?
I think so .
You can get rich simply by being energetic and unscrupulous , but getting rich from a technology startup takes some amount of brains .
It is just the kind of work the upper middle class values ; it has about the same intellectual component as being a doctor .
[ 2 ] Actually , someone did , once .
Mitch Kapor 's wife Freada was in charge of HR at Lotus in the early years .
( As he is at pains to point out , they did not become romantically involved till afterward . )
At one point they worried Lotus was losing its startup edge and turning into a big company .
So as an experiment she sent their recruiters the resumes of the first 40 employees , with identifying details changed .
These were the people who had made Lotus into the star it was .
Not one got an interview .
[ 3 ] The US News list ?
Surely no one trusts that .
Even if the statistics they consider are useful , how do they decide on the relative weights ?
The reason the US News list is meaningful is precisely because they are so intellectually dishonest in that respect .
There is no external source they can use to calibrate the weighting of the statistics they use ; if there were , we could just use that instead .
What they must do is adjust the weights till the top schools are the usual suspects in about the right order .
So in effect what the US News list tells us is what the editors think the top schools are , which is probably not far from the conventional wisdom on the matter .
The amusing thing is , because some schools work hard to game the system , the editors will have to keep tweaking their algorithm to get the rankings they want .
[ 4 ] Possible does n't mean easy , of course .
A smart student at a party school will inevitably be something of an outcast , just as he or she would be in most high schools .

Iraq 's Kurdish regional government welcomed the U.S. Congress non-binding decision to divide the war - torn country into three entities , while Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki rejected it saying it would be " catastrophe . "
" People and government of the Kurdistan Region welcome the U.S. Senate decision calling for rebuilding Iraq on the basis of federalism , " the Kurdish regional presidency , headed by Masoud Barzani , said in a statement obtained by Xinhua on Saturday .
Late on Wednesday , the U.S. Senate approved , with 75 votes for and 23 against , a non-binding draft decision proposing the division of Iraq into three of Kurdish , Shiite and Sunni entities , with a federal government in Baghdad responsible for border security and supervision on oil production .
The Kurdish leadership emphasized that dividing Iraqi into three entities " is the only viable solution to the problems of Iraq , " adding that the federal system " does not mean division for the country , but rather voluntary union . "
For his part , Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki vehemently rejected the resolution describing it as a " catastrophe " and called for the Iraqi parliament to hold a session devoted for discussing the resolution .
" The resolution is weird , because it is an Iraqi affair dealing with Iraqis .
Iraqis are eager for Iraq 's unity .
Dividing Iraq is a problem , and a decision like that would be a catastrophe , " Maliki told reporters on his way back from New York , where he appeared at the U.N. general Assembly .
Also , the Association of Muslim Scholars , a Sunni Arab body , said to be close to several insurgent groups fighting the U.S. - led occupation , condemned the decision in a statement , considering whoever backs the decision to be " traitor for his religion , his nation and his home . "

Every Friday is Health Tip Day at Zen Habits .
Reader stayfly wrote to ask about healthy eating and gaining weight :
I really want to eat as healthy as possible and also to gain some weight ( I ’m currently a bit underweight at 60 kilos and I ’m wanting to put on about 10 kilos over the rest of the year ) .
I ’ve read a fair few health books but there is so much conflicting information that it ’s difficult to know what to eat .
With most other ares of my life I feel in control thanks to researching and finding great information that I believe in and trust ( including from your blog ) but with heath I ’m struggling .
I really feel as though as you are spot on with things like productivity , goals , habits , finances and I would love to hear more about your beliefs regarding health and hopefully you can possible recommend some excellent books on the subject of health as well .
In terms of healthy eating , here are a couple of posts that might help :
Trying to eat healthier ?
Make lifestyle changes , and have a weekly cheat day
Health tip :
Try eating vegetarian sometimes
These are geared to people like me who are trying to eat healthy and also lose some fat .
You want to eat healthy ( rightfully so ) and at the same time , gain some weight .
However , I ’m assuming you want to gain muscle weight and not just fat .
To do that , you need to eat more lean protein while cutting back on the fat ( do n’t eliminate it , just try to eat less saturated fats and more good fats ) , while doing some weight - bearing exercises such as lifting weights .
Here ’s what I would do in your situation :
Focus first on your eating habits , as those are most important to long term health .
Do a one - month challenge that focuses on replacing some of the unhealthier things you might eat with healthy things like fruits , vegetables , whole grains and lean protein ( either lean meats , poultry and fish , or vegetarian protein like nuts , beans , tofu , soy meats , etc ) and the like .
After that one - month challenge , focus on strength training .
You do n’t need to become a bodybuilder or anything , but really there ’s no way to build muscle without some kind of exercise , and weights are best .
You do n’t need to do a lot of exercises and spend hours doing them .
Do some research on the web , but I would suggest starting with simple exercises like pushups , crunches , lunges , squats with no weights , pullups , etc that you can do at home .
After a few weeks , you can add some dumbbells or a barbell with weights , and do some compound exercises like squats , deadlifts , and the like .
Protein power .
When you do strength training , get some extra protein both before and after your workout to maximize muscle building .
Again , you do n’t need to bulk up or anything , but if you want to add a little muscle to your frame , you ’ll need to get some protein .
I suggest whey or soy protein powder to make a shake with milk or soymilk … drink some before and after a workout .
Low reps , higher weights .
A lot of people try to do a high number of repetition for low number of weights , but it ’s really best to do a higher amount of weight ( build up to it though ! ) with lower amount of reps — that ’s how you build muscle .
Again , we ’re not talking about bodybuilder muscle , just about building muscle without having to spend all day in the gym .
Legs , not your biceps .
When doing strength workouts as mentioned above , focus on your bigger muscles rather than smaller ones .
Big ones are in the legs and back , while smaller ones include things like biceps .
It ’s much easier to build some mass in your legs than it is in your arms .
I ’m not saying to ignore your smaller muscles , I ’m just saying that you ’ll maximize your workout time by focusing on the big muscles — and if you do the compound exercises I mentioned , you will also be including the smaller muscles , which is why those are the best exercises .
I ’m not an expert , but I have done a lot of reading on this topic , and that ’s what I recommend .
I ’ve used these methods to build some muscle , although my focus has been more on losing fat than on building muscle so far .
I hope to change that once I get a flatter stomach .

A judge has granted a new trial to Julie Amero , a former substitute teacher in Norwich , Connecticut who was convicted in January on four felony counts of risking injury to minors after she was unable to prevent pornographic pop-ups from showing up on a computer in a classroom in 2004 .
The city 's prosecutors did not oppose the motion for a new trial , raising the possibility that Amero will not be tried again .
The opportunity for a new day in court marks a reversal in fortune for Amero who faced sentencing this week that could have landed her in jail for forty years .
Amero was convicted of endangering children after several students saw pornographic thumbnails on a computer screen .
Despite testimony that the monitor did not face the children , that Amero asked for help from other teachers and a vice principal , and that the schools IT administrator allowed the school 's filtering software to expire , Amero was found guilty .
Security experts around the internet have rallied to Amero 's defense , arguing that it is clear that the computer Amero was using was infested with pop -up software , but the school 's IT administrator told the jury he'd never heard of such software .
Judge Hillary B. Strackbein granted the motion for a new trial filed by Amero 's new lawyer , William F. Dow , after a state laboratory 's examination of the computer 's hard drive after the trial contradicted evidence presented in court .
" The jury may have relied , at least in part , on that faulty information , " said Judge Hillary B. Strackbein , according to the Associated Press .
Eric Sites , the CTO of the security software company Sunbelt who examined a copy of the hard drive for the defense , hailed Wednesday 's ruling .
" For a real computer expert , it was easy to see there were inaccuracies in the testimony given by the prosecution 's expert witness , and I think the pros was truly led astray by the assertiveness of their witness , "
Sites said .
Sites analyzed a copy of the hard drive provided to him by Amero 's first expert witness , and found that computer was infected .
" There was definitely adware called new.net , " Sites said .
" It was downloaded by a screensaver installed for Halloween by the teacher
Amero was subbing for . "
Sites said the adware would intercept terms typed into a browser address bar , redirect them and then " you are down the rabbit hole . "
Amero 's original expert witness , Herb Horner , was n't able to present at trial his prepared findings on the contents of the hard drive because Amero 's original lawyer forgot to provide it ahead of time to the prosecution as required .
Spyware is n't just about pop-up ads and browser hijacking – there 's an X - rated component as well , according to Ari Schwartz of the Center for Democracy and Technology .
" More people are seeing porn that they do n't want to see than in past , and when you put those numbers up against spyware studies , that spike directly correlates to spyware distribution , " Schwartz said .

Democrats increasingly confident they can sway Senate against war John Byrne
Published : Saturday July 7 , 2007 Print This Email This
It could be Senate Majority Harry Reid 's ( D - NV ) moment .
The New York Times will report Sunday that the Democrats ' Senate chief is increasingly confident that he 'll be able to sway the Senate into voting for withdrawal .
Against the backdrop of a seething public -- including those of his own party who feel Democrats have n't done enough to seek an exit from Iraq -- and a coterie of Senate Republicans who have warmed to the idea , Reid suggests he may find enough votes to withdraw .
 We havent done enough ,  Reid tells the Times .
Reid 's efforts to temper America 's involvement in Iraq have been frustrated by a former member of his own party .
Sen. Joseph Lieberman ( I - CT ) , who supported Reid in his bid for the Senate leadership , votes against him on the war .
" Sensing momentum from the new Republican defections , Mr. Reid and other leading Democrats intend to force a series of votes over the next two weeks on proposals to withdraw troops and limit spending , " the paper 's Carl Hulse and Jeff Zeleny report .
" Democrats are increasingly confident they can assemble majority opposition to administration policies . "
 It is going to be harder for Republicans to not sign on to something with bite in it , a clear Congressional assessment that change is needed ,  Senate Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin ( D - MI ) says .
 I think it is more likely there will be a majority around here that say we should begin to redeploy some forces by a certain date , and I hope it would be a larger majority .
The full story is
On the same week last month that the European Union unveiled its new , no -hassle “ blue card ” program to attract highly skilled migrant workers , the U.S. Senate voted to hike employer fees for H1 - B visas to $ 5,000 .
H1 - Bs allow U.S. employers to bring foreign talent into the American workforce .
It was a telling coincidence , demonstrating that as the rest of the world is becoming more welcoming of skilled immigrants who fuel innovation , the United States , mired in its know - nothing Lou Dobbesian nativism , is turning its back on one of its great competitive advantages -- its historic knack for playing the role of host to the world ’s most creative tinkerers .
For the nation , and for California , turning away gifted computer scientists and engineers to more welcoming jurisdictions could prove devastating .
According to a recent study by the National Venture Capital Assn. , over the last 15 years , foreign nationals have started a quarter of U.S. venture - backed public companies .
These are companies that generate about $ 130 billion in annual revenue and that employ hundreds of thousands of Americans .
Within California alone , foreign - born entrepreneurs played a key role in founding Intel , eBay , Yahoo , Sun Microsystems and Google .
The H1 - B fee hike is a mere nuisance compared with the scarcity of such visas for needed workers .
Congress has set the number of H1 - Bs -- which are three - year visas -- at an arbitrarily low 65,000 a year .
In April of this year , the first day companies could apply for the visas for fiscal 2008 ( which started Oct. 1 ) , the government was swamped with 133,000 applications .
That means a lot of high - tech innovators will go to work elsewhere .
Earlier this year , Microsoft expanded a research - and - development center in Vancouver , and it cited the dysfunctional U.S. immigration system as one reason to go to Canada , which is eager to attract , rather than harass , foreign talent .
In congressional testimony last June on the visa shortfall , Google ’s vice president of “ people operations , ” Laszlo Bock , said the company had failed to get visas for 70 engineers .
Some of these individuals , who should be innovating in California , are now parked at Google campuses in Switzerland or Britain .

Does it really make sense to ban from the U.S. engineers whom Google has determined it needs to continue revolutionizing the Web ?
It is n’t as though U.S. workers are victimized by the addition of outstanding foreign workers .
Google has hired thousands of people this year alone , and only 8 % of its U.S. workforce is here on a visa .
Moreover , the innovations resulting from bringing the world ’s best and brightest together in Silicon Valley lead directly to the creation of more jobs for U.S. workers .
Orkut Buyukkokten , a Stanford University - trained computer scientist from Turkey who obtained his H1 - B in 2002 , was cited as a case in point by Bock .
Buyukkokten ’s first name is now a brand , the name of a popular social networking service .
He is just one of many foreign computer scientists who have led to the company ’s explosive growth .
Google will be fine , even if Lou Dobbs is elected president and all of the company ’s innovation takes place overseas , but I worry about California ’s future if overly restrictive immigration policies become the long - term norm .
And it is n’t only the corporate icons that could be jeopardized but the state ’s vaunted research universities as well .
The symbiotic relationship between places such as UC Berkeley and Stanford and high - tech start - ups is widely understood -- from the Hewlett - Packard era to our own Google age .
But a key reason for that harmonic relationship has always been Silicon Valley ’s accessibility to the world ’s best and brightest .
If high - tech start - ups start favoring more welcoming places such as Australia , Canada or even Europe , their universities will likely benefit at U.S. universities ’ expense .

In 2005 , two - thirds of U.S. doctoral electrical engineering students and half of computer science doctoral students were foreign born .
Even if we could remain an educational magnet while closing the door to highly skilled foreign workers , would it really make sense to continue investing in the education of these great minds , only to see the fruits of their labor enrich more welcoming jurisdictions ?
The number of jobs in the U.S. for computer software engineers is expected to reach 450,000 by 2014 , according to the government , and there is no way all these jobs will be filled solely by graduates -- foreign or native born -- of American universities .
The problems created by an unrealistically low number of H1 - B visas are compounded by the notorious backlog for permanent - residency green cards , the alternative for foreigners who want to become U.S. workers .
Green card applications ( and lives ) remain in limbo for more than five years .
( Europe aims to process its blue - card applications within months . )
The overall system screams “ we do n’t want you here ” to talented workers the country in fact needs .
As in the case of the low - skilled agricultural workforce also crucial to this state , most members of Congress know that it is urgent to secure the supply of needed computer scientists and engineers .
But in the aftermath of the collapse of comprehensive immigration reform this year , and the attending anti-immigrant hysteria , our representatives seem too paralyzed to do what the rest of the world knows to make sense , which is to try harder to woo those who will be creating the Intels , eBays and Googles of tomorrow .
A UN conference , held at the European Parliament in Brussels , heard an array of speakers call for a boycott against Israel and strategize on ways to achieve its international isolation , during the first day of an event billed by organizers as a gathering to promote " Middle East peace " .
Taking Israel 's Side Polish MEPs boycott UN conference Yaakov Lappin
' We can call this conference anti-Israeli , ' Polish MEP says Polish MEPs boycott UN conference
The ' International Conference of Civil Society in Support of Israeli - Palestinian Peace ' has been organized by the UN's Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People , and attracted political figures and pro-Palestinian members of non governmental organizations ( NGOs ) .
According to the Bnei Brith organization , which sent delegates to attend the conference from its European Affairs Office , British Member of Parliament Clare Short said during her speech that Israel was not interested in a two - state solution , and blasted the EU for " allowing " Israel to build " an apartheid wall " .
" The boycott worked for South Africa , it is time to do it again , " Short was quoted as saying .
The security fence was also attacked by the European Parliament 's vice president , Edward McMillan - Scott , who maintained that it would not bring peace to Israel .
McMillan - Scott added that the European Parliament was committed to " a two state solution with safe borders , " according to the Bnei Brith report of the conference .
Addressing the conference on behalf of PA President Mahmoud Abbas , Leila Shahid , Palestinian Representative to the EU , read out a statement in which Abbas expressed satisfaction that the conference was hosted by the European Parliament , and lamented the suffering of the Palestinian people .
Pierre Galand , European coordinator of the Committees and Associations for Palestine , claimed that the conference was taking place despite pressures to cancel it , and blamed the Fatah - Hamas conflict on " Israeli policy " .
' Members guided by clear agenda '
" This is a conference of Israel - haters , " Adam Mouchtar , Director of Bnei Brith 's European Union Affairs Office , told Ynetnews .
Mouchtar attended the conference 's first day , and said its members were clearly guided by a single agenda : " To prove that Israel is a racist apartheid state , and therefore Israel should be boycotted internationally , as South Africa was . "
" We 've had this in Durban in 2001 .
These are the same organizations that took over the Durban conference and coined the term ' Zionism is racism ' , " Mouchtar said .
He added that the most positive speech came from an Israeli - Arab Knesset Member , Nadia Hilou , who praised the recent boost in relations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority .
" I feel that it 's a farce , " Mouchtar said , adding : " It 's a biased conference .
It nearly totally excludes any reasonable Israeli speakers . "
According to Mouchtar , one of the few Jewish attendees was a " self hater " invited to " legitimize the claim that the conference was not biased " .
Mouchtar called on the UN Secretary - General , Ban Ki-moon , to take action to prevent such activities in the future , adding that the actions of UN sub - committees were " delegitimizing the good work the UN is doing in other fields " .
' Campaign to demonize Israel '
But Wolfgang Grieger , Secretary of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People , told Ynetnews that the conference had " received a message from Ban Ki-moon " .
" It opened this morning with some 400 participants attending , representatives of 140 civil society organizations , members of the European and national parliaments , 53 government observers , as well as 16 intergovernmental organizations , including UN agencies .
The Committee is very pleased with this big turnout , " he said .
A spokesman for NGO Monitor , an Israeli watchdog , told Ynetnews : " As NGO Monitor 's continued research has shown , non governmental organizations funded and supported by the EU and other international governments , are at the forefront of the political campaign to demonize and delegitimize Israel .
" This conference highlights once again , the moral bankruptcy of so many of these groups and individuals who compare the Israel - Palestinian conflict to apartheid South Africa , and single out Israel for boycotts and sanctions , " he said .

An article at The Volokh Conspiracy pointed me to a month - old profile of Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens and , in particular , his role in one of most pivotal events of the Second World War :
After graduating Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Chicago in 1941 , Stevens enlisted in the Navy on Dec. 6 , 1941 , hours before the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor .
He later won a bronze star for his service as a cryptographer , after he helped break the code that informed American officials that Adm .
Isoroku Yamamoto , the commander of the Japanese Navy and architect of the Pearl Harbor attack , was about to travel to the front .
Based on the code - breaking of Stevens and others , U.S. pilots , on Roosevelt ’s orders , shot down Yamamoto ’s plane in April 1943 .
Stevens told me he was troubled by the fact that Yamamoto , a highly intelligent officer who had lived in the United States and become friends with American officers , was shot down with so little apparent deliberation or humanitarian consideration .
The experience , he said , raised questions in his mind about the fairness of the death penalty .
“ I was on the desk , on watch , when I got word that they had shot down Yamamoto in the Solomon Islands , and I remember thinking :
This is a particular individual they went out to intercept , ” he said .
“ There is a very different notion when you ’re thinking about killing an individual , as opposed to killing a soldier in the line of fire . ”
Stevens said that , partly as a result of his World War II experience , he has tried on the court to narrow the category of offenders who are eligible for the death penalty and to ensure that it is imposed fairly and accurately .
He has been the most outspoken critic of the death penalty on the current court .
A few thoughts .
First of all , while I ca n’t read Justice Stevens ’ mind , either now or back in 1945 , I somehow doubt that he was as morally conflicted over the death of the man who planned and executed the attack on Pearl Harbor as he now claims to be .
Agree with him or not , he ’s become a staunch death penalty opponent on the bench over the years , and I ca n’t help but think that his opinions today have an influence over his judgment of his own actions , and the actions of others , in the heat of war .
Second , there is no comparison between the death of Yamamoto and the death penalty in the context of a criminal case .
Yamamoto was , at the time of his death in 1943 , the Commander of the entire Japanese Navy and , by all accounts , one of it ’s most brilliant strategists .
He planned an executed an attack that resulted in the deaths of thousands of Americans .
And , more importantly , he was a soldier in the middle of a total war in which victory was the only option .
His removal from the playing field , whether by capture or death , would have dealt a significant blow to Japan , shortened the war , and saved the lives of American and Japanese soldiers , and , in retrospect , it clearly did .
Therefore , he was an acceptable target in a military sense and his death is in no way comparable the the death of a murderer in a criminal case .
Moreover , as Volokh points out , the moral case for killing a commander in the course of war is so clear from a moral perspective ( unless , of course , you ’re a pacifist ) that if the same were were from the death penalty it would make executing criminals a moral imperative :
[ I ] f Yamamoto ’s killing were analogous to the death penalty , then the death penalty should be acclaimed as a high moral imperative : Rather than wondering whether the death penalty saves innocent lives , we ’d be nearly sure of it .
Rather than wondering whether there are less lethal alternatives that would protect society , we ’d know that other alternatives would be vastly less reliable and more dangerous .
Rather than wondering whether the target is innocent , we ’d be sure that killing him is entirely morally proper .
I generally support the death penalty , but I do see strong arguments against it — arguments that flow precisely from the fact that the death penalty is extraordinarily unlike the targeted killing of Yamamoto .
Rather than agonizing over his role in this pivotal event in history , Stevens should be proud of it .
As for the death penalty , he may be right that there are arguments against it , frankly I think that he is , but you do n’t need to reach back to the Second World War to find them .

My favorite web based comic , Penny Arcade , is starting their Child ’s Play initiative once again .
This is their fourth year of running the charity , and I hope to see it continue growing bigger and bigger every year .
The premise of the charity is simple , give gaming technology to hospitals to improve people ’s stay at an otherwise not so fun-friendly place .
Since 2003 , the initiative has been able to give over $ 2 million in games , toys , and cash to hospitals worldwide .
From their site :
Now in its fifth year , Child ’s Play has expanded its network of beneficiary hospitals to over 25 states and five countries across the globe with additional partner hospitals being added each month .
Child ’s Play works in conjunction with Amazon.com to create wish lists for participating hospitals .
Individual donors can choose to give new items ranging from toddler toys to music CDs , videogames , game consoles and accessories .
Gifts are delivered directly to hospitals in need and are tax deductible as denoted by law .
The annual Child ’s Play Fundraiser Dinner Auction will be held Tuesday , December 11 , 2007 at the Washington State Convention and Trade Center in Seattle , Washington .
The semi - formal evening features a silent auction , dinner and live auction .
In 2006 the dinner raised over $ 200,000 in one night , with all fundraising proceeds going directly to the Child ’s Play network of hospitals .
I really believe that this charity is doing great things for children ’s hospitals around the world , and I hope that if you can , you will help by promoting the project , or sending a contribution to it .
The Child ’s Play Charity deserves your support and once you are done donating , be sure to read Penny Arcade .

OpenBSD project creator
Theo de Raadt detailed his concerns regarding BSD - licensed code and Dual - BSD / GPL - licensed code being re-licensed under only the GPL ( as previously discussed ) : “ Honestly , I was greatly troubled by the situation , because even people like Alan Cox were giving other Linux developers advice to …
Break the law .
And furthermore , there are even greater potential risks for how the various communities interact . ”
Regarding the concern that the BSD license allows companies to steal code , Theo reflected : “ GPL fans said the great problem we would face is that companies would take our BSD code , modify it , and not give back .
Nope – the great problem we face is that people would wrap the GPL around our code , and lock us out in the same way that these supposed companies would lock us out . ”

Print This Email This Former Chairman of the US Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan believes that it's " unfair " to try and use his book as Exhibit A to make the case that the Bush Administration lied to the public about the real reason why Iraq was invaded .
" I am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows : the Iraq war is largely about oil , " Greenspan wrote in his soon - to - be- published memoir , The Age of Turbulence : Adventures in a New World .
Monday morning on NBC's Today Show , Matt Lauer said to Greenspan , " You write a 500 - page book and you know what happens .
People want to talk about a certain couple of key sentences in that book . "
Lauer continued , " Now , as a lifelong libertarian Republican , as the former chairman of the Federal Reserve , you know that when you speak , people are going to listen ; they 're going to react .
Liberal bloggers are having a field day with this .
They 're saying , ' Here 's a Republican saying the administration lied about the reason to go to war . '
Is that a spin ?
Is that fair ? "
" It 's utterly unfair , " Greenspan responded .
" I was expressing my view .
Saddam Hussein was obviously seeking to get a choke hold on the Straits of Hormuz , where about 18 million barrels a day flow from the Middle East to the industrial world .
Had he been able to get hold of a nuclear weapon and indeed move through Kuwait and into Saudi Arabia and control the Straits of Hormuz , it would have caused chaos in the international --"
Lauer interjected , " So are we talking about semantics here , Alan ?
In other words , the administration went to war saying it was all about weapons of mass destruction . "
" I believe that they believed that , " Greenspan said .
" I 'm not saying that they believed it was about oil .
I 'm saying it is about oil and that I believe it was necessary to get Saddam out of there . "
Lauer offered , " Maybe the better way to put it -- it was about stability .
It was about stability in a region .
And whether it was about weapons of mass destruction , destabilizing that region or oil , it 's all about stability . "
" Absolutely , " Lauer agreed .
Reporting for the UK's Times , Gerard Baker notes , " The excitement that that seems to have caused in some sections of the media might be tempered by his somewhat testy acknowledgement earlier in the book that he was left out of the inner circle of policy advisers around President Bush . "
" Back to the subject of oil , you say if the war in Iraq was all about oil , some people say , ' Then why are we facing $ 80 a gallon right now -- a barrel right now ? ' "
NBC 's Lauer asked Greenspan .
" You make the point that if we had n't gone to war , we might be facing $ 130 , $ 140 a barrel .
Correct ? " " Correct , " Greenspan agreed .
Lauer continued , " And you think that would have been a real possibility . "
" Absolutely , " Greenspan said .
" The way I read Saddam , that 's where he was going . "

Section I : Handbook For Jurors
Jury Duty !
The purpose of this information if to revive , as Jefferson put it , " The Ancient Principles . "
It is not designed to promote lawlessness or a return to the jungle .
The " Ancient Principle " refer to the Ten Commandments and the Common Law .
The Common Law is , in simple terms , just plain common sense and has its roots in the Ten Commandments .
In 1776 we came out of BONDAGE with FAITH , UNDERSTANDING and COURAGE .
Even against great odds , and with much bloodshed , we battled our way to achieve LIBERTY .
LIBERTY is that delicate area between the force of government and FREEWILL of man .
LIBERTY brings FREEDOM of choice to work , to trade , to go and live wherever one wishes ; it leads to ABUNDANCE .
ABUNDANCE , if made an end in itself , will result in COMPLACENCY which leads to APATHY .
APATHY is the " let George do it " philosophy .
This always brings DEPENDENCY .
For a period of time , dependents are often not aware they are dependent .
They delude themselves by thinking they are still free - " We never had it so good . " -
" We can still vote , can 't we ? "
Eventually abudance diminishes and DEPENDENCY becomes known by its true nature : BONDANGE !!!
There are few ways out of bondage .
Bloodshed and war aften result , but our founding fathers learned of a better way .
Realizing that a CREATOR is always above and greater than that which He creates , they established a three vote system by which an informed citizenry can control those acting in the name of govenment .
To be a good master you must always remember the true " pecking order " or chain of command in this nation :
GOD created man ...
Man ( that 's you ) created the Constitution ...
The Constitution created government ...
Government created corporations ...etc .
The base of power was to remain in WE THE PEOPLE but unfortunately , it was lost to those leaders acting in the name of government , such as politicians , bureaucrats , judges , lawyers , etc .
As a result America began to function like a democracy instead of a REPUBLIC .
A democracy is dangerous because it is a one - vote system as opposed to a Republic , which is a three - vote system .
Three votes to check tyranny , not just one .
American citizens have not been informed of their other two votes .
Our first vote is at the polls on election day when we pick those who are to represent us in the seats of government .
But what can be done if those elected officials just do n't perform as promised or expected ?
Well , the second two votes are the most effective means by which the common people of any nation on earth have ever had in controlling those appointed to serve them in government .
The second vote comes when you serve on a Grand Jury .
Before anyone can be brought to trial for a capital or infamous crime by those acting in the name of government , permission must be obtained from people serving on the Grand Jury !
The Minneapolis Star and Tribune in the March 27th 1987 edition noted a purpose of the Grand Jury this way : " A grand jury 's purpose is to protect the public from an overzealous prosecutor . "
The third is the most powerful vote ; this is when you are acting as a jury member during a courtroom trial .
At this point , " the buck stops " with you !
It is in this setting that each JUROR has MORE POWER than the President , all of Congress , and all of the judges combined !
Congress can legislate ( make law ) , the President or some other bureaucrat can make an order or issue regulations , and judges may instruct or make a decision , but no JUROR can ever be punished for voting " Not Guilty ! "
Any JUROR can , with impunity , choose to disregard the instructions of any judge or attorney in rendering his vote .
If only one JUROR should vote " Not Guilty " for any reason , there is no conviction and no punishment at the end of the trial .
Thus , those acting in the name of government must come before the common man to get permission to enforce a law .
You Are Above The Law !
As a JUROR in a trial setting , when it comes to your individual vote of innocent or guilty , you truly are answerable only to GOD ALMIGHTY .
The First Amendment to the Constitution was born out of this great concept .
However , judges of today refuse to inform JURORS of their RIGHTS .
The Minneapolis Star and Tribune in a news paper article appearing in its November 30th 1984 edition , entitled : " What judges do n't tell the juries " stated :
" At the time of the adoption of the Constitution , the jury 's role as defense against political oppression was unquestioned in American jurisprudence .
This nation survived until the 1850's when prosecutions under the Fugitive Slave Act were largely unsuccessful because juries refused to convict . "
" Then judges began to erode the institution of free juries , leading to the absurd compromise that is the current state of the law .
While our courts uniformly state juries have the power to return a verdict of not guilty whatever the facts , they routinely tell the jurors the opposite . "
" Further , the courts will not allow the defendants or their counsel to inform the jurors of their true power .
A lawyer who made ... Hamilton 's argument would face professional discipline and charges of contempt of court . "
" By what logic should juries have the power to acquit a defendant but no right to know about the power ?
The court decisions that have suppressed the notion of jury nullification cannot resove this paradox . "
" More than logic has suffered .
As orignally conceived , juries were to be a kind of safety valve , a way to soften the bureaucratic rigidity of the judicial system by introducing the common sense of the community .
If they are to funciton effectively as the ' conscience of the community , ' jurors must be told that they have the power and the right to say no to a prosecution in order to achieve a greater good .
To cut jurors off from this information is to undermine one of our most important institutions . "
" Perhaps the community should educate itself .
Then citizens called for jury duty could teach the judge a needed lesson in civics . "
This information is designed to bring to your attention one important way our nation 's founders provided to insure that you , ( not the growing army of politicians , judges , lawyers , and bureaucrats , rule this nation .
It will focus on the true power you possess as a JUROR , how you got it , why you have it , and remind you of the basis on which you must decide not only the facts placed in evidence but also the validity or application of every law , rule , regulation , ordinance , or instruction given by any man seated as a judge or attorney when you serve as a JUROR .
One JUROR can stop tyranny with a " NOT GUILTY VOTE ! "
He can nullify bad law in any case , by " HANGING THE JURY ! "
" I am only one , but I am one .
I cannot do everything , but I can do something .
What I can do , I should do and , with the help of God , I will do ! "
Everett Hale
The only power the judge has over the JURY is their ignorance !
" WE THE PEOPLE , " must relearn a desperately needed lesson in civics .
The truth of this question has been answered by many testimonies and historical events .
Consider the following :
JURY Rights
" The jury has a right to judge both the law as well as the fact in controversy . "
John Jay , 1st Chief Justice
United States supreme Court , 1789
" The jury has the right to determine both the law and the facts . "
Samuel Chase , U.S. supreme Court Justice ,
1796 , Signer of the unanimous Declaration
" the jury has the power to bring a verdict in the teeth of both law and fact . "
Oliver Wendell Holmes ,
U.S. supreme Court Justice , 1902
" The law itself is on trial quite as much as the cause which is to be decided . "
Harlan F. Stone , 12th Chief Justice
U.S. supreme Court , 1941
" The pages of history shine on instance of the jury 's exercise of its prerogative to disregard instructions of the judge ... "
U.S.vs Dougherty , 473 F 2nd 113 , 1139 , ( 1972 )
Law of the Land
The general misconception is that any statute passed by legislators bearing the appearance of law constitutes the law of the land .
The U.S. Constitution is the supreme law of the land , and any statute , to be valid , must be in agreement .
It is impossible for a law which violates the Constitution to be valid .
This is succintly stated as follows :
" All laws which are repugnant to the Constitution are null and void . "
Marbury vs Madison , 5 US ( 2 Cranch ) 137 , 174 , 176 , ( 1803 )
" Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved , there can be no rule making or legislation which would abrogate them "
Miranda vs Arizona , 384 US 436 p. 491 .
" An unconstitutional act is not law ; it confers no right ; it imposes no duties ; affords no protection ; it creates no office ; it is in legal contemplation , as inoperative as though it had never been passed . "
Norton vs Shelby County118 US 425 p.442
" The general rule is that an unconstitutional statute , though having the form and the name of law , in in reality no law , but is wholly void , and ineffective for any purpose ; since unconstitutionality dates from the time of its enactment , and not merely from the date of the decision so branding it .
No one is bound to obey an unconstitutional law and no courts are bound to enforce it . "

A Summary of the Ten Commandments
The TEN COMMANDMENTS represent GOD'S GOVERNMENT OVER MAN !
GOD commands us for our own good to give up wrongs and not rights !
HIS system always results in LIBERTY and FREEDOM !
The Constitution and the Bill of Rights are built on this foundation , which provides for punitive justice .
It is not until one damages another 's person or property that he can be punished .
The Marxist system leads to bondage and GOD'S system leads to LIBERTY !
Read very carefully :
Thou Shalt have no other gods before Me .
Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image .
Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain .
Remember the Sabbath to keep it Holy .
Honor thy father and mother .
Thou shalt not murder .
Thou shalt not commit adultery
Thou shalt not steal .
Thou shalt not bear false witness .
Thou shalt not covet .
Directly above the Chief Justice 's chair is a tablet signifying the TEN COMMANDMENTS When the Speaker of the House in the U.S. Congress looks up , his eyes look into the face of Moses .
" The Bible is the Book upon which this Republic rests . "
- Andrew Jackson , Seventh President of the United States
" The moral principles and precepts contained in the Scriptures ought to form the basis of all our civil constitutions and laws .
All the miseries and evils which men suffer from , vice , crime , ambition , injustice , oppression , slavery , and war , proceed from the despising or neglecting the precepts contained in the Bible . "
- Noah Webster
A Summary of the Communist Manifesto
The Communist Manifesto represents a misguided philosophy , which teaches the citizens to give up their RIGHTS for the sake of the " common good , " but it always ends in a police state .
This is called preventive justice .
Control is the key concept .
Read carefully :
Abolition of private property .
Heavy progressive income tax .
Aboliton to all rights of inheritance .
Confiscation of property of all emigrants and rebels .
A Central bank Government control of Communications and Transportation Government ownership of factories and agriculture .
Government control of labor .
Corporate farms , regional planning .
Free education for all children in govenment contolled schools
Give Up Rights or The " Common Good " ?
When the people fear the government you have tyranny ; when the government fears the people , you have liberty .
Politicians , bureaucrats and especially judges would have you believe that too much freedom will result in chaos .
Therefore , we should gladly give up some RIGHTS for the good of the community .
In other words , people acting in the name of government , say we need more laws and more JURORS to enforce these laws - even if we have to give up some more RIGHTS in the process .
They believe the more laws we have , the more control , thus a better society .
This theory may sound good on paper , and apparently many of our ' leaders ' think this way , as evidenced by the thousands of new laws that are added to the books each year in this country .
But , no matter how cleverly this Marxist argument is made , the hard fact is that whenever you give up a RIGHT you lose a " FREE CHOICE " !
This adds another control .
Control 's real name is BONDAGE !
The logical conclusion would be , if giving up some RIGHTS , produces a better society , then by giving up all RIGHTS we could produce the perfect society .
We could chain everybody to a tree , for lack of TRUST .
This may prevent a crime , but it would destroy PRIVACY , which is the heartbeat of FREEDOM !
It would also destroy TRUST which is the foundation for DIGNITY .
Rather than giving up RIGHTS , we shoud be giving up wrongs !
The opposite of control is not chaos .
More laws do not make less criminals !
We must give up wrongs , not rights , for a better society !
William Penn of the British House of Commons , once proclaimed , " Necessity is the plea for every infringement of human liberty ; it is the argument of tyrants ; it is the creed of slaves . "
Inailienable , ( Unalienable ) or Natural Rights !
NATURAL RIGHTS ARE THOSE RIGHTS such as LIFE ( from conception ) , LIBERTY and the PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS e.g. FREEDOM of RELIGION , SPEECH , LEARNING , TRAVEL , SELF - DEFENSE , ETC .
Hence laws and statutes which vilolate NATURAL RIGHTS , though they have the color of law , are not law but imposters !
The U.S. Constitution was written to protect these NATURAL RIGHTS from being tampered with by legislators .
Further , our forefathers also wisely knew that the U.S. Constitution would be utterly worthless to restrain government legislators unless it was clearly understood that the people had the right to compel the government to keep within the Constitutional limits .
In a jury trial the real judges are the JURORS !
Surprisingly , judges are actually just referees bound by the Constitution !
Lysander Spooner in his book Essay on the Trial by Jury wrote as follows :
" Government is established for the protection of the weak against the strong .
This is the principal , if not the sole motive for the establishment of all legitimate government .
It is only the weaker party that lose their liberties , when a government becomes oppressive .
The stronger party , in all governments are free by virtue of their superior strength .
They never oppress themselves .
Legislation is the work of the stronger party ; and if , in addition to the sole power of legislation , they have the sole power of determining what legislation shall be enforced , they have all power in their hands , and the weaker party are the subjects of an absolute government .
Unless the weaker party have a veto , they have no power whatever in the government and ... no liberties ... The trial by jury is the only institution that gives the weaker party any veto power upon the power of the stronger .
Consequently it is the only institution that gives them any effective voice in the government , or any guaranty against oppression . "
The Complete TEXT of The Essay on the Trial by Jury is HERE
JURY Tampering ?
A JURY's Rights , Powers and Duties :
The Charge to the JURY in the First JURY Trial before the supreme Court of the United States illustrates the TRUE POWER OF THE JURY .
In the February term of 1794 , the supreme ( Supreme is not capitalized in the Constitution , however Behavior is .
Art. III ) Court conducted a JURY trial and said : " ... it is presumed , that the juries are the best judges of facts ; it is , on the other hand , presumed that the courts are the best judges of law .
But still both objects are within your power of decision . "
" You have a right to take upon yourselves to judge of both , and to determine the law as well as the fact in controversy . "
( State of Georgia vs. Brailsford , et al , 3 Dall 1 )
" The JURY has an unreviewable and unreversible power ... to aquit in disregard of the instructions on the law given by the trial judge ... " ( emphasis added )
U.S.vs Dougherty , 473 F 2nd 1113 , 1139 , ( 1972 )
Hence , JURY disregard to the limited and generally conviction - oriented evidence presented for its consideration , and JURY disregard for what the trial judge wants them to believe is the controlling law in any particular case ( sometimes referred to as " JURY lawlessness " {jury lawlessness means willingness to nullify bad law} ) is not something to be scrupulously avoided , but rather encouraged .
Witness the following quotation from the eminent legal authority above mentioned : " Jury lawlessness is the greatest corrective of law in its actual administration .
The will of the state at large imposed on a reluctant community , the will of a majority imposed on a vigorous and determined minority , find the same obstacle in the local JURY that formerly confronted kings and ministers . " ( emphasis added )
Dougherty , cited above , note 32 at 1130
The Right of the JURY to be Told of Its Power
Almost every JURY in the land is falsely instructed by the judge when it is told it must accept as the law that which is given to them by the court , and that the JURY can decide only the facts in the case .
This is to destroy the purpose of a Common Law JURY , and to permit the imposition of tyranny upon the people .
" There is nothing more terrifying than ignorance in action . "
Goethe - engraved on a plaque at the Naval War College
" To embarrass justice by a multiplicity of laws , or to hazard it by confidence in judges , are the oposite rocks on which all civil institutions have been wrecked . "
Johnson - engraved in the Minnesota State Capitol
Outside the supreme Court Chambers
" ... The letter killeth , but the spirit giveth life . "
II Corinthians 3 vs 6
" It is error alone which needs the support of government .
Truth can stand by itself . "
Thomas Jefferson
The JURY'S options are by no means limited to the choices presented to it in the courtroom .
" The jury gets its understanding as to the arrangements in the legal system from more than one voice .
There is the formal communicaiton from the ' judge ' .
There is the informal communication from the total culture - literature , current comment , conversation ; and , of course , histor y and tradition . "
Dougherty , cited above , at 1135 .
Laws , Facts , and Evidence !
Without the power to decide what facts , law and evidence are applicable .
JURIES cannot be a protection to the accused .
If people acting in the name of government are permitted by JURORS to dictate any law whatever , they can also unfairly dictate what evidence is admissible or inadmissable and thereby prevent the WHOLE TRUTH from being considered .
Thus if government can manipulate and control both the law and evidence , the issue of fact becomes virtually irrelevant .
In reality , true JUSTICE would be denied leaving us with a trial by government and not a trial by JURY !
How Does Tyranny Begin ?
Why Are There So Many Laws ?
Heroes are men of glory who are so honored because of some heroic deed .
People often out of gratutude yield allegiance to them .
Honor and allegiance are nice words for power !
Power and allegiance can only be held rightfully by trust as a result of continued character .
When people acting in the name of government violate ethics , they break trust with " WE THE PEOPLE . "
The natural result is for " WE THE PEOPLE " to pull back power ( honor and allegiance ) .
The loss of power creates fear for those losing the power .
Fearing the loss of power , people acting in the name of government often seek to regain or at least hold their power .
Hence , to legitimatize their quest for control , laws and force are often instituted .
Unchecked power is the foundation of tyranny .
It is the JUROR'S duty to use the JURY ROOM as a vehicle to stem the tide of oppression and tyranny :
To prevent bloodshed by peacefully removing power from those who have abused it .
The JURY is the primary vehicle for the peaceable restoration of LIBERTY , POWER AND HONOR TO " WE THE PEOPLE ! "
Your Vote Counts !
Your vote of NOT GUILTY must be respected by all other members of the JURY - it is the RIGHT and the DUTY of a JUROR to Never , Never , NEVER yield his or her sacred vote - for you are not there as a fool , merely to agree with the majority , but as an officer of the court and a qualified judge in your own right .
Regardless of the pressures or abuse that may be heaped on you by any other members of the JURY with whom you may in good conscience disagree , you can await the reading of the verdict secure in the knowledge you have voted your own conscience and convictions - and not those of someone else .
YOU ARE NOT A RUBBER STAMP !
By what logic do we send our youth to battle tyranny on foreign soil , while we refuse to do so in our courts ?
Did you know that many of the planks of the " Communist Manifesto " are now represented by law in the U.S. ?
How is it possible for Americans to denounce communism and practice it simultaneously ?
The JURY judges the Spirit , Motive and Intent of both the law and the Accused , whereas the prosecutor only represents the letter of the law .
Therein lies the opportunity for the accomplishment of " LIBERTY and JUSTICE for ALL . "
If you , and numerous other JURORS throughout the State and Nation begin and continue to bring in verdicts of NOT GUILTY in such cases where a man -made statute is defective or oppressive , these statutes will become as ineffective as if they had never been written .
" If ye love wealth better than liberty , the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom , go home from us in peace .
We ask not your counsels or your arms .
Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you .
May your chains set lightly upon you , and may posterity forget that ye were out countrymen . "
Samuel Adams
Section II : GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH !
Patrick Henry Shocked !
Young Christian attorney Patrick Henry saw why a JURY of PEERS is so vital to FREEDOM !
It was March 1775 when he rode into a small town of Culpepper , Virginia .
He was totally shocked by what he saw !
There , in the middle of the town square was a minister tied to a whipping post , his back laid bare and bloody with the bones of his ribs showing .
He had been scourged mercilessly like JESUS , with whips laced with metal .
Patrick
Henry is quoted as saying : " When they stopped beating him , I could see the bones of his rib cage .
I turned to someone and asked what the man had done to deserve such a beating as this . "
Scouraged for not Taking a License !
The reply given him was that the man being scourged was a minister who refused to take a license .
He was one of twelve who were locked in jail because they refused to take a license .
A license often becomes an arbitrary control by government that makes a crime out of what ordinarily would not be a crime .
IT TURNS A RIGHT INTO A PRIVILEGE !
Three days later they scourged him to death .
This was the incident which sparked Christian attorney Patrick Henry to write the famous words which later became the rallying cry of the Revolution .
" What is it that Gentlemen wish ?
What would they have ?
Is life so dear , or peace so sweet , as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery ?
Forbid it , Almighty God !
I know no what course others may take , but as for me , GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH !" ( view complete speech here )
Later he made this part of his famous speech at Saint John 's Episcopal Church in Williamsburg , Virginia .
Jury of Peers
Our forefathers felt that in order to have JUSTICE , it was obvious that a JURY of " PEERS " must be people who actually know the defendant .
How else would they be able to judge motive and intent ?
" PEERS " of the defendant , like the rights of the JURY have also been severely tarnished .
Originally , it meant people of " equals in station and rank . "
( Black 's Law Dictionary , 1910 ) , " freeholders of a neighborhood , " ( Bouvier 's Law Dictionary , 1886 ) , or a " A companion ; a fellow ; an associate . "
( Webster 's 1828 Dictionary of the English Language ) .
WHO HAS THE RIGHT TO SIT ON A JURY ?
Patrick Henry , along with others , was deeply concerned as to who has a right to sit on a JURY .
Listen to our forefather 's wisdom on the subject of " PEERS " .
Mr. Henry
" By the bill of rights of England , a subject has a right to a trial by his peers .
What is meant by his peers ?
Those who reside near him , his neighbors , and who are well aquainted with his character and situation in life . "
Patrick Henry , ( Elliont , The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution , 3:579 ) .
Patrick
Henry also knew that orignally the JURY of PEERS was designed as a protection for Neighbors from outside governmental oppression .
Henry states the following , " Why do we love this trial by jury ?
Because it prevents the hand of oppression from cutting you off ... This gives me comfort - that , as long as I have existence , my neighbors will protect me . "
( Elliot , 3:545 , 546 )
Mr. Holmes
Mr. Holmes , from Massachusetts , argued strenuously that for JUSTICE to prevail , the case must be heard in the vicinity where the fact was committed by a JURY of PEERS .
" ... a jury of the peers would , from their local situation , have an opportunity to form a judgement of the CHARACTER of the person charged with the crime , and also to judge of the CREDIBILITY of the witnesses . "
( Elliot , 2:110 ) .
Mr. Wilson
Mr. Wison , signer of " The unanimous Declaration , " who also later became a supreme Court Justice , stressed the importance of the JUROR'S knowing personally both the defendant and the witnesses .
" Where jurors can be aquainted with the characters of the parties and the witnesses - where the whole cause can be brought within their knowledge and their view - I know no mode of investigation equal to that by a trial by jury : they hear every thing that is alleged ; they not only hear the words , but they see and mark the features of the countenance ; they can judge of weight due to such testimony ; and moreover , it is a cheap and expedious manner of distributing justice .
There is another advantage anexed to the trial by jury ; the jurors may indeed return a mistaken or ill - founded verdit , but their errors cannot be systematical . "
( Elliot , 2:516 ) .
Freedom for William Penn
" Those people who are not governed by GOD will be ruled by tyrants . "
William Penn
Edward Bushell and three fellow JURORS learned this lesson well .
They refused to bow to the court .
They believed in the absolute power of the JURY , though their eight companions cowered to the court .
The four JURORS spent nine weeks of torture in prison , often without food or water , soaked with urine , smeared with feces , barely able to stand , and even threatened with fines , yet they would not give in to the judge .
Edward Bushell said , " My liberty is not for sale , " though he had great wealth and commanded an international shipping enterprise .
These " bumble heads " , so the court thought , proved the power of the people was stronger than any power of government .
They emerged total victors .
The First Amendment
The year was 1670 , and the case Bushell sat on was that of William Penn , who was on trial for violation of the " Conventicle Act . "
This was an elaborate Act which made the Church of England the only legal church .
The Act was struck down by their not guilty vote .
Freedom of Religion was established and became part of the English Bill of Rights and later it became the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States .
In addition , the Right to peaceful assembly was founded .
Freedom of Speech , and also habeas corpus .
The first such writ of habeas corpus ever issued by the Court of Common Pleas was used to free Edward Bushell .
Later this trial gave birth to the concept of Freedom of the press .
Had Bushell and his colleagues yielded to the guilty verdict sought by the judge and prosecutor .
William
Penn most likely would have been executed , as he clearly broke the law .
He Broke the Law !
Then there would have been no Liberty Bell , no Independence Hall , no city of Philadelphia , and no state called Pennsylvania , for young Wiliam Penn , founder of Pennsylvania , and leader of the Quakers , was on trial for his life .
His alleged crime was preaching and teaching a different view of the Bible than that of the Church of England .
This appears innocent today , but then , one could be executed for such actions .
He believed in freedom of religion , freedom of speech and the right to peaceful assembly .
He had broken the government 's law , but he had injured no one .
Those four heroic JURORS knew that only when actual injury to someone 's person or property takes place is there a real crime .
No law is broken when no injury can be shown .
Thus there can be no loss or termination of rights unless actual damage is proven .
Many imposter laws were repealed as a result of this case .
It is Almost Unfair !
This trial made such an impact that every colony but one established the jury as the first liberty to maintain all other liberties .
It was felt that the liberties of people could never be wholly lost as long as the jury remained strong and independent , and that unjust laws and statutes could not stand when confronted by conscientious JURORS .
JURORS today face an avalanche of imposter laws .
JURORS not only still have the power and the RIGHT , but also the DUTY , to nullify bad laws by voting " not guilty " .
At first glance it appears that it is almost unfair , the power JURORS have over government , but necessary when considering the historical track record of oppression that governments have wielded over private citizens .
Jefferson 's Warnings !
In 1789 Thomas Jefferson warned that the judiciary if given too much power might ruin our REPUBLIC , and destroy our RIGHTS !
" The new Constitution has secured these [ individual rights ] in the Executive and Legislative departments ; but not in the Judiciary .
It should have established trials by the people themselves , that is to say , by jury . " ( emphasis added )
The Judiciary of the United States is the subtle corps of sappers and miners constantly working under ground to undermine the foundations of our confederated fabric .. " ( 1820 )
" ... the Federal Judiciary ; an irresponsible body ( for impeachment is scarcely a scarecrow ) , working like gravity by night and by day , gaining a little to - day and a little tomorrow , and advancing its noiseless step like a thief , over the field of jurisdiction , until all shall be usurped from the States , and the government of all be consolidated into one .... when all government ... in little as in great things , shall be drawn to Washington as the centre of all power , it will render powerless the checks provided of one government on another and will become as venal and oppressive as the government which we seperated .
1821 ( emphasis added )
" The opinion which gives to the judges the right to decide what laws are constitutional and what not , not only for themselves in their own sphere of action , but for the legislative and executive also in their spheres , would make the judiciary a despotic branch . "
" ... judges shold be withdrawn from the bench whose erroneous biases are leading us to dissolution .
It may , indeed , injure them in fame or fortune , but it saves the Republic ... "

TOM BACHTELL
The Red Sox and the Colorado Rockies wrap up their World Series this week , at last delivering a winner at the end of a season of spectacular losses in baseball .
The art of losing is n’t hard to master , as Elizabeth Bishop told us , and for stretches in the late going this year it seemed as if the teams and the players were only out there to illuminate the maxim .
In the divisional playoffs , the first round of the postseason , the Cubs , the Phillies , and the Angels all went down in the minimum three straight games , while the Yankees struggled to a lone win against the Cleveland Indians and then disappeared , losing their adulated long - term manager , Joe Torre , in consequence .
The Mets , viewed for a time as the best team in either league , contrived to lose twelve out of their last seventeen games on the schedule — a feat unmatched and unimagined in the pastime — and lost first place in their division to the Phillies on the final day of the season and , with it , a place in the playoffs .
Elsewhere , the San Diego Padres , one strike short of attaining their own post - season slot , instead surrendered a game - tying triple to Tony Gwynn , Jr. , a Milwaukee Brewers rookie , and eventually saw the game and ( after a one - game playoff ) their hopes slip away .
A week before , Padres manager Bud Black , while attempting to pull Milton Bradley ( the outfielder , not the Parcheesi board ) away from an argument with first - base umpire Mike Winters , inadvertently threw him to the ground and lost him for the rest of the year with a torn ACL .
Baseball will stick it to you ; it means to break your heart , and though old fans do understand that it ’s losing , in all its variety , that makes winning so sweet , the departure of Joe Torre is something else altogether .
Gone after twelve years at the helm of the Yankees , the longest uninterrupted run since Casey Stengel ’s 1949 - 60 tenure , Torre was victim of a corporate midfield takedown : the decision by the owner , George Steinbrenner , and his nepotic front office not to renew — or not acceptably renew — his contract , after the team ’s failure to progress beyond the first round of post - season play in the past three Octobers .
Torre ’s first Yankee team captured a thrilling World Championship in 1996 , and three more between 1998 and 2000 , at one stretch winning fourteen consecutive Series games .
His teams also attained the post - season in each of his dozen years in the Bronx : a far greater achievement , all in all , in an era when the distribution of player talent and the intensity of team competition have been upgraded by a luxury tax imposed on the richest teams , starting , of course , with the Yanks .
The Colorado Rockies are the ninth team to represent the National League in the World Series in the past decade , and seven teams have emerged as World Champions in the same period ; so far ( unless the Red Sox prevail ) , the Yankees have been the only multiple winner .
Quite a performance , but not nearly good enough for those on the Steinbrenner side of the room , where , as has long been understood , only another World Championship is acceptable in the end .
What has set apart the Torre era is not just winning but a sense of attachment and identification that he effortlessly inspired among the fans and the players and the millions of sports bystanders .
Already known by the fans as a strong - swinging Brooklyn - born catcher ( and , later , a third baseman ) with an eighteen - year career with the Braves , the Cardinals , and the Mets , and then for his long tenure as a semi- distinguished manager of the same three teams , he became a sudden celebrity , a Page Six sweetheart , in his first season with the Yankees , when his brother Frank Torre , another former major leaguer , underwent successful heart - replacement surgery the day before the last game of the World Series .
The fourth game , in which the Yankees , trailing the Braves by 2–1 in the Series and 6–0 on the scoreboard , came back to win in extra innings , beginning their rush to the championship , changed New York to a Yankee town overnight .
Torre ’s composure and steadiness in hard times became as familiar as his odd , tilting trudge from the dugout to the mound to call in a fresh pitcher .
A habitual modesty interwoven with an awareness of the difficult daily grind powerfully secured him to his players .
Whenever someone brought up the batting title and National League M.V.P. award he had captured in 1971 with a .363 average , he threw in a reminder about his .289 mark the following year .
Mid-July often brought on a retelling of a game of his as a Mets third baseman in 1975 , when he batted into four double plays and also committed an error .
This ease with himself and his profession set the tone in his pre-game and post - game press conferences , delivered every day to thirty or forty writers , plus TV and radio and Japan .
Again and again in his long run , Torre would be asked by the writers about some slumping or hurting Yankee player , and he gave back just about the same magical reply .
Pressed in late August this year about the veteran Yankee starter Mike Mussina , whose lost mastery had just cost him his place in the starting rotation , Joe said , “ Yes , he ’s not maybe as proud of his stuff as he ’d like to be . ”
A silence followed , while the reporters saw the crisis afresh from the mind of the player .
A month later , Mussina said , “ I ’d play for the guy anytime . ”
The Yankees lost their divisional to the Indians because Chien - Ming Wang , their ace and the starter in the first and fourth games , could n’t get his sinkerball working .
In the second game , their brilliant rookie setup pitcher , Joba Chamberlain , defending a 1–0 Yankee lead in the eighth , was assailed by a mating swarm of midges on the mound at Cleveland ’s Jacobs Field and gave up the tying run on a wild pitch .
The Indians played on , midges or no midges , and won in the eleventh .
That was about it .
The shock of Torre ’s departure will not soon go away , but of course we should have known how it would play out .
Only the owners , down in Tampa , seemed startled ( at times , anyway ) by his decision , but if they knew anything about him how could they not have known what would follow ?
Is it possible that they have no sense of the calamity to the franchise and to the fans and to baseball itself that the departure of Joe Torre from New York represents ?
He , at last , supplied the touch of class , the Augustan presence , that the Yankees had so insistently proclaimed for themselves and have now thrown away .
For Torre , it was still about the players .
Meeting the press at the Stadium after the third divisional game , the last victory of his regime , he said , “ Every time we go to the post - season , there ’s nothing that ’s going to satisfy anybody unless you win the World Series .
And that ’s very difficult .
. . .
I understand the requirements here , but the players are human beings , and it ’s not machinery here .
Even though they get paid a lot of money , it ’s still blood that runs through their veins . ”
There was a little more in this tenor and then he brightened : “ For a guy that never got to the post - season as a player , I ’m having a hell of a lot of fun when you look back on the whole thing . ” ♦

EARLIER this month , the Senate Intelligence Committee and the White House agreed to allow the executive branch to conduct dragnet interceptions of the electronic communications of people in the United States .
They also agreed to “ immunize ” American telephone companies from lawsuits charging that after 9/11 some companies collaborated with the government to violate the Constitution and existing federal law .
I am a plaintiff in one of those lawsuits , and I hope Congress thinks carefully before denying me , and millions of other Americans , our day in court .
During my lifetime , there has been a sea change in the way that politically active Americans view their relationship with government .
In 1920 , during my youth , I recall the Palmer raids in which more than 10,000 people were rounded up , most because they were members of particular labor unions or belonged to groups that advocated change in American domestic or foreign policy .
Unrestrained surveillance was used to further the investigations leading to these detentions , and the Bureau of Investigation — the forerunner to the F.B.I. — eventually created a database on the activities of individuals .
This activity continued through the Red Scare of the period .
In the 1950s , during the sad period known as the McCarthy era , one ’s political beliefs again served as a rationale for government monitoring .
Individual corporations and entire industries were coerced by government leaders into informing on individuals and barring their ability to earn a living .
I was among those blacklisted for my political beliefs .
My crime ?
I had signed petitions .
Lots of them .
I had signed on in opposition to Jim Crow laws and poll taxes and in favor of rent control and pacifism .
Because the petitions were thought to be Communist - inspired , I lost my ability to work in television and radio after refusing to say that I had been “ duped ” into signing my name to these causes .
Nicholas Handler , is a junior at Yale University majoring in history .
Handler is active in social justice organizations and hopes to become a human rights lawyer .
I never expected to gain any new insight into the nature of my generation , or the changing landscape of American colleges , in Lit Theory .
Lit
Theory is supposed to be the class where you sit at the back of the room with every other jaded sophomore wearing skinny jeans , thick - framed glasses , an ironic tee - shirt and over - sized retro headphones , just waiting for lecture to be over so you can light up a Turkish Gold and walk to lunch while listening to Wilco .
That ’s pretty much the way I spent the course , too : through structuralism , formalism , gender theory , and post - colonialism , I was far too busy shuffling through my iPod to see what the patriarchal world order of capitalist oppression had to do with Ethan Frome .
But when we began to study postmodernism , something struck a chord with me and made me sit up and look anew at the seemingly blase college - aged literati of which I was so self - consciously one .
According to my textbook , the problem with defining postmodernism is that it ’s impossible .
The difficulty is that it is so …. post .
It defines itself so negatively against what came before it– naturalism , romanticism and the wild revolution of modernism –that it ’s sometimes hard to see what it actually is .
It denies that anything can be explained neatly or even at all .
It is parodic , detached , strange , and sometimes menacing to traditionalists who do not understand it .
Although it arose in the post - war west ( the term was coined in 1949 ) , the generation that has witnessed its ascendance has yet to come up with an explanation of what postmodern attitudes mean for the future of culture or society .
The subject intrigued me because , in a class otherwise consumed by dead - letter theories , postmodernism remained an open book , tempting to the young and curious .
But it also intrigued me because the question of what postmodernism –what a movement so post - everything , so reticent to define itself –is spoke to a larger question about the political and popular culture of today , of the other jaded sophomores sitting around me who had grown up in a postmodern world .
In many ways , as a college - aged generation , we are also extremely post : post - Cold War , post - industrial , post - baby boom , post - 9/11 … at one point in his famous essay , “ Postmodernism , or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism , ” literary critic Frederic Jameson even calls us “ post - literate . ”
We are a generation that is riding on the tail - end of a century of war and revolution that toppled civilizations , overturned repressive social orders , and left us with more privilege and opportunity than any other society in history .
Ours could be an era to accomplish anything .
And yet do we take to the streets and the airwaves and say ‘ here we are , and this is what we demand ’ ?
Do we plant our flag of youthful rebellion on the mall in Washington and say ‘ we are not leaving until we see change !
Our eyes have been opened by our education and our conception of what is possible has been expanded by our privilege and we demand a better world because it is our right ’?
It would seem we do the opposite .
We go to war without so much as questioning the rationale , we sign away our civil liberties , we say nothing when the Supreme Court uses Brown v. Board of Education to outlaw desegregation , and we sit back to watch the carnage on the evening news .
On campus , we sign petitions , join organizations , put our names on mailing lists , make small - money contributions , volunteer a spare hour to tutor , and sport an entire wardrobe ’s worth of Live Strong bracelets advertising our moderately priced opposition to everything from breast cancer to global warming .
But what do we really stand for ?
Like a true postmodern generation we refuse to weave together an overarching narrative to our own political consciousness , to present a cast of inspirational or revolutionary characters on our public stage , or to define a specific philosophy .
We are a story seemingly without direction or theme , structure or meaning –a generation defined negatively against what came before us .
When Al Gore once said “ It ’s the combination of narcissism and nihilism that really defines postmodernism , ” he might as well have been echoing his entire generation ’s critique of our own .
We are a generation for whom even revolution seems trite , and therefore as fair a target for bland imitation as anything else .
We are the generation of the Che Geuvera tee - shirt .
Jameson calls it “ Pastiche ” –“ the wearing of a linguistic mask , speech in a dead language . ”
In literature , this means an author speaking in a style that is not his own– borrowing a voice and continuing to use it until the words lose all meaning and the chaos that is real life sets in .
It is an imitation of an imitation , something that has been re-envisioned so many times the original model is no longer relevant or recognizable .
It is mass - produced individualism , anticipated revolution .
It is why postmodernism lacks cohesion , why it seems to lack purpose or direction .
For us , the post - everything generation , pastiche is the use and reuse of the old cliches of social change and moral outrage–a perfunctory rebelliousness that has culminated in the age of rapidly multiplying non-profits and relief funds .
We live our lives in masks and speak our minds in a dead language – the language of a society that expects us to agitate because that ’s what young people do .
But how do we rebel against a generation that is expecting , anticipating , nostalgic for revolution ?
How do we rebel against parents that sometimes seem to want revolution more than we do ?
We do n’t .
We rebel by not rebelling .
We wear the defunct masks of protest and moral outrage , but the real energy in campus activism is on the internet , with websites like moveon.org .
It is in the rapidly developing ability to communicate ideas and frustration in chatrooms instead of on the streets , and channel them into nationwide projects striving earnestly for moderate and peaceful change : we are the generation of Students Taking Action Now Darfur ; we are the Rock the Vote generation ; the generation of letter - writing campaigns and public interest lobbies ; the alternative energy generation .
College as America once knew it–as an incubator of radical social change– is coming to an end .
To our generation the word ‘ radicalism ’ evokes images of al Qaeda , not the Weathermen .
‘ Campus takeover ’ sounds more like Virginia Tech in 2007 than Columbia University in 1968 .
Such phrases are a dead language to us .
They are vocabulary from another era that does not reflect the realities of today .
However , the technological revolution , the moveon.org revolution , the revolution of the organization kid , is just as real and just as profound as the revolution of the 1960 ’s– it is just not as visible .
It is a work in progress , but it is there .
Perhaps when our parents finally stop pointing out the things that we are not , the stories that we do not write , they will see the threads of our narrative begin to come together ; they will see that behind our pastiche , the post generation speaks in a language that does make sense .
We are writing a revolution .
We are just putting it in our own words .
For Immediate Release - November 28 , 2007 ( TORONTO ) - Pedophilia might be the result of faulty connections in the brain , according to new research released by the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health ( CAMH ) .
The study used MRIs and a sophisticated computer analysis technique to compare a group of pedophiles with a group of non-sexual criminals .
The pedophiles had significantly less of a substance called " white matter " which is responsible for wiring the different parts of the brain together .
The study , published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research , challenges the commonly held belief that pedophilia is brought on by childhood trauma or abuse .
This finding is the strongest evidence yet that pedophilia is instead the result of a problem in brain development .
Previous research from this team has strongly hinted that the key to understanding pedophilia might be in how the brain develops .
Pedophiles have lower IQs , are three times more likely to be left - handed , and even tend to be physically shorter than non-pedophiles .
" There is nothing in this research that says pedophiles should n't be held criminally responsible for their actions , " said Dr. James Cantor , CAMH Psychologist and lead scientist of the study , " Not being able to choose your sexual interests does n't mean you can't choose what you do . "
This discovery suggests that much more research attention should be paid to how the brain governs sexual interests .
Such information could potentially yield strategies for preventing the development of pedophilia .
A total of 127 men participated in the study ; approximately equal numbers of pedophiles and non-sexual offenders .
The Kurt Freund Laboratory at CAMH was established in 1968 and remains one of the world 's foremost centres for the research and diagnosis of pedophilia and other sexual disorders .

The security contracts awarded to Blackwater USA in Iraq were done so for primarily political reasons , Senator Jim Webb of Virginia told Joe Scarborogh today on MSNBC 's Morning Joe .
In an extensive discussion about US foreign policy , Webb brought up the controversy over Blackwater 's actions in Iraq and the attempt by congress to bring them under US law .
" With respect to Blackwater , we 've allowed mercenaries to actually conduct combat operations , and we 've never done this before , " Webb said .
" And they 're doing this with no legal structiure over them . "
There are also no international agreements that govern the handling of mercanries , Webb said , and it now up to the Congress to decide how best to deal with them , Webb said .
" But the other piece of it , let 's be honest about it , a lot of the contracts , under this quasi military functions have been awarded for political reasons , and Blackwater is a really good example of that , " Webb added .
" That 's something like half a billion out of their nearly billion dollar contracts were awarded without proper competition , according to the house committee report last year . "

ROUGH TRANSCRIPT ( via Closed - Captions )
iraq and other foreign policy issues , we were basically up a c senator johnson was ill and then we are now a 50 - 50 tie trying to get stuff through .
Foreign policy is gintrinsically and that was alluded to before .
We 've been able to hold here and able to push this a little bit , but we have an administration that wo n't talk to people .( sx we had hearings week on this situation in myanmar .
I was in myanmar as a private citizen in '01 .
You could see , quite frankly , that the sanctions that were put into place were working against the ability of the people in myanmar to become a 3o part of the upside world and then we see these blowups like we had last week , and we become very frustrated about the immediate incident , but we forget how to affect the long - term goals that we have .
You can only do that through the right kinds of relationships and these people have n't been talking to the people they disagree with .
Including iran and syria .
: let 's apply that same question to iran .
I d?p know if you saw the mario cuomo piece over the weekend .
: no .
Hillary clinton go before congress to ask for a declaration of war before any military action against iran or other nations .
He says you 're missing the mark .
He says that you should go further and not fund any action without a proper declaration of war .
That this legislation would probably be another failed democratic effort reminding voters that democrats have not been as effective as they promised they would be .- t4 ~ kind of harsh , but is it true and where do we go with iran then ?
: well , I did n't see his piece , so it 's a little difficult for me to respond to specifics , but the intention of the amendment that I offered in march was exactly to say that .
It was to say that you could not fund any actions inside iran , other than ppursuit or preemptive strikes .
" tpgjupen in the region focusing down order to resolve the problem .
And33|x we 're in a situation where potentially are going to widen the nature of the conflict , and , n, a| if that happens , congress has to get involved .
: I think this is just a hole .
We had never anticipated in our history that we would have such a wide set of responsibilities for these quasi military units , and they do n't want iraqi law to apply because of all the reasons that you were talking about , joe , that you do n't know how this fledgling government is going to handle americans .
Like the status of forces agreements that were in countries particularly in asia with american -- regular american troops .
And then we can't put them under the ucmj because they should n't be there .
They 're not military people and it takes a crisis for people to start reacting to this .
But the other piece of it , let 's be honest about it , a lot of the contracts , under this quasi military functions have been awarded for political reasons .
And blackwater is a really good example of that .
That 's something like half a billion out of their nearly billion dollar contracts were awarded without proper competition , according to the house committee report last year .
: wow .
: so it 's a situation2f that I do n't think we fully appreciate it or anticipated and it really begs for some -- not only for some oversight , but we need to get these mercenary units out of combat .
: and what happens when they get out of combat ?
I guess here 's my question .
My point earlier was that don rumsfeld thought he'd win this war on theaes{{ cheap .
What you 're suggesting though if they decide to } 'i give them the troops that they asked for at the beginning of the war , we'd be in this position that we 're in now .
: well , i said what happened , you can't put this on the I think a big part of this is the administration was worried .
You can see a whole series of issues that they ducked before this authorization to go to war .
I think that if they had put the same focus on the ramifications out there in a visible they probably would n't have gotten the resolution to go to war .
Including by the way , the north korea -- we found out they had nukes .
Like a week before the authorization vote .
So I think the administration was holding back onq : k some realities that most military planners could have told you about .
And here we are , suffering the consequences .
But I think we have to get these people out of the line of fire .
There are 180,000 private contractors in iraq right now and 160,000 troops .
I heard your comment earlier about , well , you know , the size of the troops , you have to have the ancillary forces .
I think when you listen to admiral allen -- admiral fallen , instead of asx petraeus , it 's not the number ofiwl troops in iraq , but what you have them do .
We have to take a hard look at what they 're doing .
: sometimes it takes something like this to focus americans .
And i'm sure the focus is going to be there .
You 're right , if we fight these type of wars , we need to fight these wars with men and women that live and breathe under military codes and mika talks about talking of the moral code by which they conduct their operation operations .
: it affects the way that iraqis look at americans because itp00 spills over into our military people .
: thank you so much for being with us .
Greatly appreciate it .
Mika ?
: we appreciate you coming on .
We 'd like to have you back .
: all right .
Thanks so much .
There you go .
You said you needed somebody that knew more than I did .
To come on .
Well , we just found him .
: i'm not going to pick on you anymore . , , .. , , .. , , .. , , ..
Blanchett play bob dylan , I guess investors do n't flock to it .
: not the way we want to see cate blanchett , I guess .
: but i've heard it 's wonderful .
: see you next week .
Take care .
: bye , everyone .
: all right .
October 1 , 2007
In June , Congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) promised that his congressional committee would hold new 9 - 11 hearings " sometime in September . "
These hearings were to focus on specific narrow aspects of 9 - 11 which , incredibly , have never been properly looked into , such as the unprecedented short - selling of airline stocks just prior to September 11 , 2001 .
These hearings have now been postponed until further notice .
" It 's not going to happen in 2007 , " says a spokesperson for the House Subcommittee on Domestic Policy , which Kucinich chairs .
But Natalie Laber , Kucinich 's press representative , notes that while " nothing scheduled right now , " the hearings are not dead or off the table .
" We announce the schedule two weeks in advance , " says Laber , who adds that it 's better to contact them directly for scheduling updates than the committee itself , since committee assistants do not always have the most up - to - date information .
Pressed for an update this week , Kucinich said in a video posted on www.911blogger.com from Student Scholars for 911 Truth , " I have a small committee which is gathering information from various sources .
We 're trying to refine exactly where we 're going to take it .
I 'd like to ask some questions .
I feel that the American people deserve that .
Do I think that the 9 - 11 investigation ought to be reopened ?
Absolutely . "
But Kucinich would not offer a time frame .

Facebook WASHINGTON 
More than 15,000 people have appealed to the government since February to have their names removed from the terrorist watch list that delayed their travel at U.S. airports and border crossings , the Homeland Security Department says .
TERROR WATCH : List swells to more than 755,000
The complaints have created such a backlog that members of Congress are calling for a speedier appeal system that would help innocent people clear their names so they wo n't fall under future suspicion .
Among those who have been flagged at checkpoints : toddlers and senior citizens with the same names as suspected terrorists on the watch list .
" To leave individuals in this purgatory is un-American , " says Rep. Yvette Clarke , D - N.Y. , who says she 'll introduce legislation to try to streamline the process .
The Homeland Security Department says it gets about 2,000 requests a month from people who want to have their names cleared .
That number is so high that the department has been unable to meet its goal of resolving cases in 30 days , says Christopher White , spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration , which handles the appeals .
He says the TSA takes about 44 days to process a complaint .
In February , the TSA launched the Traveler Redress Inquiry Program , a one - stop shop for people to appeal links to the watch list , which flags anyone with potential ties to terrorism .
The list has more than 750,000 names .
House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson , D - Miss. , says he will grill officials at a hearing on Thursday .
" Given the widespread use of the terrorist watch list , the redress process is of paramount importance , " he says .
John Anderson of Minneapolis , who turned 6 on July 4 , is among those who have been inconvenienced .
He was first stopped at Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport in 2004 , when his family took him for his first airplane ride to Disney World .
" We checked in at the ticket counter , and the woman said in a stern voice , ' Who is John Anderson ? ' " says his mother , Christine Anderson .
" I pointed to my stroller . "
Her son is allowed to fly .
But because his name is flagged , his family cannot print out a boarding pass for him online and he must check in at the ticket counter so an airline official can see that he 's a child .
Christine Anderson says she has tried repeatedly to get her child 's name cleared , but she can't find the right forms on the TSA website and none have come in the mail after officials promised to send them .
" No one can give any answers to why my son is on the list or really how to get him off , " she says .
White says many names will be cleared when the government begins requiring air travelers to provide their birth date .
The government wo n't start collecting that information until next year , he says .

Over the years journalism has been tainted with the creation of tabloid news , but when it comes to mainstream media , we the viewing public should demand better coming from paid journalists .
Then again , in this anything goes society one has to wonder if society really cares or do we drink it all in like some sick soap opera ?
As an unpaid journalist , even I know that one of the primary rules or ethics of journalism is not to create the story , but let the story unfold in front of you and then report on it .
Rule number two is not to interject oneself into the story , but be an unbiased reporter .
If one cannot abide by those simple rules , one has no business being in the media .
If one is deserving of my new ‘ Smarmy Award ’ , this new award goes to MSNBC’s , Tucker Carlson and rightfully so .
The reason for the creation of this award is upon reading this article , Tucker Carlson Brings Prostitutes to Meet Ron Paul .
I first want to say that prostitutes are more principled than Tucker Carlson for this primary reason ; one knows what they are getting upfront before one is provided with their services .
Carlson on the other hand dealt the American people a blow and more importantly Congressman , Ron Paul .
I say that since we have serious problems to solve in this country and abroad and Congressman Ron Paul is trying to convey a message as to how he would solve them .
In reading this article , they cite that the AP reported that Paul “ picked up ” the endorsement of a brothel owner , Dennis Hof .
But , that in itself is erroneous since Paul never solicited any endorsement from Hof .
Point in fact is what was relayed in this article , “ In actuality , it was a member of the media , MSNBC ’s Tucker Carlson , who had done the soliciting .
Carlson not only contacted
Hof to ask him to check out Ron Paul while Paul was in Nevada , but he even arrived at Ron Paul ’s Reno news conference in the company of Hof and two of Hof ’s prostitutes . ”
As we all know , Carlson is married with four children and one has to wonder :
Why is he hanging around a brothel owner let alone prostitutes ?
Where are his conservative values ?
I am serious when I say this : MSNBC should throw him off the air .
No this is not a freedom of speech case or where a racist remark was made ; he clearly violated the ethics of journalism and embarrassed MSNBC that is if they have morals .
More importantly , I do feel he did this to embarrass Ron Paul and create a controversy to surround him .
If anyone owes an apology to a candidate , the viewing public and the American people in general it is Carlson .
As this article rightfully points out was a message coming from the Paul campaign , " On a personal basis , he does n't condone those things .
At the same time , from his campaign perspective , it ’s not the role of federal government and it's not in the Constitution for federal government to regulate these things . "
The article continues on to state , “ That of course is correct , and in Nevada prostitution is legal in 12 of the state ’s 17 counties , including the county where Dennis Hof ’s brothel is located . ”
But this is lost in the AP report in which the voting public will not know that in certain communities such as Las Vegas , prostitution is legal .
All they will know is that a brothel owner has endorsed Ron Paul and that is not telling the full story .
The AP should have also reported this stunt created by Tucker Carlson in order to be fair and balanced .
Paul who is widely known to be an anti-war candidate a maverick of sorts within the Republican Party is trying to convey a message especially when we are fast approaching 4,000 soldiers ’ dead .
And for Tucker Carlson to pull this stunt , I feel he owes the family members who have lost loved ones over in Iraq an apology as well .
Politics should be dealt with seriously especially when men and women are dying overseas .
It should be dealt with seriously when one million innocent Iraqis have died and let it be known that Ron Paul voted no to this heinous war .
As this article rightfully points out , this is part and parcel of the anti-Paul media especially when Paul does not have skeletons in his closet as other politicians do .
So , hence they along with Carlson created said skeleton .
That is unfair to all of those people who have been working day in and day out to support the Paul campaign .
This past weekend , I met a wonderful man named Tom who gave what he could financially to the Ron Paul campaign .
While I have not been excited concerning this presidential campaign , when one mentions Ron Paul , one can see the sparkle coming from Tom .
How I wish I had that inner spirit as he does .
To create this controversy is especially unfair to the American people who are hurting at this point as one looks at the mortgage crisis .
As reported by the NY Times , “ RealtyTrac expects foreclosure filings to hit two million in 2007 , or roughly one per 62 American households — a rate approaching heights not seen since the Great Depression . ”
While there has been no urgency to deal with this crisis , the NY Times did report that these foreclosures are “ drawing the attention of Democratic presidential candidates , including John Edwards and Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio . ”
The Times also reported this of Pres .
Bush that , " he ruled out a federal bailout , citing both “ excesses in the lending industry ” and unduly optimistic homeowners who took out “ loans larger than they could afford , ” as reasons for the mortgage woes . "
Meanwhile , he can spend billions upon billions to fund a war in Iraq .
These are the problems that are elusive to Carlson in pulling a stunt like that .
This is where we need serious journalists who are not creating the news , but reporting it .
At the end of this article it cites , “ Let MSNBC know how you feel about their employees visiting brothels at - letters@msnbc.com ” I would go one better since emails can be deleted upon receipt is to call MSNBC at this number , ( 201 ) 583-5000 .
Tell them that you do not appreciate their employee , namely Carlson playing games with America ’s future .
Demand they either have him apologize for this stunt on - air or that they fire him .
I just did .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A 2004 crash that killed everyone on board -- three crew members and three U.S. troops -- was caused by pilots from a Blackwater plane taking a low - level run through a mountain canyon in Afghanistan , testimony revealed Tuesday .
A twin-engine CASA C - 212 , similar to the plane pictured , crashed in 2004 , killing all six on board .
" I swear to God , they would n't pay me if they knew how much fun this was , " the doomed plane 's cockpit voice recorder captured the pilot saying shortly before the November 27 , 2004 , crash .
The account of the crash emerged during a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on Blackwater 's performance in Iraq and Afghanistan .
In its November 2006 report on the crash , the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that Blackwater provided insufficient oversight and guidance of the pilots involved in the 2004 crash .
Dispatchers failed to ensure that pilots followed their flight plan and did not adequately track flights in the air .
The NTSB said the military " did not provide adequate oversight of the contract carrier 's operations in Afghanistan . "
The company 's chairman , Erik Prince , appeared before the committee to defend the firm Tuesday .
The twin -engine CASA C - 212 , a light cargo plane operated by Blackwater sister company Presidential Airways , crashed in a box canyon well off its planned route from Bagram Air Base to the western Afghan town of Shindand .
" You 're an X - wing fighter Star Wars man , " an NTSB report quoted the plane 's co-pilot , Loren Hammer , saying during the flight -- a reference to the dizzying battle in the 1977 film .
" You 're [ expletive ] right .
This is fun , " the pilot , Noel English , responded .
About eight minutes later , the plane slammed into the wall of the canyon , which was flanked by ridgelines that rose nearly a mile above surrounding terrain .
When rescuers found the wreckage three days later , they discovered one of the passengers had survived the crash only to die of internal bleeding and exposure , the NTSB found .
When an unidentified passenger asked about the plane 's route before the crash , flight mechanic Melvin Rowe told him , " I do n't know what we 're gonna see .
We do n't normally go this route . "
English added , " All we want is to avoid seeing rock at 12 o'clock . "
English and Hammer had been in Afghanistan less than two weeks , the NTSB found .
Federal investigators found each should have been paired with a more experienced aviator , according to Rep. Henry Waxman , D - California .
Waxman is chairman of the oversight committee , which is investigating Blackwater 's performance on more than $ 1 billion in U.S. government contracts since 2001 .
He said a company e-mail stated the company had overlooked experience requirements " in favor of getting the requisite number of personnel on board to start up the contract . "
" The corporation hired inexperienced pilots .
They sent them on a route they did n't know about , " Waxman said .
" It seems to me that it 's more than pilot error .
There ought to be corporate responsibility , and Blackwater was the corporation involved . "
Prince said investigators concluded the crash in Afghanistan was not due to corporate error , but pilot error .
He rejected Waxman 's contention that the pilots " acted like cowboys . "
" We provided thousands and thousands of flight hours of arrival service since then , " Prince said .
" Today , still , we 're flying more than a thousand missions a month . "
Passengers on the flight included Lt. Col. Michael McMahon , the commander of a Hawaii - based Army aviation battalion ; and two members of his unit , Chief Warrant Officer Travis Grogan , and Spc. Harley Miller .
In a letter read to the committee , McMahon 's widow , Col. Jeannette McMahon , wrote the accident was the result of a " gross lack of judgment in managing this company . "
Her husband 's unit had a great safety record , she wrote : " It 's ironic and unfortunate that he had to be a passenger on this plane versus one of the people responsible for its safe operation . "
The families of the passengers have filed suit against Presidential Airways and its related firms .
Blackwater 's effort to dismiss the case is before a federal appeals court in Atlanta , plaintiff 's lawyer Robert Spohrer said .
The company has come under scrutiny over its work in Iraq , where government officials accuse its contractors of killing as many as 20 civilians in a September clash in Baghdad .
The Defense Department hired Blackwater to fly cargo to sites in Afghanistan , where larger transports are unable to take off or land .
Prince described the job as " rugged , Alaska - style bush flying . "
And he said the military violated its own regulations by flying 400 pounds of 81 mm mortar rounds along with the passengers and gear .

About a quarter of people in England smoke
A poll of 3,100 young cinema - goers found ads before films that glamorise smoking made it more likely smokers would continue the habit .
But the study by Newcastle University also said it turned non-smokers against it , the Tobacco Control journal said .
Campaigners said smokers were " fed up " of being dictated to .
The anti-smoking advert , shot in the style of a movie trailer , was shown before films which glamorised smoking .
Over half of the 12 to 24 - year - olds who viewed a film , were shown the advert , while the rest were not .
I think people are getting really fed up being dictated to and treated like children
Neil Rafferty , of Forest
A fifth of those polled were smokers .
The study was designed to see the effect of the advert on future smoking behaviour .
It found that adverts had no positive impact in helping people give up - if anything were more likely to keep smokers smoking .
After the film , a quarter of smokers surveyed who did not see the advert said they were likely to be smoking in 12 months time .
This compared to 39 % who did see it .
In comparison , the number of non-smokers not intending to smoke after seeing the advert stood at 96 % , compared to 94 % of those who did not see it .
Lead researcher Dr Diane Bull said anti-smoking adverts could work .
But she warned : " Caution must be exercised in the type of advertisement screened as some types of advertising may reinforce smokers ' intentions to smoke . "
She also added there was mounting evidence to suggest young people are influenced by smoking in films by top actors .
It comes as advertising is playing an increasing part in the public health campaign to reduce the number of smokers in England .
' Counter - productive '
About a quarter of the population smoke but in recent years the government has run high - profile anti-smoking adverts on TV and cinema screens .
Health warnings have also been put on cigarette packets .
Neil Rafferty , of smokers ' lobby group Forest , said : " I think people are getting really fed up being dictated to and treated like children .
" Everyone knows tobacco is bad for your health , but the more extreme actions become , the more likely people are to react against it . "
But Amanda Sandford , of the anti-smoking campaign group Ash , said anti-smoking ads still had a role to play .
" Showing anti-tobacco ads prior to films containing smoking scenes has the potential to change youth perceptions about smoking , although as this study shows , care must be taken to ensure that such ads are not counter - productive . "

Washington $ 20.2 b boost in student aid approved Pell grant hike , interest rate cut goes to Bush WASHINGTON - Congress approved a $ 20.2 billion boost in financial aid for college students yesterday , a package that backers said would be the single largest increase in federal tuition funding since World War II .
The bill , which President Bush is expected to sign , raises the maximum Pell grant for low - income students from $ 4,050 to $ 5,400 , and temporarily slashes interest rates on student loans by half .
It also establishes debt - forgiveness programs for graduates who enter certain poorly paid fields such as law enforcement , firefighting , and teaching .
According to the Department of Education , the average student now graduates with $ 19,000 in debt .
The new aid would be funded by a massive cut in subsidies to the scandal - plagued private student loan industry .
Lenders said the cutbacks would cause some banks to stop offering student loans .
The president had threatened to veto an earlier version , but the White House indicated Thursday that Bush would sign the legislation .
With the first major increase in tuition grants in years seemingly assured , Massachusetts higher education officials were pleased .
" The increase in the Pell Grants is unprecedented in terms of its size , " said Richard Doherty , president of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts .
Roughly 75,000 students in Massachusetts received $ 198 million in Pell Grants in the current school year .
They will become eligible for another $ 28.7 million in September 2008 .
Under the legislation , Pell Grants will be increased gradually over the next five years .
The cut in the interest rate for student loans from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent will also be phased in , and will only apply to new loans .
Republicans were quick to point out yesterday that the rate will revert to the higher percentage after four years .
Senators approved the bill by a vote of 79 to 12 .
The final tally in the House was 292 to 97 .
Some education analysts downplayed the changes .
Shelley Steinbach , the former general counsel of the American Council on Education , rejected the comparison drawn by many Democrats yesterday to the 1944 GI Bill , which is credited with opening the doors of universities to millions of veterans after World War II .
" Increasing the Pell Grant from four - thousand something to five - thousand something by the year 2012 will not have a really significant impact , given the likelihood of inflationary costs in everything that goes into providing higher education , " he said .
The subsidy cut means companies such as Sallie Mae and Citigroup that lend to students will get a smaller " special allowance payment " from the federal government in exchange for offering the loans .
But the government will continue to guarantee those loans against default , which virtually guarantees a profit and which has been criticized by some Democrats as too generous .
Lenders said that Democrats were unfairly targeting the entire student loan industry after revelations that some companies gave kickbacks to school officials who touted their loans to students .
Peter Warren , vice president for government relations at the Education Finance Council , which represents private lenders , said that the subsidy cut would force some lenders to scale back .
" The stories that have been running in the media lately obviously have contributed to an environment that has been used politically to sort of cast a very broad net and indict all lenders , " he said One Nebraska - based lender , Nelnet Inc. , announced Thursday that it would lay off 400 employees in anticipation of the new rules .
Nelnet was one of the loan companies snared in a corruption investigation by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo .
It paid a $ 2 million settlement to the state of New York for making improper arrangements with college alumni associations to promote its loans .
In an interview Thursday , Senator Edward M. Kennedy , one of the authors of the legislation , dismissed the lenders ' concerns and said that the student loan business would remain profitable .
Kennedy pointed out that the $ 25 billion acquisition by a group of investors of Sallie Mae , the nation 's biggest private student loan provider , was going ahead despite the impending passage of the legislation .
" If this took so much from the lender , why would this be such a profitable deal ? " he said .
" There 's more than ample incentives for these lenders at the present time . "
Still , there was criticism from some Democrats that the legislation did not go far enough .
Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards released a statement calling for an end to subsidies to private lenders and said that all loans should be handled directly through the Department of Education .
Congressional Republicans expressed frustration with President Bush for endorsing the measure .
Representative Howard P. McKeon of California , the ranking Republican on the House Education Committee , said the bill amounted to an " entitlement program spending spree . "
Michael Dannenberg , director of the Education Policy Program at the New America Foundation , a think tank in Washington , said that by proposing his own cuts in lender subsidies in his February budget , Bush had undercut members of Congress in his own party .
" President Bush triangulated conservative Republicans .
He made common cause with the Democratic majority and proposed his own lender subsidy reduction as part of his budget , " Dannenberg said .
When the lending scandal exploded , he said , " congressional inaction became publicly unacceptable . "

The recent market turmoil is rocking investors around the globe .
But it is raising the stock of one person : a little - known economist whose views have suddenly become very popular .
Hyman Minsky , who died more than a decade ago , spent much of his career advancing the idea that financial systems are inherently susceptible to bouts of speculation that , if they last long enough , end in crises .
At a time when many economists were coming to believe in the efficiency of markets , Mr. Minsky was considered somewhat of a radical for ...
Origins of a Pronoun
In Old English , the nominative singular first person pronoun was ic .
The Oxford English Dictionary says that after the Norman conquest , the north of England retained this original pronoun in forms such as ic , icc , ig , hic , ik , yk , ike , and hyc .
Southern England , on the other hand , palatised it to create such forms as ich , hich , ych , yche , iche , ih , and ihc .
By the 14th century the north started to drop the velar plosive before consonants , giving the form i , and by the 15th century this was used in front of vowels too , along with the variant forms hi , j , e , y , Y , and I .
The south persisted with ich .
There 's a joke about this dialectal division between north and south in the Second Shepherds '
Play , the greatest of the Wakefield Cycle of mystery plays from the 15th century , wherein a northern thief called Mak tries to steal some sheep from shepherds Coll , Gyb , and Daw .
He attempts to affect a southern accent but fails to keep it consistent :
Mak
What !
ich be a yoman , I tell you , of the kyng ,
The self and the same , sond from a greatt lordyng ,
And sich .
Ffy on you !
Goyth hence
Out of my presence !
I must haue reuerence .
Why , who be ich ? [...]
Coll
Bot , Mak , is that sothe ?
Now take outt that sothren tothe ,
And sett in a torde !
There is evidence to suggest that this play was still being staged at least as late as 1520 , by which time you 'd 've thought that ich would 've been supplanted by I and the joke rendered opaque .
In fact , ich held on for a long time .
Shakespeare uses some southern dialectal variations in King Lear when he has Edgar say , " keepe out che vor 'ye , or ice try whither your Costard , or my Ballow be the harde ; chill be plaine with you " .
Edward Phillips describes it as " a Word us 'd for I in the Western Parts of England " as late as 1706 .
In his book on the dialect of the West Country in 1869 , James Jennings even records the word utchy being used for I in the south of Somerset , which he believes to be a corruption of the disyllabic iche .
Utchill for " I will " , as well as utchy , was heard by Prince L. L. Bonaparte in the same region in 1875 .
When the northern forms of the pronoun established themselves , squeezing ich into the obscure hinterlands of Somerset , capital I most of all became predominant .
But why this irregular form appeared at all is somewhat of a mystery .
Capital I was first used in the late 14th century , and co-existed with lowercase i and y until the middle of the 15th century , with the i being often dotless .
The dot on the minuscule i started to appear as a diacritic in Latin manuscripts of the 11th century to particularize a minim stroke as being a separate letter , especially in the case of - ii where it might be confused with - u .
Now the dot is taken to be an inherent part of the glyph .
One of the theories about the capital is that it represents the same kind of particularization , but the dot was already becoming available , and moreover even the absorption of the pronoun into surrounding words ( e.g. icham , ichill , ichot ) does n't put it in an ambiguous context .
As well as the co-existence problem , any theory of the capitalisation that somehow depends on i being too typographically insignificant or mistakable has to contend with the fact that John Wyclif 's Bible from 1388 uses uppercase Y for the pronoun in a medial setting .
Also relevant may be the fact that John Barbour 's 1375 poem The Bruce ( the first purely Scottish literary work ) , whose texts are from the 15th century , uses both Ic and Ik capitalised .
Charles Bigelow proposed in 1998 that the change may have been phonological in nature , reflecting the diphthongisation that occured changing ɪ to əɪ ( I to @I in X - SAMPA ) .
The original pronunciation is apparent in the enclitic absorption of the pronoun as a suffix in words such as haddy and hauy , i.e .
I had and I have , both of which were used by Chaucer in his Treatise on the Astrolabe .
But if Barbour 's Ic and Ik have to be taken into account , this theory is made unlikely .
Moreover , it would seem more natural to indicate diphthongisation by using an actual diphthong , as happens sometimes with Scots such as in " Aw was up at Allokirk the day , an ' div ye ken what the craiturs war sayin ' ? " from S.R. Crockett 's Stickit Minister of 1893 , though the diphthong is much less emphatic in Scots than English .
Another theory is that of ego .
Though it is without direct precedent , some languages do capitalise the second person pronoun .
In German , Sie and its declensions are capitalised , as are Lei and Loro in Italian , and occasionally U in Dutch .
These are all the formal versions of the second person pronoun .
In Polish , pronouns referring to a recipient are always capitalised , irregardless of grammatical person .
These are all the opposite of ego , of course , intended to flatter or show respect to the party being communicated with ; it'd be an interesting psychological idiom if English did the inverse , but the fact that it lost its informal second person pronoun somewhat negates that .
The theory of ego falls at the fact that the idiom of capitalisation did n't take hold on any of the other forms of the pronoun , even though as with Y , Ik , and Ic it did appear rarely .
Though they do n't stand up to inspection when taken individually , a combination of the theories could be the answer .
Some intangible mixture of aesthetics , convention , phonology , clarity , egotism , and a very loose orthography seem to have conspired in the period of English 's greatest upheaval to produce a form which appears natural today but makes as much etymological sense as the l in could or the b in debt .
Though we crave discrete atomic answers , language is driven by consensus and convention .
Even though there is no historical rationale for the capitalisation , we 're forced to retain it because of convention .
But as with all conventions , they can change rapidly and unpredictably , and such seems to have been the case with the first person singular pronoun .

In the beginning , there was the Waterfall model based on a world where everything is known in advance and specs do n't change ( i.e. a figment ) .
Users got something functional , just not what they wanted or needed by the time the software shipped .
Then came various spiral flavors : Iterative , Agile , XP .
Unlike waterfalls ( which run in one direction and do n't back up ) , spirals can produce software much more likely to match what users want .
Spirals support usability , and usability drives the need for spiral development .
But what comes after usability ?
And will new development approaches emerge to support it ?
So , I guess I 'm really asking two somewhat - related questions .
This is just a first crack very rough look for me , so please feel free to hack away , remix , rearrange , and add your own more credible ( or just as wild - ass as mine ) ideas .
After Usability comes Flow
" Thanks for giving me something useable , well - designed , and useful .
Now , can you make it as engaging as a game or sport ?
Can you keep me so immersed that time and all the clutter of daily existence drops away ?
Where I 'm under a spell that 's never broken by an intrusion from the software itself ?
Where the challenge is NOT in using the software , but in what I 'm using the software TO DO ? "
Even if users do n't start demanding Flow ... it 's a huge opportunity and advantage for those whose products support it .
( And one of the key attributes of products with passionate users )
To learn more about flow -- and I strongly encourage us all to make a study of it -- some resources include :
The original FLOW book
An excellent overview of flow theory by award - winning game designer Jenova Chen , including an enchanting , seductive game that implements a theory of flow .
Game design guy Raph Koster 's blog , and do n't forget his excellent book on A Theory of Fun .
And two of my earlier posts on this :
User Enchantment and Cognitive Seduction .
What about development models ?
I really have no idea .
People like Jonathan Kohl and Jason Gorman are talking about Post - Agilism , but there 's no agreement on what that looks like or even means .
Some see it as nothing more than the practical approach of taking the best of what works without being such a hard - core Agile zealot .
In other words , " agile " with a lower - case " a " rather than The Church of Agile .
And in this post I 'm really talking about the web - app world , not necessarily big corporate enterprise systems that do n't have the pressure the new class of web - apps ( or games ) have .
It 's the new web - app development that needs ultra - fast releases and near - instant responses to user needs ( not necessarily user requests ) .
Is there a Post - Agile model that works for this ?
Or is just faster , tighter iterations ?
Do we speed up the spirals or do we do something completely different ?
How does this fit with things like , say , the 37 Signals somewhat controversial Getting Real approach ?
I say " controversial " because some see it as nothing new at all , or worse - - a fly - by - the - seat thing that absolutely Does Not Scale , or ...
So , what do you think ?
( And if I were smarter than I actually am , I would have done this artwork more napkin - sketchesque so you 'd realize just how rough my thoughts are on this .
As if that was n't obvious ... )

For me , the difference you 're articulating is the difference between usability as a discipline and user - centered design as a philosophy .
Usability is a huge step in the right direction - but its practitioners tend to focus on measuring the completion of tasks .
What 's the metric for the user being in flow ?
It 's probably often related to time spent in the task or reuse / revisits ( assuming those are goals ) - but that does n't quite get it .
How do we capture that info without resorting to " tell us what you think " post - task surveys ?
The only way I know how to design for flow is to immerse myself in the user 's world to the extent I can bear and my clients can wait for .
The more I study and empathize with my users and their goals , the better I understand how to design for flow .
I 'm reminded of how I feel when I watch usability tests .
What 's important is n't the report afterward - percentage of tasks completed and whatnot .
It 's what I gain from watching and empathizing with the pain I 've inadvertently inflicted on the users with my assumptions , seeing in sharp relief the degree to which I 've inevitably embedded my own preferences and biases into the design .
So I 'd say usability has the tools to get us there , but the design team has to engage its own emotions in order to understand what they 're seeing and take appropriate action .
And there 's room for us to purposefully elicit and encourage that emotional connection with the users .
Another thought that occurs to me :
The best design ideas often come from people designing what they themselves want , right ?
That 's a shortcut way of ramping up passion .
Does anybody remember the book _ Descartes ' Error ? _
Fascinating study of brain injury and how emotions are required for good decisionmaking .

I think you 're moving from developers being distant from customers ( waterfall ) , to developers being close to customers and responsive to them ( agile ) , and the " flow " step is when customers become developers .
For this to work , you need to include features to allow non-technical customers to build parts of your application and share these with others .
Technical developers should produce the architecture that allows them to do this .

Great post !
I absolutely love your focus on flow .
I met Dr. Csikszentmihalyi a few times while at Claremont McKenna College ( taking a few courses at Claremont Graduate school where he teached ) and have been fascinated by flow ever since .
I 've been working hard to find the answer to your question about the development process necessary to capture flow in a web application .
Up to this point I can say that the only thing that really works for me is to do dozens of usability tests on almost every little feature .
This does n't mean calling people in from the streets .
I just call someone over from the other side of the room and pay very close attention to their body language as they use the application .
I can't say I 'm very good at it , but I think I am getting better .
You can see some of the fruits of my efforts in my two web apps :
CommunityWalk
WeddingMapper
My current belief is that you need to apply an 80/20 rule of sorts where you isolate 20 % of your app that is the most fundamental user experience and spend 80 % of the time trying to get it perfect .
In any case I think it is a very fundamental question to the future of web application ( maybe software in general ) development .

" Jonathan Kohl and Jason Gorman are talking about Post - Agilism , but there 's no agreement on what that looks like or even means . "
Let 's all find out together . :)
Jason and I both independently thought of the term " post- agilism " because we were afraid that the industry would stop innovating .
We both felt stuck in the " Agile " mode , and noticed others who had worked through the Agile movement , and then said : " That was fun .
Some things worked well , others not so well .
What 's next ? "
Post - agilism as I have witnessed it is like you mention , a reaction to dogmatic zealotry , like philisophical skepticism .
I 've also seen behavior towards processes that is like scientific skepticism , or falliblism , that seeks to question process claims through investigation and scrutiny .
That 's the " process skepticism " side .
" Does this process ' X ' , as one of many tools I can use help us reach our goals of satisfying and impressing the customer ?
If not , why ?
What can we try that might work better ? "
Jason and I are both hoping that the neologism " post- agilism " will help spur people to try out new ideas , and help create the new future of software development .
We have a long way to go before we can say we have arrived , and discovery and innovation are a lot of fun .
We can learn a lot from those who came before , including the Agilists .
Thanks for the link , and keep up the great posts .

To me this seems to be an internal business issue as opposed to a user centred design issue .
Whether or not your product / service meets user needs should not be dependent on what development model you use .
I 'd re-phrase ' Development models affect users ' to ' Users do n't care about development models ' .
Users just want to get things done .
I would advocate an approach where you * plan* to involve users both at the beginning , and a few times throughout , the development lifecycle .
Additionally , users should also be involved ' when it feels right ' .
I appreciate that ‘ when it feels right ’ is not very scientific , but if 5 people in a business are debating whether something is easy to use , or useful , or enjoyable , then it should ' feel right ' to involve users .
If these debates happen every 3 weeks , then get a small number of users in , observe them using the product / system , and iterate .
If the debates happen every week , then get a smaller number of users involved and iterate faster .
On Flow : Sometimes
Flow is important , sometimes not .
I do n’t think it should always be an aspiration for the development team .
If the user ’s goal is narrow and time sensitive e.g. to pay a bill online , then entering a state of Flow is arguably not a good thing :
" I lost track of time because I was having a whale of a time paying my bill online " .
:)
On the flipside , if the goal is broad e.g. ‘ book next year ’s holiday ’ or ‘ check out my friend ’s photos ’ , the state of Flow is indeed the ultimate user experience .

I want to slip something in beneath your base need Kathy .
Before functionality , it seems to me that we increasingly want speed of response / achievement - not in terms of completion but in terms of seeing progress - if there 's a time lag anywhere , we get frustrated .
If you do n't believe me , Bill Gates says as much in his Scoble show chat today when revealing that the key customer gripe with IP TV etc is the time it takes to change channels .
The function is there , it just does n't work fast enough .

For this to work , you need to include features to allow non-technical customers to build parts of your application and share these with others .
Technical developers should produce the architecture that allows them to do this .
If you 're talking about something like the Flickr API , then I 'd agree with your comment , but never make the mistake of thinking that the average end - user is going to want to do this as a regular part of their interactions with your application .
Posted by : fiat lux | Jan 8 , 2007 10:50:08 AM
I agree with an earlier comment that the most obvious way to go beyond " spiral " models is to have the actual users create the software .
The problem is that somewhere in the hierarchy of user needs is " effortlessness " .
Even a partial or inefficient solution that I can use right now without any extra work is probably better than an " optimal " one that makes me build my own software .
So that leaves us with sped - up spiral ( agile , post - agile , whatever ) in order to deal with a constant stream of user requests ( some of which will be wrong , but quickly rolled back in the next upgrade ) .
I think this model is unlikely to work except in areas where constant change is tolerable .
And do you really want a new version of Word , Outlook , or even Flickr every day or even every month ?
The best way to create flow in my opinion is to dedicate time learning the problem domain and environment of the users , and doing everything possible to create invisible happiness .
Invisible happiness is created when something just works without the user being aware that a " feature " is being used .
Like the way your web browser does a " redirect " automatically when necessary , or when your new radio auto - detects channels that are accessible .

A word on behalf of the poor waterfall : your list is a great exemplifier of why in some organizations ( like mine , here in the bowels of Oracle ) , waterfall is king .
For companies where product complexity means 18 - month development cycles , where each and every feature developed has half a dozen stakeholders with barely - overlapping needs , and where a missing , buggy or ill - conceived feature might cost you two to five years of 7 - figure sales deals , production really is king .
It may lead to exactly the type of Big Boring Business Software that you 're not generally talking about with your blog , but for some folks , the waterfall is sadly appropriate .
At the enterprise - level , spiral development is really just sequential waterfalls .
Your Maslow - esque functionality - to - flow spectrum is absolutely true , and with smaller development organizations , every effort should be made to be out there on the flow - focussed edge .
In some places , getting the coordinated functionality right is so hard that the best that smart people can achieve , sadly , is just making sure that the features are delivered correctly .
But if only more of them ( us ) would ask your sainted question : " How does this help our user ( s ) kick ass ? " ....

I 'd like to see the next development in lifecycle models not be " post agile " but " helping people implement agile . "
I do n't think the Church of Agile has yet done the necessary work to help actual businesses in the real world ( of larger size , geo - diversity , etc. ) learn how to agilate their organization .
I 'm a big fan of agile practices , or " acknowledging reality " as I like to call it .
But , for all the why - you - should - do - it and the what - it - looks - like - when - it 's - done , there 's not nearly enough here 's - how - you / we--do/did - it .
Unless
I 'm looking in the wrong place , there 's a lot more rhetoric and success stories about agile than there are tools for real businesses which might be big , messy and political .
Maybe it just wo n't work for them , in which case we do n't yet need post agility so much as we need agility 's bigger cousin .
Let 's slow the roll on the next wave until this one 's crested -- which I think it is far from doing .

Web - based applications have the advantage of " permananet beta " that has been so abused .
Why not offer user accounts on the test environment , but keep that test environment separate ?
Online multiplayer games have done this for some time - play on the " beta " server , and you get all the cool goodies before everyone else .
There 's just a chance your character will be deleted .
So , have Google Mail , then have Google Mail Beta ( which has new features almost daily , some of which make it and some of which do n't ) .
Posted by : Ben | Jan 8 , 2007 12:57:41 PM
A long while back , I heard a company promote the following analogy .
The original model has always been the waterfall .
The iterative spiral model was described as a " whirlpool " , in keeping with the water theme .
These folks suggested that the whirlpool would replaced with the " jacuzzi " model , which consists of lots of tiny whirlpools all over the place , each doing a tiny little part of the big job , even though it looks chaotic from a distance .

FYI -- I am currently in San Franciso at the MacWorld conference , so my online time is very sketchy .
I added a few comments here , but I 'm not sure how much I 'll be able to do in the next three days .
=======================
Thanks everyone for adding to this .
One thing that 's really confusing me is the relationship between flow and ultra - fast releases .
Are they orthogonal ?
Or in some cases incompatible ?
Or in some cases ( I suspect ) is the ultra - fast releases that help create flow -- given the right application , where cognitive seduction is enhanced incrementally with each new nano - release .
Jonathan :
Thanks so much for jumping in here .
I 'm glad you 're thinking about this ( and talking about it , and getting the rest of us to think and talk about it ) .
I especially appreciate that your goal is forward innovation more that it is about any one specific direction .
John : Good point --
I put appropriate response times in with usability , and certainly they 're an absolute prereq for flow .
So , yes , I agree that it does n't matter if the thing does what you want if the performance is so slow that it takes you out of the experience ( or even just gives you time to drift away ... )
I realize that performance is relative to the application -- latency in a midi application is deadly , and even tiny fractions of a second can degrade the experience .
On the other hand , a lot of us have gotten used to much greater lag times when bandwidth is the bottleneck ...

Agile is a risk aversion strategy .
you can't go too far off track if the iterations are frequent .
The customer wants to add a feature half way through , they also get to choose what should be dropped .
etc...
But over here at Passionate Users we like to talk about Death by Risk Aversion .
Can we iterate our way to innovation ?
Is an exercise in ass covering the way to kick ass ?

Nice stuff , Kathy .
Flow equals invisibility or transparency , where the tool simply disappears .
Beyond flow ( we should be so lucky ) comes anticipation .
I recognize how hard it is to make software and services that reflect this hierarchy , but should n't we expect more ?

Warning : Possibly feeling grumpy this morning :-)
But gosh - darn it I / so / hate the phrase " post- agile " since it 's meaning always seems to map on to " agile done right " as far as I 'm concerned .
Grump .
Moan . Etc .
I 'd also disagree that agile approaches are risk - aversion strategies .
They are risk management strategies - which means ( if done right ) they let you take / more / risks since you are more in control .
I know the agile teams ( and by " team " here I 'm including the customer ) I 've worked on are much more open to trying out ideas an experimenting since they 're doing it in a safe environment .

And thing that Adrian really hit the nail on the head with his remarks on the phrase " post- agile " and agile as risk - management rather than risk - aversion .
Using the term often represents a misunderstanding of what it means to work in an agile way .
Much of what you describe as post - agile is just doing agile well .
I am becoming a believer in this site , very timely posts on great subjects .

This is very timely for me as just last week I decided to write an article on how Flow can be used to improve e-learning .
I 'm still at the thinking and research phase , so my ideas are not extremely well reasoned at this point .
I found a study by Ruth Rettie ( An exploration of flow during Internet use http://www.kingston.ac.uk/~ku03468/docs/An Exploration of Flow during Internet Use.pdf ) where she lists this finding -
Respondents felt that flow was more likely when they were activley involved ( e.g. selecting options , communicating ) and getting immediate responses .
So I am exploring the idea of 5 " concentric circles " for designing e-learning .
Circles are numbered from 1 ( innermost ) to 5 ( outermost ) .
Circle 1 - New Information
Circle 2 - Prerequisite Information
Circle 3 - Help , Analogies , Examples , Etc .
Circle 4 - Advanced Information
Circle 5 - Links to Additional Information
Some learners may be able to work through the material just using Circle 1 , others might need Circles 1 - 3 , and others may need / want all 5 circles .
The basic idea is that everything a learner needs to learn is available and only a click or 2 away .
No need to search the web , send an email asking a question , look in the book --- everything is available within the lesson .
Now will this lead to Flow ?
I do n't know , but I think flow is not possible without it .
I see a great deal of similarities between designing a program or system and designing a lesson or course , so I hope this was relevant .
Posted by : Rich | Jan 9 , 2007 11:49:53 AM
I think instead of Flow Model it should be called the Fluid Model because software should be more like water and shape itself to a users needs and task objectives as s/he using the system .
I see a system where a user clicks on a particular file lets say a word document or picture and instead of an application launching and taking you to another screen , the software launches around the the file with a your latest used commands .
This then affords better interaction with the files and systems .
If a user chooses to launch it at full screen the software allows them .
If the software is not installed in the system it goes out and brings in a temporary web tool to view the file automatically with out installing anything just passing the encrypted stream to a service which loads and displays it with a read only message to make a more fluid usability .
This of course depends on a interconnected full time web .
I think people really do n't care what software created any particular file , just open it , let them see it and if its worth editing , make it easy for that install this part as well .
In the business world of software at work , for the most part , people that I write software for do not tend to want to use it because it looks pretty or function gracefully or is fast .
They just want to complete a task and get back to surfing or whatever they were doing as fast as possible .
They use maybe 10 % of all those office commands so why are the Software Giants continuing to focuses on more functionality and only moderate usability trends .
It 's Money , even though people do n't use the new functionality they still want the upgrade .
It 's a psychological thing and security thing .
What we learned in Usability this past year is a great indication of were we might focuses some of our energy this year .
Check it out here .

Here 's my spin on process and the products it produces .
Process is just how you get things done in a reasonable amount of time with a certain amount of quality .
Waterfall 's only original reason for existence was so that its creator could introduce Spiral .
Of course the spiral methodology has evolved into the different forms we have today .
I think it is funny when I hear of " agile " being a process , because it is a mindset .
The idea is that you have certain preferences for how you do things .
In short its the mantra to favor people interacting over a mechanical and boring process .
Let 's face it , no one wants to do things just because " the process " says we should .
Talking to people is fun , and we get more out of it .
The next evolution in getting done what is good for the user has to recognize the " soft " requirements .
Everyone with a degree seems to scoff at the requirement " Make it friendly to use " .
It makes me want to take their degree and burn it .
The criticism is always " how do you test it ? "
If you can't test it then how can you make it a requirement ?
Nevertheless , it is very important to at least attempt .
My personal evolution of the software development process starts with goals .
What are the goals for this thing that we are building ?
What does the client need for this to do for them ?
Goals are n't hard testable requirements .
They are the aspirations for the software and the people writing it .
It 's where things like " user friendly " and " kicks * ss " belong .
It 's also where the rubber meets the road .
If you created a slick little app , but it fell short on a critical goal -- maybe even the mission statement for the project -- then the project was a failure .
Even if it satisfied all the " requirements " .
Ok , so the PC term for failure is " a learning experience " , but call it what it is .

As a game designer , designing for flow is my job .
Achieving it is of course not easy .
My favorite game company is PopCap , which produces a small number of superb titles , in contrast to most other casual game publishers .
They were the company that started the casual game industry with the release of Bejeweled , and they remain on top of that market .
So what is their development process ?
A spiral ?
Some other shape ?
Their process is iterative to be sure , but the key is not the shape of their process but their absolute commitment to high standards .
I think the same principles apply to Apple 's design process .
To summarize :
1 . Set a very high standard of user experience quality .
This requires a great deal of imagination -- to imagine something way beyond what you have seen before .
It 's striking to me how Apple was able to imagine a phone more radical than what any of its fans could imagine ( http://appleiphone.blogspot.com/).
2 . Be ruthless in achieving this standard .
The key to PopCap 's success is that they take as much time as it takes to achieve quality .
In an industry that takes as little as 3 months to crank out a title , they can take several years .
They also kill most of their titles early in development , rather than release inferior titles .
Of course this can be expensive .
My less expensive solution as a freelance game designer is to have a portfolio of projects that includes some smaller faster projects that let me experiment with many ideas quickly .
I then harvest the best ideas and use them in my bigger projects .
3 . Hire really smart people , and have them work in small interdisciplinary teams .

The comments to this entry are closed .
Long piece by David Brooks in which he attempts to figure out why the Republican party appears to be in shambles :
To put it bluntly , over the past several years , the G.O.P. has made ideological choices that offend conservatism ’s Burkean roots .
This may seem like an airy - fairy thing that does nothing more than provoke a few dissenting columns from William F. Buckley , George F. Will and Andrew Sullivan .
But suburban , Midwestern and many business voters are dispositional conservatives more than creedal conservatives .
They care about order , prudence and balanced budgets more than transformational leadership and perpetual tax cuts .
It is among these groups that G.O.P. support is collapsing .
American conservatism will never be just dispositional conservatism .
America is a creedal nation .
But American conservatism is only successful when it ’s in tension — when the ambition of its creeds is retrained by the caution of its Burkean roots .
Hogwash .
If you want to know why the Republican party is in shambles , read this :
Yesterday , in response to a question from a reporter suspicious of why he was n’t wearing an American flag pin on his lapel , Barack Obama explained his belief that for some , the pins became a substitute for “ true patriotism . ”
The senator said he would instead “ try to tell the American people what I believe will make this country great , and hopefully that will be a testimony to my patriotism . ”
I did n’t expect leading conservative voices to understand , but I was a little surprised at the ferocity of the response .
Jonah Goldberg described Obama ’s perspective as “ staggeringly stupid , ” and “ the single dumbest thing I ’ve ever heard of him doing . ”
Another prominent far - right blogger responded this way : Seriously , you want this for President of these great United States .
This is how he catches the attention of a media aligned with the terror force ?
This useful tool wo n’t wear an American flag pin ?
Talk about pandering to the radical base , he ought to run against Ahmadinejad .
He is scoring points with Georgie Soros , wo n’t be waiting long for his on his Soros stipend , I ’m sure .
What ’s Obama Hussein ’s new campaign slogan , “ America Sucks ! ” ?
For starters , people got tired of being associated with these drooling retards .
Then , when they realized that these drooling retards had ideological allies running the show in the Bush administration and then began to experience their idiotic policies , they moved from disgusted to outright hostile .
Like me .
It had nothing to do with Burke , and everything to do with what the party had become .
A bunch of bedwetting , loudmouth , corrupt , hypocritical , and incompetent boobs with a mean streak a mile long and no sense of fair play or proportion .
Seriously - what does the current Republican party stand for ?
Permanent war , fear , the nanny state , big spending , torture , execution on demand , complete paranoia regarding the media , control over your body , denial of evolution and outright rejection of science , AND ZOMG THEY ARE GONNA MAKE US WEAR BURKHAS , all the while demanding that in order to be a good American I have to spend most of every damned day condemning half my fellow Americans as terrorist appeasers .
And that is n’t even getting into the COMPLETE and TOTAL corruption of our political processes at every level .
The shit is really going to hit the fan after we vote these jackasses out of power in 2008 .
Screw them .
I got out .
They can have their party .
I will vote for Democrats and little L libertarians and isolationists until the crazy people are n’t running the GOP .
The threat of higher taxes in the short term is n’t enough to keep me from voting out crazy people and voting for sane people with whom I merely disagree regarding policy .
Hillarycare does n’t scare me as much as Frank Gaffney having a line to the person with the nuclear football or Dobson and company crafting domestic policy .
That is why the Republican party is in shambles .
The majority of us have decided that the movers and shakers in the GOP and the blogospheric right are certified lunatics who , in a decent and sane society , we would have in controlled environments in rocking chairs under shade trees for most of the day , wheeled in at night for tapioca pudding and some karaoke .
Introduction
At the end of my Mac OS X 10.4
Tiger review , I wrote this .
Overall , Tiger is impressive .
If this is what Apple can do with 18 months of development time instead of 12 , I tremble to think what they could do with a full two years .
That was exactly two and a half years ago , to the day .
It seems that I 've gotten my wish and then some .
Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard has gestated longer than any release of Mac OS X ( other than 10.0 , that is ) .
If I had high expectations for 10.5 back in 2005 , they 've only grown as the months and years have passed .
Apple 's tantalizingly explicit withholding of information about Leopard just fanned the flames .
My state of mind leading up to the release of Leopard probably matches that of a lot of Mac enthusiasts : this better be good .
Maybe the average Mac user just expects another incrementally improved version of Mac OS X. Eighteen months , two and a half years , who 's counting ?
Maybe we enthusiasts are just getting greedy .
After all , as Apple 's been so fond of touting , there have been five releases of Mac OS X in the time it 's taken Microsoft to deliver Windows Vista .
But far be it from me to use Microsoft to calibrate my expectations .
Leopard has to be something special .
And as I see it , operating system beauty is more than skin deep .
While the casual Mac user will gauge Leopard 's worth by reading about the marquee features or watching a guided tour movie at Apple 's web site , those of us with an unhealthy obsession with operating systems will be trolling through the internals to see what 's really changed .
These two views of Leopard , the interface and the internals , lead to two very different assessments .
Somewhere in between lie the features themselves , judged not by the technology they 're based on or the interface provided for them , but by what they can actually do for the user .
This review will cover all of those angles , in varying degrees of depth .
Like all other Mac OS X releases before it , Leopard is too big for one review to cover everything .
( After all , Tiger 's internals alone can fill over 1,600 printed pages . )
As in past reviews , I 've chosen to delve deeply into the aspects of Leopard that are the most interesting to me while also trying to provide a reasonable overview for the non-geeks who 've decided to take the plunge into an Ars Technica review .
( Hi , Mom . )
Okay Leopard , let 's see what you 've got .
Fred Kaplan had an interesting article last week about ongoing discussions among current and retired military officers as to the best response for military professionals concerned that the country may be moving toward a very unwise war with Iran .
The only issue I have with the piece is that it follows its military sources in faulting the conduct of the generals ' before the Iraq War .
As I 've pointed out before , all the relevant policymakers and opinion - leaders were well - aware that most ( though by no means all ) military officers thought the Bush administration 's Iraq policies were misguided -- people just did n't care , there 'd been a widespread and successful campaign in the press to convince civilian elites that the career professionals in the military , the foreign service , and the intelligence community were bad sources of advice on policy in the greater Middle East and that we'd be better off relying on the information and analysis provided by conservative think tanks founded by dissidents from the academic and governmental consensus .
All of which is to say that when you read these kind of passages in a newspaper profile of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 's views on the world situation , you ought to pay attention and read between the lines a bit :
[ Admiral Mike Mullen ] rejected the counsel of those who might urge immediate attacks inside Iran to destroy nuclear installations or to stop the flow of explosives that end up as powerful roadside bombs in Iraq or Afghanistan , killing American troops .
With America at war in two Muslim countries , he said , attacking a third Islamic nation in the region “ has extraordinary challenges and risks associated with it . ”
The military option , he said , should be a last resort . [. . .]
“ That said , that does n’t get at the source of it , ” he acknowledged .
Asked whether the American military should aim at sites inside Iran if intelligence indicated that such interdiction could halt the flow of those bombs , he said “ the risks could be very , very high . ”
“ We ’re in a conflict in two countries out there right now , ” he added .
“ We have to be incredibly thoughtful about the potential of in fact getting into a conflict with a third country in that part of the world . ”
That 's as far as a person in his job can go toward saying publicly " do n't let the crazy people inside this administration start a war with Iran ! " without seriously violating his constitutional role .
So do n't say you were n't warned .
Fred Hiatt & Friends , meanwhile , assure us that George W. Bush , Hillary Clinton , and Barack Obama all have the same " centrist and sensible " policies on Iran and it's therefore rude and irresponsible for Obama to suggest that this is an issue voters should consider when voting .
Basically , everyone should just calm down and trust the Powers That Be to handle everything properly .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

A draft law aimed at rehabilitating the memory of Franco 's victims was tabled 18 months behind schedule , got bogged down in parliamentary wrangling and may not be submitted for definitive approval in time before the March 2008 parliamentary elections .
The so - called Law of Historic Memory is one of the most controversial initiatives launched by Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero 's Socialist government .
It is rejected by the opposition conservatives , who accuse the Socialists of trying to rewrite history and say a re-evaluation of the Franco era would reopen old wounds .
For far - left and regionalist parties , on the other hand , the planned law does not go far enough in redressing the wrongs committed by Francoists .
The law has divided parliament , with parties proposing nearly 200 amendments to it .
In contrast to other countries which had Fascist regimes , such as Germany and Italy , Spain has never made a clean break with its one - time dictator .
After the death of the Caudillo ( leader ) put an end to his rule in 1975 , democratic parties agreed to leave the past behind to heal a divided nation , and an amnesty was granted to Franco 's collaborators in 1977 .
A truthful picture of Franco ?
Removing Franco 's statue in Zaragoza did not erase him from history
Critics say school history books still do not give a truthful picture of the 1936 - 39 Civil War , which was sparked by Franco 's military uprising against the legal republican government , and of his subsequent dictatorship .
About half a million people from both sides were killed in the war , and afterwards tens of thousands of republicans died in reprisals , prisons and labor camps .
Tens of thousands of republicans remain buried in anonymous mass graves around the country .
The government thought the time was ripe to finally lay Franco 's ghost to rest , but it seems to have been wrong .
The conservative People 's Party ( PP ) , which grew partly out of Francoist roots , opposed plans to rehabilitate and compensate the republican victims .
" Spaniards do not want to know anything about Franco , " PP leader Mariano Rajoy said .
" They are more concerned with education and health care . "
Removal of Franco - era monuments not enough
Franco , left , led an uprising which led to the civil war
The far - left party Izquierda Unida ( IU ) , however , found the government 's plans far too timid .
It was backed by regionalist parties such as the ERC in north - eastern Catalonia , whose culture was oppressed by the Franco regime .
The IU and its allies , for instance , have asked the government to finance groups exhuming remains of republicans to give them honorable burials , instead of just encouraging city councils to do so .
The most controversial part of the draft law concerned summary verdicts handed out by Francoist tribunals to tens of thousands of people who were executed on charges of being communists , trade unionists or the like .
The government rejected the IU 's request that the law open the door to the judicial revision of individual sentences , which could have overburdened courts and led to a questioning of other laws dating from the Franco era .
The two finally agreed on a general condemnation of the Francoist verdicts , but the compromise has not been approved by all the parties supporting the law .
The IU and regionalists also want the government to tackle the sensitive issue of the Valley of the Fallen , Franco 's huge mausoleum near Madrid , which was built by republican prisoners .
They are concerned that a number of statues and street names still pay homage to Franco , though many such tributes have been removed from cities governed by the political left .
The government has struggled to find a law that would be acceptable to all , but the result has left nobody satisfied , and it seems possible that the law could be shelved after the end of the current legislature .
Nigella Lawson : Curvy figure and an Oxford degree
Researchers studied 16,000 women and girls and found the more voluptuous performed better on cognitive tests - as did their children .
The bigger the difference between a woman 's waist and hips the better .
Researchers writing in Evolution and Human Behaviour speculated this was to do with fatty acids found on the hips .
In this area , the fat is likely to be the much touted Omega - 3 , which could improve the woman 's own mental abilities as well as those of her child during pregnancy .
Men respond to the double enticement of both an intelligent partner and an intelligent child , the researchers at the Universities of Pittsburgh and California said .
The findings appear to be borne out in the educational attainments of at least one of the UK's most famous curvaceous women , Nigella Lawson , who graduated from Oxford .
But experts are not convinced by the findings .
" On the fatty deposits being related to intelligence front , it 's very hard to detangle that from other factors , such as social class , for instance , or diet , " said Martin Tovee of Newcastle University .
" And much as we logically like the idea that men are interested in the waist to hip ratio , it actually features relatively low down the list of feature males look for in a potential partner . "
A recent study on the impact of filesharing on CD sales shows that the more music people download on P2P - networks , the more CDs they buy .
University of London researchers , Birgitte Andersen and Marion Frenz surveyed a large group of Canadians to find out what the effect of piracy is on music sales .
The results are surprising , at least , for the music industry .
The researchers conclude that that people who download more music actually buy more CDs .
They report : “ We estimate that the effect of one additional P2P download per month is to increase music purchasing by 0.44 CDs per year . ”
This basically means that if someone downloads 270 songs a year via BitTorrent , he or she will buy 9 CDs more than someone who only downloads 27 songs .
So , in a way illegal downloads actually convert into more CD sales .
Overall the researchers found no difference between pirates and other people in the number of CDs they buy .
They did not find a positive or a negative relationship between filesharing and CD sales .
So , at worst , filesharing is n’t the cause for a drop in CD sales .
It might even be a boon to it .
This study once again confirms that piracy is not as bad as the recording industry content “ owners ” want us to believe .
Filesharing gives people the opportunity to discover new music for free .
It makes it easier to try new music before you buy .
Right now , downloading songs off P2P networks is pretty much the only way to listen to complete tracks before deciding to buy them .
It is worth mentioning that there are legal alternatives , like Soundpedia and Lala.com ’s upcoming service , which will let you stream entire songs for free .
However , most people will still prefer pirated music because the quality is much better and they can transfer it to their MP3 player .

Germany hopes to put an unmanned space craft into the moon 's orbit in the early part of the next decade , a senior German official said on Wednesday .
REUTERS / Fabrizio Bensch
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Germany hopes to put an unmanned space craft into the moon ’s orbit in the early part of the next decade , a senior German official said on Wednesday .
The lunar orbit mission will be useful for scientific research , Deputy Economy Minister Peter Hintze , the government ’s aerospace coordinator , told reporters .
“ It is also a chance for Germany to prove its competence in this area . ”
Hintze said a report prepared by the German Aerospace Centre ( DLR ) would be presented to the government for consideration .
“ The essence of this report is that it is possible and it makes sense , ” he said .
“ The political decision has not been made yet . ”
The project would be called LEO -- Lunar Exploration Orbiter -- and could be fired into space in 2012 if decisions are made and sufficient financing found , Hintze said .
He said initial costs for the project would be around 350 million euros ( $ 513.6 million ) , which would cover the planning , building and launch of the spacecraft .
DLR head Johann - Dietrich Woerner said the project was not intended to compete with efforts of the European Space Agency ( ESA ) , of which the DLR is a member , but to complement them .
“ A lunar mission would be a building block and would not be against Europe or against cooperation , ” he said , adding that the Germans had discussed the project with NASA , ESA and the Russian Space Agency .
Both Woerner and Hintze said Germany has no plans for a manned lunar mission or a moon landing .
But Woerder noted the LEO craft would be 50 kms ( 30 miles ) above the moon ’s surface .
One of the commonly accepted mantras is that the Internet is a very dangerous place for kids — especially social networking sites , where innocent youngsters can be approached by strangers offering them virtual candy — hence the recent moves by sites such as MySpace to tighten up access controls for younger users .
A new study from the National School Boards Association suggests strongly that many of those fears are misplaced and that the overwhelming majority of kids have never had an unknown adult ask them for personal information .
The NSBA study ( PDF ) was carried out by surveying 1,277 students aged 9 to 17 , 1,039 parents , and 250 school administrators with decision - making power over Internet policy .
Funded in part by Microsoft , News Corp. ( which owns MySpace ) .
and Verizon , the study paints a picture of Internet safety that differs significantly from that commonly depicted by the mainstream media .
Of the over 1,200 students surveyed , only seven percent said that they have been the victims of cyberbullying .
That figure is in stark contrast to a report issued a couple of months ago by the Pew Internet & American Life Project .
In a survey of 935 teens aged between 12 and 17 , nearly a third of them reported that they had experienced some form of cyberbullying .
Three percent of the kids surveyed said that unwelcome strangers attempted to communicate with them online .
Two percent said that such a person attempted to arrange an in - person meeting .
A miniscule .08 percent of the kids responding to the survey said that they went through with such a meeting without their parents ' permission .
In contrast , school administrators believe that social networking sites are a significant cause of problems for students .
52 percent of the districts surveyed said that students being free and easy with personal information online has been " a significant problem " despite the fact that only 3 percent of the students in the same study ever reported doing so .
The NSBA notes that there is a similar disparity on the subject of cyberbullying .
Should schools relax their restrictions on social networking sites , as tech.blorge.com suggests ?
Problems arise when a student does meet up with an online predator with tragic results or a particularly bad case of cyberbullying hits the media .
The end result is predictable : repeated calls for schools to ban access to social networking sites , forums , and even instant messaging services .
Most schools already have such bans in place : 84 percent of the districts surveyed ban online chat and 81 percent ban IMs .
A little over half of the schools bar access to social networking sites , while 62 percent prohibit participation in forums .
60 percent have also banned e-mail .
The report concludes with a handful of recommendations , the most controversial of which is likely to be a suggestion that schools reexamine social networking policies .
" Safety policies remain important , as does teaching students about online safety and responsible online expression , " the study 's authors note .
" But students may learn these lessons better while they 're actually using social networking tools . "
One might look askance at such a recommendation , given that the study was funded in part by MySpace 's corporate parent — not to mention the fact that kids should be getting their learn on when they 're in school .
But much of the data in the study underlies the NSBA 's assertion that the vast majority of students are aware of the dangers that may await them online .
Perhaps all of the warnings and attention paid to Internet safety are actually having the desired effect on kids .
The rumors are flying that they are .
Gristmill : Bye , bye , Ms. Renewable Pie ( their emphasis ) :
I 've learned from concerned advocates that Democratic congressional leadership is considering stripping the production tax credits for wind and solar , along with the federal renewable portfolio standard , from the conference bill .
Losing the RPS and the PTC would mean jettisoning basically every measure that the White House has complained about ...
If this happens , it will mean there 's bupkis in the energy bill for renewable electricity , imperiling probably billions of dollars in solar and wind contracts that have been written with the expectation that the production tax credits will lower costs to investors and consumers .
Huffington Post : News Alert : If You Love Renewable Energy , It 's Time to Freak Out
Pelosi and Reid are just about to do the stupidest thing imaginable : pull the rug out from underneath the blossoming renewable energy economy at the time when we need it most ...
As Adam Browning of Vote Solar put it " Thursday morning , Senator Reid and Speaker Pelosi decided to drop the renewable energy standard out of the energy bill and drop the tax title .
No tax title means no extension of the investment tax credit for solar , and no extention of the production tax credit for wind .
Let 's see ... nothing for solar , plus nothing for wind , hmmm , add no renewable energy standard , carry the zero ... yep , that adds up to precisely nothing for renewable energy .
Got that ?
Congressional leadership is moving an energy bill with nothing in it for renewable energy .
Remember , these stories are all second - hand rumors .
They might not be true .
Keep that in mind before judging Pelosi and Reid too harshly .
Then again , they started circulating last week .
I had hoped that by now we 'd see some " woops , it was all just a misunderstanding stories . "
No dice .
So ... could the Democrats possibly be that stupid ?
Well , there 's one line of argument that says , no , its not possible :
That said , there may be another version to this story .
Reid and Pelosi , knowing that there will be a knockdown dragout fight on the Energy Bill , may actually be unbundling the renewables from the fight , in order to allow easier passage befitting renewables bipartisan support ... i'm not claiming insider knowledge here , as i'm not sure what 's happening .
I have spoken at length with Pelosi about the political and economic benefits of windpower , however , and know that she is a strong backer of the technology , and can't imagine her stabbing us in the back .
Uh , yeah .. the Democrats can't possibly be caving in ... it must be an , uh , parliamentary maneuver .. yeah , yeah , its gotta be .
OK , folks , now its time to answer my title question .
No , you do n't get a poll , you get some homework .
Pelosi and Reid 's phones are already apparently ringing off the hook ... keep them that way .
Make sure that the answer to my title question is " No , the Democrats can't be that stupid ..
WE WON " T LET THEM . "
Pelosi's offices number is 202 - 225-4965 ( fax 202-225-4188 )
Reid 's office 's number is 202-224-3542 ( fax 202-224-7327 )
Once you call , you may discuss the following points amongst yourselves :
- Most Americans want to do something about Global Warming .
Is removing subsidies for solar / wind smart politically ?
- Will this help our international standing in the world ?
- The solar and wind industries are growing rapidly .
Will this help our international competitiveness ?
- Will help Democrats in future negotiations with Bush / Cheney ?
But please call , first .
If you can't call tonight , call tomorrow .
Call your Rep / Senator while you 're at it .
( Update : Apparently , Pelosi and Reid 's voice mailboxes are both full from calls received over the holiday weekend .
Good .
They wo n't be tomorrow . )
The last , best hope for averting a war with Iran lies with the United States military .
The Democratic Congress , cowed by the Israel lobby and terrified of appearing weak on defense before the presidential elections , will do nothing to halt an attack .
The media , especially the electronic press , is working overtime to whip up fear of a nuclear Iran and tar Tehran with abetting attacks against American troops in Iraq .
The American public is complacent , unsure of what to believe , knocked off balance by fear and passive .
We will be saved or doomed by our generals .
The last wall of defense that prevents the Bush administration from targeting Iran , an attack that could ignite a regional conflagration and usher in apocalyptic scenarios in the Middle East , runs through the offices of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates ; Adm .
William Fallon , the head of the Central Command ( CENTCOM ) ; and Gen. George Casey , the Army ’s new chief of staff .
These three figures in the defense establishment have told George W. Bush and the Congress how depleted the U.S. military has become , that it cannot manage another conflict , and that a war with Iran would make the war with Iraq look like an act of prudence and common sense .
The reliance on the military command , however , to be the voice of reason in the debate about a new war is not a healthy sign for our deteriorating democracy .
Compliant generals can always be found to carry out the Dr. Strangelove designs of a mad White House .
Those who resist implementing decisions can easily be removed .
The protective cover provided by these figures in the defense establishment could vanish .
The United States is able to launch a massive and devastating air attack on Iran ’s military installations .
It can obliterate the Iranian air force .
It can cripple if not dismantle effective communications and military command and control .
It can destroy some of Iran ’s underground nuclear facilities .
But our intelligence inside Iran , as was true in Iraq , is uneven .
We do not know where all of Iran ’s nuclear facilities are .
And it is probable that an Iranian response against American targets , such as the Green Zone in Iraq , as well as Iranian - sponsored terrorist attacks on American soil , would follow .
Shiites in the region would interpret an attack as a war on the Shiite community and would unleash unrest , terrorism and violence against us and our allies from Lebanon to Pakistan .
The battle is between the Cheney camp , which would like to carry out strikes on Iran before Bush leaves office , and Gates and his senior generals .
Cheney , who has always been able to push aside the feckless Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , is having a tougher time with the military .
Fallon , for example , was successful in his attempt to block efforts by Cheney to move a third aircraft carrier into the Persian Gulf earlier this year and bluntly said that “ there would be no war against Iran ” as long as he was chief of CENTCOM .
Gen .
Casey informed Congress this fall that the Army was “ out of balance ” and added : “ The demand for our forces exceeds the sustainable supply .
We are consumed with meeting the demands of the current fight , and are unable to provide ready forces as rapidly as necessary for other potential contingencies . ”
This White House has a habit of dismissing recalcitrant generals .
Gen. Eric Shinseki , when he was chief of staff of the Army , ended his career when he told the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee on the eve of the war in Iraq that “ something in the order of several hundred thousand soldiers ” would probably be required for postwar Iraq .
Gen. Peter Pace also ran afoul of the White House and was not nominated for a second term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff when he publicly defied Donald Rumsfeld .
At a press conference in November 2005 he stood next to Rumsfeld as the secretary of defense asserted that “ the United States does not have a responsibility ” to prevent torture by Iraqi officials .
Pace pointedly disagreed with Rumsfeld , saying , “ It is the absolute responsibility of every U.S. service member , if they see inhumane treatment being conducted , to intervene , to stop it . ”
Pace also openly dismissed White House claims that Iran was supplying weapons and explosively formed penetrators to Iraqi insurgents .
He too was shown the door .
The White House , isolated and reviled at home and abroad , believes it is on a higher mission to save the world from itself .
The instability in the Middle East could undermine Gates and his generals .
A limited Israeli strike on suspected Iranian nuclear production facilities , currently under discussion in Jerusalem , could trigger retaliatory strikes by Iran on Israel and U.S. targets in Iraq and the Persian Gulf .
The clamor for revenge , fueled by a rapacious right - wing media , coupled with our feelings of collective humiliation , could sweep aside all reasoned objections to war with Iran .
It happened after the attacks of 2001 .
It can happen again .
There is a petition circulating that was put together by Marcy Winograd from the Progressive Democrats .
The petition is addressed to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and all U.S. military personnel .
It urges them to defy orders to attack Iran .
It points out that a pre-emptive war with Iran is a war crime under international law .
It reminds military personnel of the statute in the Army Field Manual 27 - 10 , Section 609 , and Uniform Code of Military Justice , Article 92 , that states : “ A general order or regulation is lawful unless it is contrary to the Constitution , the law of the United States . … ”
The petition notes that any provision of an international treaty ratified by the United States becomes the law of the United States .
The United States is a party and signatory to the United Nations Charter , of which Article II , Section 4 , states , “ All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state . … ”
Iran has not attacked the United States .
The U.S. , as a party and signatory to the U.N. charter , would be in clear violation of international law and the laws enshrined in the Constitution if it went to war with Iran .
If the citizens and their representatives in Congress refuse to resist and uphold the rule of law , perhaps the military can be prodded to halt our slide into despotism .
It is not the best option , but it may be the only one left .
We live now at the mercy of events .
A provocation by Iran , aided by a bellicose White House , could plunge us into another war .
It could unleash the primitive chant for violence and revenge that rises up from a population that feels vulnerable , uncertain and afraid .
There are forces in our society ready and willing to fan the blood lust for a wider circle of war and mayhem .
The Iranians , like us , are cursed by their leadership .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is as primitive , inept and paranoid as George Bush .
They are the perfect dance partners for a waltz into Armageddon .
The Rules
Do n’t Spam
I want to get this out of the way , as it has become a huge problem online with nearly every blog .
If you are manually spamming someone else , you are not a good Internet citizen .
If you are honestly wondering if your comment is spam , ask yourself if you would like to receive such comments ?
Or if you do n’t have a blog of your own , try to remember how you feel when a telephone marketer calls right in the middle of supper .
If your comment is only to promote your own site , then do n’t be surprised if it gets deleted as it detracts from the conversation .
If you are a spammer , and ignore this rule , I hope that someday there are laws that will stop you from having Internet access .
Fill Out Your Information Properly
If you want to make a good impression , be sure to fill out all the information requested .
I know it can be worrisome to give out your e-mail address , but if that is a concern for you , create an e-mail account just for commenting on blogs .
That way you can still start conversations with the blog owners if you so choose .
I have been able to build some amazing relationships with top level bloggers by commenting on their blogs .
If I had n’t filled out all the requested information , they would have had no way to find me and start that line of communication .
Reference Your Response
When you are getting ready to submit a comment , you will want to reference what it is you are commenting on .
Sometimes this might be very apparent , but other times , other people might not understand if you are responding to the main article , or to another comment .
This is a larger issue on sites that do n’t have a threaded commenting system , but it is still helpful , and polite to reference what the comment is regarding .
If you say something like “ I disagree ” , and do n’t say who you are disagreeing with , it can create confusion , and not help continue to build the conversation .
Make sure you answer the basic questions : who , what , where , when and why ?
I know this can seem basic , but so many people forget to do this , treating comments like cell phone text messages or instant messages , thus reducing the meaning behind their message , and the value of what they have to say .
More is Usually Better
Text can be such a limiting medium , you lose out on pitch , tone , body language , and facial clues , and so adding more words to your comments can help make up for those shortcomings .
The phrase “ yeah right ” , could mean so many different things depending on the tone .
It could be sarcastic , honest , questioning , or a variety of other things , and without any more description , it is up to the person reading the comment to try to judge the original intention of the message .
The Reasons
Increase Your Traffic
If you have a blog of your own , and followed the above rules , people may follow that link , and see if you have more knowledge to share , thus increasing your traffic .
There are many bloggers that swear by commenting on other blogs to build up their own .
It shows that you have knowledge , an opinion , and that translates into something people will want to read .
Learn Something New
Recently , I had commented on another person ’s blog , and someone else had responded to me .
It was n’t the author of the post , but instead someone else that had found the post , and answered my question .
Had I asked this question on my own blog , I might not have received any response because it would have been outside the normal target audience of my blog .
On some great blogs , if the topic is right , and the comments are open , there can be more to learn from the comments than in the articles .
Conclusion
Part of the reason blogging has become as pervasive online as it has become is due to the openness of commenting .
This has helped blogs go beyond their traditional media counterparts and their “ letter to the editor ” style approach to creating a open dialog between the writers and their readers .
I would love to hear your opinion on commenting , and any stories you might have on how it has been beneficial or a nuisance to you .
By Jose Baig
Hispanic affairs correspondent , BBC Mundo
This Saturday , I am setting off on a two - week long trip across the United States with a simple goal in mind : to speak only Spanish during the journey .
Jose and Carlos are aiming to meet as many people as possible
I am not trying to achieve or break any record .
I just want to see what it is like to cross the country without uttering a word of English .
I am travelling with Carlos Ceresole , a video producer for the Spanish American section of the BBC .
Our trip will take us from San Agustin , Florida , to Los Angeles , California .
We will visit a total of eight states and 12 cities along the way .
The name of the project is " ¿Hablas español ? "
( Do you speak Spanish ? ) , and that is the question we will be asking everyone we meet .
In fact , that is the question I have asked everyone I have contacted while planning this trip .
I must admit , though , that the other day I was talking to an immigration specialist in Tallahassee , Florida , and only realised she spoke Spanish 15 minutes into the conversation .
That was an interesting reminder of the purpose of this project and it also showed me that there are a lot more Spanish speakers in the US than one tends to think .
It 's just a matter of asking : " Do you speak Spanish ? "
Immigration
Hispanics are the fastest - growing population in the United States .
According to government figures , there are now some 42 million Hispanics in the US , some 14.5 % of the population .
Immigration is set to be a key issue in 2008 presidential vote
After English , Spanish is the most widely spoken language and is studied by increasing numbers of non-native speakers .
Experts believe that even if no one else from Latin America were to emigrate to the US in the coming years , the Hispanic population would continue to grow at a faster rate than other minorities .
This includes African - Americans who constitute 12 % of the population .
But all the indications are that the US will continue to attract many Latin Americans , both legally and illegally .
Immigration , already a controversial and divisive issue in the country , is set to be one of the hot topics in next year 's presidential election .
We are excited about this project , but are not too sure what to expect .
Many people have written to us inviting us into their homes or businesses and saying that they want to meet us .
We are looking forward to that and we 'll try to meet as many people as possible .
But will everyone be so welcoming when we ask them " ¿Hablas español ? "
Criticism
In Nogales , Arizona , we want to tackle the issue of cross - border crossings .
We would like to talk to people who have done it and to those who try to stop them .
The trip will finish in Los Angeles , where we expect to hold a debate on the impact of Spanish in American society .
Some of our readers have criticised the project saying that millions of people already live and travel across the US speaking only Spanish , and that they do so with very little or no money .
The idea of this trip is to talk to those people and to see how they do it .
I 'll be writing a daily blog as well as reporting on BBC Mundo Hoy , the BBC 's flagship radio programme in Spanish .

Fears about the state of the world economy increased dramatically after the US central bank had to rescue one of the world ’s biggest and best - known investment banks .
The 80 - year old Bear Stearns bank will probably have to be sold and broken up after other banks stopped dealing with it for fear the New York - based bank would run out of cash .
The investment bank ’s closure of two of its hedge funds last July sparked the present credit crisis .
The Federal Reserve announced that it would provide whatever emergency funding Bear Stearns could afford to borrow .
In a statement approved unanimously by its board , the Fed said it “ will continue to provide liquidity as necessary to promote the orderly financing of the financial system ” .
An investment bank would not normally qualify for such funding , which will have to be channelled through another bank , JP Morgan .
It is believed to be the first time such a scheme has been used since the Great Depression of the 1930s .
Earlier this week , the Federal Reserve , aware of the growing problems in the US system , said it would make $ 200bn ( €128 bn ) available to banks which were finding it difficult to conduct their normal business .
Leading banks and securities firms have posted $ 195bn ( €125bn ) in asset writedowns and credit losses since the beginning of 2007 .

There ’s a fascinating yet frightening discussion over at the FatWallet Finance Forums about restaurant servers stealing their way to higher tips on credit card receipts .
Servers upset by low tips that they probably deserved have been known to edit the tip line of credit card receipts to bump up their tip .
For example :
See how easily a measly tip is changed to a generous one by a disgruntled server or bartender ?
The easiest way to combat this illegal and downright nasty behavior is to reconcile your receipts against your credit card statements each and every month .
You ’ll spot restaurant wrongdoing and be able to phone it in to your credit card issuer faster than you can say “ there ’s a fly in my soup . ”
But for the trillions of people who do n’t want to go through the trouble of reconciling their receipts each month , there ’s an easier way to stop tip alterations just by glancing over your credit card statement each month .
It involves using checksums to add a layer of security to your tip amount .
The term “ checksum ” normally refers to a technique used by computer systems to ensure file integrity .
Here , we ’ll be using checksums to ensure human integrity .
There are many checksum systems you can use when tipping , but here ’s a great example that ’s easy to learn and can be performed without the aid of a calculator unless you suck at math really badly .
Step 1 : Look over your receipt
You ’ll get ripped off far more often for food and drink overcharges than you will by spiteful servers .
Check each billed item and compare it to the menu price .
Step 2 : Calculate the appropriate tip
Tip as you normally do without worrying about checksums for now .
For our example , let ’s say you had the following bill but service was slow , so you ’d like to tip about 10 % .
Step 3 : Apply a checksum
That $ 4.71 is just begging to have ten dollars added to it , and $ 51.87 becomes $ 61.87 so easily .
Foil these alteration efforts with this simple checksum method .
Adjust the amount of the tip so that the numbers in the final total to the left of the decimal point add up to the right - most digit .
In this case , the total has a “ 51 ” to the left of the decimal point ( A ) . 5 + 1 = 6 , so the final digit should be six .
Adjust the total to $ 51.86 or $ 51.96 ( B ) by adding nine or subtracting one from the tip ( C ) .
Step 4 : Check your credit card statements each month
While the receipt will help you ensure no fraud was enacted upon your dining bill , you only need the statement to verify the checksum .
For this example , simply locate the dining transaction , add the numbers to the left of the decimal point , and confirm that they add up to the right - most digit .
If they do n’t , you ’ve been scammed .
This technique is not foolproof .
If the scammy server had added nine dollars to the total — making it $ 60.86 — the checksum calculation would still come back okay .
But because it ’s harder to turn a “ 51 ” into a “ 60 ” than a “ 61 , ” it ’s unlikely your server will do this unless they ’re wise to this particular checksum technique .
Step 5 : Deal with the theft
If you hit a checksum that fails , dig out your copy of the receipt to confirm it does n’t match the total on your statement .
Next , do three things :
Call your credit card issuer .
It should be fairly simple to get a credit for the difference between your actual bill and what you were forced to pay due to this fraud .
Call the police .
You were the victim of a crime , so you should report it , even if it ’s just a few dollars .
If the stealing server has multiple victims who report his or her behavior , the police will likely take action against the server and / or the restaurant .
Hopefully a few thieving restaurant workers behind bars will set enough of an example to discourage similar actions in others .
Call the restaurant ( optional ) .
At this point , you ’ve likely got your money back and given all the information you can to law enforcement .
You can try calling the restaurant to report the theft , but it might not do much .
In the best case , the manager will recognize the server ’s name on your receipt and confirm he or she has been suspected of wrongdoing .
Maybe you ’ll even get a free meal out of it for your trouble .
Worst case , the restaurant does nothing .
The original poster in the FatWallet Finance Forum topic may be onto something when he or she says that this is probably one of the most widespread types of theft that goes unpunished .
Now you have the tools to fight it .
The next time you ’re at a restaurant , eat , drink , be merry , and do a little extra math come tip time to help combat this rapidly growing problem .
UPDATE : Jeff B. put together a nifty Windows Mobile app for tip checksum calculations that ’ll help make it easier to compute the proper tip given your level of service and checksumming method .
Thanks Jeff !
A classic MSM damned - if - you - do - damned - if - you - do n't moment on this morning 's " Today " .
Tim Russert declared that when it comes to his surge - or - not - to - surge decision on Iraq , President Bush is in " a lose - lose situation . "
According to Russert , if the president proceeds with the surge , the Dem - controlled Congress will hold hearings with experts " and they will give the president a very difficult time on the surge capacity . "
Continued Tim : " On the other hand , if the president decides not to go forward with the surge of American troops , many members of his conservative base , particularly the neo-conservatives who have been supporting this war , will be agitated with him . "
Those darn neo-cons , making trouble again .
View video of Russert 's lose - lose formulation here .
Tim actually forgot a third part of the equation : whatever decision the president makes , he is sure to be criticized . . . by the MSM .
UPDATE : Good Morning America 's treatment of the president 's surge decison was balanced in contrast with Today's .
Senior national correspondent Jake Tapper narrated a segment that , in addition to the politics of the issue , actually addressed the substance .
We were even offered a clip of retired Army General Jack Keane who expressed support for the surge in these terms :
" It will buy us some time , probably as much as two years , so we can bring down the level of violence to an appropriate level for the growth and development of the Iraqi security forces to handle that level of violence . "
Finkelstein recently visited Iraq .

CAPTCHA をご存知でしょうか。
スパム防止のために歪んだ文字とかを入力させる、アレのことなのですが、 はてなのCAPTCHAの強度が妙に低く思えたので検証してみました。
CAPTCHAというのはいわゆる逆チューリングテストという奴で、
人間には可能だが機械には処理しにくいことをさせることで、
ロボットによる操作を弾こうというものです。
たとえば 、Gmailのユーザ登録には以下のような画像が表示され、
表示されている文字を入力することが求められます。
CAPTCHA の強度
例えばスパムを送るために大量のGmailアカウントを得ようとしてる人がいたとします。 手作業でGmailを登録するのは骨が折れる。 そこでプログラムによる機械化を試みることになるわけです。
その際、障壁となるのがこ のCAPTCHAなのです。
この画像から正解である文字 列" vittac " を得ることは機械には難しい。
プログラミング初心者にはどのようなプログラムを書けばそのようなことが
可能になるか想像もつかないでしょうし、プログラムをある程度かじった人間なら
これがいかに難しいことか容易に想像がつくと思います。では、その難しさはどこからくるのか？
ちょっと古い記事になりますが 、Radium Software Development にCAPTCHAの強度に関する記事
「 Breaking CAPTCHAs with NNs 」 がありました 。
CAPTCHAをプログラムで破ろうとする場合、 プログラムは二つの過程を経ることになります。
それは、文字の分割と認識です。
まずは、個別の文字を切り分けなくてはなりません。
それから、その個々の文字が何であるかを判別するのです。
先の記事によると 、CAPTCHA破りにおいて難しいのは分割のほうであり、
認識はさほど難しくないとあります。
はてな のCAPTCHAを破る
さて、はてな のCAPTCHAですが、アカウント登録していないユーザが書き込みを行おうとすると
以下のような画像と入力欄が表示されます。
しばらく利用していれば、この画像には0-9とa-fまでの16種類の文字しか表示されない
ことに気が付くことでしょう。 10回画像を表示して、並べて見ると以下のようになりました。
どうも文字の表示位置は決まっているように思いませんか？
固定のフォントで固定の位置に幾分色を変えて表示した文字に、ノイズを多少加えたモノのようです。
背景色は同じグレーです(ノイズはjpg化する際に乗るブロックノイズと思われる ) 。
位置が固定なので、座標を直接指定して文字を切り出します。
この切り出し過程は非常に容易です。あらかじめ、いくつかの画像をもとに、
文字の表示される位置を計測しておくだけでよい。
次に、色の違いをそろえるために白と黒の2値化します。
背景色が一緒なのでその色だけ背景として除去する方法も考えられますが、
jpg化に伴うモノとみられるブロックノイズが乗っていますので、
そこまでの手抜きはできませんが、単にRGBのどれかが0x80以下のものを黒、それ以外を白という
単純な条件判断で綺麗に2値化できてしまいます。
以上の過程を経て抽出文字を複数個サンプリングして、
論理和をとってノイズが乗っていない生のフォントを抽出します。
さて、あとは、これを実際の画像と重ねて一致率を見ます。
一致するピクセルと、しないピクセルの比率を計測するわけです。 ノイズは線が加わるだけなので、もともとのフォントで黒の部分が白になることはありません。 元フォントの黒部分に対して判別対象が黒であることを確認すれば用が足ります。
さらに文字が16種に限られるため、ループ回数も少なくて済むため軽い。
このうち、もっとも一致率の高いものが元の画像であると判断するようにプログラムしてみました。
さて、テストとして、以下の画像を読み込ませます。
そして、結果はこの通り。
左端のフォントが論理和をとった画像。右は元になった画像です。
上図ではサンプル数が20個程度と少ないのでノイズが除去し切れていませんが、
かなり容易に文字が抽出できることがわかると思います。
このプログラムに何個かのCHAPCHA画像を読み込ませて見ましたが、全て認識することが出来ました。
以上ではてな のCAPTCHAを破ることができたわけですが、ポイントは以下の４つ。
文字の位置がドット単位で固定であるため切り出しが非常に容易
色が限られるため、2値化することが非常に容易
ノイズが加算に限られるためパターンマッチングが非常に容易
文字種が少ないため高い精度で認識しやすい
今回、検証のために書いたプログラムはJavaでおよそ200行程度です。
製作時間は1.5時間程度。swingによるUIがありますから、 純粋なCAPTCHA破りロジックは100行程度になります。
スパマーによる悪用の可能性があるため公開はしませんが、
プログラムに慣れた人間であれば短時間にCAPTCHA破りのコードを書くことができるわけです。
はてなのblogはシェアも大きいですから、コメントスパムの標的にされることは多いと思います。
その点リスクは高く、このように安易に破られるCAPTCHAの実装では、
早晩スパマーによってコメントスパムで荒らされるのではないでしょうか。

[ Eugen von Böhm - Bawerk was the student of Carl Menger and the teacher of Ludwig von Mises .
Like Menger , he rejected the contention of the Historical School that there were no universally valid laws of economics .
In this incisive essay , first published a few months after his passing , in December 1914 , he criticizes the claim that the state has the ability to secure a prosperous economy in sovereign disregard of economic laws . ]
Economic theory , from its very beginnings , has endeavored to discover and formulate the laws governing economic behavior .
In the early period , which was under the influence of Rousseau and his doctrines of the laws of nature , it was customary to apply to these economic laws the name and character of physical laws .
In a literal sense , this characterization was , of course , open to objection , but possibly the term " physical " or " natural " laws was intended merely to give expression to the fact that , just as natural phenomena are governed by immutable eternal laws , quite independent of human will and human laws , so in the sphere of economics there exist certain laws against which the will of man , and even the powerful will of the state , remain impotent ; and that the flow of economic forces cannot , by artificial interference of societal control , be driven out of certain channels into which it is inevitably pressed by the force of economic laws .
Such a law , among others , was considered to be that of supply and demand , which again and again had been observed to triumph over the attempts of powerful governments to render bread cheap in lean years by means of " unnatural " price regulations , or to confer upon bad money the purchasing power of good money .
And inasmuch as in the last analysis , the remuneration of the great factors of production — land , labor , and capital — in other words , the distribution of wealth among the various classes of society , represents merely one case , although the most important practical case of the general laws of price , the entire all - important problem of distribution of wealth became dependent upon the question of whether it was regulated and dominated by natural economic laws , or by the arbitrary influence of social control .
The early economists did not hesitate to decide this question with fearless consistency in favor of the exclusive predominance of " natural laws . "
The most famous , or rather notorious , illustration of this interpretation was the " wage - fund theory " of the classic and postclassic school of economists , according to which the amount of wages was determined by a natural relationship of almost mathematical accuracy thought to exist between the amount of capital available in a country for the payment of wages , the so - called " wage fund , " and the number of workers .
All workers jointly were considered incapable of ever receiving more than the existing " wage fund , " and the average was thought to result with mathematical accuracy from the division of the wage fund by the number of workers .
No artificial outside interference , including strikes , could change the operation of this law .
For if , through a successful strike , the wages of one group of workers were to have been raised artificially , a correspondingly smaller portion of the wage fund would be available for the remaining workers , whose wages would then have to come down accordingly .
A general or average increase of wages above the total of the " wage fund " was held to be out of the question .
Later generations have adopted a different view of this matter and of economic " laws " in general , and have developed different new formulas in accordance with their changed views .
Following the example of Rodbertus and Adolf Wagner , a distinction was drawn between " purely economic categories " and " historic legal categories . "
The former were to include all that was permanent , generally valid , and recurrent in economic phenomena under any conceivable social order ; the latter were to represent the historically varying types , brought about by changed legal systems , laws , or social institutions .
Henceforth , a determining , or at any rate far - reaching influence upon the laws of distribution was ascribed to this latter or " social " category , a term used frequently ever since , especially by Stolzmann .
This may have been right or wrong , but it was certainly not without some justification .
But how far - reaching was the influence of control to be , and how and where was it to be delimited against the influences emanating from the other " categories " ?
These questions were not , and have never been , definitely settled to this day .
A few years ago , at another occasion , I wrote , " Nowadays it would be idiotic to try to deny the influence of institutions and regulations of social origin on the distribution of goods . "
It is obvious that distribution under a communistic order would have to be materially different from that in an individualistic society , based on the principle of private property .
Nor could any sensible person deny that the existence of labor organizations with their weapon of strikes has been of pronounced influence on the fixation of wages of labor .
But , on the other hand , no intelligent person would claim social " price regulation " as being omnipotent and decisive in itself alone .
Often enough one has seen governmental price regulations to be incapable of providing cheap bread in lean years .
Every day we may see strikes failing , when they are directed towards the attainment of wages " not justified in the economic situation , " as it is commonly expressed .
The question , therefore , is not whether the " natural " or " purely economic " categories on the one hand , and the " social " categories on the other , do exert any appreciable influence on the terms of distribution ; that both do , no intelligent person will deny .
The sole question is this : how much influence do they exert ?
Or , as I have expressed myself several years ago , in reviewing an older work by Stolzmann entitled " Die Soziale Kategorie , "
The great problem , not adequately settled so far , is to determine the exact extent and nature of the influence of both factors , to show how much one factor may accomplish apart from , or perhaps in opposition to , the other .
This chapter of economic theory has not yet been written satisfactorily .
I should like to go almost so far as to say that , until quite recently , not even a serious attempt has been made to elaborate this problem by either one of the two great schools that compete with each other in the perfecting of our science : the theoretical school , represented primarily by the well - known " marginal - utility theory , " and the historic or sociological school , which , in its struggle against both the old classicists and the modern marginal - value theorists , likes to place the influence of control ( Macht ) into the very heart of its theory of distribution .
The " marginal - value " school has not ignored the problem confronting us here , but so far , it has not elaborated it extensively ; it has conducted its investigations up to the confines of the whole problem , so to speak , but so far , has stopped at these confines .
So far , it has principally occupied itself with the developing of the laws of distribution under the assumption of free and perfect competition , perfect both in theory and in practice , thus precluding the predominance of one party , as would be implied in the term " influence of control . "
Under this , and the other modifying assumption of the exclusive prevalence of purely economic motives , the marginal - value theory has come to the conclusion that , in the process of distribution , each separate factor of production receives approximately that amount in payment for its contribution to the total production that , according to the rules of imputation , is due to its cooperation in the process of production .
The shortest formulation of this idea is contained in the familiar concept of the " marginal productivity " of each factor .
But in making this contribution , the marginal - value school had furnished only an incomplete skeleton of the theory of distribution as a whole , and it was well aware of this shortcoming .
It never pretended to have fully covered the complex reality with that concept ; on the contrary , it never failed to emphasize , again and again , that its past findings had to be supplemented by a second series of investigations , whose task it would be to inquire into the changes that would be produced in this fundamental concept by the advent of changed conditions , particularly those of " social " origin .
The reason why the marginal - value school took up that part of its investigation first was only that it seemed to require priority in methodical treatment , that primarily one should know and understand how the process of distribution , or more generally , that of price formation took place in the absence of all outside social interference .
First of all , a starting point , or point of comparison , had to be reached from which the changes might be measured that would be produced by the advent of special outside factors of a " social " origin .
The marginal - value theory , thus , as a whole , first laid down a general theoretical frame for the problem in formulating its general value and price theories , and , within that frame , it elaborated in detail only the theory of free competition , while until now it had left a gap where the influence of social " control " should have been studied and described .
This imperfection has always been felt as such ; with every new decade it is being sensed more because in our modern economic progress , the intervention of social means of control is continuously gaining in importance .
Everywhere trusts , pools , and monopolies of all kinds interfere with the fixation of prices and with distribution .
On the other hand , there are the labor organizations with their strikes and boycotts , not to mention the equally rapid growth of artificial interference emanating from the economic policies of governments .
In the eyes of the classical economists , the theory of free competition could claim to be the systematic foundation of the entire problem , as well as the theory of the most important normal case .
But at present , the number and importance of those phenomena that no longer find an adequate explanation in the theory of free competition probably already exceed the number of those cases that may still be explained by that one formula .
Nor has this gap left open by the marginal - value theory ever been filled by that other school of economists , those who place the influence of the " social " category in the foreground .
The reason for this is that they again overestimated the explanatory power of their favorite formulas .
When , with an air of conviction , they proclaimed that under this or that condition , for instance , in the fixation of wages , it was " power " that ultimately decided matters , they thought to have given a content to their explanation , which , if applying at all , was to supplant or exclude explanations on purely economic grounds .
Where power or " control " entered into the price , there was no economic law , they thought , and thus the mere mention of " control " was both the beginning and the end of the explanation to be given .
It was accompanied more often by a fierce denunciation of the " economic laws " developed by other theoretical schools , than by a careful investigation of the question of where and how the two " categories " relate to each other .
Moreover , the term " two categories " was merely a phrase of a rather vague and ill - defined meaning , and thus by no means very suitable to the conducting of clear and penetrating investigations .
At the present time it is probably Stolzmann who may be considered as the typical representative of that school of thought .
Other authors of a similar type , like Stammler or Simmel , may have become more widely known and influential , but Stolzmann has the merit of having tried to follow up , one by one , and to elaborate systematically the suggestions made by older economists , since Rodbertus and Wagner , and then he has the additional asset of having shown himself more familiar with economic theory than many authors starting from different approaches .
He is thus , I think , the one representative of his school best qualified to discuss these basic principles .
Now , Stolzmann declares as the fundamental idea in his theory of distribution that it is not , as taught by the marginal - utility theory , the purely economic conditions of imputation , i.e. , not the contribution of each factor of production to the total , that determine the distribution of the produce among landowner , capitalist , and laborer , but rather that it is social control .
It is " power alone that determines the size of each factor 's share . "
What determines its distribution is not " what each factor of production contributes to the total produce , but what the men standing behind the factors of production are able , by virtue of their control , to command for themselves as remuneration according to the social power exerted by each .
These and similar statements are coupled with an incessant attack on the marginal - value theory based on this very same consideration , that in its theory of distribution it had failed to give any place to the decisive factor of " power , " and instead had reversed into the old " naturalistic " interpretation , the theory of the eternal and unchanging laws of nature .
But obviously this was not a correct method of penetrating into the intricacies of the problem before us .
To have " power " alone determine the manner of distribution was just as one - sided .
It was all too obvious that power could not determine everything in distribution , and that the purely economic factors meant something too .
Nor could this dilemma be solved by a compromise in assigning determining and decisive influence to control , and only a vague and restricted influence to natural forces .
A true solution , it seems to me , is still to be sought , in spite of Stolzmann 's 800 pages , and by other means than evasive dialectics .
Let us then first state what is really before us in this controversy much neglected in economic science : neither more nor less than the scientific foundation of a rational economic policy .
For it is obvious that any artificial outside interference in the economic sphere will be without sense , unless the preliminary question of whether anything can be accomplished through the influence of " power " in opposition to the " natural economic laws " can be answered in the affirmative .
The problem is to gain a clear and correct insight into the extent and nature of the influence of " control " against the natural course of economic phenomena .
This is what we must see , or we shall grope in the dark !
I do not think that this seeing can be facilitated or replaced by simply interchanging two terms for the different causal influences , or by ascribing a merely conditional influence to the former and a determining one to the other .
In the following I shall therefore try to raise a few questions and suggest their answers through which I think the way to understanding must lead .
What I am offering here are nothing but humble suggestions , for I am well aware of the fact that a full systematic treatment would require much more than what is presented here .
And moreover , in making the suggestions , I shall have to mention things most of which have not the least claim to novelty or originality .
For the most part , I shall have to start with self - evident trivialities that are close at hand .
I shall merely present them in a certain connection and lead them into certain conclusions , equally so manifest that they merely need to be formulated with full clarity and purpose .
As I do not wish to repeat obvious things , I do not stop to inquire whether " control " is an influential factor in the determination of prices , generally speaking , and more particularly in distribution .
This I consider to be an accepted fact , settled long ago among all modern economists .
My first question , therefore , is whether this influence of control asserts itself in conformity with , or in contradiction to , the economic laws of price , or whether it counteracts and invalidates the theoretical laws of price , or whether it harmonizes with these .
This question is analogous to one that had to be asked , once upon a time , in the field of production of economic goods :
Is the admitted ability of man artificially to increase the production of goods a power that asserts itself apart from and in contradiction to the natural laws , or something that can take effect only within and in compliance with the natural laws of production ?
As is known , everybody agrees , in regard to this question , that the " power of man over nature " can be exerted only in harmony with the laws of nature and in strict conformity to them .
And I am convinced that once the question before us is explicitly and clearly stated , an analogous consensus of opinion will be easily arrived at : namely , in the problems of price and distribution , " power " ( Macht ) is evidently not asserted apart from or in contradiction to but within and in conformity with the economic laws of price .
Let us first elucidate this with a few familiar illustrations in which the element of power is particularly patent .
There is first the case of usury :
What is it that gives to the usurer that " control " over his victims which is at the bottom of the familiar " extortionate " usury prices ?
Nothing else than those very same factors which the allegedly " pure economic " theory of marginal utility furnishes us in its price formula : it is the urgent want of the borrower , which , but for the usurer , would go unsatisfied ; it is the satisfaction of the most pressing wants that depend on the services obtained from the usurer .
As a result of this , moreover , the subjective value , determined by the corresponding utility , and therewith the upper limits of the possible prices , are being moved up .
And since the borrower finds no aid from any competition among the suppliers of money who would have to underbid each other , there are equally absent all those more subtle price - restricting elements which , in the case of free competition , determine the valuation of the competitors to be contended with on the supply side .
The usurer , through his inflexibility , thus obtains the power to raise his price to almost the extreme upper limit , which corresponds to the high subjective valuation of the hard - pressed borrower .
Or there is the typical case of monopolies .
Each owner of a complete monopoly has the " power " to fix the price of his product at any point he pleases .
He again owes that " power " to the existence of certain classes of demand of the highest intensity on the part of people whose urgent wants and high purchasing power combine toward creating a correspondingly high intensity of demand , together with the factor just explained , that the absence of competitors does not establish any lower limits likely to interfere with their taking advantage of the most intense demand among the buyers .
But the fact that the monopolist 's " power " is rooted in these very economic factors will also determine certain familiar and oft - explained limitations : the monopolist can , after all , never fix the price at a point higher than that close to the valuation of the highest , most intense class of demand , and , moreover , what is still more important , he must always reckon with the restriction of the quantity that can be sold at the higher price .
He can , in other words , never escape the economic law according to which the price is fixed at the intersection of supply and demand , at that , point where equal quantities are offered and taken .
Since he can arbitrarily determine amount and intensity of the supply which he may wish to offer , he may select that point of intersection at a low or at a high point on the scale of possible prices ; but the higher that point is , the smaller will become the number of those remaining on the demand side , and the smaller will be the quantity to be disposed of at that point .
The monopolist thus never has unlimited control ; he merely has the choice within the laws of price of different " economically possible " price levels .
He can select that price at which the combination of profit for each article , and the number of articles to be sold at that price , are likely to promise the greatest total profit , but he cannot exert his " power " in any other way than in conformity with the laws of price , for it is his behavior that establishes the " price law , " namely the conditions of the amount offered at a given price level , but never can he counteract the laws of price .
The same as shown in these typical illustrations will probably always be true , whenever any kind of so - called " economic power " is applied , for it is this kind of power only that concerns our problem , not physical force or direct compulsion .
Highway - robbery or extortion , force of arms or enslavement would , of course , belong to an entirely different category .
But the exertion of economic control never introduces any new element into the determination of price that had not previously found a place in the purely theoretical laws of prices .
What conclusions are to be drawn from these facts in regard to our problem , I shall discuss later .
For the present , let me refer to an important distinction that should be made in this connection between the influence of economic " control " and " non-economic motives . "
For , while the effects of the latter may be contrary to , or conflicting with , the economic laws of price , the exertion of control must always be in conformity with them .
Where non-economic motives , such as generosity , philanthropy , class or race - hatred , national sympathies and antipathies , vanity , pride , and so forth play their part in the fixing of prices and distribution , they may lead to prices at variance with , or contradictory to those to be expected according to the price - law formula .
Whoever is moved by non-economic , outside considerations like friendship or humanitarian impulses to make a gift to the other party of the bargain , may as a buyer consent to a price that will exceed his subjective valuation and as a seller be content with a price far below his own valuation of the goods ; or who , from patriotism or national prejudice , wishes to buy only from his compatriots , may consent to prices higher than those offered by their competitors in foreign countries .
This disturbing effect of noneconomic motives conflicting with the price laws is based on the familiar fact that the economic laws of price apply and claim validity only so long as the conditions on which they are based really prevail by themselves alone , without outside interference ; analogous to the physical law of gravitation which holds true only under the assumption of the exclusive effect of gravitation , as exists for instance in a vacuum , while any interfering disturbances , such as friction or buoyancy as exercised by a balloon loaded with gas , would cause phenomena of motion contradictory to the law of gravitation .
As distinct from that , the price - determining influences emanating from economic " control , " or preponderance of " power , " always remain within and in conformity with the formula laid down by economic theory : they never form an exception to , but always an application of the economic law of price .
From this there follow two things that are of significance to our problem : first that we neither should nor even can make any reservation as to the validity of the economic laws of price and distribution , when the influence of power comes into play .
We need not , in regard to them or the non-economic motives , resign ourselves to the view that out economic laws are valid only so long as no such influence intervenes , as in the case of non-economic motives , that they hold good only in an imaginary world in which such influences are absent , but not in the world of realities in which social power plays a role more pronounced day by day .
Nor should we take that resigned view , which would greatly diminish the usefulness of our theoretical laws and reduce their general validity , that our economic laws need not explain this or that case at all .
And then , this leads to the second conclusion : whoever wishes adequately to set forth the influences of social control in the explanation of price determination should not case aside those laws operating with so - called " purely economic " factors , but he should accept and develop them .
He must not accuse them , as does Stolzmann in regard to the laws of price and distribution developed by the marginal - utility theory , of considering the effects of " natural factors " only , so that these theories would have to be discarded or rejected before one could adequately present the effects of social influences ; no , indeed not ; we should accept these laws and develop them through a careful analysis in those directions in which social forces actually become operative , when we try to formulate their effects on price fixation and distribution .
Our task is not to discard but to develop these allegedly " purely economic " laws of distribution .
The fact that economic control cannot affect the conditions of distribution in any other way than through the medium of the categories of " marginal utility " and " subjective value " is indeed not a remote conclusion , and has been explicitly stated here and there in the past , thus for instance , not so long ago by Schumpeter , who attacked a vague statement by Professor Lexis in his theory of distribution , referring to the influence of power , with these words :
The reference to the relative strength of economic power in itself does not explain anything .
For if one asks what constitutes economic power the answer can only be : the control over certain goods .
And it is only from the economic function of these goods and the subsequent formation of value that a real explanation can be derived .
Is this not just as if somebody were to argue that the speed of a steamship depends not upon the power of her engines in relation to the resistance to be overcome , or the weight to be propelled , etc. , but on the number of rotations of the propellers , which , in turn , of course , depends exclusively upon the power of the engines ?
Nor does that explanation do justice to what Stolzmann has stated at several other places in his writings to be the relation between the natural and the social " category " ; namely , that natural factors operate as " conditions " or " premises , " merely determining the possible limits , whereas within these limits and premises it is the social factors that really " determine " and " decide " matters .
Now it is quite true that , at first , the effect of economic factors is essentially that of delimiting the margins of the price ; the subjective valuations of buyers and sellers merely determine the upper and lower price limit .
But even this " setting " of " limits " may stiffen into actual " fixing " of prices , whenever and wherever the limits from above and below become so numerous and so closely placed that they reduce the interval to a small zone or even to one distinct point , as is generally the case with intense and at the same time perfect competition among many individuals .
Nor does " control , " on the other hand , ever " determine " anything .
It can at best exercise a " constraining " influence , where economic delimitations establish the margin .
He who deals with a needy purchaser , in the absence of competition , has the " power " to fix the price at any point of the probably wide range located between the value of the urgently needed goods to the anxious buyer as the upper limit , and the value of the same article to the not - anxious seller as the lower limit .
But at what exact point of this extensive range the price will ultimately be fixed is not determined by the relative " power " alone , for with equal " power " the philanthropist will make an entirely different price to the poor man than with the usurer .
Or there may be different degrees of skill in bargaining , or in sizing up the position of the other side , of perseverance , of patience , of disregard for public opinion , of defiance or fear , even in case of equal objective " power , " which will move the price to a very different point of the scale .
But when the " relative power " of the two parties seems to fix the price at a quite definite point of the scale , it certainly has again been nothing else than the coincidence of a majority of " restrictive influences " that narrow down the limits from both sides to such an extent that the price level itself appears to be " determined " thereby .
Nor is any other outcome to be expected , for since , as shown before , " economic power " can become effective only through the intermediary determinants of the theoretical price formula , and since these determinants can again fix the price only through a consecutive delimitation , it is obvious that " power " can equally determine prices in no other way than through the fixation of limits ; it does not possess any independent " price - fixing capacity , " as distinct from this " restricting " or " limiting " ability .
From this it will become clear why , in the discussion of these questions , the old terms of " purely economic " or " legal - historic " categories , as Rodbertus called them , or of " natural " and " social " categories , as applied by Stolzmann , are not sufficient .
These terms may have served a purpose in their time .
At least they have , roughly speaking , indicated certain distinctions which should also be kept in mind , and they have been particularly helpful , towards the elimination of the old , one - sided view that there are only " natural laws " operative in our economic life .
But in the theoretical explanation of the phenomena of price and distribution they do not play that role which their authors ascribe to them .
They fail to draw a straight and clear line of demarcation between social phenomena , because these are always permeated by both factors .
A certain amount of the " historical - legal " or " social " element is sure to be present in all economic phenomena .
There is no room left for an opposite , " purely natural " category .
There literally exists no price nor any form of " distribution " ( except perhaps highway - robbery and the like ) without containing at least some legalistic - historical aspect .
For , in every civilized community , there must always exist some social order that will apply when two members of that society get into contact with each other , and thus determine the nature of that contact .
It is , therefore , either saying too little or too much , when anyone claims the phenomena of distribution for the " social , " as distinct from the " natural , " category ; or it is but an empty truism , which , in its very concept , applies to every singly economic or social phenomenon , for obviously a Robinson Crusoe could not even so much as " barter " with himself .
One member of a society can only trade with another if both can acquire ownership of the goods to be exchanged under the existing social order .
Any statement attempting to express more than that truism is too far - reaching .
Thus Rodbertus shoots way beyond the mark , when with that peculiar emphasis he defines interest on capital as being the typical fruit of the existing social order , and denies its " purely economic " justification .
And Stolzmann equally shoots beyond the mark , when he holds that the " social category " alone " determines " distribution , and when he falsely accuses our theory of distribution of teaching purely natural laws of distribution , because it also does justice to the economic foundations of social power .
A closer analysis of social power , however , must inevitably lead straight across the line of demarcation between the " social " and " natural " categories ; power is present on both sides of the line .
Social " control " is not an abstraction or a distilled product in which the influence of the purely social category is reflected as such .
Nor are the explanations given by the marginal - value theory — which Stolzmann calls extremely " naturalistic " — an unmixed distillation of only the natural and purely economic influences .
Instead they always take into consideration certain characteristics of the existing , or an assumed , economic order .
With proper elaboration they will be found capable of expressing the entire influence of social power , but even so , it remains true that prices are determined more or less accurately by the subjective valuations based on the marginal utility .
And it remains equally true that the value of productive goods depends on nothing else but the value of the products to be obtained from them .
In the last analysis , therefore , the value of the factors of production depends on the share of the product attributable to each factor in the productive process .
" Social control " and " social category " are thus not synonymous .
The latter term , like its antithesis " natural " or " purely economic " category , has been so confused and misconstrued that I would prefer to dispense with its use altogether in the interest of a clear presentation .
Where I did use these terms in this or in previous writings , I did so , not because they form part of my own vocabulary , but rather because I could not well avoid altogether the use of a generally accepted term .
In order to make myself understood , I had above all to use the language of those whose opinion I was discussing .
Nor have I failed at earlier occasions to make reservations in this respect .
And now I shall try to submit a few thoughts concerning the direction in which the old economic theory will have to be developed so as to embrace systematically in its teachings the influence of " control " ( Macht , or " outside power " ) .
What I have to say may , I think , best be developed by looking at a typical instance that illustrates price determination through social control in a particularly noticeable manner : the case of the settlement of wage disputes by means of a strike .
According to the accepted formula of modern wage theory , based on the marginal - utility theory , the amount of wages in case of free and perfect competition would be determined by the " marginal productivity of labor , " i.e. , by the value of the product that the last , most easily dispensable laborer of a particular type produces for his employer .
His wages cannot go higher , for if they did , his employer would no longer gain any advantage from employing this " last " laborer ; he would lose , and consequently would prefer to reduce the number of his workers by one ; nor could the wages be substantially lower , in the case of effective competition on both sides , because the employment of the last worker would still produce a substantial surplus gain .
As long as this is true , there would be an incentive to the further expansion of the enterprise , and to the employment of still more workers .
Under an effective competition among employers this incentive would obviously be acted upon , and could not fail to eliminate the existing margin between the value of the marginal product and the wages in two ways : by the rise of wages , caused by the demand for more workers ; and by a slight diminution of the value of the additional produce , due to the increased supply of goods .
If these two factors are allowed to operate without outside interference , they would not only delimit wages , but actually fix them at a definite point , owing to the nearness of these limits , let us say for instance at $ 5.50 for a day 's labor .
But let us now assume competition to be not quite free on both sides , but that it be restricted , or eliminated , on the side of the employers ; either because there exists only one enterprise of that particular branch of industry over a large territory , thus giving it natural monopoly over the workers seeking employment , or because there is a coalition of entrepreneurs within that industry , who mutually agree not to pay their workers a wage higher than , let us say , $ 4.50 .
In either case , this coming into play of " control , " a superior power of the employers , will certainly suffice to lead the wages to be fixed at a point below $ 5.50 , say at $ 4.50 , other conditions remaining equal .
How would this correspond with the standard explanation offered by the marginal - value theory ?
The answer is not difficult .
In fact , the solution has been repeatedly stated in the fairly well developed theory of monopoly prices .
I shall merely try to restate the familiar arguments in a clear and systematic manner .
We have before us a case of " buyers ' monopoly . "
The widest margin within which the monopoly price can be fixed is limited , from above , by the value of the labor to be purchased by the entrepreneur exercising that monopoly , and from below , by the value of unsold labor to the laborer himself .
The upper limit is determined by the value of the produce of the last worker , for the reason that the entrepreneur will not assume any loss from the last worker he employs and that the same amount of labor cannot be paid for in unequal amounts .
This upper limit of the possible wage would , in our illustration , be $ 5.50 .
More is to be said in regard to the lower limit .
The very lowest limit is determined by the utility that would be left to the worker if he were not to sell his labor at all .
It is thus , primarily , the use - value to the worker of his own labor , provided he can make some use of his labor for himself alone .
In thinly populated new countries , with an abundance of unoccupied land , where everybody may become a farmer at will , this labor - value might represent quite a considerable amount .
In the densely populated " old " countries , however , this limit is extremely low , because most of the workers lack capital , and can hardly ever profitably utilize their own labor as independent producers .
A worker who has accumulated some savings may find some compensation for not selling his labor in the escape from discomfort and hard work , or in the enjoyment of rest and leisure .
Those who have any such means of subsistence will figure out just what minimum of wages would compensate them for the effort of working .
To those who have nothing to fall back on , the marginal utility of a money income to be gained by working is so extremely high that even a very low wage will be preferred over the enjoyment of leisure .
In order to illustrate this with actual sums of money , let us assume this lowest limit , the use - value of labor and the enjoyment of leisure , to be very low , say $ 1.50 .
This amount may be even far below the minimum of subsistence , which , for well - known reasons , determines the lower limit of the possible permanent wages without , of course , determining temporary wages or those of each individual case .
But there may also arise other intermediate wage levels .
In the foregoing illustration we have excluded all competition among the employers in that one particular branch of industry .
If such competition were existing , it would inevitably force up the wages to the upper limit of $ 5.50 ; but even in its absence , there would still remain a certain amount of outside competition , namely with employers in all the other branches of industry .
This means that the worker in our particular industry still has the alternative of escaping the very low wage offered to him in his own line , by switching over into other branches of production , although a number of circumstances may greatly reduce the gains to be expected from this expedient .
To change from one occupation , for which one has been trained and adapted , into another , is likely to result in less productivity , and the maximum wage level attainable in the new occupation will be likely to remain far below $ 5.50 .
The curtailment in wages will vary for each worker entering into a new branch of production according to his adaptability , or his ability to perform a different kind of skilled labor .
The most painful cuts in wages will be suffered by that probably largest portion of the workers , who are not adequately trained to perform any other kind of skilled labor , and who will have to switch over from " skilled " into " unskilled " trades , and accept a poorer position in some type of common labor .
Still another slight lowering of the wage level may result from the fact that the influx of new workers into that occupation may force down slightly the marginal productivity of the last worker , and thus lower the wage level for all .
Under the influence of all these circumstances we would now have to assume that the various workers set for themselves a series of individual minimum limits , below which no one would allow his wages to be reduced by the monopolistic pressure of the entrepreneurs .
To illustrate these various gradations of minimum wages , let us assume the minimum of existence to be $ 3.00 , which , as has been said , would represent not the temporary , but the permanently possible lowest wage level .
The wages obtained by the most common type of labor would thus be very near to $ 3 , say $ 3.10 .
A smaller and smaller number of workers could find employment in other occupations , as the wage rate increased in the following ascending sequence : $ 3.50 , $ 3.80 , $ 4 , $ 4.20 , $ 4.50 , $ 4.80 , $ 5 . Note , however , that the upper limit of this wage scale would still remain below the marginal product of the original occupation , thus below $ 5.50 .
What effects and limitations will result from this state of affairs in regard to the monopolistic fixation of wages within the original widest zone of $ 1.50 to $ 5.50 ?
Let us assume , to begin with , that the monopolistic entrepreneurs use their power in an unrestricted , purely selfish policy , unaffected by any considerations of altruism , or consideration of public opinion , uninfluenced by any apprehension that the workers might fight back through means of a labor union or strike , and convinced that they are absolutely assured of an atomized , effective competition among the individual workers .
Under such premises , the rate of wages would be fixed according to the general formula applying to a purely selfish monopoly , already mentioned before in another connection : they would be fixed at that point which promises the largest returns , after a careful consideration of all circumstances , and with due regard to the inevitable fact that with changing prices , the amount of goods to be disposed of profitably will change , only that in the case of a buyers ' monopoly the results are exactly opposite to that of a sellers ' monopoly .
Or stated concretely : the lower is the wage rate fixed by the monopolist , the smaller will be the number of workers available , and from a correspondingly smaller number of workers will the entrepreneurs be able to collect that increased return which might accrue from pushing the wage scale down below the value of the product of the marginal laborer , i.e. , below $ 5.50 ; in fact , this value might even increase through a reduction in the output , which would cause a rise in the price of the finished goods .
Of course , there may again enter certain counteracting tendencies , such as increasing costs , with the restricted expansion of the enterprise , the growth of overhead expenses , etc .
With an increase in wages ( which , however , we always assume to remain below the marginal product of $ 5.50 ) the gain per laborer would decrease ; but , to offset this , the number of workers from which that gain can be made will increase , or even be brought back to normal .
From these considerations , it would be most unlikely that the monopolists could fix the wage rate at $ 1.80 or $ 2.00 or at any point below the minimum of existence of $ 3 , both because this rate would not be likely to remain in force , and because it would be lower than the wage paid outside for common labor , and therefore would at once cause the majority of the workers to withdraw into those unskilled occupations which , in our illustration , receive $ 3.10 .
This danger will diminish gradually with each increase in the wage rate , and disappear almost entirely at some point , say at $ 4.50 , at which only a few exceptional workers might find it possible to obtain higher wages in other skilled occupations , if such be open to them at all .
Under the assumed circumstances , the danger of men withdrawing would have almost disappeared , and a successful attempt might be made by the monopolistic employers to fix the rate of wages at this point , without running the risk of any considerable restriction of output caused through a shortage of workers .
Two other considerations might influence an intelligent monopolist to exercise his power " with restraint . "
First , a wage rate remaining far below that of other skilled occupations may , if only in the long run , lead to a shortage of workers , for while the laborers accustomed to their occupation might hesitate to change their job owing to the difficulties of transition , the new supply would fall off .
Secondly , too high a rate of profit per worker would exert too powerful a strain on the employers ' union , and is likely to lead to a dissolution of the coalition by those members wishing to expand their business , or to the formation of new enterprises outside of the coalition , thus creating new competition , likely to cut down prices and to raise wages .
Generally speaking , the fear of outside competition forms perhaps the greatest safeguard against too unscrupulous a use of monopolies preying on the general public .
I hardly need to re-emphasize the fact that if , under such conditions , through the " control " of the monopolists the wage level were to be reduced from $ 5.50 to $ 4.50 , this would , from first to last , happen by virtue of and in conformity with the elements of the price - law , as formulated by the marginal - value theory .
It is in consideration of these elements that both contending parties would fix the price at that level , by " delimiting " it from above and from below .
By such action , no " fixed " price would be determined , but merely a wider price - range , as distinct from the case of perfect competition on both sides .
The monopolists might just as well decide upon $ 4.20 or $ 4.80 than upon $ 4.50 .
This situation is explained by the fact that several factors entering into the calculation , such as the number of workers likely to drop out at a certain wage level , or the probability of outside competition , are not definitely known , but only to be conjectured .
The monopolists would naturally try to select the most favorable point of the wage scale ; but , owing to the uncertainty of so many elements entering into the fixation of this optimum point , there results a certain more or less elastic zone for its approximate location , just as in ordinary market competition for prices , when negotiations are carried on with covered cards , traders less experienced or less shrewd commit errors in sizing up inside marked situations , so that actual prices are caused to fluctuate over a wide range around the " ideal " market price .
Let us now turn to the other case , equally interesting and complicated , the influence of " control " exerted by labor unions , through the use of their instrument of power , the strike .
Let us retain all previous assumptions with the same figures as above : $ 5.50 for the value of the product of the " last " worker , $ 1.50 as the personal valuation to the workingman of his unsold labor , $ 3 as the minimum of existence , etc. , and introduce into our assumed case only one novel element , namely that the workers of the industry under discussion do not compete against each other , but that they be unionized , and thus be in a position to enforce their joint demand for higher wages by means of a strike .
Now I do not for a moment deny that this coming into play of " power " on the part of the workers may profoundly influence the price of labor .
It might even raise it not only above the level of $ 4.50 , reached in the case of reduced competition among the monopolists , but even beyond the level of $ 5.50 , which would have been attainable under perfect competition .
This last fact is particularly noteworthy and striking , for hitherto we had regarded the value of the marginal product of labor , precisely that $ 5.50 , as the upper limit of the economically possible wage , and at first sight it might look as if " power " could actually accomplish something in contradiction to the price formula of the marginal - value theory , something that did not conform to this law , but disproved it .
Here now enters into our explanation the distinction between marginal utility and total utility , i.e. , the fact that the value of a total aggregate of goods is higher than the marginal utility of each unit , multiplied by the number of units contained in the total .
The fundamental question in the evaluation of a commodity or an aggregate of goods is always how much utility may be derived from the command over the good to be valued .
Under the assumption of competition among all the workers , the thing to be evaluated by the employer is always the labor - unit of each worker .
If the employer had in his employ , for instance , 100 workers , his negotiations with each one of the 100 workers over his wages would merely hinge upon the question of how much additional profits the employers would make by employing that one additional worker , or how much he would lose by not employing this one last worker .
In that case we were fully justified in arriving at the marginal utility of each unit of labor , that is , the increase in output which the labor of the last one of the 100 workers adds to the total output of the enterprise , or $ 5.50 .
But now this is different : in the case of a joint strike of all the 100 workers , the point in question for the employer is no longer whether he is going to run his enterprise with 100 or 99 workers , which to him would mean a difference in the output of $ 5.50 , but whether he is to keep his enterprise going with 100 workers , or not at all .
On this depends not 100 times $ 5.50 , but obviously much more than that , if for no other reason than that labor is what is called a " complementary " good , a good which cannot be utilized by itself alone , without the necessary other " complementary " goods , such as raw materials , equipment , machinery , etc .
If only one man out of a hundred withdraws from the enterprise , the utilization of the complementary factors will , as a rule , be little disturbed .
One single operation — the one which can be dispensed with most easily — will be omitted , or replaced , as far as possible , through a slight change in the division of labor , so that with the deduction of one man , not more is lost than the marginal product of one day 's labor , namely $ 5.50 .
The withdrawal of ten men would cause a more serious disturbance .
But a changed disposition in the use of the remaining ninety workers would probably make it possible to find some way for at least the most important functions to continue unhampered , and the loss again to be shifted to that place where it is least felt .
A continued depletion of the complementary good , " labor , " would make itself felt more and more severely .
While the withdrawal of the first worker would have caused a decrease in the daily production of only $ 5.50 , that of the second might amount to a diminution of the output by $ 5.55 , that of the third by $ 5.60 , and that of the tenth by as much as $ 6 .
If , as would be the case in a strike , all the 100 men walked out , there would be caused a loss , not only of the specific labor product of those 100 men , but additional productive goods would cease to be utilized .
The machinery would have to stand still , the raw materials would lie idle and depreciate , etc .
The loss in the value of the product would increase out of all proportion , far beyond a hundred times the last laborer 's marginal product .
The loss , of course , would be subject to great modifications , according to the actual conditions existing in each case .
If the idle machinery and capital do not suffer any other damage by being idle , the additional loss would merely consist in a postponement of the completion of the respective products from the capital goods , temporarily not utilized on account of the lack of the complementary factor of labor .
Their produce will be obtained in an undiminished amount only at a later period , after the resumption of production .
This loss must at least equal the interest on the dead capital for the period of idleness .
It may amount to more , if the delay should involve added losses , such as the inability to take advantage of favorable business opportunities , whereby indirect depreciations may be incurred .
But the damage would be still further increased if the specific character of the idle capital goods should not only cause a temporary delay , but a definite curtailment in the profits , as for example in the case of perishable raw materials , such as beets in an idle sugar refinery , or agricultural products that cannot be harvested owing to the worker 's strike , unused animal power , such as horses , or the water power of an electric power plant .
The enforced shutdown may also threaten the fixed capital investments , as in mines , where ventilation and water pumps must not stop , lest the entire plant be destroyed .
How does all this affect the fixation of wages in the case of a strike ?
Let us realize , first of all , that although the wage disputes are formally concerned with the per capita wages for each individual worker , to the manufacturer it is always a question of obtaining , or not obtaining , the total labor of these 100 workers .
He will either get all of the workers , or none , according to whether the negotiations lead to an agreement , or to a break .
The decision as to how much wages he can pay at most will thus hinge on the value that the hundred workers represent to him jointly .
The per capita wage is a secondary item , and is determined by dividing the total value by the number of workers .
To him , this quota represents only an arithmetical concept , not a value ; to him it does not represent the value of a unit of labor .
But how high is the total value ?
This is explained by the theory of imputation .
The value of that aggregate of labor is derived from the value of that amount of products which may be ascribed to the availability of that particular total of labor , and this again is identical with the amount of the product of labor .
Here comes into play a remarkable phase of the theory of imputation , which I recently had to defend in detail against differing opinions .
For if the withdrawal of that amount of labor , whose value we are trying to ascertain , not only prevented the use of that labor itself , but also stopped the use of other , complementary goods , the utility of these goods would have to be added to that of labor , regardless of the fact that under certain circumstances the use of labor might have to be imputed to its corresponding complementary good , without which the products could not be obtained .
I shall merely recapitulate here without detailed discussion the various steps of the argument leading to this conclusion .
Fundamentally , the total value of a whole group of complementary goods is dependent upon the amount of the ( marginal ) utility which they possess jointly , and thus , in case of complementary productive goods , upon the value of their common product .
The distribution of this total value among the various units of the complementary group may take different directions , according to the different causation .
If none of the units admits of any other use than joint use , and if , at the same time , no one member contributing toward the joint use is replaceable , then every single member has the full total value of the entire group , while the other members are valueless .
Each complementary unit is equally capable of holding either one of the two valuations , and it is solely the outside circumstances that determine which one of them shall be worth " everything , " by being absolutely essential in the ultimate completion of the group , or which one is worth " nothing " through its isolation .
In our case of an impending strike of all the hundred workers , the employer is threatened with the total loss of the joint gain arising from the use of the two complementary groups , labor and capital , to the extent stated above , and this is why in that case he would have to attribute to labor that total joint utility , including that part which under other conditions might have to be attributed to the complementary capital goods .
His subjective valuation of labor must be based upon all these things .
Consequently , the upper limit for the highest rate of wages will advance .
For all the hundred workers jointly it will rise beyond the hundred - fold amount of the single value of each day 's labor , that is , beyond 100 times $ 5.50 , at least by the amount of the interest of the capital left idle and perhaps even above this , by the amount of the actual loss from perishing or deteriorating complementary capital goods .
Thus , for instance , in case there be merely a postponement or loss of interest , it would rise above $ 550 , up to , say , $ 700 for each day ; in case of a direct loss in the utilization of the complementary goods , it would rise in proportion to the extent to which an actual loss takes place , perhaps to $ 1000 , perhaps even to $ 2000 per day .
And the maximum of the economically possible wage level for each individual worker would thereby rise from $ 5.50 to $ 7 or even to $ 10 or $ 20 .
This means that with any wage level remaining below this maximum , the entrepreneur would , at least for the time being , fare better than if he were to cease employing all the hundred men .
This " faring better " need , however , not imply actual profits to the entrepreneur , but merely a smaller loss than he would incur in the other alternative — the " lesser evil , " which is , of course , to be preferred to the greater one .
This rise of the last possible per capita wage to $ 7 or to $ 20 , on the other hand , does not represent the subjective valuation of one day 's labor to the entrepreneur .
This has already been stated in the foregoing and it can hardly be sufficiently emphasized .
The employer would never pay that wage , if it were a question of employing one laborer only .
It represents the hundredth part of the total value of 100 laborers , which is a very different unit from the individual value of each unit of labor .
In the wage negotiations between an employer and a labor union the range would thus be limited by the value to the laborer of his unsold labor ( i.e. , the amount of $ 1.50 as his lowest limit ) , and by the per capita quota of the total value of all 100 laborers at the rate of $ 10 as upper limit , to take one of the three figures as an illustration .
In our imagined case , direct competition being absent on both sides , entrepreneur and workers would meet each other within their limits on similar grounds , just as the two parties of buyers and sellers meet in the case of isolated exchange .
In theory , it would not be unthinkable nor impossible for the rates to be fixed at any single point within the wide range between $ 1.50 and $ 10 .
We have , of course , come to know some circumstances that make it appear rather unlikely , though not altogether economically impossible , that the wages be fixed within the lowest section of the zone lying between the absolutely lowest limit and the minimum of existence of unskilled labor ; and for reasons of similar nature , it is not very likely that the wage rate would be raised up to a point near the upper limit of $ 10 .
That it could not be kept at such a point for any length of time I shall try to demonstrate in a future investigation which I consider of special theoretical import .
But not even temporarily will it readily be pushed so high .
For any wage level substantially exceeding the output of the " last worker " would meet with a strong and increasing opposition on the part of the employers as involving a loss to them .
Before granting such a wage rate , they would probably prefer to risk the decision of the supreme trial , consisting in fighting matters out in a lockout or strike ; although an intermediate wage , approximating the actual service of the last worker , might conceivably be granted by the employers , anxious to avoid the risk of the certain losses involved in a strike , and the added uncertainty of its outcome .
Nor would workers find it to their advantage to push the wages up to level actually causing losses to the entrepreneur , for this again might threaten them with a restriction , or suspension , of work , and force them out of their jobs .
Thus there enters the question about the permanency of wages , which will be investigated later .
On the other hand , the workers ' difficulties will become all the greater by the strike , the more excessive wage demands they make .
The threat from strike breakers or " scabs " from other branches of industry will increase with the more favorable terms which the entrepreneur can still grant below the refused rate of wages .
If the striking workers should insist on a wage rate of $ 9 , a wage of $ 7 may perhaps already contain a very tempting premium to scabs and substitutes , who in other occupations requiring similar qualifications may obtain only a wage of $ 5.50 , corresponding to the output of the last worker .
And once substitutes are employed , the cause of the strike is usually lost , whereas , in the other alternative , the outcome is by no means certain .
In a strike , that party wins , as a rule , which , popularly speaking , can " hold its breath " for the longest time .
To the worker , the strike means unemployment .
For the time being the worker may meet this loss by means of savings accumulated for this purpose , by subventions from strike funds , by consuming his property , by selling or pawning dispensable goods , or by incurring debts as far as his credit will permit .
With the longer duration of the strike , these savings will become smaller and smaller until they are used up .
During the period of gradual diminution of savings , the marginal utility of the rapidly decreasing means of subsistence goes up , more and more of essential wants go unsatisfied , and more and more of the vital necessities are neglected , with the increasing shortage of funds .
Finally the point is reached at which the very maintenance of life depends on a renewal of income through work , if only at a modest wage : at this point even the most obstinate resistance of the strikers is broken — provided , of course , that the resistance of the opposite party , the employer , is not crushed beforehand .
In the ranks of the employers there are the same phenomena .
With the increasing duration of the strike , the desire for a settlement becomes more and more intense .
The idle plant produces no income .
Some of the costs of production and at least the personal living expenses of the manufacturer continue , and have to be met .
If the entrepreneur has a large fortune , these expenses may be covered from that .
If not , then the pressure of the strike will be felt much more rapidly and intensely .
In any case , there are here two very distinct phases of the effects of the strikes that should be distinguished .
The successive and increasing lack in the means of subsistence may first threaten the business of the entrepreneur , and then , if there are no funds left for the most urgent living expenses , his personal existence .
This latter , more intense effect of strikes , will normally arise only in the most exceptional cases .
Nor is it likely , for these and similar reasons stated before , that in a strike wages will be fixed at the most extreme — neither at the very lowest nor at the very highest — marginal regions of the wide range " economically possible , " at least for the time being .
In our illustration this zone was assumed to extend from $ 1.50 to $ 10 , and a wage rate below $ 3 would be just as unlikely as one above $ 8 , although , as I want specially to emphasize , such extreme wage rates are not unthinkable , nor altogether economically out of question for a short period of time .
Most of what has been said so far is based on obvious and almost trivial facts and observations which have become sufficiently familiar through common experiences with strikes .
I have merely restated these matters , so to speak , in the terms of the marginal - utility theory , in order to make plain the essential point of the theoretical principle under discussion , namely , that the " influence of power " in the case of strikes , so familiar to all engaged in industry , is not altogether distinct from , or opposed to , the forces and laws of the marginal utility theory , but wholly in conformity and in harmony with these , and that every deeper analysis of the question , through what intermediate agencies and to what marginal points " power " may control the course of events at all , must lead into the more specific exposition of marginal utility , in the theory of imputation , where the ultimate explanation is to be sought and found .
There is another far more interesting question :
When will the terms of distribution , obtained through means of power , be of lasting effect ?
This question is all the more interesting , in that it is by far the most important one .
Even the most ephemeral fixation of prices or wages may have considerable importance to that group of individuals or for that short span of time that happens to be affected by it .
On the other hand , these temporary fixations mean little or nothing for the permanent economic welfare of the various social classes ; just as the classical economists have held long - trend prices to be far more important and challenging than momentary fluctuations ; thus Ricardo hardly touched upon the latter , and found it worthwhile only to elaborate the theory of long - trend prices .
Similarly , in the theory of distribution , paramount importance is attached to the permanent trends according to which the shares of the various factors of production tend to be distributed as distinct from all ephemeral and temporary fluctuations .
Even the most ephemeral phenomena must also be understood and explained , if for no other reason than that the laws controlling them are , in the last resort , not different from those determining their permanent effects ; but it goes without saying , that that phase of our theory which covers those cases outlasting the others in time and space will be far more important to us than the explanation of rapidly passing exceptions .
But there is a second reason why it seems to me that the consideration of the influences of " power " deserves greater attention from the viewpoint of their permanency , for , as far as my knowledge of economic literature goes , this most important phase of the subject has never been investigated .
While the problem of the influence of power on prices as such has hitherto been only scantily treated , and never in a systematic manner , in economic theory , fundamental investigations into the permanent effects of such influences of power seem to be totally lacking , so that here we enter , in a certain sense , upon literary virgin land .
Let me again start from our concrete illustration , and discuss , one by one , the various alternatives .
What is typical and generally true in each individual case will thus easily become clear , and , moreover , specially stressed and summarized at the end .
Temporarily , as we have seen in our assumed conflict between the power of entrepreneurs and workers , any wage rate between $ 1.50 and $ 10 was economically possible , although it was not likely to be fixed , not even for a short period , near the extreme upper of lower limit possible , but rather somewhere near the middle of the total range of wages .
In order to make our discussion theoretically exhaustive , we shall have to consider both extremes , as well as each one of the possible rate levels within the total range of wages .
I need not waste any words about the fact that a wage rate below the minimum of existence — thus in our example below $ 3 — cannot possibly be permanent .
This follows from the familiar reasons stated often and in detail elsewhere , pointing to the diminution of the labor supply as the inevitable consequence of a wage level no longer sufficient for the support of the workers ' families , and to the subsequent increase of wages , necessitated by the law of supply and demand — allowing , of course , for familiar exceptions in favor , or rather in disfavor , of those exceptional types of occupations which are being followed merely as a sideline by people who draw their real means of subsistence from other sources .
Nor can wages be fixed permanently below the rate of the most common type of labor , in our illustration , below $ 3.10 .
This hardly needs any further explanation , for the reason that all the causes applying to point 3 which follows , will evidently apply here too , even to a greater degree .
The exceptions , familiar since Adam Smith , for occupations connected with special attractiveness or privileges and in which , therefore , many people are satisfied with a smaller remuneration than that available in other less attractive or less honorable occupations , will , of course , also apply here , without , however , affecting the general theory of distribution .
Wages higher than those of common labor , but below the " marginal product of the last laborer " ( in our illustration , wages between $ 3.10 and $ 5.50 ) , will hardly be able to remain in force , if imposed through temporary preponderance of power , certainly not when the use of that power was limited to one particular group , such as to the workers of a single factory , or to a single branch of production , while in other occupations , requiring the same or a similar amount of skill , wages prevail commensurate with the natural amount of the marginal product ( in our case , of $ 5.50 ) .
For although the personal discomfort connected with a change of occupation may prevent a large - scale exodus of an entire generation of skilled workers from a less remunerative branch of production into other , better - paid occupations , the gradual effect upon the selection of occupation among the younger generation of workers will be all the greater .
They will naturally seek the better - paid occupations , and shun those with exceptionally poor wages .
Normal deficiencies in the original stock of workers will no longer be met , and the gradual depletion of employees will ultimately force the employers to offer their workers a wage rate equal to that obtainable in other industries of a similar type .
A more complex analysis would have to be made in the case of a universal reduction of wages through artificial forces affecting all lines of production .
Such a contingency is , however , far less likely ever to occur , for the reason that a universal coalition of entrepreneurs of all branches of industry which alone could exert such control would be extremely hard to organize , and still harder to hold together .
But let us assume such a case , at least for a certain period of time , for our theoretical analysis .
Obviously , the worker would then no longer find it possible to escape into another , more remunerative branch of production , and thus there would cease to exist that most influential factor , which , in the case of a partial reduction of wages , would sooner or later ensure the restoration of the original wage rate .
Instead , there would now appear some new , although slow - working , factors within the ranks of the entrepreneurs .
A wage level fixed below the marginal productivity of labor results in a special gain that goes to the employer , first , in the form of an increased profit , which , however , in case of a prolonged continuance of this condition , will have to be surrendered in part to the capitalist in the form of higher interest , for the reason that pending on and owing to this condition other equally profitable types of investment will be open to capital .
The very fact of an increased entrepreneur 's profit will in itself alone work as an incentive to the expansion of existing enterprises ( this incentive might perhaps be temporarily curbed by binding the old entrepreneurs to coalition agreements ) and also to the formation of new enterprises founded by outsiders , not belonging to the coalition , who , of course , can attract the needed number of workers only by offering somewhat higher wages .
The increased interest rate , moreover , will shift the margin of profits among the various more or less capitalistic methods of production toward those with more machinery , labor - saving devices , and so forth .
An increased interest on capital and a cheaper supply of labor will transform the smaller profits into losses among those producers near the margin of profitability , especially in these enterprises where a low rate of interest prevails coupled with higher wages , so that where previously a slight advantage had been found to exist in a more capitalistic method of production , it now becomes more profitable to reverse the methods of production through increase in the use of manpower , and a less intense use of capital equipment .
Naturally , this incentive will not lead to quick results .
Capital invested in such a manner in instruments of production will not suddenly be abandoned , but rather tend to be used up first , or at least not be replaced , because human labor , having become cheaper , will be preferred in its place .
This again will lead to an increased demand for labor which can only be met by granting somewhat higher wages .
These , of course , must not completely neutralize the advantages of the less capitalistic method of production .
This motive may be operative both within and without the employers ' coalition , and to a very different degree among the various types of producers .
It will be hardly at all operative among those who had employed very little fixed capital and much physical labor ; very little among those with whom capital predominates to such great technical advantage that even considerable changes in the level of wages or interest will not bring about any transition towards a less capitalistic method ; but far more among a third group of producers , whose technical equipment is such as to divide their methods of production just equally between machinery and labor .
These great individual differences will not remain without profound influence on the probable course of events .
Industrial coalitions comprising the producers of one and the same line of industry , or of similar industries will as a rule be based on a harmony of interest , sufficient to favor a continuation of the coalition that benefits all members equally .
But if the coalition should include certain groups whose interest makes them disagree in regard to the desirability of a continuance of the coalition , then in all human experience , harmony cannot be maintained , particularly not when the inevitable appearance of outsiders pierces a hole through the victorious phalanx of entrepreneurs .
All employers , of course , stand to gain to some extent by keeping the wages down , but these gains will differ widely in the various industries , according to the physical distribution of capital and labor .
In those branches of production in which this gain is comparatively small , it may be neutralized by the enforced inability to expand or to introduce more profitable methods of production .
Now , if an industrialist sees that the benefits he has sacrificed in favor of the coalition are unscrupulously reaped by outsiders and feels their competition more and more keenly , then the psychological moment has come for his withdrawal from the ranks of the coalition ; for those industrialists whose particular situation would enable them to profit most from an expansion and a change in their methods , in violation of the rules of the coalition , will prefer to reap these advantages for themselves , before their last chance has been destroyed by outsiders .
And that is the beginning of the end of the coalition : the reappearance of a steadily widening stream of competitors with the final effect that the wage level will again be raised from that dictated by superior control to the level of free competition , i.e. , to the level of the marginal product !
This kind of deductive reasoning may perhaps be found to be convincing only in part .
But it should be remembered that in problems of this nature there are no other than deductive methods at our disposal .
We shall never be so fortunate as to assemble reliable direct observations , or to make experimental tests .
The assumed employers ' coalition embracing all industries has never actually existed , and if it should ever come into being , it would soon disappear again , like all social groupings , and it could not even be considered as an empirical proof of my deductions .
The question might still be , whether its dissolution was caused by the factors cited in my deduction , or by some other , new factors .
The reasons given in my argument can , by their very nature , operate gradually only .
And conditions would hardly remain unchanged for so long a period as might be necessary to produce these effects .
One would never be able to determine beyond a question through purely empirical methods , whether the ultimate result was due to the gradual undermining influence brought about by these alone within the original state of affairs , or whether , and to what extent , it might be ascribed to the advent of new factors .
But precisely because we are dependent in these questions upon deduction as the sole source of our knowledge , and because they cannot be verified through direct observation , as is possible in other cases , we have no choice other than to elaborate such deductions ; and these , of course , must be made on the basis and according to the methods of economic theory , which alone after all , as we have seen , will explain the influences of outside power .
At the same time , we must observe that supreme caution and precaution which the use of the deductive method always requires , particularly where the lines of deductive reasoning are long and complex , and where it is not possible to check them up , step by step , through empirical observations .
It is from these considerations that I wish to submit here and in the following pages a few suggestions which , I realize , constitute only a rough , unfinished sketch of such deductive thoughts as may lead to a more detailed investigation later on , and in a general way at least , may indicate the direction in which , in my opinion , the attainable amount of knowledge and understanding may be found .
Let us then continue our inquiry into the wage rates located above the level of the marginal product ( within the range of possible wages ) , and beginning from above , start with the highest conceivable rates .
It is obvious without any further discussion that such extremely high wages cannot endure , because they would cause such great capital losses to the entrepreneur that their perpetuation would lead to bankruptcy , although temporarily they might represent the minor evil as against a prolonged shutdown .
( See above . )
Nor can the wage level following next , as is equally obvious , remain in force permanently because , though not threatening the entrepreneur with immediate financial ruin , it would still cause him actual losses , although of a smaller extent .
If continued over a long period of time , even small losses must also lead ultimately to financial ruin , so that case 5 would flow over into case 4 ; and without doubt , in such cases the entrepreneurs would prefer to liquidate their unprofitable business , or at least give up the unprofitable branches .
The greatest theoretical interest attaches to the next - following level of wages : can that wage rate endure which , though not causing any actual loss of capital to the entrepreneur , absorbs or reduces the interest on his capital investment ?
Let us first answer a preliminary question .
Would it be possible for the entrepreneur 's profits proper to disappear or to be permanently reduced , while in other branches of business , such as in the loan market or unproductive investments like real estate ( apartment houses ) , the rate of interest remained unchanged ?
The answer is emphatically , No !
Entrepreneurs working with borrowed capital would suffer an actual loss from the difference between the higher rates of interest that they would have to pay to their creditors , and the lower rate which that capital would bring them in their business , and thus the matter would lead back into the situation presented under point 5 above .
Nor would those entrepreneurs who work wholly or in part with their own capital be able to stay in business under such a state of affairs .
Once capital is invested in an enterprise , it may have to content itself with a lower rate of interest , when and because its withdrawal would not be feasible nor possible without a great depreciation of the capital stock itself .
There would be little inducement to replace used - up capital funds , if the investment should promise a smaller return to its owners than the same capital could produce in other kinds of investments , such as in real estate or in the loan market .
And the familiar and often - discussed causes which , generally speaking , tend to equalize the interest rate in the various markets of capital ( not artificially isolated ) would surely also tend to prevent a one - sided diminution or elimination of the entrepreneur 's original capital gains .
Their reduction would thus either have to extend all over the other fields of capital employment , or they could not occur at all .
The question under investigation thus assumes the following form : " Can that wage rate remain in force permanently which , though not affecting the entrepreneurs ' capital stock , takes away capital interest from business , or at least reduces the ' natural ' rate of interest prevailing under free competition ? "
In other words , can a wage increase obtained by the use of power permanently absorb interest on capital , or reduce it below its natural level ?
The rather difficult answer to this question will be somewhat facilitated if we investigate separately the two stages involved , namely , the total and the partial absorption of interest on capital .
I consider it impossible that interest could disappear completely from a nation 's economic life , with the exception of the almost unthinkable case , hardly applying here , of capital accumulation far exceeding all demand .
The disappearance of the " incentive to thrift , " contained in interest , would eliminate that most important portion of capital , which is formed through savings made only for the sake of interest .
It might happen , of course , that that other type of savings , intended as a " rainy - day penny , " might then be somewhat increased , if people were to provide for their future by accumulating capital alone , without the support of interest .
But it is generally believed that on the whole there would result a substantial diminution of capital stock , and the subsequent shortage of capital supply would probably exert a strong pressure in the opposite direction , i.e. , in the direction of a renewed increase , rather than in that of a permanent disappearance of interest .
But even though the supply of capital were to be reduced , the thing that would be of decisive importance is the demand side of capital .
Let us assume for a moment that interest had actually disappeared from economic life , i.e. , that present and future goods could be exchanged for each other on the same level without discount , and that loans could be obtained without interest .
The inevitable consequence of this would be an increase exceeding all bounds in the demand for present goods .
The empirical law of the larger productivity of time - consuming , more highly capitalistic , roundabout methods of production , could not fail to make itself felt , in the sense that industrialists would compete with each other in lengthening the periods of production , and would adapt their enterprises to the technically most economical , but at the same time , most extended and time - consuming methods of production .
The automatic check that counteracts such tremendous lengthening of the productive process at present would have ceased to exist ; that check is the interest payment that automatically places a progressive tax on lengthened methods of production .
But once the lengthened method of production were freed from the burden of interest , and did not cost more than the shorter one , and at the same time , produced more than the latter , a general incentive to an enormous prolongation of the productive process would be called forth .
It would , however , find its physical limitation in the diminished subsistence fund of the workers during the increased period of waiting , imposed by the lengthened period of production .
From the existing , and possibly reduced , subsistence fund , it would be impossible to support the same number of workers for an indefinitely prolonged period of waiting .
Instead , the trend of wages will necessarily be held down from two sides within the margins of the possible price range .
First , the duration of the periods of production , although somewhat longer , will be restricted to the shortest possible time through a process of selection which will be made under free competition in favor of the most profitable among the various possible extensions of the productive process ; and as this selection can only be effected in regard to the most effective part of demand by granting higher prices , which means , in this case , by granting a correspondingly higher premium on the demanded subsistence fund , then , at least in regard to this phase of the inevitable development , interest will be restored to business — as I have described more fully in my Positive Theory of Capital .
But at the same time something else will happen .
The just - described process of selection leads to a restoration of interest and the periods of production will no longer be indefinitely lengthened , although they will still continue to be somewhat longer .
The entrepreneurs , who profit by paying the highest premium on present goods , will under normal circumstances be forced to resort to longer periods of production than they employed originally .
For while before the advent of wage increases , the permanency of which we are investigating , they had to pay only as much for interest and wages jointly as they now have to pay for the increased wages alone , now , moreover , they have to pay for the restored interest .
This condition can only be met through larger profits than before , and these increased profits can be made only through a corresponding lengthening of the period of production , unless we should invoke the advent of new inventions with a subsequent increase in the output , like a deus ex machina , instead of concluding our argument by sticking to the original assumptions .
But then it would be impossible for the same number of workers as before to be provided for throughout this extended period of production out of the existing reduced , rather than increased , subsistence fund .
There must therefore be a limitation in another direction , a restriction in the number of employed workers , in approximately the same proportion in which the subsistence fund has been extended .
This physical necessity will be met economically through the motive of self - interest , with high wages and a low interest rate under a more capitalistic method of production ; that is , the employment of fewer workers in lengthened periods of production is more profitable .
As long , therefore , as the enforced wages prevail at that high level , there will come about a provisional state of equilibrium of approximately this description :
The general adoption of the lengthened period of production will tend to increase the workers ' per capita output .
The " marginal product of labor " will thus be increased , as also by a reduction in the number of workers , and it will now correspond with the enforced higher wage level that had risen beyond the " marginal product " of the previous stage .
Interest on capital that has been restored is now lower than previously .
The entrepreneurs manage to survive because , with the increased " marginal productivity of labor , " even the last worker in their employment will still produce to them the higher wage to be paid , and also because the surplus productivity of the entire lengthened process of production will leave them a sufficient amount above the wage increase to compensate them for the interest on capital .
But this new equilibrium is possible only at the expense of employing a smaller number of workers .
And it is for this reason that , in all probability this temporary equilibrium will again be disturbed .
For now , the labor union will be split in two , one group employed at a high wage , and another group not employed at all .
The greater an increase in wages has been enforced and the more the new methods of production are protracted , the bigger will be the number of unemployed .
Two developments are possible .
Both groups of workers may stay together within the union , which implies that the unemployed members would have to be supported by contributions from their employed fellow workers .
If these contributions are large , they will absorb the surplus accruing to the workers from the wage increase , for it should not be overlooked that the total output that can be produced by a reduced number of workers with the same capital , must , even with improved methods of production , remain below that obtainable from a full employment of capital and labor .
Thus , nobody would be benefited from the new artificially created order of things ; as against the previous " natural " order ; many would indeed be at a disadvantage , which fact would again be distinctly unfavorable to the prolonged maintenance of a situation created through a strong combined pressure of power .
But if the standard of living of the unemployed workers were to be substantially reduced , these latter again would not allow such a condition to persist ; there would be discontent , discord , and ultimately dissolution of the union .
The malcontents would sooner or later become outsiders , and compete by offering their services to the entrepreneurs ; the revived competition , with its underselling , would put an end to the monopolistic dictation of wages back to the level economically justified under the full employment of all workers , i.e. , to the " marginal product " of the last worker employed in an again reduced period of production .
If , ultimately the employed workers should fail to provide for their unemployed fellow workers , then the same process would take place , even more rapidly .
The mass of the unemployed would enter into competition and even more violently underbid wages .
One might perhaps think of an alternative in another direction ; namely , that the unionized workers might enforce not only higher wages , but also the full employment of all workers at that higher wage rate .
But even though the workers might have the power temporarily to enforce these conditions , they could not be permanent .
For this would necessarily lead over into one of the two alternatives considered above , under numbers 4 and 5 .
By being forced to pay the workers not only a wage that in itself is higher than the entire amount of the original interest on capital , and in addition to this a restored interest on capital ( although somewhat smaller in the aggregate ) , the entrepreneur will find that his costs have increased , and he will suffer losses and sooner or later abandon the enterprise , or go into bankruptcy .
Moreover , it is almost unthinkable that any employer could ever be compelled to employ all workers available at a given time .
At best , the labor union may , through violence , prevent dismissals from the former stock of workers .
But any attempt to enforce the employment of additional workers , in proportion to the natural deficiencies in their ranks , or even that of an increasing number of workers , corresponding to the natural growth of population , would be well - nigh impossible .
From all these considerations , which could and probably ought to be elaborated in far more detail , I believe that a complete absorption of interest and capital through artificial , enforced wage increases is out of the question in the economic life of a nation .
But would , perhaps , even the partial elimination of natural interest on capital be permanently possible ?
I do not see any reason for assuming a course of events differing from the one assumed above .
A smaller increase in wages at the expense of interest on capital will cause exactly the same reactions and effects , only in a correspondingly smaller degree .
A mere reduction in the interest rate will at first not destroy the premium for saving contained in interest , but merely diminish it ; the effect of this on the amount of future savings cannot be predicted with certainty .
Possibly the amount of savings would decrease , and possibly not .
But this would not alter the general trend of events , as shown in the preceding chapter of this inquiry , where I have purposely mentioned incidentally only , the probable reduction in the supply of capital , without ascribing to it any decisive influence .
The determining factor is to be found in the demand for capital , and in this phase of the problem it is inevitable that each increase in wages beyond the actual marginal product , followed by a reduction in the interest - rate , will tend to cause a lengthening of the methods of production and thus a diminution in the number of workers .
If the entrepreneur is not to suffer any actual loss , which he could not take for any length of time , the wage increase must be covered by an increased marginal productivity of labor , which can best be brought about through an extension of time for the various stages of production .
This again , under otherwise equal circumstances , can be accomplished only by a simultaneous reduction in the number of workers , unless improvements through inventions , etc. , should happen to be introduced , or other developments of an accidental nature should take place , contingencies which can be left out of account .
Enforced unemployment of a portion of the workers would also tend to lead toward the dissolution of the labor union , only in a less intense degree , in accordance with the smaller extent of wage increases attained by the labor union , under this assumption .
The weakening of the forces counteracting the continuance of such a temporary condition does not mean a different result , but merely the postponement of effect .
It cannot mean that an adjustment exceeding the natural limits , if only by very little , could last , nor can it mean that the suspension of a smaller number of workers would not cause them to compete for employment .
But it does mean that such a condition will continue to exist for a longer period against the pressure of minor influences , so that , for instance , trifling losses caused by this temporary situation could be borne for a considerably longer time by the employers , before they would go into bankruptcy or go out of business ; or else a small number of the unemployed might be supported from union funds for a longer period , or , through moral pressure , be prevented from underbidding the union members .
And this again may imply something else .
As I have already shown above , protracted periods of time are likely to bring in their wake changes in other directions .
If a process of economic change is spread over a certain length of time , its general progress will , in most cases , be affected by other incidental or independent outside causes , which almost spontaneously will affect the general situation .
Over a period of several years , methods of production , or the business cycle , never remain unchanged .
The latter may move up or down , the former will most likely progress , and if the interval is very long , there may even occur considerable changes in the general economic structure , such as the number of population , and their relation to the capital stock .
Besides this , another alternative is possible .
Those very impulses , whose normal effects I am trying to observe and investigate , may themselves contain certain additional , almost accidental effects on other external factors .
For example , they need not necessarily , but may , affect the technique of production .
These chances should thus not be left altogether out of consideration , but should not be inserted as a factor in the series of deductions , as they cannot be foretold with absolute certainty .
In our case , for instance , the entrepreneurs may find themselves pressed by the enforced wage increase , and this may form a powerful and effective incentive for the adoption of technical improvements in the methods of production , just as free competition is generally credited with forming a powerful incentive to industrial progress .
Or it may happen that the permanent improvement in the standard of living attained by the workers by way of an enforced wage increase may retard the growth of population , as is commonly the case among wealthier classes , etc .
Now , should some accidental or incidental development occur that would directly or indirectly increase the marginal productivity of labor , then it may also happen that the initial wage increase , exceeding that marginal productivity , might subsequently counterbalance the unexpected increase in the marginal productivity , and thus remain in force permanently .
This would be all the more frequent , the less excessive the original enforced wage increase had been , i.e. , the less it had gone beyond the marginal productivity of labor existing at that time .
But of course , in the case of small wage increases , it is impossible to expect this with any degree of certainty , because such accidental events as these may fail to take place , or even have opposite effects .
Business cycles may show a downward trend , population may increase more rapidly than capital supply , etc. , in which case wages would be reduced all the more rapidly .
Those cases , however , in which a subsequent change of economic environment may render permanent an originally excessive wage increase obtained through force , might tend to confuse the theoretical analysis .
They appear to give empirical proof of the fact that , through the dictate of power , wages can be raised above the limits laid down by marginal productivity , not only for the time being , but with a lasting effect .
On close observation , however , they do not furnish this proof .
The original wage increase was the effect of a dictate of power .
Its permanent duration , however , is not the result of power , but of outside influences of a third order , which have increased the marginal productivity of labor , and with that increased the possible permanent higher wage level , quite independently from the dictate of power , or at least without necessary connection with it .
I shall have to return to this point further on , in summarizing the results of this investigation .
Before that , however , for the sake of completeness , I shall have to consider a seventh possibility , so small , however , in practical importance , as to be out of all proportion to its theoretical complexity .
In the scale of the possible wage rates , there enters , between that wage that already absorbs a part of the interest and that wage level which coincides with the marginal product of labor , another rate of wages which , though exceeding the marginal productivity of labor , does not cut into the reward of capital with this excess amount , but remains within the total produce of labor .
For when an increasing number of workers cooperate with a given stock , each additional worker entering the field will contribute only a decreasing addition to the joint product .
The last worker employed at a given time adds the " marginal product " ; each one previously hired adds a little more to the total product .
That is why the entrepreneur gains nothing from the last worker employed — provided his wages just equal th
Scientists from the University of Pennsylvania have developed nanowires capable of storing computer data for 100,000 years and retrieving that data a thousand times faster than existing portable memory devices such as Flash memory and micro-drives , all using less power and space than current memory technologies .
Ritesh Agarwal , an assistant professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering , and colleagues developed a self - assembling nanowire of germanium antimony telluride , a phase - changing material that switches between amorphous and crystalline structures , the key to read / write computer memory .
Fabrication of the nanoscale devices , roughly 100 atoms in diameter , was performed without conventional lithography , the blunt , top - down manufacturing process that employs strong chemicals and often produces unusable materials with space , size and efficiency limitations .
Instead , researchers used self - assembly , a process by which chemical reactants crystallize at lower temperatures mediated by nanoscale metal catalysts to spontaneously form nanowires that were 30 - 50 nanometers in diameter and 10 micrometers in length , and then they fabricated memory devices on silicon substrates .
“ We measured the resulting nanowires for write - current amplitude , switching speed between amorphous and crystalline phases , long - term durability and data retention time , ” Agarwal said .
Tests showed extremely low power consumption for data encoding ( 0.7 mW per bit ) .
They also indicated the data writing , erasing and retrieval ( 50 nanoseconds ) to be 1,000 times faster than conventional Flash memory and indicated the device would not lose data even after approximately 100,000 years of use , all with the potential to realize terabit - level nonvolatile memory device density .
“ This new form of memory has the potential to revolutionize the way we share information , transfer data and even download entertainment as consumers , ” Agarwal said .
“ This represents a potential sea-change in the way we access and store data . ”
Phase - change memory in general features faster read / write , better durability and simpler construction compared with other memory technologies such as Flash .
The challenge has been to reduce the size of phase change materials by conventional lithographic techniques without damaging their useful properties .
Self - assembled phase - change nanowires , as created by Penn researchers , operate with less power and are easier to scale , providing a useful new strategy for ideal memory that provides efficient and durable control of memory several orders of magnitude greater than current technologies .
“ The atomic scale of the nanodevices may represent the ultimate size limit in current - induced phase transition systems for non-volatile memory applications , ” Agarwal said .
Current solid - state technology for products like memory cards , digital cameras and personal data assistants traditionally utilize Flash memory , a non-volatile and durable computer memory that can be erased and reprogrammed electronically .
Data on Flash drives provides most battery - powered devices with acceptable levels of durability and moderately fast data access .
Yet the technology ’s limits are apparent .
Digital cameras can’t snap rapid - fire photos because it takes precious seconds to store the last photo to memory .
If the memory device is fast , as in DRAM and SRAM used in computers , then it is volatile ; if the plug on a desktop computer is pulled , all recent data entry is lost .
Therefore , a universal memory device is desired that can be scalable , fast , durable and nonvolatile , a difficult set of requirements which have now been demonstrated at Penn .
“ Imagine being able to store hundreds of high - resolution movies in a small drive , downloading them and playing them without wasting time on data buffering , or imagine booting your laptop computer in a few seconds as you would n’t need to transfer the operating system to active memory ” Agarwal said .

THE AFFECTED AREAS India : 125 people killed and 12 million stranded , mostly in Bihar , Uttar Pradesh and Assam Bangladesh : 64 people have been killed and seven million are marooned Nepal : Thousands of people displaced in the south
Worst - hit areas Resilience as waters rise
Hundreds of thousands of people across the affected area are at risk from hunger and disease .
The BBC's South Asia correspondent , Damian Grammaticas , says that food , clean drinking water and medical aid are the priorities , but just a fraction of those who need them are receiving supplies as aid agencies and government teams struggle to get through .
It has been raining heavily in the region for 20 days .
Some rivers have seen their levels rise nine or 10 metres , swamping embankments and submerging huge tracts of land .
Initial government figures say at least 125 people have been killed in India in recent days , and around 64 in Bangladesh .
It means that more than 1,000 people have died across South Asia since the start of the annual monsoon in mid-June .
The number of dead is expected to rise sharply as news comes in from more remote areas .
An estimated five million hectares of farm land is under water .
In some areas , the floods are being called the worst in living memory .
THE ASIAN MONSOON Monsoon winds blow north - easterly for one half of the year , and from the south - west for the other half South - westerly winds bring the heavy rains from June to Sept Winds arrive in southern India six weeks before the north west Annual rainfall varies considerably
What is the monsoon ?
The bulk of the rain is now expected in central India , a region which has so far received a weaker monsoon .

" We 've lost our crops , there 's nowhere to put the children down , not even a place to cook . "
Forecasters in the area say some river levels are still rising but the situation is not yet as severe as the flooding in 2004 in which 700 people lost their lives and millions had to leave their homes .
In Nepal , several rivers that flow down from the Himalayas have burst their banks in the heavily populated and low - lying Terai region that borders Bihar and Uttar Pradesh .
The country 's Red Cross says a quarter of a million people have been affected by rains .
There have been deadly landslides in the highlands and floods have hit dozens of districts in the low - lying Terai region .
UC Berkeley Press Release
Whales evolved biosonar to chase squid into the deep
– Behind the sailor 's lore of fearsome battles between sperm whale and giant squid lies a deep question of evolution :
How did these leviathans develop the underwater sonar needed to chase and catch squid in the inky depths ?
Now , two evolutionary biologists at the University of California , Berkeley , claim that , just as bats developed sonar to chase flying insects through the darkness , dolphins and other toothed whales also developed sonar to chase schools of squid swimming at night at the surface .

Because squid migrate to deeper , darker waters during the day , however , toothed whales eventually perfected an exquisite echolocation system that allows them to follow the squid down to that " refrigerator in the deep , where food is available day or night , 24/7 , " said evolutionary biologist David Lindberg , UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology and coauthor of a new paper on the evolution of echolocation in toothed whales published online July 23 in advance of its publication in the European journal Lethaia .
" When the early toothed whales began to cross the open ocean , they found this incredibly rich source of food surfacing around them every night , bumping into them , " said Lindberg , former director and now a curator in UC Berkeley 's Museum of Paleontology .
" This set the stage for the evolution of the more sophisticated biosonar system that their descendents use today to hunt squids at depth . "
Lindberg and coauthor Nick Pyenson , a graduate student in the UC Berkeley Department of Integrative Biology and at the Museum of Paleontology , reconstructed this scenario after looking at both whale evolution and the evolution of cephalopods like squid and nautiloids - relatives of today 's chambered nautilus - and relating this to the biology of living whales and cephalopods .
All toothed whales , or odontocetes , echolocate .
The baleen whales , which sieve krill from the ocean and have no teeth , do not .
The largest of the toothed whales , the sperm whale , grows up to 60 feet long and dives to 3,000 meters - nearly two miles - in search of squid .
Though poorly known because they live entirely in the deep ocean , the many species of the beaked whale dive nearly as deep .
Belugas and narwhals descend beyond 1,000 meters , while members of the dolphin family - porpoises , killer whales and pilot whales , for example - all can dive below the 200 - meter mark where sunlight is reduced to darkness .
According to Pyenson , who focuses on the evolution of whales , the first whales entered the ocean from land about 45 million years ago , and apparently did not echolocate .
Their fossil skeletons do not have the scooped forehead of today 's echolocating whales , which cups a fatty melon - shaped ball that is thought to act as a lens to focus clicking noises .
Skulls with the first hints of a concave forehead and potential sound - generating bone structures arose about 32 million years ago , Pyenson said , by which time whales presumably had spread throughout the oceans .
Whales had developed underwater hearing by about 40 million years ago .
According to Lindberg , whale biologists had various theories about echolocation , including that whales developed this biosonar soon after entering the water as a way to find food in turbid rivers and estuaries .
The evolution of toothed whales , however , indicates otherwise .
Whales first occupied the ocean , and only later invaded rivers .
Other experts have proposed that development of echolocation coincided with global cooling around 33.5 million years ago , though a mechanism was not specified .
The most convincing explanation , that echolocation allowed whales to more efficiently find food in the darkness of the deep ocean , ignores the question of evolution .
( Data from Roper & Young [ Smithson .
Contr. Zool. 209 : 1975 ] , Nesis & Nikitina [ Russ .
J. Aquat . Ecol. 4 : 1995 ] and Moiseev [ Bull .
Mar. Sci. 49 : 1991 ] )
" How did the whales know there was a large supply of food down in the dark ? " asked Lindberg , noting that cephalopods are the most abundant and high - energy resource in the ocean , eaten by 90 percent of all toothed whales .
" What were the intermediate evolutionary steps that got whales down there ? "
Lindberg , a specialist in the evolution of marine mollusks , noted that cephalopods have migrated up and down on a daily " diel " cycle for at least 150 million years .
At the time whales developed biosonar , nautiloids dominated the oceans .
Lindberg and Pyenson propose that whales first found it possible to track these hard - shelled creatures in surface waters at night by bouncing sounds off of them , an advantage over whales that relied only on moonlight or starlight .
This would have enabled whales to follow the cephalopods as they migrated downwards into the darkness during the day .
Today , the largest number of squid hang out during the day at about 500 meters below the surface , though some go twice as deep .
During the night , however , nearly half the squid are within 150 meters of the surface .
Over the millennia , cephalopod species in general - and especially shelled cephalopod species - fell as the number of whale species boomed , possibly because of predation by whales .
Then , about 10 million years ago , the whales seem to have driven the nautiloids out of the open ocean into protected reefs .
Lindberg said that the decline in nautiloid diversity would have forced whales to perfect their sonar to hunt soft - bodied , migrating squid , such as the Teuthida , which in the open ocean are typically two feet long or bigger and range up to the 40 - foot - long giant squid .
" Whales did n't need to have a very sophisticated sonar system to follow the nautiloids , they could just home in on the hard part , " Lindberg said .
Only later , he added , did they " develop a complex system with finer resolution to detect and capture soft - bodied squid . "
( David Lindberg / UC Berkeley )
" Whales , like bats , developed a sensory system for seeing with sound , and every single toothed whale echolocates in a different way , just like how different bat species echolocate in different ways , " Pyenson said .
Whales also partition the water column , specializing in harvesting squid at specific depths , just as bats partition the tree canopy and preferentially hunt insects at specific heights .
Lindberg noted that whales and bats are strong examples of convergent evolution to take advantage of unexploited food resources : nocturnal insects , in the case of non-migrating insectivorous bats , and nocturnal cephalopods , in the case of whales .
And just as predominately migrating fruit bats do not echolocate , so filter - feeding baleen whales that depend on dense seasonal resources lack biosonar .
Lindberg and Pyenson used existing data on whales and cephalopods to reach their conclusions , drawing upon aspects of tectonics , paleontology , physiology , ecology , anatomy and biophysics .
In the same way , " thinking from an evolutionary perspective about existing data from biology , paleontology and ecology could answer questions about the origin of echolocation in bats , shrews and other animals , " Lindberg said .
The work was supported in part by the Remington Kellogg Fund and the Doris O. and Samuel P. Welles Research Fund of the UC Berkeley Museum of Paleontology and by a graduate research fellowship from the National Science Foundation .
· ' War on terror ' phrase described as misguided · Normality better than rush to legislate , says McNulty
A senior Home Office minister criticised Tony Blair 's response to the July 7 bomb attacks last night , saying it had been wrong to suggest that civil liberties had to suffer as a consequence .
Tony McNulty told a fringe meeting in Bournemouth that Britain 's legal framework did not need to be altered to fight terror .
" Actually the rules of the game had not changed , " he said , adding : " I think we have made mistakes since 7/7 " .
After the attacks that killed 50 people on the London transport network in 2005 , Mr Blair advanced a raft of new anti-terror measures , suggesting that Britons would have to accept reductions in their civil liberties as part of the fight against terror .
He put forward a 12 - point plan , including enforced deportations and a new offence of glorifying terrorism .
But in what seems a major change of heart for the party , Mr McNulty said the phrase " war on terror " was misguided and all violence should be dealt with through normal legal means .
He said : " With the best will in the world , where we are at now as a government means that we are coming round to the view that says , actually , the rules of the game have not changed .
" The more these things are tackled through normality , with some little exceptions at the top , rather than absolutely , by exception , the better .
The more any response is rooted in our civil liberties and our human rights with whatever slight tweaks at the top , the better . "
He suggested it was unwise to " rush headlong into looking at legislation instantly and with very short shrift " , saying it was better to develop a broader counter - terrorist strategy .
Asked about Mr McNulty 's comments , the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , said at a separate session : that she and the minister had always been in agreement on the approach to counter terrorism .
" We are completely at one on the way we have to take this forward .
Winning over people 's hearts and minds and making the case against those who want to carry out attacks on us means we have to think carefully about the arguments you make , and you do not want to further alienate people . "
The remarks are striking for Mr McNulty 's rejection of any major changes to Britain 's anti-terror laws .
The government will nevertheless press ahead in the near future with an extension of the period for which suspected terrorists can be held in detention without charge .
It is expected that it will seek to double the period of maximum detention , subject to judicial oversight , from 28 to 56 days .
EVEN the colour of the usually pristine blue of Santa Monica Bay has appeared an ugly yellowish - brown — as the sun , filtered through a vast plume of smoke spilling out of the Los Angeles basin , has cast a jaundiced hue across the ocean .
Coming on the heels of the region 's driest summer on record , the dozen or more wildfires raging on the hillsides of southern California this past week were all too predictable .
In fact , the weather forecasters had it right almost to the hour .
As the high - pressure system normally at higher latitudes swung south and inland , the humidity dropped early Sunday morning to below 10 % when hot , dry Santa Ana winds roared predictably out of the high desert to the north - east of Los Angeles and barrelled down the mountain sides towards the coast — blowing down power lines and anything else in their path as they gathered momentum while funnelling through the canyons at tornado speeds .

Set - alight seen from satellite
The hillsides , with their undergrowth of waxy chaparral and uncleared thickets of dead trees felled by the drought 's plague of pine beetles , were powder kegs waiting to explode .
Sparks from fallen electricity cables lit the fuse .
The hot , dry winds worked as bellows to fan the flames .
All perfectly normal .
Or so it used to be until housing developers started carving up the hillsides .
Now the aim is to prevent wildfires at all cost .
But the measures half - heartedly taken are often counter - productive .
Few home - owners clear the brush around their homes .
Fewer still vote for bond issues needed to buy more fire - fighting aircraft , such as Bombardier 's miraculous “ Superscooper ” amphibian .
But worst of all is an attitude of mind that seeks to deny the very existence of fire — and is then mortified when it happens .
In reality , fire is an integral part of nature , the mechanism by which much of vegetation regenerates itself .
The prickly chaparral is a typical example of a tinderbox in search of a flint .
Inedible to all but hardiest of creatures such as goats , the only way it can propagate itself is through providing enough oily fuel to catch alight .
The shrub 's hardier seeds then get carried aloft by the smoke and dispersed by the wind .
It was ever thus .
In 1542 , when the Spanish explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first sailed up the coast of California to where Los Angeles is situated today , one of the key observations he recorded was the plumes of smoke from fires burning in the Santa Monica Mountains .
The Native Americans had learned to torch the hillsides to replenish the vegetation and provide better hunting .
Subsequent Spanish , and later Mexican , ranchers in the area continued the practice .
Cabrillo also noted , incidentally , that an inversion layer of hot air blowing out of the desert overlaying colder air blowing in from the ocean had trapped the pollution from the fires to below a few hundred feet .
Four centuries later this inversion layer was fingered as the main cause of Los Angeles ' infamous smog — and the reason why , today , the world has vastly cleaner cars .
But their basin's unique geography and inversion layer have done little to alter Angelinos ' thinking about fire .
Instead of encouraging controlled burns , the current practice of total fire suppression has only increased the fuel load of the area 's forested hillsides and canyons .
So locals turn instead to technology to counter a problem they 've helped create .
From his home overlooking Santa Monica Bay from halfway up the hillside , and a mere hop and a skip from where a fire ripped through Malibu canyon earlier this week , your correspondent has been keeping a weary eye on his mid-century enclave .
With his high - pressure electric hose at the ready , he 's been poised all week to douse any glowing embers the instant flames start licking his way .
With stuccoed walls and double glazing throughout , he 's felt no need to break out the aluminium foil and paste it to the inside of the windows .
Reflecting the heat of a passing firestorm this way helps reduce the chances of an unprotected wooden structure bursting spontaneously into flames .
Apart from installing garden sprinklers on his roof , your correspondent has been exploring the possibility of spraying his home each year before the fire - season gets underway with one of the latest hydrogel flame - retardants .
One of the most popular retardants used by fire - fighters is Phos - Chek , made by ICL Performance Products in the Los Angeles area .
The formulation includes various ammonium phosphates and sulphates plus gums and clays .
In the heat of the flames , the hydrates break down endothermically ( ie , absorb heat from their surroundings ) and help slow the combustion .
Meanwhile , the sulphates and other additives create an insulation barrier between the burning and unburned timbers .
The assorted gums and clays plus secret ingredients help thicken the mixture and prevent it from dispersing after being sprayed or dropped .
Though available in three colours , Phos - Chek usually comes as a red powder or liquid that gradually fades to an earthy brown .
The red colouring helps aerial fire - fighters see where previous loads have been dropped .
Another neat thing about Phos - Chek is that , once things have cooled down , the phosphates and sulphates then act as fertilisers .
A Russian product called OC - 5 , from the Leningrad Forest Research Institute in St Petersburg , is just as eco-friendly and even cheaper .
None of this , of course , would be necessary if Californians adopted the same low - tech solution used by their neighbours south of the border .
Mexican authorities have sensibly introduced herds of goats into their hilly suburbs to keep the chaparral under strict control — and have suffered far fewer wildfires as a consequence .
Your correspondent has been lobbying his neighbours and local officials to do the same .
Unfortunately , everyone seems more concerned about their roses than their roofs .

Introduction
" How to learn math and physics " — the title is deliberately provocative .
Everyone has to learn their own way .
I do n't know how you should learn math and physics .
But presumably you came here looking for advice , so I 'll give you some .
My advice is aimed at people who are interested in fundamental theoretical physics and the math that goes along with that .
( By " fundamental " physics I mean the search for the basic laws concerning matter and the forces of nature . )
If you want to do experiments instead of theory , or other kinds physics like condensed matter physics and astrophysics , or math that has nothing to do with physics , my advice will be of limited use .
You should still learn the basics I mention here , but after that you 'll have to look elsewhere for suggestions .
Learning math and physics takes a whole lifetime .
Luckily , it 's a lot of fun ... if you have a reasonably patient attitude .
A lot of people read pop books about quantum mechanics , black holes , or Gödel 's theorem , and immediately want to study those subjects .
Without the necessary background , they soon become frustrated — or worse , flaky .
It can be even more dangerous if you want to plunge into grand unified theories , or superstrings , or M - theory .
Nobody knows if these theories are true !
And it's hard to evaluate their claims until you know what people do know .
So , especially when it comes to physics , I urge you to start with slightly less glamorous stuff that we know to be true — at least as a useful approximation , that is — and then , with a solid background , gradually work your way up to the frontiers of knowledge .
Even if you give up at some point , you 'll have learned something worthwhile .
This webpage does n't have lots of links to websites .
Websites just do n't have the sort of in - depth material you need to learn technical subjects like advanced math and physics — at least , not yet .
To learn this stuff , you need to read lots of books .
I will list some of my favorites below , and also some you can get free online .
But , you can't learn math and physics just by reading books !
You have to do lots of calculations yourself — or experiments , if you want to do experimental physics .
Textbooks are full of homework problems , and it 's good to do these .
It 's also important to make up your own research topics and work on those .
If you can afford it , there 's really nothing better than taking courses in math and physics .
The advantage of courses is that you get to hear lectures , meet students and professors , and do some things you otherwise would n't — like work your butt off .
It 's also crucial to ask people questions and explain things to people — both of these are great ways to learn stuff .
Nothing beats sitting in a cafe with a friend , notebooks open , and working together on a regular basis .
Two minds are more than twice as good as one !
But if you can't find a friend in your town , there are different ways to talk to people online .
In all cases , it 's good to spend some time quietly getting to know the local customs before plunging in and talking .
For example , trying to start a rambling discussion on a question - and - answer website is no good .
Here are some options :
There are also lots of interesting blogs and free math books online .
Finally , it 's crucial to admit you 're wrong when you screw up .
We all make tons of mistakes when we 're learning stuff .
If you do n't admit this , you will gradually turn into a crackpot who clutches on to a stupid theory even when everyone else in the world can see that it 's wrong .
It 's a tragic fate , because you can't even see it 's happening .
Even bigshot professors at good universities can become crackpots once they stop admitting their mistakes .
To avoid looking like a fool , it 's really good to get into the habit of making it clear whether you know something for sure , or are just guessing .
It 's not so bad to be wrong if you said right from the start that you were n't sure .
But if you act confident and turn out to be wrong , you look dumb .
In short : stay humble , keep studying , and you 'll keep making progress .
Do n't give up — the fun is in the process .
This release is available in German .
Although the discrepancy is not large , it is significant : Geodesists from the University of Bonn have remeasured the size of the Earth in a long lasting international cooperation project .
The blue planet is accordingly some millimeters smaller than up to now assumed .
The results are important , for example , to be able to demonstrate a climate contingent rise in sea level .
The results have now appeared in the renowned Journal of Geodesy .
The system of measurement used by the Bonn Geodesists is invisible .
It consists of radiowaves that are transmitted into space from punctiform sources , the so - called Quasars .
A network of more than 70 radio telescopes worldwide receives these waves .
Because the gaging stations are so far apart from each other , the radio signals are received with a slight time - lag .
„ From this difference we can measure the distance betwen the radio telescopes - - and to the preciseness of two millimeters per 1,000 kilometers , " explained Dr. Axel Nothnagel , reasearch group leader for the Geodesy Institute of the University of Bonn .
The procedure is called VLBI , which stands for „ Very Long Baseline Interferometry . "
The technique can be used , for example , to demonstrate that Europe and North America are distancing from each other at a rate of about 18 millimeters annually .
The distance of the gaging stations from each other allows the the size of the Earth or the exact location of the center of the Earth to be determined .
„ We have analyzed the measurements and calculations from 34 partners in 17 countries , " explained Nothnagel .
„ A combination of GPS and satellite laser measurements will enable the availability of the coordinates from almost 400 points on the surface of the Earth with unparalleled exactness . "
The results are the basis for a new coordinate system for the planet .
With this system it would be possible , for example , to determine the track of so - called Altimeter - Satellites within a few millimeters precision .
Altimeter - Satellites measure their altitude over the Earth 's surface and can , for example , register a rise in sea level .
Deviations from the flight path , however , falsify the result .
If the satellite flies higher than expected , the distance to the surface of the Earth differentiates from what is recorded -- the sea level appears lower than it really is .

Iraq : A War For Israel
By Mark Weber
The U.S. bombing and invasion of Iraq in March - April 2003 , and the occupation that followed , cost more than four thousand American lives and hundreds of billions of dollars , and brought death to many tens of thousands of Iraqis .
Why did President Bush decide to go to war ?
In whose interests was it launched ?
In the months leading up to the attack , the President and other high - level US officials repeatedly warned that the threat posed to the US and world by the Baghdad regime was so grave and imminent that the United States had to act quickly to bomb , invade and occupy Iraq .
On Sept. 28 , 2002 , for example , Bush said :
" The danger to our country is grave and it is growing .
The Iraqi regime possesses biological and chemical weapons , is rebuilding the facilities to make more and , according to the British government , could launch a biological or chemical attack in as little as 45 minutes after the order is given ...
This regime is seeking a nuclear bomb , and with fissile material could build one within a year . "
On March 6 , 2003 , President Bush declared :
" Saddam Hussein and his weapons are a direct threat to this country , to our people , and to all free people ...
I believe Saddam Hussein is a threat to the American people .
I believe he 's a threat to the neighborhood in which he lives .
And I 've got good evidence to believe that .
He has weapons of mass destruction ...
The American people know that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction . "
These claims were untrue .
As the world now knows , Iraq had no dangerous " weapons of mass destruction , " and posed no threat to the US .
Moreover , alarmist suggestions that the Baghdad regime was working with the al - Qaeda terror network likewise proved to be without foundation .
So if the official reasons given for the war were untrue , why did the United States attack Iraq ?
Whatever the secondary reasons for the war , the crucial factor in President Bush 's decision to attack was to help Israel .
With support from Israel and America 's Jewish - Zionist lobby , and prodded by Jewish " neo-conservatives " holding high - level positions in his administration , President Bush - who was already fervently committed to Israel - resolved to invade and subdue one of Israel 's chief regional enemies .
This is so widely understood in Washington that US Senator Ernest Hollings was moved in May 2004 to acknowledge that the US invaded Iraq " to secure Israel , " and " everybody " knows it .
He also identified three of the influential pro-Israel Jews in Washington who played an important role in prodding the US into war : Richard Perle , chair of the Pentagon 's Defense Policy Board ; Paul Wolfowitz , Deputy Defense Secretary ; and Charles Krauthammer , columnist and author . [ 1 ]
Hollings referred to the cowardly reluctance of his Congressional colleagues to acknowledge this truth openly , saying that " nobody is willing to stand up and say what is going on . "
Due to " the pressures we get politically , " he added , members of Congress uncritically support Israel and its policies .
Some months before the invasion , retired four - star US Army General and former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Wesley Clark acknowledged in an interview : " Those who favor this attack [ by the US against Iraq ] now will tell you candidly , and privately , that it is probably true that Saddam Hussein is no threat to the United States .
But they are afraid at some point he might decide if he had a nuclear weapon to use it against Israel . " [ 2 ]
Six months before the attack , President Bush met in the White House with eleven members of the US House of Representatives .
While the " war against terrorism is going okay , " he told the lawmakers , the United States would soon have to deal with a greater danger : " The biggest threat , however , is Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass destruction .
He can blow up Israel and that would trigger an international conflict . " [ 3 ]
Bush also spoke candidly about why the US was going to war during a White House meeting on Feb. 27 , 2003 , just three weeks before the invasion .
In a talk with Elie Wiesel , the well - known Jewish writer , Bush said : " If we do n't disarm Saddam Hussein , he will put a weapon of mass destruction on Israel and they will do what they think they have to do , and we have to avoid that . " [ 4 ]
Fervently Pro-Israel
President Bush 's fervent support for Israel and its hardline government is well known .
He reaffirmed it , for example , in June 2002 in a major speech on the Middle East .
In the view of " leading Israeli commentators , " the London Times reported , the address was " so pro-Israel that it might have been written by [ Israel prime minister ] Ariel Sharon . " [ 5 ]
In an address to pro-Israel activists at the 2004 convention of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , Bush said : " The United States is strongly committed , and I am strongly committed , to the security of Israel as a vibrant Jewish state . "
He also told the gathering : " By defending the freedom and prosperity and security of Israel , you 're also serving the cause of America . " [ 6 ]
Condoleeza Rice , who served as President Bush 's National Security Advisor , and later , as his Secretary of State , echoed the President 's outlook in a May 2003 interview , saying that the " security of Israel is the key to security of the world . " [ 7 ]
Long Range Plans
Jewish - Zionist plans for war against Iraq had been in place for years .
In mid-1996 , a policy paper prepared for then - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu outlined a grand strategy for Israel in the Middle East .
Entitled " A Clean Break : A New Strategy for Securing the Realm , " it was written under the auspices of an Israeli think tank , the Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies .
Specifically , it called for an " effort [ that ] can focus on removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq , an important Israeli strategic objective in its own right ... " [ 8 ]
The authors of " A Clean Break " included Richard Perle , Douglas Feith , and David Wurmser , three influential Jews who later held high - level positions in the Bush administration , 2001 - 2004 : Perle as chair of the Defense Policy Board , Feith as Undersecretary of Defense , and Wurmser as special assistant to the Undersecretary of State for Arms Control .
The role played by Bush administration officials who are associated with two major pro-Zionist " neoconservative " research centers has come under scrutiny from The Nation , the influential public affairs weekly . [ 9 ]
The author , Jason Vest , examined the close links between the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs ( JINSA ) and the Center for Security Policy ( CSP ) , detailing the ties between these groups and various politicians , arms merchants , military men , wealthy pro-Israel American Jews , and Republican presidential administrations
JINSA and CSP members , notes Vest , " have ascended to powerful government posts , where ... they 've managed to weave a number of issues - support for national missile defense , opposition to arms control treaties , championing of wasteful weapons systems , arms aid to Turkey and American unilateralism in general - into a hard line , with support for the Israeli right at its core ...
On no issue is the JINSA / CSP hard line more evident than in its relentless campaign for war - not just with Iraq , but ‘ total war , ' as Michael Ledeen , one of the most influential JINSAns in Washington , put it ...
For this crew , ‘ regime change ' by any means necessary in Iraq , Iran , Syria , Saudi Arabia and the Palestinian Authority is an urgent imperative . "
Samuel Francis , author , editor and columnist , also looked into the " neo-conservative " role in fomenting war . [ 10 ]
" My own answer , " he wrote , " is that the lie [ that a massively - armed Iraq posed a grave and imminent threat to the US ] was fabricated by neo-conservatives in the administration whose first loyalty is to Israel and its interests and who wanted the United States to smash Iraq because it was the biggest potential threat to Israel in the region .
They are known to have been pushing for war with Iraq since at least 1996 , but they could not make an effective case for it until after Sept. 11 , 2001 ... "
In the aftermath of the 2001 Nine - Eleven terror attacks , ardently pro-Zionist " neo-conservatives " in the Bush administration - who for years had sought a Middle East war to bolster Israel 's security in the region - exploited the tragedy to press their agenda .
In this they were backed by the Israeli government , which also pressured the White House to strike Iraq .
" The [ Israeli ] military and political leadership yearns for war in Iraq , " reported a leading Israeli daily paper , Haaretz , in February 2002 . [ 11 ]
The Jerusalem correspondent for the Guardian , the respected British daily , reported in August 2002 : " Israel signalled its decision yesterday to put public pressure on President George Bush to go ahead with a military attack on Iraq , even though it believes Saddam Hussein may well retaliate by striking Israel . " [ 12 ]
Three months before the US invasion , the well - informed Washington journalist Robert Novak reported that Israeli prime minister Sharon was telling American political leaders that " the greatest US assistance to Israel would be to overthrow Saddam Hussein 's Iraqi regime . "
Moreover , added Novak , " that view is widely shared inside the Bush administration , and is a major reason why US forces today are assembling for war . " [ 13 ]
Israel 's spy agencies were a " full partner " with the US and Britain in producing greatly exaggerated prewar assessments of Iraq 's ability to wage war , a former senior Israeli military intelligence official has acknowledged .
Shlomo Bron , a brigadier general in the Israel army reserves , and a senior researcher at a major Israeli think tank , said that intelligence provided by Israel played a significant role in supporting the US and British case for making war .
Israeli intelligence agencies , he said , " badly overestimated the Iraqi threat to Israel and reinforced the American and British belief that the weapons [ of mass destruction ] existed . " [ 14 ]
The role of the pro-Israel lobby in pressing for war has been carefully examined by two prominent American scholars , John J. Mearsheimer , professor of political science at the University of Chicago , and Stephen M. Walt , professor of international affairs at Harvard University . [ 15 ]
In an 81 - page paper , " The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy , " they wrote :
" Pressure from Israel and the [ pro - Israel ]
Lobby was not the only factor behind the decision to attack Iraq in March 2003 , but it was critical .
Some Americans believe that this was a war for oil , but there is hardly any direct evidence to support this claim .
Instead , the war was motivated in good part by a desire to make Israel more secure ...
Within the United States , the main driving force behind the Iraq war was a small band of neoconservatives , many with close ties to Israel 's Likud Party .
In addition , key leaders of the Lobby 's major organizations lent their voices to the campaign for war . "
Important members of the pro-Israel lobby carried out what professors Mearshiemer and Walt call " an unrelenting public relations campaign to win support for invading Iraq .
A key part of this campaign was the manipulation of intelligence information , so as to make Saddam look like an imminent threat . "
For some Jewish leaders , the Iraq war is part of a long - range effort to install Israel - friendly regimes across the Middle East .
Norman Podhoretz , a prominent Jewish writer and an ardent supporter of Israel , was for years editor of Commentary , the influential Zionist monthly .
In the Sept. 2002 issue he wrote :
" The regimes that richly deserve to be overthrown and replaced are not confined to the three singled - out members of the axis of evil [ Iraq , Iran , North Korea ] .
At a minimum , the axis should extend to Syria and Lebanon and Libya , as well as ‘ friends ' of America like the Saudi royal family and Egypt 's Hosni Mubarak , along with the Palestinian Authority , whether headed by Arafat or one of his henchmen . "
Patrick J. Buchanan , the well - known writer and commentator , and former White House Communications director , has been blunt in identifying those who pushed for war : [ 16 ]
" We charge that a cabal of polemicists and public officials seek to ensnare our country in a series of wars that are not in America 's interests .
We charge them with colluding with Israel to ignite those wars and destroy the Oslo Accords .
We charge them with deliberately damaging US relations with every state in the Arab world that defies Israel or supports the Palestinian people 's right to a homeland of their own .
We charge that they have alienated friends and allies all over the Islamic and Western world through their arrogance , hubris , and bellicosity ...
" Cui Bono ?
For whose benefit these endless wars in a region that holds nothing vital to America save oil , which the Arabs must sell us to survive ?
Who would benefit from a war of civilizations between the West and Islam ?
" Answer : one nation , one leader , one party .
Israel , Sharon , Likud . "
Uri Avnery - an award - winning Israeli journalist and author , and a three - time member of Israel 's parliament - sees the Iraq war as an expression of immense Jewish influence and power .
In an essay written some weeks after the US invasion , he wrote : [ 17 ]
" Who are the winners ?
They are the so - called neo-cons , or neo-conservatives .
A compact group , almost all of whose members are Jewish .
They hold the key positions in the Bush administration , as well as in the think - tanks that play an important role in formulating American policy and the ed-op pages of the influential newspapers ...
The immense influence of this largely Jewish group stems from its close alliance with the extreme right - wing Christian fundamentalists , who nowadays control Bush 's Republican party .
...
Seemingly , all this is good for Israel .
America controls the world , we control America .
Never before have Jews exerted such an immense influence on the center of world power . "
In Britain , a veteran member of Britain 's House of Commons bluntly declared in May 2003 that Jews had taken control of America 's foreign policy , and had succeeded in pushing the US into war .
" A Jewish cabal have taken over the government in the United States and formed an unholy alliance with fundamentalist Christians , " said Tam Dalyell , a Labour party deputy and the longest - serving House member .
" There is far too much Jewish influence in the United States , " he added . [ 18 ]
Summary
For many years now , American presidents of both parties have been staunchly committed to Israel and its security .
This entrenched policy is an expression of the Jewish - Zionist grip on America 's political and cultural life .
It was fervent support for Israel - shared by President Bush , high - ranking administration officials and nearly the entire US Congress - that proved crucial in the decision to invade and subdue one of Israel 's greatest regional enemies .
While the unprovoked US invasion of Iraq may have helped Israel , just as those who wanted and planned for the war had hoped , it has been a calamity for America and the world .
It has cost many tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars .
Around the world , it has generated unmatched distrust and hostility toward the US .
In Arab and Muslim countries , it has fueled intense hatred of the United States , and has brought many new recruits to the ranks of anti-American terrorists .
Americans have already paid a high price for their nation 's commitment to Israel .
We will pay an ever higher price - not just in dollars or international prestige , but in the lives of young men squandered for the interests of a foreign state - until the Jewish - Zionist hold on US political life is finally broken .

The curiosity that fueled the experiments in Mr. McGee 's first book is undiminished after 20 years , and his approach to cooking is still skeptical .
He tries to take as little as possible for granted , asking at each step :
Why am I doing this ?
Is there a better way ?
All this questioning has yielded conclusions , some more useful than others , and many of them heretical in culinary circles .
For example , although brining the turkey is now part of the Thanksgiving ritual for many cooks , Mr. McGee does not do it .
" The bird does become juicier , but it 's just absorbing tap water , not the true juices that make a bird flavorful , " he said .
" And the drippings become so salty that you can't use them . "
He says that his own experiments with turkey , though far from complete , show that drying the bird out , rather than infusing it with water , is more likely to make it flavorful and juicy with crisp skin .
He unwraps his turkey a day or two before cooking , letting it air - dry in the refrigerator , and then cooks it at high temperature .
After our 13 - pound bird had roasted for only an hour and half , the readings from four temperature probes attached to a Fluke 50 lab thermometer showed that the meat was perfectly done both in the thigh and the breast .
" White meat and dark meat are completely different kinds of muscles in both birds and animals , " Mr. McGee said .
" White muscles store energy for sudden , rapid movements and dark ones for slow , sustained ones .
That 's why chickens , who only fly for a few seconds when they 're startled , have white breasts , and ducks , who fly for long periods , have red ones . "
But the skin was only golden , not as brown and crisp as we wanted .
" Crispness is a matter of heating and dehydrating the proteins , " Mr. McGee said , as he fired up an industrial - size blowtorch and began methodically stroking its blue flame over the turkey .
Dissatisfied with the slow results , he switched to a heat gun , whose red - hot coils seemed to give a more concentrated heat .
The skin turned from gold to clear and then to bronze , the juices visibly running out of it and through the turkey .
" Caramelized has become a popular word since I wrote the first book , " he said .
" But everything browned is not caramelized . "
Caramelization , he explained , is what happens to sugar -- simple sucrose molecules -- exposed to high heat .
But the browning that takes place in savory foods like onions , potatoes , celery and turkey skin is a " Maillard reaction , " the explosive meeting of a carbohydrate molecule ( which may or may not be a sugar ) and an amino acid in a hot , dry environment .
Maillard reactions take place when coffee or cocoa beans are roasted or when a bread crust turns brown .
Mr. McGee said : " Maillard reactions contribute even more to the pleasures of eating than caramelization does .
But of course it does n't sound as good on a menu . "
The alluring scent of Maillard reactions filled the kitchen as Mr. McGee 's pie crust began to brown .
Although it is almost impossible to do anything truly new in the kitchen -- as Mr. McGee notes , it often turns out that even the most complex flavor combinations were routinely used by Roman cooks -- his pie crust method seems revolutionary .
" The goal of pie crust is to create thin , even layers of fat and flour , " he said .
" That 's what makes them flaky .
But the usual method is n't really optimal for that . "

The Hidden Rip-off
Hundreds of thousands of computer workers , throughout the country are being denied a big chunk of the wages they have earned .
How ?
These workers have been improperly classified as “ Salaried - Exempt Employees . ”
Any employee so classified , receives a fixed annual salary .
Every paycheck will be exactly the same , no matter how many hours the employee worked each week .
That classification saves employers millions of dollars a year , by the simple trick of not paying overtime wages .
Whether out of ignorance , or deliberate intent , many companies automatically assign this category to all employees who are classified as “ Computer Workers . ”
Sorry , employers .
It ’s not up to you .
Instead , both Federal and State Law sets forth the conditions by which employees may be classified as Exempt Workers .
By far , most computer workers are mandated to be classified as “ Salaried – Non exempt . ”
That means they are required to be paid the following
1.5 times their calculated hourly rate ( annual salary / 2080 ) for each hour beyond 8 hours in each day worked , or each hour exceeding 40 hours in a week .
2.0 times their calculated hourly rate for each hour beyond 12 worked in a single day .
Salaried Non-Exempt personnel must also be paid for two fifteen - minute rest breaks within each eight hour period worked .
2.0 times their calculated hourly rate for each hour worked on a legal holiday .
What Qualifications Must the Employer Meet to Assign Exempt Status ?
As of September 2000 , California recognizes an hourly computer professional exemption for certain employees in the computer software field .
A computer software field employee is exempt from overtime pay if all of the following requirements are met :
The employee is primarily engaged in work that is intellectual or creative and that requires the exercise of discretion and independent judgment ; AND
The employee is primarily engaged ( spends more than half his or her time ) in duties that consist of one or more of the following :
The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures including consulting with users to determine hardware , software , or system specifications .
The design , development , documentation , analysis , creation , testing , or modification of computer systems or programs , including prototypes , based on and related to user or system design specifications .
The documentation , testing , creation , or modification of computer programs related to the design of software or hardware for computer operating systems .
AND
The employee is highly skilled and proficient in the theoretical and practical application of highly specialized information to computer systems analysis , programming , and software engineering ; ( Job title not determinative ) AND
The employee 's hourly rate of pay is not less than $ 45.84 per hour for every hour worked .
If the employer cannot show all of the above , the employee is non-exempt and entitled to overtime pay and other benefits .
Such employees can recover wages going back three years ( and in some cases four years ) from the date a complaint is filed , but only up to those wages earned since September 2000 .
If you are working as a computer worker for a company , you do n’t need a law degree to determine whether you should be qualified as a Salary Exempt worker .
First , let ’s determine whether you are , indeed in that category generally qualifying for the classification , “ Computer Worker . ”
Here is a list of titles and tasks which will be instantly suspect , if classified Exempt :
· Computer Technicians
· Software Engineer
· Customer Training Consultants
· System Administrator

The alfalfa was first , gnawed at the roots .
The barley went next , followed by the beets and tomatoes .
Then , one morning in August , Francisco Javier Ponferro went to his melon patch .
" From the outside , they looked fine .
But when you picked them up , you realized they all had big holes in them . "
Like many farmers across central Spain , Mr. Ponferro has seen the face of evil , and it is small and furry .
A plague of voles , some 750 million strong , is eating through the fields of Castilla - León , devouring crops , decimating local economies , and carrying disease .
While no one seems to know what caused the invasion , creative tactics to combat it are flourishing as farmers , frustrated with weak local response , take matters into their own hands .
The voles first appeared in large numbers three months ago in the provinces of Palencia and Valladolid .
With their short reproductive cycles ( 21 days ) and hearty appetites , they soon spread across the plains .
" They like tender greens , such as alfalfa , so they go for that first , " says Francisco Ávila , an alfalfa farmer in Vilbañez .
" But when that runs out , they move on to other things – like my beets . "
Officials say some 260,000 hectares of land ( 1,000 square miles ) have been affected , wreaking € 30 million worth of damage .
Francisco Salvador , spokesperson for the Palencia branch of COAG , an organization for agricultural unions , says , " People are frightened .
If the voles are still there in a month , when we start planting , we do n't know what we 're going to eat . "
Juan José Luque , a biologist at the University of Valladolid , admits that scientists do n't know the source of the invasion .
" Some of these species go through cycles where their population explodes , " he says .
" It 's our hypothesis that the confluence of one of those natural cycles with last year 's mild winter plays a role . "
He adds that there is not enough evidence yet to connect the problem to global warming .
" But if winters stay mild , like last year , it would be logical to expect more of these population explosions . "
The recent shift from traditional dry farming to more profitable irrigated agriculture has also made Castilla - León 's farmland more appealing to the critters .
Among locals , rumors of more insidious origins are spreading .
" These are n't normal moles – they 're not blind , for one thing , " charges Rufino Reyerto , who lives in Reseno .
" They 're hybrids that have been produced in a lab . "
In neighboring Vilbañez , vegetable farmer Ponferro harbors deeper suspicions .
" The government created this new mole so that birds of prey would have food .
It 's the environmentalists ' fault . "
[ Editor 's note : Many Spanish farmers called the animals moles .
Juan José Luque , a biologist at the University of Valladolid , confirmed that they are voles , a rodent not closely related to the mole . ]
However murky the outbreak 's causes , its cure remains more obscure .
In an effort to drive the varmints above ground and toward tubes filled with poison or pits that will be set on fire , the government last week began sponsoring controlled field burning in some towns .
But Professor Luque says there is no research to prove that will work .
" It would be more effective to do what northern countries have done , and flood the fields , " he says .
Denmark , Sweden , and the US have had some success with that method .
Mr. Salvador says that his organization is contemplating roadblocks or other collective actions because they 're so frustrated .
" In most towns , we have seen nothing from the government . "
Many are rigging traps or digging elaborate canals around fields to drown the voles when they stop to drink .
Armed mostly with shovels , boys in towns like Fresno el Viejo have set up vole - hunting competitions .
Ponferro sends out his three dogs each morning .
" They caught 50 today , " he says proudly .
[ Editor 's note :
The original version of this paragraph incorrectly referred to the animals as moles .
They 're voles . ]
At lunchtime , he and other farmers in dusty Vilbañez escape the brutal August sun in the town cafe .
The talk quickly turns to voles .
Ávila notes that his alfalfa is only two years old – it takes six for the plant to really take root .
When he goes out at night to check his crop , the voles are so plentiful that his fields ripple with movement .
" If this keeps up , " he says glumly , " I do n't know what we 're going to do . "

Israel was criticised for bombing Lebanese civilian centres
Former ambassador to the UN John Bolton told the BBC that before any ceasefire Washington wanted Israel to eliminate Hezbollah 's military capability .
Mr Bolton said an early ceasefire would have been " dangerous and misguided " .
He said the US decided to join efforts to end the conflict only when it was clear Israel 's campaign was n't working .
Israel was reacting in its own self - defence and if that meant the defeat of the enemy , that was perfectly legitimate under international law
John Bolton
Mr Bolton said the US was deeply disappointed at Israel 's failure to remove the threat from Hezbollah and the subsequent lack of any attempt to disarm its forces .
Britain joined the US in refusing to call for an immediate ceasefire .
' Damn proud '
The war began when Hezbollah captured two Israeli soldiers , but it quickly escalated into a full - scale conflict .
BBC diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall says the US - UK refusal to join calls for a ceasefire was one of the most controversial aspects of the diplomacy .
The UK , US and Israeli were alone in resisting an early ceasefire
Mr Bolton now describes it as " perfectly legitimate ... and good politics " for the Israelis to seek to defeat their enemy militarily , especially as Hezbollah had attacked Israel first and it was acting " in its own self - defence " .
Mr Bolton , a controversial and blunt - speaking figure , said he was " damned proud of what we did " to prevent an early ceasefire .
Also in the BBC programme , several key players claim that , privately , there were Arab leaders who also wanted Israel to destroy Hezbollah .
" There were many not - how should I put it - resistant to the thought that the Israelis should thoroughly defeat Hezbollah , who ... increasingly by Arab states were seen as an Iranian proxy , " said UN special envoy Terje Roed Larsen .
More than 1,000 Lebanese civilians and an unknown number of Hezbollah fighters were killed in the conflict .
Israel lost 116 soldiers in the fighting , while 43 of its civilians were killed in Hezbollah rocket attacks .
Some say the age of exploration is over , but there are still parts of the world that scientists and other explorers have rarely penetrated .
Many of these places lie beneath the sea 's surface , and one such place -- the so - called Bird 's Head Seascape off the western coast of the island of New Guinea - - revealed upon recent survey that it contained as many as 52 new species of fish , shrimp and coral .
" The scientists that went there did expect to see impressive things , " says Sebastian Troeng of Conservation International in Washington , D.C. , the advocacy group that organized the expedition .
" But I think they were blown away by the biodiversity that they did encounter . "
A peninsula juts off the northwestern coast of New Guinea on the Indonesian side , which helps the world 's second largest island look vaguely like a turkey .
In that picture , the peninsula represents the bird 's head , and the area between its beak and wattle is the area surveyed .
An initial team had scouted it back in 2001 , but in February and April of this year Conservation International put together a team of biologists and other scientists to scour the seascape as part of its rapid assessment program .
These expeditions aim to quickly register the flora and fauna in order to inform conservation decisions .
During the six weeks of survey , scientists catalogued more than 1,200 species of fish and nearly 600 species of coral as well as 52 potentially new species , including a shark .
" These epaulette sharks have very large pectoral fins that they can use to hobble along the bottom and basically look like they are walking , " Troeng notes .
The new species include : two confirmed flasher wrasses ( see gallery for images ) , some suspected new reef - building corals and mantis shrimp .
" They are neither mantis nor shrimp , but they look a bit like both of them , " Troeng explains .
" Some species have been recorded striking so hard that they can break an aquarium glass . "
The scientists searched the seascape from Teluk Cenderawasih in the north to the Raja Ampat archipelago in the west and the Fak Fak - Kaimana coastline to the south .
In the heart of Asia 's coral triangle , the 180,000 square kilometer area full of islands and submerged reefs represents one of the most abundant discoveries ever , dwarfing even Australia 's Great Barrier Reef in terms of biodiversity .
" The numbers are there to say that it is one of the most diverse areas that has ever been found , " says marine biologist Russ Chapman of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla , Calif .
" I personally do not know of a similar example where there was such a richness in terms of new species . "
But the unique creatures of the Bird's Head seascape face an uncertain future , given Indonesia 's previous plans to expand fishing in the area .
" There are a number of emerging threats : some destructive fishing methods , like dynamite or cyanide ; the threat from overfishing ; and sedimentation from mining or logging might impact coral reefs , " Troeng says .
" We still have a window of time before these emerging threats become overwhelming . "
Initial indications are that the Indonesian government is responsive to protecting its natural heritage , as are local villagers who rely on the sea for their livelihoods .
" We 're quite optimistic that there will be a system , perhaps of marine protected areas , that will be put in place so that it will be managed in a sustainable manner , " Troeng says .
" One option that is being considered now is to focus development on promoting sustainable ecotourism . "
Regardless , it is clear that the world beneath the waves still has plenty to reveal to explorers ; future expeditions plan to chart the undersea glories off Madagascar and Brazil .
As Chapman notes : " This survey and the discoveries show us how much marine biodiversity remains to be discovered if we can get to some of these sites before they disappear . "

Toye gets paid to surf every site that you 're not allowed to look at when working .
An analyst for St. Bernard Software , a maker of messaging security products , Toye evaluates and categorizes Web sites .
" My friends think it 's a crazy job , " he says .
" Everyone thinks all I do is look for porn all day .
They call me ' Porn Guy . ' "
During the past five years this college student has worked part - time at St. Bernard , classifying sites into 73 general categories -- such as real estate , society , malware , lingerie or phishing .
An in - house software application guides Toye and 15 other part - time analysts , providing them five sites at a time to assess .
The Human Touch
Having a human in on the evaluation -- rather than just automated technology -- is critical , says Morgan Christian , a development manager and Toye 's boss .
Those categorized Web sites are automatically fed into St. Bernard 's iGuard database , which now contains more than 30 million URLs and IP addresses .
The database populates St. Bernard 's iPrism appliance , which enables small - and mid-size customers ( mostly educational institutions and midsize businesses ) to block employees ' unproductive digital desires .
At Network Services , a paper and janitorial supply distributor , CIO Paul Roche has reaped the fruits of Toye 's labor with iPrism .
Though Roche does n't know Toye by name , he 's aware of the work .
" [ St. Bernard ] has people who literally go to Web sites all day long , " Roche says .
From the 73 categories , Roche can tell iPrism which sites to allow and which to block for his employees .
His company now has a more locked - down Web environment , which lessens the worries of him , his IT staff and HR .
" My [ appropriate use ] policy is so easy to enforce , " Roche says .
" And it 's nothing my IT staff has to do . "
Back at St. Bernard ,

I see this mistake quite often : people have a performance or scalability problem with their threaded code and start blaming locks .
Because everyone knows that locks are slow and limit scalability ( yes , that was ironic : grin : ) .
They start to optimize their code by getting rid of the locks entirely , e.g. by messing around with memory barriers .
Or by just not using locks at all .
Most of the time the result happens to work on their machine but has subtle bugs that surface later .
Let ’s see what the experts say about using locks , in this case Brian Goetz in his excellent book on Java Concurrency in Practice :
When assessing the performance impact of synchronization , it is important to distinguish between contended and uncontended synchonization .
The synchronized mechanism is optimized for the uncontended case ( volatile is always uncontended ) , and at this writing , the performance cost of a “ fast - path ” uncontended synchronization ranges from 20 to 250 clock cycles for most systems .
While this is certainly not zero , the effect of needed , uncontended synchronization is rarely significant in overall application performance , and the alternative involves compromising safety and potentially signing yourself ( or your successor ) up for some very painful bug hunting later .
Could not have told you any better than that and I can assure you this man knows what he is talking about .
Although he speaks about Java specifically , the result is the same for other parallel programming systems : the first step when you have synchronization problems is not to get rid of locks , but to reduce lock contention .
This article will tell you 10 ( +1 ) ways to do just that .
Update :
As Brian notes correctly in his comment below this article , these are advanced techniques and should only be employed if you are absolutely sure , locks are the problem !
The only way to be sure of course is to use your profiler of choice , or else you will be guilty of the number one sin of ever programmer : premature optimization ( and you do n’t want to go to programmers hell for this one , do you ? : lol : ) .
Protect data , not code : A common technique to achieve thread - safety quickly is to slap a big lock around a whole function call .
Or in Java ’s case , declare the whole method synchronized .
Remember that it is merely the data that needs to be protected from concurrent access , not the code !
Following this advice alone can take the time spent in you locks down significantly .
Get rid of expensive calculations while in locks :
This may seem obvious , but a little instruction reordering and use of temporary variables can bring down the time spent in locks considerably , especially as soon as I /O is involved .
Use lock striping :
Does your whole array really need to be protected by the same lock ?
Or can you give each element its own lock ?
Or if thats too many , use e.g. the modulo - function to distribute array elements to different locks and make sure your threads are not contending for the same lock ?
I bet you can in many cases .
The more general advice here is : use different locks for different data whenever possible .
Employ interlocked / atomic operations :
There is no need to use locking just to increase a counter .
Most parallel programming systems offer atomic operations to achieve simple tasks like that .
Use them whenever available .
Use synchronized data structures :
Even if you cannot use atomic operations directly , maybe you can use a data structure that uses them internally .
A lock - free message queue for example .
Data structures like that are available for a variety of systems now and give you the power to synchronize your threads without worrying about locks .
Use Reader - Writer Locks where applicable :
For the cases where a lot of threads read a memory location that is rarely changed , the reader - writer lock was invented and is available in many parallel programming systems .
It ensures that multiple readers can enter the lock at the same time .
Only when a writer enters the picture , the lock becomes exclusive .
Use Read - Only data whenever possible :
In some parallel progamming systems ( e.g. in Java ) , the system will make sure these are properly published to all threads , eliminating the need for locking entirely ( since they can not be changed anyways ) .
Avoid Object Pooling :
In some parallel programming systems , object creation is expensive ( note : I am not talking about Java today .
Maybe the Java of 5 years ago . )
Many programmers have therefore become used to reusing objects and storing them away for later reuse in pools .
In the multi - threaded case this turns out to be a problem , because of course the pool needs to be protected from concurrent access as well .
Depending on how fast objects can be created in your system , it may be a good idea to forget about object pooling while working on multi- threaded code ( or in general ) .
Use local variables or thread - local storage :
In many cases , a shared variable can be substituted by another one , which is local to each thread .
Think of the simple case of a reduction : when you want to find the biggest number in an array , you can store either store it immediately in a max - variable that is increased by all threads as they go ( this is the contended case ) , or you can have each thread store its own result locally and combine them in the end ( uncontended case ) .
Avoid hotspots : A hotspot is a resource ( e.g. a shared variable ) that needs to be updated frequently .
Think of a linked list .
The size of the list is stored somewhere in many list - implementations , because the implementers want the size ( ) - operation to complete in constant time ( if the size is not stored and updated constantly , the size ( ) - method needs to walk the list each time it is called ) .
What seems like a good performance optimization at first sight might shoot you in the foot in the multi- threaded case : now each and every list operation that changes the number of elements in the list needs to update the size - variable , an operation that needs to be protected from concurrent access .
This is what is called a hotspot .
Avoiding it is simple in this case : just do n’t store the size of the list and the hotspot is gone .
Software development is the art of choosing the right tradeoffs ;-) .
Bonus : use a transactional memory system : transactional memory is supposed to bring you all the advantages of fine - grained locking while getting away with a complexity comparable to coarse grain locking .
Unfortunately , I have yet to see a transactional memory system that is ready for production ( and that ’s the reason why this is merely a bonus ) .
But maybe you do ?
If yes , be sure to let me know !
Disclaimer
The tips are not ordered according to importance , each one may help in different situations .
Some of them I have already posted in my post about thread - safety , some of them are inspired by the excellent book on Java Concurrency in Practice ( pages 229- 245 ) and some I have not seen in a written format anywhere else .
Of course , not all of them are applicable to each parallel programming system .
POSIX Threads for example has no atomic operations .
I still find this a useful list to have in one place , no matter what threading system is closest to your heart : smile : .

A brave mongrel was twice shot in the head by callous thugs - with a crossbow .
Amazingly , the friendly brindle mongrel , named Beau by nurses at the veterinary surgery , survived the vicious attack which left two crossbow bolts embedded in her skull .
It is thought Beau , who has only just been taken out of intensive care after a major two - hour operation , was fired at by two disgusting yobs at point blank range .
Scroll down for more ...
Lovable Beau was handed in to vets in Dewsbury , West Yorkshire , by police on Wednesday night .
She was found by a member of the public at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in Wakefield , with the devastating injuries .
She was given urgent pain relief when she was handed to shocked staff at the animal hospital .
And she underwent the drastic surgery on Thursday morning to remove the distinctive bolts .
Scroll down for more ...
Staff believe she was shot by two yobs at the same time because the bolts went in at different angles .
Angry vet Steve Dixon , of Calder Veterinary Group , said : " We think there were two people firing two separate crossbows at the same time at point blank range .
There is no way she would have just sat there after being hit by the first one . "
He added : " In all my years as a vet I have never seen anything like this .
It 's disgusting .
It 's one of the most extreme cases of cruelty I have ever encountered .
It is easy to tell when dogs are in a horrific amount of pain since they fail to eat and have a high heart rate . "
Scroll down for more ...
Mr Dixon said : " I think at the time it must have been incredibly painful for her and she did n't eat until after the operation but she was surprisingly calm and brave . "
He said that one of the bolts has gone in above the eye at the top of the head leaving Beau with nasty grazing on her nose .
The second bolt went in behind the right eye and came out under the left ear .
After surgery to remove the bolts , Mr Dixon said : " We do n't know her name , she should probably be called Lucky - although we have named her Beau .
One of the bolts was four or five inches into her skull , quite near the brain .
" It 's amazing that it missed all the vital parts of her head as it went straight through the middle .
It just goes to show how lucky we are that dogs have quite small brains . "
He added : " It 's likely that , because it 's such a friendly dog , it has been beckoned towards whoever has shot it and they have then shot it at point blank range twice in the head - they 've tried to kill it .
" There is an argument that this sort of thing is just a step away from shooting people , because they think they can get away with it . "
Beau , who will be kept at the hospital for four or five days , is thought to be around four years old and has some skin conditions , suggesting she may have been homeless for a while although staff are appealing for a possible owner to come forward .
The crossbow arrows were maroon coloured aluminium with silver tips and red and yellow fletchings .
Mr Dixon added : " These are quite distinctive arrows so there can't be many people wandering around with a pair of these crossbows . "
A police spokeswoman said : " We would appeal to anyone who was in the area at the time , or anyone who has any information about this to contact us on 0845 6060606 . "

The crisis in Zimbabwe has led to food , currency and fuel shortages
A new currency will be introduced - striking more zeros off bank notes - in an attempt to curb the black market in currency , Gideon Gono said .
The main lending rate will also rise to 800 % from 650 % in a move to tame " angry and formidable " inflation , which is running at an annual level of 6,500 % .
Restoring economic stability is one of the government 's biggest problems .
Zimbabwe is currently experiencing the world 's highest inflation and shortages of food , fuel and foreign currency .
However , economists say the latest measures unveiled by Mr Gono will have little effect unless fundamental problems in the country are tackled .
Cuts urged
So far , the government 's only solution to its inflation problem has been to have the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe print more money .
But observers say the key to resolving Zimbabwe 's problems is to reduce government expenditure , though this looks unlikely in the short term .
While Mr Gono said inflation will fall in the medium to short term , he also warned that it would come under further pressure from spending ahead of the country 's joint parliamentary and presidential elections in 2008 .
Meanwhile , the country says it has secured a $ 200 m credit facility to increase desperately needed fuel imports , though it is unclear how the government will repay the money .
Mr Gono has also urged parliamentarians to consult widely before going ahead with the controversial bill that allows black Zimbabweans to take a majority shareholding in foreign owned companies .
In a move probably designed to show a measure of independence for the central bank , he said that rushing through the legislation could be counter - productive .
President Robert Mugabe 's government has proposed the new law in a bid to give Zimbabweans more control over the economy , despite fears it could further drive investors from the country .
Rove 's good - bye kiss : Critics of ' clear - eyed '
Bush will be wrong like critic of Vietnam war Nick Juliano
Published : Friday August 31 , 2007

On his last day in the White House , Karl Rove gave President Bush one last politically charged booster shot .
In an essay published by the conservative National Review , Rove predicted that the president he has loyally served for more than a decade would be judged positively by history , and he took the opportunity to bash calls for a withdrawal of US troops from Iraq .
Rove reiterated the comparison of a troop withdrawal to the aftermath of Vietnam .
" History will see President Bush as right , and the opponents of his policy as mistaken -- as George McGovern was in his time , " Rove wrote .
President Bush made headlines earlier this month when he reminded of the years of turmoil that followed America 's withdrawal from Vietnam in 1975 , and some historians said Bush 's analogy to the situation in Iraq was inaccurate .
Rove argued that history 's view of Bush would be more " clear - eyed " than the assessments of current administration critics .
" He will be judged as a man of moral clarity who put America on a wartime footing in the dangerous struggle against radical Islamic terrorism , " Rove wrote .
Rove praised some of the president 's most controversial policies , including his No Child Left Behind initiative , which some states have called intrusive , and his decision not to join the Kyoto agreement , which aimed to reduce global carbon emissions .
The political guru trumpeted Bush 's economic record , claiming the 2003 tax cuts led to economic growth .
Bush pursued and aggressive series of tax cuts almost as soon as he was elected , and some say his economic policies have created greater inequality .
On fighting genocide in Darfur , Rove argued that Bush had n't " refused to act , " despite his resistance to adding US troops to the region to stop the violence .
" While most of the globe ignored Sudan and Darfur or refused to act , this president labeled the violence there genocide  and pressed world leaders to take action , " Rove wrote of the extent of the president 's involvement .
Rove has nothing but kind words for the man he has known for nearly 34 years .
Without another campaign to run for the president , Rove announced earlier this month that he would be leaving his post at the White House .
Friday was his last day .

Home Realization of natural language interfaces using lazy functional programming Realization of natural language interfaces using lazy functional programming , Richard Frost , ACM Computing Surveys , Volume 38 , Issue 4 ( 2006 ) .
The construction of natural language interfaces to computers continues to be a major challenge .
The need for such interfaces is growing now that speech recognition technology is becoming more readily available , and people cannot speak those computer - oriented formal languages that are frequently used to interact with computer applications .
Much of the research related to the design and implementation of natural language interfaces has involved the use of high - level declarative programming languages .
This is to be expected as the task is extremely difficult , involving syntactic and semantic analysis of potentially ambiguous input .
The use of LISP and Prolog in this area is well documented .
However , research involving the relatively new lazy functional programming paradigm is less well known .
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of that research .
WASHINGTON , Oct. 18 — The House today upheld President Bush ’s veto of a bill to provide health insurance to 10 million children , but Democrats vowed to send it back to him next month , with minor changes , in the belief that they could ultimately prevail .
Despite a multimillion - dollar advertising campaign and intense lobbying by children ’s advocates , supporters of the bill were unable to convert a single House Republican who voted against passage of the bill last month .
For now , the insurance vote stands as the latest example of how Mr. Bush can still get his way on Capitol Hill .
Through artful use of veto threats and his veto pen , Mr. Bush has fended off attempts to force a change of course in Iraq — a feat Democrats would never have imagined when they pushed Republicans out of power a year ago .
He has twisted Democrats into knots over domestic surveillance , and forced them to rethink a resolution condemning as genocide a century - old massacre of Armenians .
The outcome today , reminding Democrats of the limits of their power , came as Congress and the president prepared to square off over a dozen spending bills needed to finance the government in the new fiscal year .
President Bush has threatened to veto at least 10 of those measures , while also holding the Democrats responsible for not acting more quickly on the bills , which were supposed to be enacted by Sept. 30 .
This office in Llangadog has been struck three times
Residents in Llangadog said trucks and lorries were smashing into buildings that have already had thousands of pounds spent on them .
One property , once thought to have been a toll house , has been hit three times .
The Townscape Heritage Initiative , which oversees the restoration work , said there was growing concern over the rise in traffic through the village .
Around £ 1.5 m is being spent restoring landmark properties in Llangadog and Llandovery .
The Townscape officer for Carmarthenshire Council , Roger Morgan , said Llangadog residents were convinced that satellite navigation was to blame for the damage .
" It 's a very small narrow road and these large lorries are coming through the village and causing problems for everyone , " he said .
There has been a tremendous increase in traffic
Roger Morgan , Townscape officer
An office used by an architectural consultant in the village has taken the brunt of the damage .
" Since the lime rendering has been applied to the front of the building it has been damaged at least three times , " said Mr Morgan .
' Mounting concern '
In August , the Vale of Glamorgan council became so concerned over lorries being sent along narrow roads near St Hilary it began trials of a sign warning drivers to ignore sat -nav directions .
In the same month , a Polish lorry driver became trapped for three hours at Ty Croes in Carmarthenshire after following sat -nav directions .
Roger Morgan said there was " mounting concern " in Llangadog at the number of heavy vehicles using routes to cross from the Black Mountain in the Brecon Beacons through the Llangadog area .
" There has been a tremendous increase in traffic and there 's no reason for it to come over the Black Mountain unless they have been directed that way , " he said .
" I think the thing is to stop them coming over the mountain by telling them not to use the route from a sat - nav point of view . "

In 1981 , the New England Journal of Medicine published a Harvard study that showed an unexpected link between drinking coffee and pancreatic cancer .
As it happened , researchers were anticipating a connection between alcohol or tobacco and cancer .
But according to the survey of several hundred patients , booze and cigarettes did n't seem to increase your risk .
Then came a surprise :
An incidental survey question suggested that coffee did increase the chances of pancreatic cancer .
So that 's what got published .
Those positive results , alas , were entirely anomalous ; 20 years of follow - up research showed the coffee - cancer connection to be bunk .
Nonetheless , it 's a textbook example of so - called publication bias , where science gets skewed because only positive correlations see the light of day .
After all , the surprising findings are what makes the news ( and careers ) .
So what happens to all the research that does n't yield a dramatic outcome — or , worse , the opposite of what researchers had hoped ?
It ends up stuffed in some lab drawer .
The result is a vast body of squandered knowledge that represents a waste of resources and a drag on scientific progress .
This information — call it dark data — must be set free .
For the past couple of years , there 's been much talk about open access , the idea that more scientific publications should be freely available — not locked behind firewalls and subscriptions .
Thanks to the Public Library of Science ( PLoS ) and other organizations , that notion is making headway .
Liberating dark data takes this ethos one step further .
It also makes many scientists deeply uncomfortable , because it calls for them to reveal their " failures . "
But in this data - intensive age , those apparent dead ends could be more important than the breakthroughs .
After all , some of today 's most compelling research efforts are n't one - off studies that eke out statistically significant results , they 're meta-studies — studies of studies — that crunch data from dozens of sources , producing results that are much more likely to be true .
What 's more , your dead end may be another scientist 's missing link , the elusive chunk of data they needed .
Freeing up dark data could represent one of the biggest boons to research in decades , fueling advances in genetics , neuroscience , and biotech .
So why does n't it happen ?
In part , it 's a logistics problem : Advocating the release of dark data is one thing , but it 's quite another to actually collect it , juggling different formats and standards .
And , of course , there 's the issue of storage .
These days , an astronomical study of quasars or an ambitious bioinformatics project can generate several terabytes of data .
Few have the capacity to store that , let alone analyze it .
Google , among others , is lending a hand with its Palimpsest project , offering to store and share monster - size data sets ( making the data searchable is n't a part of the effort ) .
As storage costs drop , similar data banks will emerge , along with format standards , and it should become ever easier to share results , good or bad .
Technology is actually the simple part .
The tougher problem lies in the culture of science .
More and more , research is funded by commercial entities , which deem any results proprietary .
And even among fair - minded academics , the pressures of time , tender , and tenure can make openness an afterthought .
If their research is successful , many academics guard their data like Gollum , wringing all the publication opportunities they can out of it over years .
If the research does n't pan out , there 's a strong incentive to move on , ASAP , and a disincentive to linger in eddies that may not advance one 's job prospects .
There are some islands of innovation .
Since 2002 , the Journal of Negative Results in Biomedicine has offered a peer - reviewed home to results that go negative or against the grain .
Earlier this year , the journal Nature started Nature Precedings , a Web - based forum for prepublication research and unpublished manuscripts in biomedicine , chemistry , and the earth sciences .
At Drexel University , chemist Jean - Claude Bradley practices " open notebook " science — chronicling his lab 's work and sharing data via blog and wiki .
And PLoS is planning an open repository for research and data that is other wise abandoned .
These are great first steps .
But freeing dark data should be the norm , not the exception .
Once the storage and format problems are solved , scientists will need easy ways to search and retrieve each other 's data .
( And there should be a simple way , perhaps via metadata , to make sure that work is always duly cited and acknowledged by others . )
Congress should mandate that all federally funded research be disseminated , whatever the results .
Getting science comfortable with exposing its dark data is really just the beginning .
Once you start looking for it , dark data is everywhere :
It 's locked away in out - of - print books and orphaned art , the stuff that Creative Commons and Google Book Search have been bringing to light .
Speaking of which :
Hey , Google !
Know all those research projects your employees do that the company will never green - light ?
How about letting the rest of the world take a crack at them ?

Something to Watch : Health Care Becomes a “ Competitive Disadvantage ” ?
We ’ve recently noticed several corporations complain that they are at a competitive disadvantage operating in the US because of health care costs .
These firms claim that it is to their advantage to employ workers outside the US or to cut US benefits because health care systems in many other countries are nationalized .
Thus , these corporations believe they can become more competitive by operating outside the US because they do not have the semi- fixed cost of US private sector health care benefits .
This is an interesting twist to the health care debate , and should be watched closely as next year ’s mid-term elections approach .
The political environment might force both sides of the aisle to suggest programs to counteract that competitive disadvantage and save / create jobs in the US .
We find this somewhat disconcerting from an investment strategy point of view .
This could be a risk to our highlighted , but admittedly hardly out - of - consensus , overweight of the Health Care sector .
