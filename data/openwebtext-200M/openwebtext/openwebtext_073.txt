To take advantage of the energy - saving opportunities , some product standards would have to be tightened and some policy incentives changed .
Current regulations and fuel subsidies , for example , often favor consumption over efficiency .
But many steps are not taken , the report said , because energy users lack information or do not value efficiency enough to change their buying habits .
“ The opportunities are huge and yet they are being left on the table , ” said Diana Farrell , director of the McKinsey Global Institute , a research arm of the McKinsey consulting firm .
“ Standard economics would say that energy prices would work their way through everything .
But that ’s not really the case , particularly in the consumer market . ”
That is especially the case , according to other energy experts and executives , if an energy - thrifty product has a slightly higher purchase price and the financial payoff for users takes a while .
That helps explain the slow progress made by compact fluorescent light bulbs in the marketplace .
Years ago , these efficient light bulbs cost up to 10 times as much as conventional incandescent bulbs , and their light had a somewhat different hue .
But today , the light spectrum has been corrected and compact fluorescents are only slightly more costly than conventional bulbs , yet they last 10 times as long and consume 75 percent less electricity .
The overall financial advantage of using compact fluorescent bulbs is obvious and sizable , even if the initial purchase price is higher .
“ One of the great mysteries is why the public has not shifted faster to fluorescent bulbs , ” said Alexander Lidow , a Stanford - educated physicist and the chief executive of International Rectifier , a maker of power management equipment for energy - efficient appliances .

BBC News , Paris
The title , " A history of politeness in France " , might strike the uncharitable as being a very short book indeed .
The famed romance of Paris may need to be tempered with realism
But Frederic Rouvillois ' definitive study of manners through the ages in France weighs in at a crushing 550 pages .
It joins Nadine de Rothschild 's best - selling bible of politeness in offering advice to those in need of guidance on how to behave in that oxymoron , " polite French society " .
For this season of festive meals can be a minefield for those uneducated in French ways .
Oh , if only I had read their advice before venturing out to my first Parisian dinner party .
I had arrived punctually at the chic Parisian flat on the Left Bank , on the dot of eight o'clock in the evening , as per the invitation , bearing flowers for my hostess .
I wondered why she seemed slightly put out .
I realised , when the other guests - politicians , a philosopher , a banker or two and their wives - finally arrived an hour later .
The conversation was in rapid - fire French , no allowances made for the only foreigner in the room .
So , to make myself feel more at ease , I reached over to a bottle of wine , to pour myself a second glass .
The entire table suddenly fell silent as the wine emerged loudly , and in slow motion , into my glass .
A deep froideur descended as 10 pairs of steely Parisian eyes turned to stare .
I smiled weakly and remained quiet for the rest of the meal , fleeing as soon as I politely could .
Clearly , I had committed an unforgivable faux pas , although what it had been I was n't sure .
Cardinal sins
It was only this week that I discovered just how many terrible solecisms I 'd committed under the strict laws of French etiquette .
My lesson came courtesy of Constance Reitzler , director of La Belle Ecole - " the beautiful school " - which aims to give Parisians and foreigners alike that special polish .
It teaches the " arts de vivre " , that uniquely French concept which encompasses everything from how to appreciate your wine and food , to whether to eat your sorbet or ice - cream with a spoon or a fork .
It 's a fork , for those who want to know .
And never spread your foie gras on your toast .
Eat it with a fork , and the toast separately .
Constance patiently explained that a lady never , ever grabs the bottle of wine to pour her own drink .
She must wait for her host or another man to pour it for her .
And more than one aperitif before dinner is considered the sure sign of an alcoholic , or an Englishwoman .
We are , after all , a nation renowned in France for 'le binge - drinking ' .
And I had compounded the offence by wishing those at the table " bon appetit " , before noisily expressing my appreciation of the food .
Both , apparently , cardinal sins in the Bible of French etiquette .
" Wishing someone bon appetit is seen as very vulgar in polite circles , " Constance explained , as I realised to my horror that I must have wished almost every French person I have ever met at a meal " bon appetit " .
Paris ' syndrome '
So why did n't the BBC send me on this course before I began my job in Paris ?
Buying clothes in the land of haute couture is no easy experience
And apparently in France it 's good manners to keep your elbows ON the table , and your hands visible .
The custom dates back centuries , to when noblewomen did so to display their dazzling rings , to show off their husbands ' social status .
Keeping your hands above the table shows that you 're concentrating on your meal .
And , I thought unworthily , that you are not using them to get to know the husband next to you rather better than his wife might like .
I , of course , had politely kept my elbows off the table , and my hands beneath it while not eating - goodness only knows what all the wives had thought .
But I wondered who was ruder : myself , for not understanding the local customs , or my hosts , for making me feel so ill at ease .
The phrase , " the customer is king " , has clearly lost something in translation .
Or perhaps the French think it a reference to the Revolution , a chance to cut the customer down to size
It 's not that the French are necessarily rude - but Parisians certainly can be .
A psychiatrist has coined a term for its effect on Japanese visitors to the city : " Paris Syndrome " .
Every year , several Japanese tourists have to be repatriated from Paris after falling prey to severe culture shock at the hands of the less than polite Parisians .
Waiters who fail to understand their order , taxi drivers who take them to the wrong place and then charge double .
All this is too much for some to take , as their dream of the city of light crumbles into a nightmare of darkness , creating a sense of rejection and paranoia .
' Bon appetit '
Yet I know exactly how they feel after my encounter at a dress shop last week .
I picked up a skirt to try on , and as I took it to the changing room , the shop assistant shouted out across the crowded room : " I would n't bother if I were you - it 'll never fit ! "
The phrase , " the customer is king " , has clearly lost something in translation .
Or perhaps the French think it a reference to the Revolution , a chance to cut the customer down to size .
Madame La Guillotine may no longer be available , but a sharp tongue can do the job just as well .
Perhaps Constance can help both sides .
As I rose to leave the Belle Ecole , she politely handed me a two - page guide to etiquette , with an expression of sympathy , though whether for my past and future hosts or for myself , I was n't sure .
I glanced at it .
It could have been tailor - made for the oafish , drunken Englishwoman who came to dinner .
" Never down your drink in one " , and " ne jamais ecraser le buste vers l'assiette " or " do n't put your bust in your plate " and " never make noises of satisfaction at the dinner table " .
And never , ever say bon appetit .
So now I know .
And in spite of that , I 'd like everyone across Britain to join me now in wishing all in France a very bon appetit indeed this Christmas .

AMERICAN STOPS WASHING HAIR !
number one by Jason Headley Greetings friends .
I 've sent you this email because you have knowledge of my hair .
Some of you , who are family , are genetically related to or responsible for it .
Others , with whom I attended college , saw the great " Let It Grow " experiment in all its strange glory .
The rest of you I feel are simply intellectually curious enough to wonder what might happen when a man simply stops washing his hair .
That 's right .
I 've stopped washing my hair altogether .
The last time I washed my hair was on the morning of Friday , October 5th .
It was an otherwise normal day , and at the time I had no idea it would be my last washing .
But then night fell , and through the darkness came a great illumination .
While at a bar , where most great epiphanies occur , a friend of mine mentioned that he had n't washed his hair in almost fifteen years .
Apparently he 'd seen a TV show once where these science guys asked a woman to stop washing her hair or using any type of hair products for six weeks .
She was only allowed to rinse her hair with water to keep it clean .
Well , after the six weeks , she was back on the show and her hair looked healthy and shiny and soft and all that other shit you want your hair to be .
The science guys explained that after a certain period of time , your hair reverts to its natural state of balance .
( I had quite a few drinks in me by this point , but I 'm certain my friend used words like " oils " and " equilibrium " in a combination that seemed to make a lot of sense . )
So this friend of mine said he tried it , and after a couple of weeks of fairly dreadful hair days , his locks began to settle into their own .
And since that time , he has n't washed his hair or put anything in it besides water .
( Except for one time when he had lice , but he swears that had nothing to do with the whole hair - washing thing . )
The next morning , when I showered , I skipped the usual shampoo , condition , add leave - in product that I normally did .
I decided I certainly had six weeks to kill .
It 's not like I even have to do anything .
Actually , I have to do way less that normal .
It 's like the lazy man 's science .
It 's simple , but somehow quite complex .
It involves chemistry , biology , psychology , sociology and probably a few other ologies that I 'm not even aware of yet .
So for the next six weeks , I 'll put nothing in my hair besides water .
The plan is to keep you all updated on the progress , possibly even including some digital photos so you can see the results for yourselves .
If you have any questions that I do n't answer in my discourse , please ask .
This hair experiment is for the good of mankind , really .
All inquiries will be researched and responded to .
As I 'm already on Day 4 of the project , I 'll offer up a quick summary to date : DAY 1 : Fuzzy DAY 2 : Frizzy DAY 3 : Fuzzy , with brief moments of frizziness .
DAY 4 : I 'm suffering from jet lag and detox from my wild weekend in New York , so my hair does n't seem to look or feel any more fuzzy than the rest of me .
Which is by no means a good thing .
Stay tuned for another update in a few days .
And if you 're not interested in this project at all and would just prefer to get the final update when the Department of Health and Human Services descends upon my residence and forcibly shaves my head for the sake of public hygiene , let me know and I 'll take you off the list .
Till next time .
Yer fuzzy buddy ,
Jason Headley is the author of the novel Small Town Odds .

The West Virginia Surf Report !
Wow , what a great audience .
Has anyone heard the one about the Austrians and their stalled car ?
OK .
What do you call four Austrians gathered around a broken down car with the hood up ?
A wine tasting !!
Ha ! < tap , tap , tap >
Is this thing on ?
So I see you do n’t get the Austrian wine joke .
Let me provide a bit of background on Austria ’s infamous wine debacle of 1985 .
A group of winemaking “ middlemen ” decided to add a little something called diethylene glycol to their wine .
Diethylene glycol is essentially antifreeze .
Oh , and it tastes sweet too .
And it ’s , umm , also kind of toxic .
The scheming winemakers added small amounts of this chemical to sweeten their wine in an attempt to increase its appeal .
Inexplicably , one of them claimed his portion of antifreeze costs as a deducted business expense on his tax return .
Fortunately for potential customers , the scam was quickly discovered and halted .
Alas , this also signaled the end of many a wine comedian ’s material .
Nowadays it ’s damn near impossible to joke about Austrian wine .
The noble and honest Austrian wine producers used the ’ 85 embarrassment as a catalyst to develop some of the world ’s most stringent wine laws .
Additionally , many prominent Austrian vintners modeled their work after master wine makers in France and Germany .
As a result , wine from the land of Mozart is now considered a classic in many circles .
Austrian wines are more “ groovy ” than classic .
By groovy , I mean “ Grüner Veltliner , ” which is the name of Austria ’s very own native wine grape .
And since many wine drinkers can’t seem to get the pronunciation straight ( say it with me now : groo - nur felt - leen - er ) , it is commonly referred to as , “ Gru - V ” or “ groovy . ”
Gru -V produces wine that is best described as Riesling with a lime twist and dash of pepper .
In the mouth , it is spicy and tangy rather than sweet .
Yet , there remains a fruity - floral bouquet that tickles the nose .
Gru -V is n’t cheap .
Prices usually start at $ 20 and climb steeply from there .
However , Gru -V is quite dependable ; Austria ’s climate is ideal for this grape , and the wine is consistently made at a high level of quality ( lest there be any more Austrian wine jokes ) .
Höpler produces an entry level Gru-V for around twelve dollars ( Höpler Grüner Veltliner , ’ 03 ) .
For twenty dollars , Loimer offers a terrific Gru-V ( Loimer Grüner Veltliner Langenlois , ’03 ) .
Now , if you ’re willing to peel off another few bills , you can delve into Austria ’s world of stylized wine .

As a member of the Jewish ultra-Orthodox community , David wore a long black coat and a black hat covering his Jewish skullcap .
He spent 10 hours a day studying the Torah , the Jewish holy book , and the Talmud , rabbinical discussions on Jewish law , ethics and customs .
David says that he used to want to be a rabbi - but that was then .
Ultra-orthodox Jews represent some 8 % of Israel 's population
Now , David , 24 , wears blue jeans and loose - fitting T - shirts .
He no longer believes in religion , saying that he is completely secular .
He is currently at university and hopes to become an engineer .
David - who does not want use his full name - is one of hundreds of young Israelis who leave their ultra- orthodox communities to join the secular world , according to Daat Emet , an organisation that works on the issue .
People who leave the ultra - orthodox community are considered unbelievers who have lost their way in life .
The community is very closed and senior religious officials rarely comment on this phenomenon .
For many who do choose to leave , the journey is one mired with difficulties and full of pain .
I see the ultra-orthodox as fundamentalists ... and now I 'm leading an enlightened life
David
But it also symbolises the division between Israel 's ultra-religious communities and its secular population .
The ultra -orthodox community represents about 8 % of the population .
Its members adhere to strict interpretation of Jewish law and are shut off from mainstream society .
David grew up as the second eldest in a family of eight in an ultra-Orthodox community located in Jerusalem .
His education was exclusively religious studies from the age of 13 onwards .
He was bright , but had only a basic knowledge of maths and other subjects .
Military service
" It was like a wall blocking us from the rest of the world , " he says .
But one evening he attended a lecture that questioned the beliefs of the ultra-Orthodox community .
" I wanted to prove that they were wrong , " says David , explaining why he attended the lecture .
" I was angry that they would say such things .
But I left that night thinking they might be right . "
For the next four months , he wrestled with his beliefs - particularly with Talmudic law .
He asked his rabbis a series of questions about biology and the natural world but they went unanswered .
From this point on , his whole faith started quickly unravelling .
David then decided to perform Israeli military service .
The ultra-Orthodox community are exempt from this service .
Family separation
" It was a hard step , " he says .
" But I knew that I could n't continue living in the community when I did n't believe in the religion .
I would be cheating myself . "
When David 's mother saw a letter from the army she instantly knew that her son had lost his faith .
His family moved quickly to ostracise him .
" My mother told me that I had to leave the family because I would be a bad influence on my brothers and sisters , " he says , recalling the incident five years ago .
His father has not spoken to him since that day .
And David has only sporadic contact with his mother and his siblings .
He joined the army and served the obligatory three years .
But during leave , he had nowhere to go .
An organisation which supports young people leaving religious communities provided David with a surrogate family .
It was difficult .
" I left the community without any tools to start my new life , " he says .
But David appears happy with his new life and says he has no regrets .
" I see the ultra-Orthodox as fundamentalists , " he says .
" And now I 'm leading an enlightened life . "
Site not Updated !!
This site has n't been maintained or updated for a considerable number of years and is just left in place for historic reasons .
Many of the techniques discussed here are not relevant these days and use out - dated techniques not applicable to today 's web design structures .
The demos may still be of interest as they show various techniques but most of these demos were created before mobiles existed so are n't relevant today .
They do however show ingenious methods ( hoops ) that we used to have to jump through to get browsers to behave .
If you want to see more modern demos then please follow me on codepen instead .
Welcome to pmob.co.uk a site dedicated to hosting fully supported examples of CSS implementation .
Within the tutorials and FAQ you 'll find examples of how to create CSS based page layouts , style your documents and organise your code .
This site also exposes , then shows you how to fix , many of the bugs and foibles of the most common browsers .
Even though this site is currently undergoing a facelift it is fully functional .
You can still visit all of its most popular components including the FAQ tutorials ( which are not meant as a lesson in aesthetics ) , the three column Demos ( still valid today even though they were done 2 years ago ) and various examples of how to use css to add content to your site .
Be aware that some of these techniques are quite advanced and require a reasonable understanding of CSS .
Consequently if you 're relatively new to CSS taking a glance through the tutorials should give you a good idea of whether you 're ready to start using them .
Again , none of the examples are meant to be pretty and I have spent no time beautifying them ( as you can tell ) .
Indeed I seem to have gone out of my way to make them as ugly as possible ( it 's a good talking point ) .
Some of the demos listed below are simply experiments without explanation .
However , as many people have found them interesting part of my site redesign plan includes documenting them fully .
If the particular example has not been fully documented yet please check back later and if you intend to forge ahead unassisted , the examples are at the least well organised and with some perseverance will , I hope , prove helpful .
The age of the demos listed below vary greatly and going through them to sort out the wheat from the chaf is another item on my to - do list .
To help direct readers to the recently updated and documented demos I have placed them in little beige boxes .
Working my way through all the demos though is going to take some time !

Wilson would have been taken to a bunker under the Cotswolds
They reveal that government bunkers would be manned by civil servants , emergency legislation would be passed , and hospitals would be emptied .
TV was to close down , and the BBC to begin a wartime service on radio .
The prime minister would be taken to his bunker but there were no plans at that time to evacuate civilians .
' Crown Jewels '
However , the papers showed art treasures from London and Edinburgh would be saved by being sent to slate mines in Wales .
The information is among a raft of unseen material that has been revealed in government records from 1975 , now released to the public at the National Archives in Kew , south - west London .
Given the notorious sentiment of the British public about animals , this could make the government look unnecessarily unsympathetic
Foreign Office
Pandas almost cause a crisis
On the preparations for a nuclear attack historian Peter Hennessy told the BBC's Sanchia Berg the documents were the most secret he had ever seen ,
He said : " These were the Crown Jewels of genuine official secrecy ... because you did n't want the other side to get your war plans .
" Also the degree of alarm for the civilian population , in relatively tranquil times , that a leakage of this would have produced would have been extraordinary . "
Other Cabinet papers showed Harold Wilson was warned in 1975 that Britain 's economy faced " possible wholesale domestic liquidation " .
One minister told the Labour prime minister there could be constitutional crisis if inflation continued to rise .
BBC 'hippies '
Documents show concerns a year before an International Monetary Fund loan was requested .
They also reveal Chancellor Denis Healey and Industry Secretary Tony Benn at odds over policy .
Further documents released this week reveal :
Two pandas in London Zoo sparked fears a diplomatic rift could flare up between Britain and China in the 1970s .
The extent of behind - the - scenes Cabinet splits before the 1975 referendum on British membership of the Common Market .
How British diplomats secretly floated the idea that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein - seen then as a figure to be courted - could be brought to the UK for a back operation .
That in discussions between Prime Minister Harold Wilson and the BBC 's chairman they talked about whether there were too many " hippies " in the corporation .
The blocking of plans for the Queen Mother to fly to Iran in Concorde by Harold Wilson because he was worried about the plane 's safety .
The prime minister 's plan to protect local breweries by nationalising them as part of an initiative to show he was sensitive to small problems that caused people concern , called " little things that mean a lot " .
That John Stonehouse , the Labour MP who faked his own death , spent months rehearsing his new identity .
( There ’s always a dilemma between “ publishing soon ” and “ polishing for peer review . ”
This is my first attempt at blog - based collaborative peer - review .
Let ’s see how it goes ! )
The Problem
Phishing is a serious issue , and it ’s only getting worse .
Through various means ,
Alice ends up at a spoofed web site she thinks she recognizes ( usually her bank ) .
She inevitably ends up providing her login credentials , which the attacker can then use to perform ( malicious ) actions on Alice ’s behalf .
Theoretically , assuming Alice ’s browser is relatively secure , she could check the URL and the SSL certificate and defend against these kinds of attack .
In practice , users do n’t check the URL or are easily fooled by similarly spelled URLs and other dirty tricks .
Various anti-phishing solutions in the past help to some degree , though they all tend to have one annoying property : if the user is really not paying attention , if the anti-phishing solution errors out , the user gets phished .
That ’s not okay .
We need a solution where , if the proposed solution errors out , the user may get denied access , may become confused , but she can not get phished .
At a high level , this requires two - factor authentication , where even if the user gets fooled into revealing the password she knows , that ’s not enough for an attacker to gain her full login credentials .
OpenID and CardSpace
The OpenID project is a distributed , web - based single sign - on system that requires no changes to the user ’s browser .
Unfortunately , as Kim Cameron and Ben Laurie have recently pointed out , OpenID as it is specified makes phishing worse , because an attacker can simply offer OpenID logins on a semi-legitimate web site and then play Man - in - the - Middle for the user ’s OpenID login page .
OpenID folks have mostly ruled this issue out of scope , which is unfortunate .
As it stands , OpenID makes things less secure than they currently are .
Some folks are trying to address this issue by augmenting OpenID with other features , for example using a browser plugin .
There are also signs that the OpenID community is starting to take this concern more seriously , though no good solution exists yet .
Meanwhile , Microsoft is about to deploy CardSpace , a radically new way to authenticate to web sites , with a significantly revamped client - side experience .
On technical grounds and security , CardSpace appears to be quite solid .
I ’m most impressed with the user interface aspects , which really make it much harder to get successfully phished .
Unfortunately , deploying CardSpace on both client and server is fairly involved , and may take time .
So the question is : can we find a middle ground ?
Something that is more secure than the OpenID spec , but not quite as involved as deploying CardSpace ?
Ideally , something that does n’t even require a plugin ?
We do n’t have to have the entire feature set of CardSpace , but at least we should aim to make phishing far more difficult .
And , ideally , we could make this OpenID+ , something that only slightly alters the model for OpenID , while leaving the existing protocols in place .
Last Minute Edit : looks like CardSpace and OpenID will soon have a collaboration story .
I do n’t think this reduces the need for an immediate anti-phishing solution with minimal client - side work , but it ’s an interesting move nevertheless .
Related Work
In recent days , Simon Willinson and then Ka-Ping Yee proposed having Alice use a bookmark to reach her OpenID server , rather than rely on the web site to redirect appropriately .
This is interesting , and one of the OpenID implementors , JanRain , thinks so too .
( In the interest of full scientific disclosure , I was working on a bookmark - related idea independently and around the same time as Simon and Ka-Ping , but they published their ideas first .
There is a substantive difference between their proposal and mine , so this presentation should still be useful . )
A Proposal : BeamAuth
What if a bookmark could be a second factor for authentication ?
In this proposal , the bookmark is more than a server locator : it also contains a secret token .
It would be useful if the login process that folks are used to is not radically altered .
Because this is BookMark Authentication , or BMAuth , my proposal is called BeamAuth .
With BeamAuth , Alice registers with a web site ( which may be an OpenID provider ) , http://beamauth.org , and obtains some kind of confirmation page which presents a special bookmark , “ BeamAuth , ” which she can drag to her bookmarks bar .
This bookmark contains , within it , a secondary secret token , randomly generated by beamauth.org , that complements Alice ’s password .
Later , when Alice wants to log in , she :
visits http://beamauth.org/login , either manually or because some other site redirected her there ( with OpenID , for example ) , clicks her BeamAuth bookmark , which automatically fills in her username into the login form and “ injects ” a secondary secret token into the page scope , enters her password into the form , and submits the form .
How does this prevent phishing ?
URL checked by BeamAuth : If Alice clicks her BeamAuth bookmark at a location that is not her proper login page , the bookmark sends Alice to her actual login page .
Some confusion may ensue since Alice was expecting to log in to a specific web site ( which is now lost ) , but at least Alice wo n’t enter her password on a phishing site .
In other words , as long as Alice remembers to click her BeamAuth bookmark before typing in her password , her password is safe .
: If Alice clicks her BeamAuth bookmark at a location that is not her proper login page , the bookmark sends Alice to her actual login page .
Some confusion may ensue since Alice was expecting to log in to a specific web site ( which is now lost ) , but at least Alice wo n’t enter her password on a phishing site .
In other words , as long as Alice remembers to click her BeamAuth bookmark before typing in her password , her password is safe .
Two - Factor Authentication : If Alice is somehow duped into typing her password without clicking her BeamAuth bookmark , she only reveals her password , not the second secret token within the bookmark .
The attacker only obtained half the login credentials , while the other half remains safely hidden inside BeamAuth .
If you like this already , you might wonder , “ why not just have the password in the bookmark so Alice does n’t have to type anything ? ”
Well , that would work , too , and it would be phishing - proof , but it seems preferable to make sure the bookmark is not entirely sufficient to perform the login , just in case an attacker gains physical control of Alice ’s machine for a few minutes ( lunchtime attack ) .
How Does This Work ?
The bookmark looks like :
http://beamauth.org/login#ben@adida.net|8b7c8xcv882340235098142308
Thus , if you are at the location http://beamauth.org/login , as you are when you are redirected for single sign - on , e.g. OpenID , this does not cause a page reload , it simply appends everything after the “ # ” sign to your URL address bar .
This portion of the URL is called the fragment identifier .
Crucially , it is n’t sent over the network .
However , your login page ’s Javascript can pick it up and use it for computation , which is exactly what BeamAuth does .
Specifically , BeamAuth Javascript HMAC ’s the user ’s password with the bookmark token as a key , all inside the web browser , and the result is the user ’s login credential .
The URL before the pound sign has to match exactly , though , which means that if request parameters are required , they should be sent to the URL via a POST , or stored in the server - side session .
In Opera and Safari , only the latter solution ( parameters stored in the server - side session ) works , because a click on the bookmark will always cause a reload in Safari , and in Opera if the URL is the result of a POST .
Is This Really Better ?
I think so .
The current JanRain implementation of Simon ’s suggestion might still lead a user to be phished : an evil web site sends the user to a spoofed login page , which happily accepts his password .
In other words , a momentary lapse of judgment on behalf of the user will still result in the user being phished .
I do n’t think this can happen with BeamAuth , mostly because BeamAuth is a two - factor solution .
The only downside is that BeamAuth requires Javascript .
If you have Javascript turned off , you ’re still safe , of course : an attacker ca n’t log in .
But then again , neither can you .
One solution is then to send the secondary token to the server directly over SSL , without Javascript on the client .
I like this less , but it ’s workable .
Extensions
Of course , passwords should n’t be transmitted in the clear , and neither should our computed credential which results from two user factors .
The computed credential should be exchanged over SSL or using a challenge - response protocol .
That ’s not too hard to implement .
What ’s interesting is that , if you ’re not worried about IP / DNS spoofing , you can safely use BeamAuth without SSL .
That ’s a bit dangerous , but it ’s likely more secure than using a login server over SSL without BeamAuth , because users never check the SSL padlock anyways .
There may be a way to provide a more consistent experience across all browsers using bookmarklet tricks .
I ’m exploring this possibility with Filipe Almeida .
The trick is to find a piece of Javascript that the phisher cannot hijack , which is a lot harder than it sounds .

A man in jail on Rikers Island has been accused of trying to hire someone to behead Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly and to bomb Police Headquarters .
The police said the man , David Brown , 47 , of Prospect Heights , Brooklyn , was charged yesterday with second - degree criminal solicitation in a plot that was discovered after the police received a tip on the department ’s Crime Stoppers hot line on Feb. 13 .
Not only did Mr. Brown offer to pay $ 15 , 000 to have Mr. Kelly killed , the police said , but he also specified that he wanted him beheaded , the police said .
He also offered to pay $ 50,000 to have the 14 - story headquarters in Lower Manhattan bombed , though he was told that a job could cost upward of $ 150,000 , the police said .
It was unclear whether Mr. Brown had the resources to pay such fees , the police said .
Mr. Brown is to be arraigned today in the Bronx .
In December , while he was in custody for violating an order of protection , Mr. Brown asked a fellow inmate to contact someone he could pay to kill Mr. Kelly , the police said .
His request led an undercover officer posing as a contract killer to reach out to Mr. Brown , who has been convicted on a total of 30 charges , including 5 violent crimes , according to Paul J. Browne , the Police Department ’s chief spokesman .
In 2001 , he was convicted of attempting to murder his wife , the police said .

Nintendo Wii
Released November 2006
The console was known by the codename of " Revolution " until April 27 , 2006 , when it was renamed Wii , spelled with two " i"s to imply an image of players gathering together , as well as to represent the console 's controllers .
It is said Wii sounds like ' we ' , which emphasizes that the console is for everyone .
Wii can easily be remembered by people around the world , no matter what language they speak .
No confusion .
No need to abbreviate .
Just Wii "
The Wii Remote is a one - handed controller that uses a combination of accelerometers and infrared detection to sense its position in 3D space .
This allows users to control the game using physical gestures as well as traditional button presses .
The controller connects to the console using Bluetooth , and features force feedback , 4KB non-volatile memory and an internal speaker .
Perhaps the most important of these devices is the Nunchuk unit , which features an accelerometer and a traditional analog stick with two trigger buttons .
In addition , an attachable wrist strap can be used to prevent the player from unintentionally dropping or throwing the device .

University of California , Berkeley , graduate student Allen Liu last Friday donned coveralls , a blindfold , earplugs and gloves , then got down on all fours and sniffed out a 33 - foot chocolate trail through the grass .
This was no fraternity initiation , but part of an experiment to find out whether mammals compare information coming from their two nostrils in order to aid scent - tracking performance , much like they compare information from their ears in order to locate a sound .
In a paper appearing this week in the advance online edition of Nature Neuroscience , UC Berkeley researchers report conclusive evidence from these experiments that humans do indeed gain a performance advantage from cross-nostril comparisons .
They also found that humans can scent - track , and that , with training , they can improve their accuracy significantly while nearly doubling their speed along the scent trail .
In one experiment , the authors found that while volunteers with one nostril blocked could still track a scent - in this experiment , essence of chocolate - volunteers with two open nostrils tracked a scent quicker and with fewer deviations from the trail .
" We were asking the question , ' Are two nostrils better than one " ' " said lead author Jess Porter , a graduate student in biophysics at UC Berkeley .
" The answer is yes . "
Apparently , according to Porter and her colleagues , the mammalian brain compares smells between nostrils to tell where an odor is coming from in the same way that the brain compares the sounds entering a person 's two ears to locate a source .
Until now , many researchers thought this was unlikely because a mammal 's nostrils , in a mouse , for example , are too close together to receive distinctly different smells .
" The human brain compares information from two ' noses ' to turn smell information into spatial information , " said Noam Sobel , associate professor of neuroscience and psychology and member of the program in biophysics at UC Berkeley .

Sobel hopes to use information from these experiments to design scent - tracking robots equipped with his eNose , an electronic nose that one day could detect odors such as that from an explosive mine .
To test Sobel and Porter 's smell hypothesis , the UC Berkeley researchers soaked a 33 - foot ( 10 - meter ) string in chocolate essence and laid it in the grass outside Barker Hall , located at the northwest corner of the UC Berkeley campus .
They then garbed volunteers to block their senses of sight , hearing and touch , eliminating all clues other than smell to guide them along the trail .
Sniffing like bloodhounds , two - thirds of 32 subjects were able to follow the chocolate scent to the end of the trail within three attempts .
All volunteers zigzagged along the trail in the same way that tracking dogs follow a scent .
The researchers then trained four of these volunteers to see if they could improve .
All were able to double their speed along the track within just a few days and deviated much less from the scent trail than on their first attempts .
The researchers measured subjects ' sniffs and noticed that the faster the subjects moved along the trail , the more rapid their sniffing - just as with dogs , though not as fast as the six sniffs per second rate exhibited by dogs .
The big question , however , was whether two nostrils allow scent localization in the same way that a human 's two ears and eyes help locate sounds and sights .
To further test this , the researchers devised an ingenious nasal " prism " that mixed scents from the outside world and then presented this to both nostrils , so that there was no difference between what the nostrils smelled .
The four subjects were half as accurate at tracking smells under these conditions .
Independent measurements showed that a human's two nostrils sample odors from distinct areas separated by approximately 1.5 inches ( 3.5 centimeters ) , more than enough distance to distinguish the edge of a scent plume .
All of these experiments put the lie to a common assumption that humans are lousy smellers compared to all other mammals .
While it 's true that humans are predominantly visual creatures , Sobel said , their olfactory sense can be compared to that of dogs and other mammals .
" Our sense of smell is less keen partly because we put less demand on it , " Porter said .
" But if people practice sniffing smells , they can get really good at it . "
The work , which will be published in the journal 's January 2007 issue , was supported by the Army Research Office and the National Institute on Deafness and other Communication Disorders of the National Institutes of Health .
What do you get for the eccentric executive who has everything ?
How about the Ant Desk ?
It ’s part desk , and part Ant Farm .
How creepy is it to work at your desk while hundreds of ants scurry all around you ?
Is it distracting ?
Fascinating ?
Did some of them get out ?
Do you think you feel them crawling on your legs ?
It ’s the ultimate desk for nature lovers , bug lovers , and , well , other people who want a weird desk .
How does it work ?
It begins with a thick layer of glass or clear plastic .
This protects you from the ants , and protects the ants from you .
Below the glass is an open space with a thick layer of dirt , allowing the ants to crawl in , out , and around their tunnels , caves , and hills .
This all rests on top of a sturdy base layer , which doubles as the bottom of the desktop .
Small holes around the sides of the desk provide air , while being too small for the ants to escape .
Hundreds of ants will live happily for months , with just a little food and water periodically inserted through the feeding portals .
For cleaning , the base layer can be built to slide out on casters like a large drawer , or the glass top may be hinged to open .
I have n’t worked that out yet .
And when you get home , you can cuddle up with your loved one in front of the TV and rest your wine glasses on your Ant Coffee Table .
The perfect oddity for any living room .

Iran 's weekend offer to resume nuclear negotiations , coupled with new flexibility over how and where future uranium enrichment trials may be conducted , represents the first clear evidence that domestic and international pressure on Tehran 's hardliners is beginning to bear fruit .
But the US military build - up in the Gulf , UN sanctions , or even Washington 's latest Iraq " dossier " , are not primarily responsible for this apparent shift : American meddling with the mullahs ' money has been much more effective .
Since imposing penalties last autumn on Iran 's largest commercial bank , Bank Saderat , for allegedly transferring funds to Hizbullah and other " terrorist organisations " , the US treasury and associated agencies have been spinning an expanding , entangling web of unilateral sanctions and other punitive measures around Iran 's financial institutions and commercial enterprises .
Where direct US regulatory enforcement is impossible , as with European businesses trading with Iran , American political , diplomatic and other pressures are proving to be almost equally effective .
The unexpected success of similar action last year against a Macao bank used by North Korea 's government appears to have provided a template for the US drive .
Another big Iranian state - controlled bank , Bank Sepah , and its wholly owned UK subsidiary , was targeted last month .
Washington accused the bank of being " the financial linchpin of Iran 's missile procurement network " , and off having links to a North Korean missile technology exporter .
As in other cases , US entities and citizens were barred from dealing with the bank while assets under US jurisdiction were frozen .
Officials said the US had also " shared information " with European and other allies and private sector businesses .
There is speculation meanwhile that three other leading Iranian banks , Bank Melli , Bank Mellat and Bank Tejarat , may be targeted .
Despite legal worries and concerns about " extra- territoriality " - attempts to apply US laws beyond US shores - European governments are being urged to curtail all types of business with Iran , including commodities and manufacturing .
This goes far beyond the measures agreed in December by the UN security council and approved by EU foreign ministers yesterday .
Further limited UN sanctions will follow if Iran misses the next UN compliance deadline later this month - but again , the scope of Washington 's action remains far greater .
Unlike the US , which has almost no bilateral trade , the EU is Iran 's top trading partner , with business worth $ 25 bn ( £ 12.8 bn ) last year .
EU countries provided $ 18bn in loan guarantees in 2005 to companies doing business in Iran .
All this must stop , the Americans insist , if Iran 's proliferation and terrorism - related activities are to be effectively discouraged .
Latest figures suggest the strategy is working .
Exports from Germany , which with Italy is Iran 's leading European trade partner , dropped by an estimated 20 % last year .
" Business dealings are going backwards , de facto , " a Berlin official said .
" A lot of German companies do business with the US .
We do n't have to say anything .
They 've got the message . "
Private western banks are also under pressure to comply with what is rapidly becoming a " Cuba - plus " US - led international embargo , by withholding letters of credit , loans , loan insurance and transfer facilities .
Barclays plc and HSBC holdings are among those that have curbed their Iranian dealings .
Iran 's oil industry , providing 70 % of state revenues and crucial funding for an extensive welfare state , is a particular US target .
The industry has suffered years of underinvestment and has never entirely recovered from the Iran - Iraq war .
US pressure on western oil companies and energy - hungry governments such as Japan not to put money and technology into a country with the world 's third largest oil reserves is intense .
As a result , some estimates suggest Iran 's oil exports are falling by 10 % annually .
All this hardly helps plans by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for a 20 % increase in budget spending to quell growing public anger over rising prices and unemployment while maintaining domestic energy subsidies amounting to a massive 15 % of GDP .
Iran 's fragile , mismanaged economy , 80 % state owned or controlled and plagued by corruption and inefficiency , is the weak link in its defences , and Tehran 's leaders know it - hence , perhaps , their new nuclear flexibility .
Yet according to Roger Stern of Johns Hopkins University , Washington 's financial squeeze may be unnecessary .
" The mullahs are doing a good job of destroying Iran 's economy .
They should be left alone to complete their work , " he wrote recently .
" Attacking Iran would allow the regime to escape responsibility for the economic disaster it created .
Worse , an attack could unite Iran behind the clerical terror sponsors whose grasp on power may be slipping .
For these reasons , the best policy towards Iran may be to do nothing at all . "

When great science minds collide , the insults traded and the bile spilt has been both personal and scandalous .
But all too often , the victor 's reputation is scrubbed clean by the passage of history .
William Hartston rakes up some of the muck that has always been part and parcel of the nature of scientific practice , but that few of us know about .

Programme 1 :
Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz
It is probably impossible to overestimate the importance to science of differential and integral calculus .
It is now generally accepted that Newton and Leibniz discovered it independently of each other , Newton first formulating his methods around 1665 .
But when Leibniz , a German civil servant , published his work in 1684 and did n’t even mention the name of the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics , who had helped him in letters on more than one occasion , blood boiled in the lounges of learned societies and on podiums of lecture halls across Europe , and a schism in science opened up that would hold back British science and thinking , and would not heal for some 140 years .
Newton was buried in Westminster Abbey , a national hero .
Leibniz , who has since been described as the last universal genius , died a poor failure , with only his former secretary attending his funeral .

There are two pugilists in our second squabble .
The English contender was Joseph Priestley - a minister of the church , a librarian and literary companion to the political aristocracy .
On the French side , Antoine Lavoisier – wealthy son of a lawyer , social climber , tax collector and widely held to be the founder of modern chemistry .
In or around 1774 both men were working on a gas closely associated with combustion .
Priestley called it “ dephlogisticated air ” .
Lavoisier named it oxygen .
Their research techniques were very different – while Priestley heated and sniffed , Lavoisier heated , weighed , measured and made calculations .
It could be said that though Priestley almost certainly isolated the gas first , Lavoisier understood it first .
But the ruck did n’t seem so simple during the late 1700 ’s , when revolutions were overturning more than just chemical theories .
Lavoisier lost his head to Mme La Guillotine .
Priestley lost his house to a rioting mob in the Midlands , and fled to America .

Programme 3 :
Henry Thomas De La Beche and Roderick Impey Murchison
In the third set of tantrums we move on to the unseemly row which developed among leading earth scientists in the 1830s .
The new science of geology was just beginning to make progress with working out the sequence in which different rocks were laid down .
At the same time it was also becoming successful at predicting where coal could be found .
So all was well and there was a rush to map the country and establish names for different periods in geological history .
Then one man , Henry De La Beche , in Devon , found some fossils that according to another man , Roderick Murchison , could not be there .
They threatened Murchisons ’ theory and furious debate followed over the next decade .
Sir Roderick Impey Murchison was a wealthy Scot , military hero and reputedly one of the finest fox hunters in the land .
He was typical of the gentlemen amateurs who were making the running in the new science of geology .
Tipped for the presidency of the geological society , he did not take kindly to the findings .
Henry De La Beche was one of a new breed of geologists who actually had to work for a living .
When his contentious findings were presented to the society , he was too poor to afford the fare up to London , and his letter was read in his absence .
In the end , the science of geology was helped by the fight – furious though it was - and De La Beche could be said to have pioneered the career of the professional geologist , transforming what had been a pastime for the priveleged few into a serious career option for many .

Programme 4 :
Trofim Denisovitch Lysenko and Nikolai Ivanovitch Vavilov
Science and politics have never felt comfortable with each other , but the relationship sank to a brutal low in Russia in the 1920s .
The Communist Revolution had delivered power to the masses , but the masses were n’t delivering the goods .
Agriculture , and in particular cereal production , was high on Stalin ’s list for attention – the drive to increase productivity was immense and the new science of genetics had a vital role to play .
Nikolai Ivanovitch Vavilov , an extraordinarily gifted agriculturalist and academic , realised this .
He started to look scientifically for ways to feed the people .
Another up and coming scientist , Trofim Denisovic Lysenko , understood far better the minds of politicians .
Blending his style of botany with Stalin ’s version of Marxism , he gained the state ’s full support and was put in charge of the whole future programme of cereal production .
As Vavilov continued his own research , support for Lysenko began to diminish as his claims began to sound increasingly far - fetched .
Eventually Lysenko began to make Vavilov and his followers the scapegoat for the short - comings of his own programme .
Lysenko ’s skill was to paint his critics in a politically damaging light .
Ultimately this led to the arrest of Vavilov in 1940 , charged with wrecking Soviet agriculture .
Shortly after his arrest , Vavilov 's health deteriorated rapidly and he died in prison .
He was only one of thousands of Soviet geneticists wiped out in the Stalinist purges , and every such death only strengthened Lysenko ’s position .
It was not only a tragedy for Soviet scientists : it was also a tragedy for Soviet science .
Vavilov had lost his life for allegedly holding back the development of Soviet agriculture - Lysenko stayed in power even after Stalin ’s death despite doing just that , and aroused more negative passions than few scientists have ever managed .

Arthur Stanley Eddington and Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar
Sir Arthur Eddington was the most distinguished British astrophysicist in the 1930s .
He had found experimental proof of Einstein 's theory of relativity during a solar eclipse and he had worked out what goes on inside stars .
Subramanyan Chandrasekhar was a young brilliant Indian physicist who had a theory explaining what happens to stars when their nuclear fuel runs out .
His calculations showed that if a star was large enough it literally collapsed into nothing , but paradoxically a nothing of huge mass and gravitational pull .
In other words , this is what we now call a black hole .
In this edition of Test Tubes and Tantrums , William Hartston tells the story of the row that exploded on a cold January day in 1935 between Eddington and Chandrasekhar .
It was over the death of stars .
Eddington vehemently disagreed with his young Cambridge colleague and ridiculed him at a meeting at the Royal Astronomical Society .
He said Chandrasekhar 's ideas were " stellar buffoonery " .
Eddington thought stars ended their lives as lumps of metal called white dwarves .
The result of the dispute was that the science of astronomy was put on hold for thirty years .
Chandrasekhar was hurt and left Cambridge University for the United States .
He also changed his topic of research and it was three decades before his theory was proved right .
Eddington died in 1944 and never retracted his attack on Chandrasekhar .
William Hartston discusses this dispute with Arthur Miller , Professor of the History of Science at University College , London , and author of a forthcoming book on the row , Dr Simon Mitton of St Edmund 's College , Cambridge University , and Peter Coles , Professor of Astrophysics at Nottingham University .

People really do seem to have a unique odour that marks them out .
You do n't smell so good ... a survey of about 400 compounds can tell one person from another .
Alamy
There are many good reasons to believe that we all have our own unique smell .
Dogs , for example — as pets or police sniffers — seem to be able to distinguish individuals by their smell .
And the mother - baby bond is cemented by their own distinctive odours .
Now a large and systematic study led by Dustin Penn from the Konrad Lorenz Institute for Ethology in Vienna , Austria , has provided stronger support for the notion that your smell might distinguish you from others — maybe even as much as your face .
The researchers further suggest that profiles of individual odours may also fall into two groups according to gender — men more commonly have some smelly compounds , women more commonly others .
The researchers took samples of armpit sweat , urine and spit from 197 adults .
Each subject was sampled five times over a ten - week collecting period .
They extracted thousands of volatile chemicals from the samples — the type of compound most likely to have an odour — and identified them by chromatography and mass spectrometry .
Smelly armpits
The team found many more different volatile chemicals in sweat than in urine or saliva , it reports in Journal of the Royal Society Interface1 .
This could be because humans have a reason to be able to distinguish themselves by general body odour , more than by marking territory as many other animals do .

An individual 's cocktail of odours changed all the time , but the researchers identified nearly 400 compounds that persisted in sweat samples taken at different times — compounds that seem to be uninfluenced by what a person eats , for example .
Comparing the presence and absence of these 400 compounds between any two given people seems to uniquely separate one from another , including people who lived together or were closely related .
But it is n't known just yet whether everyone on the planet has a ' smellprint ' that marks them as uniquely as a fingerprint , says Penn .
More data are required to determine for certain whether individual odour profiles will provide reliable biometric data .

Our fellow citizens have been led hoodwinked from their principles by a most extraordinary combination of circumstances .
But the band is removed , and they now see for themselves . ”
~ Thomas Jefferson
Today 's citizens , lately aware of the crimes of those who rule them from the White House , have removed the band ( the blindfold ) from their eyes .
The huge majority of average Americans are dead set against " the surge " in Iraq , seeing it for what it is : the senseless slaughter of American sons and daughters on a mission which has nothing to do with US security .
The question is , what are the people going to do about it ?
It should be noted that the US Congress , charged by the US Constitution with deciding when and if the nation goes to war , has been neutered .
In the alternate universe of the Republican noise machine , anyone standing in the way of the mindless dispatch of US troops to the slaughterhouse does n't — somehow — " support the troops , " and no media - obsessed congressman wants to get hung with that accusation .
Given a choice between securing their own careers or truly serving God and country ( to put it in Red State terms ) , today 's US lawmakers overwhelmingly choose the former .
To be sure , National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley appeared on Meet the Press a few weeks ago to celebrate a neocon alchemy by which justifications for war funding can be conjured up forever whence none exists : “ I think once they get in harm ’s way , congress ’s tradition is to support those troops , ” Mr. Hadley said with fatherly pride , fitting at the birth of the Perpetual War Machine .
The next country in the neocon gunsights is , of course , Iran .
That Iran is somehow a nuclear threat to the American people surpasses in bunk and risibility the whopper that Saddam Hussein had something to do with bringing down the Twin Towers .
The latter lie ( with others ) was good enough to start the war in Iraq and it's a virtual certainty that the former lie will serve to start the war in Iran despite the fact that experts , including those at our own CIA , put Iran several years away from the development of a nuclear weapon .
And , as former National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski reminded Congress recently , " [ t ] o argue that America is already at war in the region with a wider Islamic threat , of which Iran is the epicenter , is to promote a self - fulfilling prophecy . "
That America needs to attack Iran is a conceit seen sensible by few — save neocons , the White House and opportunists like former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .
Pulitzer Prize Winner Seymour Hersh has predicted that retaliatory Iranian disruptions to the oil flow in the Middle East could push prices up over one a hundred dollars a barrel .
It 's well known , and well predicted , that in the event of an American attack , Shiite Iran will send its 650,000 strong army into Iraq to wreak vengeance on US troops .
With a pre-emptive attack , America will be begging Iran or Iranian sympathizers to launch a terrorist attack on US soil .
And , as Pentagon Papers author Daniel Ellsberg pointed out recently , " [ i ] f there 's another 9/11 or a major war in the Middle - East involving a U.S. attack on Iran there will be , the day after or within days an equivalent of a Reichstag fire decree that will involve massive detentions in this country , detention camps for middle - easterners and their …sympathizers , critics of the President 's policy and essentially the wiping - out of the Bill of Rights . "
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has dictated to those voters who put her in power that impeachment is " off the table . "
Three days after the November elections , John Conyers , the new House Judiciary Chairman and , until then , hero of the pro-impeachment movement , betrayed ( as did Pelosi ) his constituents and the spirit of the Constitution when he said , “ I am in total agreement with her [ Pelosi ] on this issue : Impeachment is off the table . ”
Pelosi is given to sweeping , dismissive statements , judged by a speech she made at the 2005 AIPAC convention in Washington , DC . " [ T ] he history of the [ Israeli - Palestinian ] conflict is not over occupation , and never has been : it is over the fundamental right of Israel to exist . "
A congressional leader who says with a straight face that Israel is wholly without blame for the bloodshed in Palestine ( and the resultant anti-American bias in the Middle East ) is a sure bet to ignore the sage counsel of the Baker - Hamilton Report , which prescribes , as an imperative for Mideast peace , adherence to UN Security Council Resolution 242 , which mandates a return of Palestinian land held illegally by Israel since 1967 .
Expect nothing from the United States Congress to make the Bush Administration even mildly uncomfortable in its role as knee - jerk defender , enabler and funder of all things Likud , despite the threat that such support carries for US prestige , sovereignty and security .
Congress could defund the Iraq war but as Senator Russell Feingold points out , it " does n't have the will . "
It could , for that matter , threaten , in the clearest of terms , impeachment , removal from office and — if it comes to it — war crimes trials for those who would lead us into a war in Iran ( with consequent conflagration through the whole Middle East ) , that could bring down the US economy and the US Constitution and lead to violent civil disorder and repression at home .
But , unruffled , US Congressional Quislings seem willing to let the whole thing go with a couple of non-binding resolutions .
Rather than listen to Congress , the Administration prefers the bellicose , anti-American counsel of neocon think tanks like the American Enterprise Institute ( where , Bush avers , he gets his " finest minds " ) .
In 2005 , I wrote a LewRockwell.com piece , " Martial Law , " expanding on General Tommy Franks ' worry that , in the event of a terrorist attack on our shores democracy might well not survive .
In that piece I wrote :
Michael Ledeen , a fellow of the American Enterprise Institute , and close and trusted White House adviser , has this to say on p. 173 of his book Machiavelli on Modern Leadership : Why Machiavelli's Iron Rules Are As Timely and Important Today As Five Centuries Ago : " Paradoxically , preserving liberty may require the rule of a single leader — a dictator — willing to use those dreaded ‘ extraordinary measures , ’ which few know how , or are willing , to employ . ”
Do n't wonder if " it " ( a fascist takeover of the United States government ) can happen here .
It has happened here .
This administration can wage war when , where and how it pleases , for as long as it pleases , for whatever reason it wants and — under current conditions — there is nobody in America , within or without the government , who can stop it .
The US Government is effectively a dictatorship in all matters of war and peace .
If , at any point , this dictatorship felt itself in real , impending danger from Congress or the people , it might react like a wounded animal .
What if , despite the best efforts of the Republican and Democratic establishment , talk of a real impeachment movement ( even a credible whisper thereof ) were heard in the halls of congress ?
Considering the character of those in the White House , and their history of desperate and murderous political solutions ( the " surge " comes to mind ) , the notion that the US Government could attack its own citizens in a false - flag terrorist operation ( to force lockstep , " wartime " obedience ) is no longer a fringe conspiracy theory .
If waves of Americans eventually show up on the streets in sustained , do n't - take - no - for - an - answer demonstrations , so forceful as to cause civil disruptions and an actual threat to the existence of the Administration , it will draw government troops , whether those troops be police , National Guard , the US Army ( posse comitatus be damned ) or contractors like those from Blackwater Security , dispatched fresh from their war crimes against the people of Iraq to deal as they see fit with the people of the United States .
There 's an iconic photo from the 1960's : at an antiwar protest outside the Pentagon , a flower child places her eponymous flower into the barrel of the bayoneted rifle of one of the soldiers lined up to contain the demonstration .
Sixties protests had an element of theater to them and the flower child knew that the bayonets were for show .
Americans were aware , in those days , of their right to free speech and peaceable assembly and , despite the aberration at Kent State , those who massed together to forcefully and effectively demand an end to the war , were secure in doing so .
But if bayonets are drawn this time around , resultant photos will likely lack that whimsical sixties theatricality , and American parents will shudder to think of a daughter standing up to troops acting under the orders of a weakened , wounded Dick Cheney
Cheney personifies the Dictatorship , morally , legally — hell , even physiognomically .
His favorability ratings are disastrously low , but it 's unlikely to bother him .
Cheney is a coward and a dictator , with no regard for human life , American or foreign .
A dictator lives to inspire fear and obeisance and if he thrills with the stranglehold he exerts on the ( currently ) impotent eighty percent or so of Americans who hate his guts , think how much bigger the thrill might be at ninety or ninety - five percent .
Dick Cheney said our troops would be welcomed as liberators in Iraq .
Well , it turns out they were n't and to that vast majority of citizens who recognize the war in Iraq ( and the next one in Iran ) for the constitutional , military and national security disaster that it is , Mr. Cheney might likely ask , " what are you going to do about it ? "
Interesting question .

The first plane of a daily service will arrive on Monday afternoon
The airline said it had received approval from Lebanon and the flight would be a daily service .
Israel has maintained an air and sea embargo on Lebanon since a 14 August ceasefire ended its 34 - day conflict with Hezbollah fighters .
It has allowed two airlines to fly to Beirut on condition they go through Amman , Jordan , for security .
Monday 's Qatar Airways flight is also to carry humanitarian aid .
Emir 's visit
A Qatar Airways spokeswoman said Flight 422 would arrive in Beirut at 1530 local time ( 1230GMT ) on Monday after a three - hour journey from Doha .
Israel bombed runways at Beirut international airport at the beginning of the conflict with Hezbollah .
Since the UN - brokered truce , which calls for the lifting of the blockade , Lebanon 's Middle East Airlines and Royal Jordanian have been able to fly to Beirut via Amman .
Lebanese Defence Minister Elias Murr said on Saturday he had been assured by the UN that the blockade " would be lifted in the coming days " .
Qatar 's Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al - Thani became the only head of state to visit Lebanon since the conflict when he travelled to Beirut on 21 August .
The UN is installing 15,000 peacekeepers in southern Lebanon as part of UN Security Council Resolution 1701 .
More than 1,100 Lebanese and about 160 Israelis died in the conflict , sparked by the capture of two Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah .

The long , strange career of Jeffrey Sachs
Jeffrey D. Sachs , The End of Poverty : Economic Possibilities for Our Time , Penguin Press , 416 pp. , $ 27.95
Jeffrey Sachs is a complicated guy .
His first claim to fame was as the doctor who administered " shock therapy " in Bolivia , Poland , and Russia .
Now he 's Bono 's traveling companion .
Bono wrote the intro to Sachs 's latest book ( " My professor ....
In time , his autograph will be worth a lot more than mine " ) , and Sachs gushes all over Bono in the text ( " Bono brilliantly brought the AIDS tragedy to the attention of several key leaders of the religious right ... " ) .
This book is a manifesto and how - to guide on ending extreme poverty around the world .
The subtitle , " Economic Possibilities for Our Time , " echoes Keynes 's famous 1928 essay , " Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren , " which forecast , rightly , that we would be able to meet all the basic material needs of humankind two generations later - essentially today .
We could , but we do n't .
Worldwide , about 1 billion people live on the equivalent of less than $ 1 a day , the official definition of extreme poverty ; 2 billion live on less than $ 2 , which officialdom considers normal poverty .
These estimates have been criticized for being too low , and the definition of poverty for being too crude , but still , the numbers are criminally large .
Sachs uses this book to promote the UN's Millennium Development Goals ( on which he is an advisor to Secretary General Kofi Annan ) , which were agreed to by 147 heads of state gathered in New York in September 2000 .
These include halving the numbers of the extremely poor and halving the numbers of the hungry by 2015 ; achieving universal literacy and primary education ; promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women ; reducing child mortality by two - thirds ; improving maternal health ; combatting HIV / AIDS , malaria , and other horrid diseases ; ensuring environmental sustainability ; and developing a global partnership for development ( which amounts to a nicer neoliberalism )
Achieving these goals , on Sachs 's estimates , would require about $ 80 billion a year over the next ten years - not much next to current world output of $ 35 trillion a year .
It 's equal to about 20 hours of global economic activity .
It 's not much more , as Sachs shows , than the income of the 400 richest U.S. taxpayers - and that 's not counting the rest of the world 's rich .
But even these modest goals are impossible in the current political environment .
A measure of that environment is Washington 's current approach to one of Sachs 's obsessions , preventing malaria in Africa , where the disease is ubiquitous .
It would cost very little to provide Africans with mosquito nets to sleep under , something that 's beyond the means of most Africans .
But U.S. policy centers instead around something called " social marketing . "
Instead of giving away the nets , " social marketers buy advertising , conduct public education campaigns and create brands , hoping to promote the goods at low prices in the commercial marketplace " ( as Donald McNeil wrote in the New York Times ) .
They claim that the poor will value more that which they have to pay for , and the sales will cultivate an entrepreneurial class .
There 's no money in the budget for epidemiological studies to see if social marketing works .
Of course , it probably does n't .
But Washington has big ideas about freedom - so who cares that 10,000 Africans die every day of preventable diseases ?
On one level , Sachs 's analysis and agenda are unremarkable .
Many have written on how much the poor of the world suffer , and how little it would cost to reduce that suffering .
But we 've almost lost sight of a remarkable fact : this is Dr. Shock , Jeffrey Sachs !
Early triumphs
Sachs 's first moment in the spotlight came in the mid-1980s , with the " stabilization " of Bolivia , a policy package he designed that brought the country 's inflation rate from 40,000 % to near - 0 % .
Sadly , though , it did nothing to relieve Bolivia 's poverty - and the current round of almost constant protests , which have driven several presidents from office ( and some from the country ) suggests that twenty years later , Bolivians still are n't happy with their situation .
But the superficial success of what came to be called " shock therapy " - and it must be conceded that almost no one likes hyperinflation - left Sachs well - positioned in the global market for economic expertise when socialism started unraveling at the end of the decade .
Sachs was an advisor to the Yeltsin government in Russia from 1991 to 1994 , and also advised Poland , Slovenia , and Estonia as they were beginning their transitions to capitalism .
The last three are mixed successes - on the surface , Poland looks like a success to some , but with the transition came higher unemployment , falling real wages , and aimless cycles of political discontent .
Russia , though , was a thorough disaster , one of the worst collapses in human history .
Living standards fell and the population shrank , an almost unprecedented event in a country not at war .
Bono 's new best friend refuses to accept any blame for the disaster , offering the defense that the Russians did n't take his advice , and the West did n't come through with the big aid package he insisted was necessary .
Apparently this is an well - practiced strategy .
A 1992 Euromoney profile notes : " Sachs is reluctant to acknowledge mistakes , defining them in terms of regret when governments do not take his advice . "
In that case , he blamed Poland for not privatizing fast enough .
Contrasting with Sachs 's regrets over advice not taken , several governments he 's consulted with have since characterized the material produced by him and his associates as irrelevant , or , as a Slovenian official put it at the time , " simplistic...kindergarten stuff . "
Lethal gall
But the outcome illustrates precisely the danger of having the likes of Sachs parachute in bearing the timeless truths of neoclassical economics .
Anyone who knew Russia knew that any rapid privatization would immediately lead to the creation of a new corrupt elite through massive theft of state property .
Anyone who knew Washington knew that no big aid package was ever going to come through ; adding to usual U.S. cheapness , a lot of hardliners wanted to see Russia ground into the dirt .
In the words of former World Bank economist David Ellerman , who frequently collided with Sachs 's work in Slovenia and has followed him intently ever since , " Only the mixture of American triumphalism and the academic arrogance of neoclassical economics could produce such a lethal dose of gall . "
During what officialdom called the transition , there were divisions between those who wanted to reform the existing socialist system and experiment with hybrid forms of ownership , and what Ellerman calls the " clean postsocialist revolutionaries , " many of them with American economics PhDs , who dismissed the reformers as tainted nomenklatura and wanted immediate privatization .
Adding to the prestige of the revolutionaries were their trusted foreign advisors , like those from the Harvard Institute for International Development ( HIID ) , led by Jeffrey Sachs and partly funded by the U.S. government .
In Poland , Sachs was firmly on the side of rapid transition to " normal " capitalism .
At first he proposed U.S. - style corporate structures , with professional managers answering to many shareholders and a large economic role for stock markets .
That did n't fly with the Polish authorities , so Sachs came back with a Germanic idea - large blocks of the shares of privatized companies would be placed in the hands of big banks .
( As Ellerman recounts it , " Wherever the parade was going , [ Sachs ] had to be in front . " )
In both versions the point was to end any hints of worker or social control and institute a conventional capitalist class hierarchy .
His style was always abrasive and domineering ; he rebuked the Slovenian parliament for passing a bill without his approval , and dismissed his critics as " idiots " and " self - management imbeciles . "
Waiting to meet with senior Soviet officials in 1991 , Sachs put his feet up on a table .
An aide asked him not to do that .
Sachs took his feet down for a moment , and when the aide turned away , put them back up .
From several public events and an hour - long interview , I can say he comes across as a very unpleasant fellow - cocky , vain , and free of doubt .
Russia
HIID eventually collapsed in scandal , when it was revealed that the principals of its Russian project , Andrei Shleifer and Jonathan Hay , along with their wives ( who happened to be mutual fund managers ) , had been buying Russian stocks and dickering for the privilege of getting the country 's first mutual fund license , while dispensing advice to the Russian government .
( Shleifer was one of the trinity of so - called Harvard Wunderkinder who were to Russia what the Chicago Boys were to Pinochet 's Chile ; the other two were Lawrence Summers - and Sachs . )
The U.S. government sued , and Harvard shuttered the institute .
Sachs , who was not involved in the scandal , decamped to Columbia ( it 's said there was no going - away party from his Harvard colleagues ) .
At Columbia , he was appointed to head its new Earth Institute , an interdisciplinary enterprise that would bring together physical , health , and social scientists to promote sustainable economic development .
Sachs admits to no responsibility for the Russian catastrophe .
When I interviewed him in November 2002 , I asked him to comment on the ( incontrovertible ) fact that he 's viewed by scores of millions of Russians , as one journalist has put it , as either an emissary of Satan or of the CIA .
He answered that he found this question " disgusting , " " perverse , " and like nothing he 's ever been asked before .
The global elite leads a very insulated life .
Regrouping , to dissuade him from hanging up , I asked how he justified the tearing apart of the USSR and forcing the country headlong into capitalism when there was little popular support for such a strategy .
He responded , illogically , by saying he " wanted to support ... the democratization of the Soviet Union . "
He sung the praises of " transparency and honesty in government , " even though the Yeltsin regime he was advising was opaque and corrupt .
Asked to comment on published reports that he supported creating an inflation , so as to wipe out the savings of Russians ( part of the shock therapists ' attempts to start post - Soviet Russia with a clean slate ) , he bristled further , denouncing the quote as " phony , " the question as " indecent , " and the interview itself as not being in " good faith . "
In his academic work , however , Sachs argued that since China was only very lightly industrialized , it could afford to take its transition slowly .
Russia , however , was burdened with the bad inheritance of Soviet industry , which was hopeless and had to go .
Yet ...
As the 1990s progressed , Sachs became more prominent as a critic of development orthodoxy , arguing against the IMF 's austere prescriptions after the 1997 Asian crisis , and pressing for debt relief for the poorest countries .
He became an economic advisor to the Jubilee 2000 movement ( named after the Biblical exhortation to observe a Jubilee year once every fifty years , in which debts would be forgiven ) .
The harder core of the global justice movement has never fully trusted Sachs ; he reportedly lobbied to get himself invited to the World Social Forum at Porto Alegre a few years ago , but was rejected .
Along with Joseph Stiglitz , he 's one of the leading critics of the economic development establishment who 's still a member of the club .
But there are n't many of them .
For a member of the club , Sachs does use some strong language .
The End of Poverty is full of sharp critiques of Western imperialism in Africa and elsewhere .
He quotes Mike Davis approvingly on British brutality during famines .
He blasts U.S. support of Mobutu and the rest of the posse of Cold War thugs .
In late 2003 , when Bush asked Congress for another $ 87 billion to fund the Iraq war , Sachs took to the pages of the Boston Globe to denounce the administration for pursuing an expensive war for oil while neglecting 500 million impoverished Africans .
In the op -ed , he reviewed the disgraceful history of U.S. alliances with Middle Eastern despots " to keep the oil flowing , " and noted vast reservoirs of ill - will towards the U.S. that that policy had created .
He declared that " the world will not tolerate unilateral control by a country that accounts for less than 5 percent of humanity ... and the American people will end up paying a high price for the fantasy of hegemony . "
That 's far stronger than anything Paul Krugman would write .
The New Sachs was n't entirely unprecedented in the utterances of the Old Sachs .
In the early 1990s , as he was busily transforming Eastern Europe , he told Euromoney , a banking trade journal , that you should n't press debtor countries for repayment if " there is going to be social catastrophe , " and that " reform " programs should be " fair , " with " burdens and benefits ... shared in an adequate way . "
But those high - minded concerns were overwhelmed by the political realities of the moment , and the results were anything but fair , as poverty and inequality increased in most of the formerly socialist countries ( a situation that they 've only recently begun to recover from ) .
People who know Sachs say he 's always considered himself on the political left .
His father , who died in 2001 , was a long - time Detroit labor lawyer and general counsel to the Michigan AFL - CIO .
That puts his passion to destroy worker power in eastern Europe in an interesting Oedipal light - and might even explain some of the contradictions of Sachs 's politics .
But that would be speculative psychoanalysis of a suspect sort , so enough of that .
Incomplete critique
Heavy debts , IMF austerity programs , and fickle financial markets are Sachs 's favorite targets .
His views on the rest of the development business are more conventional .
In The End of Poverty , he writes as if all the poorest countries need to do is get a rung or two up the economic ladder ; the problem is their distance from the ladder , not the ladder itself .
That stands in odd contrast with the strength of his anti-imperialist rhetoric .
It 's as if he can't see the financial arrangements ( with institutions like the IMF at their center - there 's usually a state center to a financial system ) as crucial enforcement mechanisms for the maintenance of orthodox policies .
Finance is an instrument of class power , locally , nationally , and internationally .
In our interview , Sachs told me that to become internationally competitive , Argentina and Brazil need to develop their educational institutions and technological capacity - as if the history of a couple of centuries of structural subordination and the present of debt service demands have n't made that difficult to impossible .
( Africa 's long - term prospects , he disclosed , lie in tourism , services , and back - office operations . )
There 's more recognition of deep structural impediments in this book , but then he offers his reform agenda as if the structurally dominant would easily consent to a weakening of their domination , which is how they see any " aid " program .
Asked how he would deal with the enormous political obstacles to his agenda , Sachs pointed to his own efforts at promoting debt relief , which date back to 1985 .
We 're back to Sachs 's enormous ego , which exposes almost anything he does to the suspicion that he 's in it mostly for the attention .
But while his work in Russia , though it drew attention , was mostly destructive - something he still can't admit to - his concerns today are a lot more admirable .
His criticisms of American warmongering and Western indifference to the poverty of a billion or two of our fellow humans are mostly on the side of the angels .
Maybe the best summing up of the latest incarnation of Jeffrey Sachs comes from David Ellerman : " I hope he gets what he wants , but that he does n't get any credit for it . "

Donald Rumsfeld said the military was capable and battle hardened
One , by former officials in the Clinton administration , said the pressure of repeated deployments was very corrosive and could have long - term effects .
The second , ordered by the Pentagon and yet to be released , reportedly calls the army " stretched to breaking point " .
The US defence secretary dismissed the claims as out of date or misdirected .
About 138,000 US troops remain in Iraq , on top of deployments to Afghanistan and Kosovo .
' Enormous strain '
The first study , commissioned by Democratic members of Congress , listed former Defence Secretary William Perry and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright among its authors .
It said the US military had performed admirably in recent operations but was under " enormous strain " .
The studies warn of future problems in recruitment and retention
" This strain , if not soon relieved , will have highly corrosive and potentially long - term effects on the force , " it stated .
The report predicted problems recruiting new troops and retaining current ones in the face of repeated overseas tours and shortfalls in vital equipment .
It accused the Bush administration of having failed adequately to assess the size of force and equipment needed in post- invasion Iraq , creating " a real risk of ' breaking the force ' . "
The report also warned that the lack of a credible strategic reserve " increases the risk that potential adversaries will be tempted to challenge the United States " .
Recruitment
The second study , conducted for the Pentagon by military expert Andrew Krepinevich , suggested that the military at its current rate of deployment might not be able to outlast the insurgency in Iraq .
He cited the problems experienced by the army in meeting its recruitment targets last year .
Speaking in Washington , Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld rejected the warnings given in both reports , saying : " The force is not broken . "
He said the US military was enormously capable and battle - hardened and any report suggesting it was close to breaking point was " just not consistent with the facts " .
Difficulties
The BBC's Adam Brookes in Washington says the reports echo the view held by some in Congress and even by some within the armed forces .
They fear that if the Iraq commitment lasts a great deal longer , or if the US is drawn into new conflict , the US armed forces could find it difficult to meet their commitments .
The report came as the British government announced the deployment of thousands of extra troops to Afghanistan as part of a Nato expansion plan in the region .
The troops are likely to be deployed to the south of the country .
BBC correspondent Rob Watson says it is unclear whether their role will be to provide support to the Afghan government in the region or to participate in counter - insurgency operations .
The purpose of the 3,600 year - old sky disc of Nebra , which caused a world - wide sensation when it was brought to the attention of the German public in 2002 , is no longer a matter of speculation .
A group of German scholars who studied this archaeological gem has discovered evidence which suggests that the disc was used as a complex astronomical clock for the harmonization of solar and lunar calendars .
" This is a clear expansion of what we knew about the meaning and function of the sky disc , " said archeologist Harald Meller .
A thirteenth month ?
The sky disc of Nebra was not all moonshine
Unlike the solar calendar , which indicates the position of the earth as it revolves around the sun , the lunar calendar is based on the phases of the moon .
A lunar year is eleven days shorter than the solar year because 12 synodic months , or 12 returns of the moon to the new phase , take only 354 days .
The sky disc of Nebra was used to determine if and when a thirteenth month -- the so - called intercalary month -- should be added to a lunar year to keep the lunar calendar in sync with the seasons .
" The functioning of this clock was probably known to a very small group of people , " Meller said .
Bronze Age science
A slice of prehistory for romantic sky gazers
The 32 - centimeter - wide ( 12.6 - inch ) bronze disc with gold - leaf appliqués representing the sun , the moon , and the stars is the oldest visual representation of the cosmos known to date .
A cluster of seven dots has previously been interpreted as the Pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
The explanation of the disc 's purpose sheds new light on the astronomical knowledge and abilities of the Bronze Age people , who used a combination of solar and lunar calendars as important indicators for agricultural seasons and passage of time .
" The sensation lies in the fact that the Bronze Age people managed to harmonize the solar and lunar years .
We never thought they would have managed that , " Meller said .
According to astronomer Wolfhard Schlosser of the Rurh University at Bochum , the Bronze Age sky gazers already knew what the Babylonians would describe only a thousand years later .
" Whether this was a local discovery , or whether the knowledge came from afar , is still not clear , " Schlosser said .
From Saxony - Anhalt to Babylon
The sky disc of Nebra was found near Europe 's oldest observatory in Goseck
Ever since the disc was discovered , archaeologists and astronomers have been puzzled by the shape of the moon as it appears on the disc .
" I wanted to explain the thickness of the crescent on the sky disc of Nebra because it is not a new moon phase , " said Hamburg astronomer Ralph Hansen .
In his quest to explain why the Nebra astronomers created a sky map with a four or five days old moon on it , Hansen consulted the " Mul - Apin " collection of Babylonian documents from the 7th and 6th centuries B.C .
These cuneiform writings represent , according to Hansen , a compendium of " astronomic knowledge from the earliest times . "
They also contain a calculation rule for the crescent that looks strikingly similar to the one from Nebra .
According to the ancient Babylonian rule , a thirteenth month should only be added to the lunar calendar only when one sees the constellation of the moon and the Pleiades exactly as they appear on the Nebra sky disc .
Knowledge comes and goes
The sky disc of Nebra was first discovered by treasure hunters
The Bronze Age astronomers would hold the Nebra clock against the sky and observe the position of the celestial objects .
The intercalary month was inserted when what they saw in the sky corresponded to the map on the disc they were holding in their hands .
This happened every two to three years .
But the German researchers also discovered that in the 400 years that the disc was in use , its status had evolved .
The perforations on the edge of the object as well as a ship that was later added to the map suggest that the knowledge about the lunar calendar 's shortage of days was lost along the way .
" That means , that in the end the disk became a cult object , " Meller said .
The disc was found in 1999 by two previously convicted treasure looters .
It was seized by the authorities in 2002 along with other Bronze Age objects in a police operation in Switzerland .
The hangperson ’s noose is unmistakably around the tobacco industry ’s neck .
In Florida and Mississippi , state governments are attempting to force tobacco companies to pay some smoking - related health care costs .
In Washington , D.C. , the Environmental Protection Agency has claimed that “ secondhand smoke ” is a significant risk for nonsmokers and the Food & Drug Administration is making noises about regulating nicotine as a drug .
And recently the American Medical Association agreed , reasserting that nicotine is addictive .
Smokers have already been driven away from many workplaces into the street for a furtive puff .
But further legal harassment , to the point of what an industry spokesman calls “ backdoor prohibition , ” seems unstoppable .
Lost in this lynching frenzy : the fact that smoking might be , in some small ways , good for you .
Hold on now !
Let ’s be clear :
The Surgeon General has indeed determined that smoking is dangerous to your health .
Lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases are highly correlated with cigarette consumption .
Annual smoking - related deaths are commonly said to be over 400,000 ( although critics say the number is inflated ) .
But so is driving automobiles dangerous to your health ( over 40,000 deaths a year ) .
Yet people do it , because it has rewards as well as risk .
And they judge , as individuals , that the reward outweighs the risk .
This is called freedom .
Well , what are the rewards of cigarette smoking ?
Apart from intangible pleasure , the most obvious is behavioral .
A battery of studies , such as those by British researcher D.M. Warburton , show that cigarettes , whatever their other effects , really do stimulate alertness , dexterity and cognitive capacity .
And alertness , dexterity , etc. , can be useful .
Such as when driving .
Or flying – as Congress recognized when it exempted airline pilots from the ban on smoking on domestic flights .
These behavioral benefits suggest an answer to the Great Tobacco Mystery : why almost a third of adult Americans continue to do something they are told , incessantly and insistently , is bad for them .
( Duke University economist W. Kip Viscusi reported in his 1992 book , Smoking : Making the Risky Decision , that survey data show smokers , if anything , exaggerate the health danger of their habit . )
Smokers , according to numerous studies such as those by University of Michigan researchers Ovide and Cynthia Pomerleau , are different from nonsmokers .
They tend toward depression and excitability .
Current understanding is that nicotine is “ amphoteric , ” that is , it can act to counter both conditions , depending on how it is consumed .
( Quick puffs stimulate , long drags calm . )
The implication is fascinating .
A large part of the population seems to be aware of its significant although not pathological personality quirks , and to have discovered a form of self - medication that regulates them .
Of course , this explanation for the stubbornness of smokers is not as satisfying as what Washington prefers to believe : mass seduction by the wicked tobacco companies and their irresistible advertising .
Nor would it justify huge rescue operations by heroic politicians and bureaucrats .
Beyond its behavioral effects , smoking seems also to offer subtler health rewards to balance against its undisputed risks :
Parkinson ’s disease .
The frequency of this degenerative disorder of the nervous system among smokers appears to be half the rate among nonsmokers – an effect recognized by the Surgeon General as along ago as 1964 .
Alzheimer ’s disease .
Similarly , the frequency of this degenerative mental disorder has recently been found to be as much as 50 % less among smokers than among nonsmokers for example , by the H studies reviewed in the International Journal of Epidemiology in 1991 .
Endometrial cancer .
There is extensive and long - standing evidence that this disease of the womb occurs as much as 50 % less among smokers as documented by , for example , a New England Journal of Medicine article back in 1985 .
The triggering mechanism appears to be a reduction of estrogen levels .
Prostate cancer .
Conversely , smoking seems to raise estrogen levels in men and may be responsible for what appears to be a 50 % lower rate of prostate cancer among smokers , although this needs corroboration .
Osteoarthritis .
This degenerative disorder of bone and cartilage is up to five times less likely to occur among heavy smokers as documented , for example , by the federal government ’s first Health and Nutrition Examination Survey .
Colon cancer , ulcerative colitis .
These diseases of the bowel seem to be about 30 % and 50 % less frequent among smokers as documented , for example , by articles in the Journal of the American Medical Association and in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1981 and 1983 , respectively .
Other benefits that have been suggested for smoking : Lower rates of sarcoidosis and allergic alveolitis , both lung disorders , and possibly even acne .
Smokers are also lighter ironically , because obesity is a leading cause of the cardiovascular disease that smoking is also supposed to exacerbate .
So you could quit smoking and still die of a heart attack because of the weight you put on .
None of these health benefits is enough to persuade doctors to recommend occasional cigarettes , in the way that some now occasionally recommend a glass of wine .

But consider this theoretical possibility : Should 60 - year - olds take up smoking because its protection against Alzheimer ’s is more immediate that its potential damage to the lungs , which wo n’t show up for 30 years if at all ?
A theoretical possibility and likely to remain theoretical .
Research into possible benefits of tobacco and nicotine is widely reported to be stymied by the absolutist moral fervor of the antismoking campaign .
Under the Carter Administration , the federal government abandoned its research into safer cigarettes in favor of an attack on all smoking .
No effort is made to encourage smokers to switch to pipes and cigars , although their users ’ lung cancer and heart disease rates are five to ten times lower ( somewhat offset by minor increases in mouth and throat cancers ) .
There is no current support for studies of the marginal increase in danger for each cigarette smoked , although it appears the human system can clear the effects of three to five of the ( much stronger ) pre-1960 cigarettes , if dispersed across a day , with relatively little risk .
Instead , the extirpation of smoking had become another “ moral equivalent of war ” as President Carter called the energy crisis in the 1970s , and as price and wage controls were viewed earlier .
There is no role for tradeoffs , risk - reward calculations or free choice .
Why do n’t tobacco companies point out the potential offsetting rewards of smoking ?
Besides the usual corporate cowardice and bureaucratic inertia , the answer may be another , typically American , disease : lawyers .
Directing the companies ’ defense , they apparently veto any suggestion that smoking has benefits for fear of liability suits and of the possible regulatory implications if nicotine is seen as a drug .
Which leaves smokers defenseless against a second typically American disease : the epidemic of power hungry puritanical bigots .

One cat will get the boot each day until a winner is chosen , but all 10 will be given a permanent home .
The programme 's producers say they hope the competition will promote animal adoption .
During filming , the cats are living in a specially constructed house , complete with scaled - down sofas , beds and even a fish tank - with fake fish .
Members of the public can stop by to watch the action , which is taking place in a specially rented storefront in New York 's Madison Avenue .
The American Humane Association is monitoring the wellbeing of the cat contestants during the competition .
The show is being broadcast on US cable channel Animal Planet .
Google has been expected , for a long time , to placate various Big Media companies about copyrighted video appearing on You Tube .
Everyone ( including Google ) wants some form of content filtering to be attached to You Tube , to prevent unauthorised bits of hit TV shows from appearing there .
Today , we find out that Google will bring in a 3rd party , Audible Magic to begin this filtering process .
There ’s a big debate about whether this is a stop - gap before they roll out something of their own , or whether something has gone awry with their own plans .
Media executives are certainly getting tired of waiting for the promised filters .
I ’ll tell you why it ’s taken Google so long to implement anything at all .
Because content filtering is actually pretty difficult .
I would go so far to say that on this scale , it ’s impossible .
Why ?
Because to know what to disallow , Google needs to have a copy of the content to compare uploads with .
That means to be an effective filter of content , Google needs to have a copy of every TV programme ever made !
That ’s not going to happen .
But think how well that goal fits in with Google ’s aim to organise the world ’s information .
Google would love to be the authoritative repository of the world ’s television .

Rosetta Code is a programming chrestomathy site .
The idea is to present solutions to the same task in as many different languages as possible , to demonstrate how languages are similar and different , and to aid a person with a grounding in one approach to a problem in learning another .
Rosetta Code currently has hundreds of tasks , and covers over 150 languages , though we do not have solutions to every task in every language , Python is very well represented .

The most exciting development in digital music and audio downloads was blown out of the water yesterday , when one elderly man asked for clarification on what was the difference between a podcast and a programme that had been taped off the wireless .
The Emperor ’s New Clothes moment came at London ’s Software - Expo 07 , which showcases all the latest exciting computer and digital software technology .
During a public presentation entitled ‘ Podcasts – the future of communications ’ , a sixty - four year old grandfather put up his hand and said ; ‘ Sorry , could somebody explain to me exactly what is the difference between these ‘ podcast ’ and a programme on the radio that you recorded on a cassette and then listened to later ? ’
Chuck Epstein , the American software wizard who had travelled from Seattle to be at Digi -Expo 07 , laughingly dismissed the question , saying podcasts were a whole new ball game , utilizing digital technology , downloading MP3 files , typically storing four gigabytes worth of files .
But then another member of the public butted in .
‘ He ’s got a point though … I mean , we understand that how you do it is new .
But what ’s the practical difference between using the timer on your radio cassette player to record your favourite programme and this big new exciting idea of podcasts ? ’
Mr Epstein became increasingly tetchy at the interjections .
‘ There ’s no comparison .
Podcasts are like a totally revolutionary concept , allowing you to experience audio files on the move … ’
‘ What like a Sony walkman , you mean ? ’ interjected the old man .
‘ And podcasts can be made by anyone … ’
‘ By amateurs , yes .
As opposed to producers at Radio 4 who have professional training and experience . ’
At this point the presentation broke up amid jeers and catcalls , as members of the public became angry that they ’d fallen for all the hype about the ‘ Podcast Revolution ’ .
Glossy leaflets were screwed up and thrown at the stage and one of the cardboard stands featuring a giant iPod was kicked over .
To cheers from the crowd , one lady leapt onto the stage and shouted ‘ If I want to listen to a high quality audio file , I ’ll go the library and browse through the talking books section ! ’ and the humiliated info - tainer was forced to abandon the presentation .
He was later spotted looking up the word ‘ library ’ on the internet .

Support Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud ( EC2 ) Amazon has started a rather limited beta of their new service Elastic Compute Cloud abbreviated EC2 .
I am one of the developers who got the invitation to participate .
Here ’s the most important point : Amazon EC2 enables you to increase or decrease capacity within minutes , not hours or days .
You can commission one , hundreds or even thousands of server instances simultaneously .
Of course , because this is all controlled with web service APIs , your application can automatically scale itself up and down depending on its needs .
It costs 10 cents per full hour of usage + usual S3 bandwidth fees .
That means that if you run it 24/ 7 it will cost around $ 72 / month + bandwidth .
That ’s cheaper than a dedicated server ( with reliability similar to what I expect from Amazon ) but more expensive than an unmanaged VPS .
However , look at the specs : “ an instance is roughly equivalent to a system with a 1.7 Ghz Xeon CPU , 1.75 GB of RAM , 160GB of local disk , and 250 Mb/s of network bandwidth ( bursting to 1 Gb ) ” and that ’s a lot of power , sounds like Amazon will put a lot of smaller hosting companies out of business .
The main point of course is that it can be set up and torn down programmaticaly .
It works like this : you upload a system image ( Amazon Machine Image or AMI ) and then make a call to boot it , you use another call to monitor the status of your instances , once they boot up you know the domain name you can use to connect to the instance , for ex. domU-12-31-33-00-00-01.dc3.compute.amazonaws.com .
It only supports Linux at the moment , and I have one particular use for this service that would need Windows , so I ca n’t wait until it supports OS ’es other than Linux .
Just in case you missed it — your instances can be web servers , database servers , load balancers , anything .
The traffic within Amazon EC2 and S3 is free , so you can have setups as funky as you wish .
Remeber what it takes to build Flickr or Livejournal datacenter ?
Now you can do similar setups from home ( unbelievable ) and just let Amazon take care of the networking and hardware .
This is so much more ’ WebOS ’ than Google ’s walled garden .
August 28 Update : Please note that EC2 is not limited to web hosting applications , far from it .
It makes even more sense to use it for virtual render farms , to run simulations and other tasks that require a lot of computing power but are usually executed only once in a while .
So if you need for ex. 100 instance - hours to complete the computation , you can make your own cluster of 20 machines of similar power ( will cost about $ 10000 for hardware alone ) and complete the task in 5 hours , you can use EC2 to create this virtual cluster , compute and then shut it down when done and pay much less — $ 10 per job .
Or you could use EC2 to create a 200 machine virtual cluster , complete the job in half an hour and pay the same $ 10 for it .
Think about that .
Herewith a quick update on the supply situation .
I briefly touched on recent declines in Saudi Arabian production the other day .
The global supply situation is as above .
Essentially , the situation has not qualitatively changed since I last discussed it .
The two agencies I track ( the US EIA and the OECD IEA ) are at increasing variance about what 's going on , with the EIA seeing supply basically flat over time , while the IEA sees a very slow rise in available supply ( with data through October ) .
For more background on this plateau debate , see this tutorial post .
Presumably , this discrepancy will not continue too many more months , as it's going to get a little embarrassing .
At any rate , there 's little doubt that the record month is now July 2006 .
Expressed as growth rates , the difference between the two agencies is about half a percentage point .
This next graph shows the year on year growth in the two moving average lines above ( which themselves are thirteen month centered moving averages recursed once ) .
Year - on - year growth in moving averages of EIA and IEA oil production estimates .
Click to enlarge .
Believed to be all liquids .
Source : IEA Oil Market Reports , and EIA International Petroleum Monthly Table 1.4 .
The IEA line is taken from Table 3 of the tables section at the back of the OMR in the last issue for which the number for that month is given .
As you can see , the EIA is seeing annual growth of 0.1 % - essentially zero - while the IEA is seeing growth at around 0.7 % annually .
There are two points worth noting about this situation .
Firstly , if it were to continue , even the IEA 's growth rate is very low by historical standards .
This next graph shows growth rates in production for various data sources .
The growth rate here is the average growth over the decade prior to the year in question ( for the mathematically oriented , it 's ( P( n ) / P(n- 10 ) ) ^0.1 - 1 ) .
Average annual growth rate over the prior decade in oil production from various estimates from 1900 - 2004 .
As you can see , in the heyday of world ( and US ) economic growth in the 1950s and 1960s , annual growth in oil usage ran around 7 - 8 % .
Then , following the 1970 peak in US oil production , came the 1970s oil shocks in which oil usage actually contracted .
In the last couple of decades , economic growth has been slower , but steadier , and oil usage has been growing at around 1.5 % a year .
For reasons that are n't clear , both economic and oil usage growth tends to come in " eras " of relatively constant growth marked by sharp " paradigm shifts " between them .
So , if we are now in for an era of sustained zero or sub 1 % growth in global production , that would be a new thing , and require more conservation on an ongoing basis .
In particular , with growth in consumption in oil exporting countries and high growth Asian economies , it 's likely US and European oil usage would need to contract slightly even if there is slight growth in overall production ( a point discussed at greater length here .
The other point , is that there 's not likely to be too much " sustained " about growth when a huge fraction of production is coming from the Middle East , where the wheels seem to be coming off the truck .
Hard to say whether a crisis will come this year , next year , or later , but the odds of , say , a decade of steady Middle Eastern oil production uninterrupted by major shocks seem discouraging at this point .
For example , see Andrew Sullivan on the possibility of a major Shiite - Sunni regional war .
Such a war would utterly transform the world economy in very short order and in a very brutal manner .
Let me put up two other graphs of interest .
The first is OPEC , which in November allegedly cut production .
We 'll have to await November / December statistics to see if that creates a noticeable step in the production history .
However , here 's the data available at present ( which goes through September or October depending on source ) and shows OPEC production already declining ahead of the planned cut ) .
Estimates of OPEC production by EIA ( both with ( Table 1.4 ) and without ( Table 1.1 ) NGLS ) and IEA .

Source : IEA Oil Market Reports , and EIA International Petroleum Monthly Table 1.1 and 1.4 .
The IEA line is taken from Table 3 of the tables section at the back of the OMR in the last issue for which the number for that month is given .
Finally , during 2001 - 2004 , when global production increased healthily , the bulk of that increase came from Saudi Arabia and Russia .
With Saudi production declining , at least for the last year , Russia becomes of particular interest .
Here 's the latest picture :
Estimates of Russian production by EIA and JODI ( Joint Oil Data Initiative ) on the left scale , and total drilling rigs in country on the right scale .

Source : JODI , and EIA International Petroleum Monthly Table 1.1 .
Rig data is from Schlumberger , and includes rigs drilling for both oil and natural gas .
As you can see , the Russian revival has not peaked out yet , though it has slowed to only around 1 / 2 mbpd in additional production each year over the last two years ( about half the pace of production increases in the early part of the decade ) .
Again , see here , for more background on these plateau posts if you have n't been following them .
Aly makes the case that although goods and gold , stocks and bonds , real estate and savings accounts stolen from murdered Jews accounted for at best 5 percent of the Third Reich ’s operational revenues , this 5 percent was often the essential piece that stabilized the vulnerable economies of the occupied nations .
The money allowed the regime to pass the costs of war and occupation onto the occupied while keeping the local populations and the German soldiers alike quiescent and complacent — and ultimately to benefit Germans back home .
Many Germans hardly thought twice before moving into apartments that had belonged to deported German Jews , or furnishing those apartments with beautiful objects that had belonged to Jews of other nations .
This was grand larceny on a scale seldom seen in the modern world .
From Tunisia to Greece , Czechoslovakia to the Netherlands , France and Italy to Serbia and Romania , Aly walks us through the Aryanization process .
He demonstrates how Jewish property was first nationalized via a variety of tricks ( like declaring the assets of deported Jews “ ownerless ” and therefore state property ) and then funneled into German government coffers , and eventually into keeping the working and lower middle classes satisfied .
He also shows that in a number of instances the urgency of the thievery process hastened deportations and killings .
“ Hitler ’s Beneficiaries ” is based on a wealth of military and economic documents , and it is chock full of data on consumer spending power , money - laundering techniques , and bankers ’ and civil servants ’ inventiveness in making theft look legal — or invisible .
The book also makes clear that even with the money and goods plundered in the occupied territories from both Jews and non-Jews , only a German military victory would have let the German economy survive the enormous debt burden it had accrued .
The evidence is powerful on its own terms .
Yet the connections
Aly draws are not equally persuasive .
When “ Hitler ’s Beneficiaries ” first appeared in Germany in 2005 , scholars challenged Aly ’s figures .
Yet the discrepancies in the balance sheets of revenues and expenses they uncovered are explicable by the different calculation methods used , and Aly ’s rebuttals to his critics have been included in this English edition .
Readers can make up their own minds .
The more significant problems have to do with interpretation .
First , there is Aly ’s monochromatic notion of human nature — the assumption that Germans under Nazism were moved primarily by material self - interest ( rather than , say , feeling thoroughly enthusiastic about Nazi militarism as long as it was successful , and unconcerned that Jews were demoted to second - class citizens — and then disappeared ) .
The second difficulty has to do with assumptions about causation .
It is Aly ’s great accomplishment to demonstrate that World War II could not have gone on for as long as it did , nor the German populace kept content for as long as it was , without the expropriation of the property and monies of slaughtered Jews .
But correlation is not causation , and illustrating connections does not prove motivation .
The historian Jonathan Petropoulos has written , “ The Nazis were not only the most notorious murderers in history but also the greatest thieves . ”
“ Hitler ’s Beneficiaries ” offers stark proof that the murder and the theft were in many cases integrally linked .
The Holocaust was unquestionably accompanied by outrageous greed .
Yet this fact cannot make us conclude that greed alone drove the Holocaust .
アカデミー賞受賞 作「 The Godfather 」 は、多くの人々が何度も繰り返し鑑賞している映画の1つだ。しかし、この映画のどんなに熱狂的なファンでも、鑑賞した回数でJenny Ryu氏の右に出る者はいないだろう。
Electronic Arts（EA）のゲームソフト「 The Godfather 」 の開発で主任キャラクターデザイナーを務めたRyu氏は、このゲームに登場する数十人のキャラクターの製作を担当した。その過程で、同氏はおよそ1年間、来る日も来る日もこの映画を見なければならなかった。
Ryuがそうせざるを得なかったのには理由がある。「 The Godfather 」 はすでにビデオゲーム化されている他の多くの映画とは異なり、1972年に製作された大変古い映画であるため、これを製作したParamount Picturesが、作品中に登場するMarlon BrandoやJames Caan、Robert Duvallといった俳優陣の高精細デジタル画像を、Ryu氏と同氏率いる開発チームに提供できなかったためだ。Ryu氏らは、ゲームに登場する映画の登場人物に瓜二つのおよそ60人分のアニメキャラクターを製作するための参考資料として、それらのデジタル画像を必要としていた。
しかし、結果的に入手できなかったため、Ryu氏はそれらのキャラクターを手作業で製作しなければならなかった。そしてそのためには、テレビの前に座り、「
The Godfather」の各シーンを何度も繰り返し見る必要があった。その結果、Ryu氏は、各キャラクターの容姿だけでなく、彼らの言動や表情まで把握することができた。
「 私は、複数の映画を何度も見る必要があった」とRyu氏は述べ、さらに「私は、各キャラクターの特徴、容姿、表情、雰囲気を把握する必要があった。それは私にとってかなりの難題だったが、面白い作業だった。なぜなら、映画を何度も見ているうちに、各登場人物の特徴を正確に把握できるようになるからだ」と付け加えた。
ゲー ム「 The Godfather 」 は米国時間3月21日に発売予定となっている。
映画業界で働く人のなかには、Ryu氏の辛い経験を理解できる人もいるだろう。というのも、多くの場合、アニメ製作者は登場人物の画像や動きを資料を参考にして手作業で製作する必要があるからだ。確かにアニメや特殊効果の大半は、各俳優を撮影したベースとなる映像を使ってアニメを製作する「モーションキャプチャー」と呼ばれる手法で製作されているが、一部の製作会社はそのような手法を使用できない。
サンフランシスコにあ るArt Institute of Californiaで、アニメ製作のインストラクターを務めるJeff Paul氏によると、例えば 、Pixar Animation StudiosやPDIといったアニメ製作会社は、手作業でアニメを製作しているという。
「 Pixarが制作した一連の作品や 、 『 Shrek』のようなアニメ映画は、全て手作業で製作されている」とPaul氏は語る。「身体の各部分の比率が実際の人間と同じである人間のキャラクターを製作する場合には、モーションキャプチャーが役に立つが、各部分の比率を誇張する場合は、モーションキャプチャーは全く役に立たない」（Paul氏）
一方、モーションキャプチャーと手作業の両方を用いて製作される映画もある。Paul氏はその例として、映画「 Spider Man」を挙げた。この映画では、手作業で製作されたシーンもあれば、主役のTobey Maguireがモーションキャプチャー用のスーツを着て、Spider Manらしい動作をしながら飛び回る様子を撮影した映像を基礎として製作したシーンもある。
しかし、多くのゲームがデジタル化した現代では、映画をベースにしたゲームは大半が映画製作と密接に連携しながら製作されるため、Ryu氏が行ったような映画を繰り返し見るという製作プロセスは大変稀といえる。
この点につい てPaul氏は、 「仮に今、（映画をベースにした）ゲームを製作しているのであれば、恐らく、モーションキャプチャーによって撮影された、今まさに映画製作に取り組んでいる俳優らの映像が手に入るだろう」と述べ、さらに「映画をベースにしたゲームの多くが、元となる映画と連携する形で製作されていることから、（EAの「Godfather」の開発プロセスは）異例といえるだろう」と語った。
それにも関わらず、最近、古い映画が相次いでゲーム化されていると同氏はいう。1979年に製作された映画「
The Warriors 」もその一例だ。この映画は昨年 、Rockstar Gamesによってゲーム化された。
Drinking regular cups of tea could help improve your memory , new research suggests .
Results of laboratory tests by a team from the University of Newcastle upon
Tyne found that green and black tea inhibit the activity of certain enzymes in the brain which are associated with memory .
The findings , which are published in the academic journal , Phytotherapy Research , may lead to the development of a new treatment for a form of dementia which affects an estimated ten million people worldwide , Alzheimer 's Disease .
For their experiment , the research team , from Newcastle University 's Medicinal Plant Research Centre , investigated the properties of coffee and green and black tea in a series of scientific experiments .
Black tea – traditional English breakfast tea – is derived from the same plant as green tea , Camellia sinensis , but has a different taste and appearance because it is fermented .
They found that both green and black tea inhibited the activity of enzymes associated with the development of Alzheimer 's Disease , but coffee had no significant effect .
Both teas inhibited the activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) , which breaks down the chemical messenger or neurotransmitter , acetylcholine .
Alzheimer 's is characterised by a drop in acetylcholine .

Green tea and black tea also hinder the activity of the enzyme butyrylcholinesterase ( BuChE ) , which has been discovered in protein deposits which are found on the brain of patients with Alzheimer's .
Green tea went one step further in that it obstructed the activity of beta - secretase , which plays a role in the production of protein deposits in the brain which are associated with Alzheimer 's disease .
Scientists also found that it continued to have its inhibitive effect for a week , whereas black tea's enzyme- inhibiting properties lasted for only one day .
There is no cure for Alzheimer 's but it is possible to slow the development of the disease .
Drugs currently on the market hinder the activity of AChE , and others are being developed which scientists hope will inhibit the activity of BuChE and beta - secretase .
However , many of the drugs currently available , such as donepezil , have unpleasant side effects and the medical profession is keen to find alternatives .
The Newcastle University researchers are now seeking funding to carry out further tests on green tea , which they hope will include clinical trials .
Their aim is to work towards the development of a medicinal tea which is specifically aimed at Alzheimer 's sufferers .
advertisement
The next step is to find out exactly which components of green tea inhibit the activity of the enzymes AChE , BuChE and beta - secretase .
Lead researcher , Dr Ed Okello , who is also a lecturer with Newcastle University 's School of Biology , said : " Although there is no cure for Alzheimer 's , tea could potentially be another weapon in the armoury which is used to treat this disease and slow down its development .
It would be wonderful if our work could help improve the quality of life for millions of sufferers and their carers .
" Our findings are particularly exciting as tea is already a very popular drink , it is inexpensive , and there do not seem to be any adverse side effects when it is consumed .
Still , we expect it will be several years until we are able to produce anything marketable .
Dr Okello , himself a green tea drinker , said the findings of the research suggested tea could boost the memory of everyday drinkers :
" The ageing politician , Tony Benn , is a prime example of somebody who drinks tea and has a fantastic memory .
He is said to drink 18 pints a day and has a very sharp mind for a man of his age , " he added .
Prof Clive Ballard , director of research , Alzheimer 's Society , said : " This interesting research builds on previous evidence that suggests that green tea may be beneficial due to anti-oxidant properties .
Certainly the effect on the cholinesterase enzyme ( the target of current anti-dementia drugs such as Aricept ) and beta - secretase ( an enzyme which is important in the build up of plaques ) is very exciting and requires further investigation . "

I wanted to get a feel for just how powerful JavaScript is as a programming language ( as opposed to just a scripting language ) , so I sat down one evening and wrote this .
It turns out that it was quite good for this application , since it is so flexible - dynamically sized arrays are used throughout , and associative arrays make the symbol table quite easy .
A number of Lisp instructions are implemented ( see below ) .
The choice of instructions and some of the implementations of the composite functions were taken from Roger Rohrbach 's Lisp in Awk interpreter .
The syntax is standard , and only integer arithmetic is available .
Primarily because it is easy to implement , scoping is dynamic as in original Lisp and unlike modern Lisp or Scheme .
Since this is pretty much a toy , it does n't do much in the way of error handling .
However , it should work on correct Lisp code ; if it breaks on code you believe to be correct , please send me mail .
To see the source code , just View - Source on this page ; but see the copying restrictions below .
Update 2010 :
I wrote this in 1997 , just for fun and as a vehicle for learning JavaScript .
It 's just a toy , and at this point a rather outdated toy at that .
People are still welcome to send bug reports , but know that in all likelihood I 'm not going to fix the bugs you report .
Meanwhile , there are a few other Lisps in JavaScript that might interest you :
RMS on DRM
Opposing Digital Rights Mismanagement
by Dr. Richard M. Stallman
In 1989 , in a very different world , I wrote the first version of the GNU General Public License , a license that gives computer users freedom .
The GNU GPL , of all the free software licenses , is the one that most fully embodies the values and aims of the free software movement , by ensuring the four fundamental freedoms for every user .
These are freedoms to 0 ) run the program as you wish ; 1 ) study the source code and change it to do what you wish ; 2 ) make and distribute copies , when you wish ; 3 ) and distribute modified versions , when you wish .
Any license that grants these freedoms is a free software license .
The GNU GPL goes further : it protects these freedoms for all users of all versions of the program by forbidding middlemen from stripping them off .
Most components of the GNU / Linux operating system , including the Linux component that was made free software in 1992 , are licensed under GPL version 2 , released in 1991 .
Now , with legal advice from Professor Eben Moglen , I am designing version 3 of the GNU GPL .
GPLv3 must cope with threats to freedom that we did not imagine in 1989 .
The coming generation of computers , and many products with increasingly powerful embedded computers , are being turned against us by their manufacturers before we buy them–they are designed to restrict what we can use them to do .
First , there was the TiVo .
People may think of it as an appliance to record TV programs , but it contains a real computer running a GNU / Linux system .
As required by the GPL , you can get the source code for the system .
You can change the code , recompile and install it .
But once you install a changed version , the TiVo wo n’t run at all , because of a special mechanism designed to sabotage you .
Freedom No. 1 , the freedom to change the software to do what you wish , has become a sham .
Then came Treacherous Computing , promoted as “ Trusted Computing , ” meaning that companies can “ trust ” your computer to obey them instead of you .
It enables network sites to tell which program you are running ; if you change the program , or write your own , they will refuse to talk to you .
Once again , freedom No. 1 becomes a sham .
Microsoft has a scheme , originally called Palladium , that enables an application program to “ seal ” data so that no other program can access it .
If Disney distributes movies this way , you ’ll be unable to exercise your legal rights of fair use and de minimis use .
If an application records your data this way , it will be the ultimate in vendor lock - in .
This too destroys freedom No. 1 – if modified versions of a program cannot access the same data , you ca n’t really change the program to do what you wish .
Something like Palladium is planned for a coming version of Windows .
AACS , the “ Advanced Access Content System , ” promoted by Disney , IBM , Microsoft , Intel , Sony , and others , aims to restrict use of HDTV recordings–and software–so they ca n’t be used except as these companies permit .
Sony was caught last year installing a “ rootkit ” into millions of people ’s computers , and not telling them how to remove it .
Sony has learned its lesson : it will install the “ rootkit ” in your computer before you get it , and you wo n’t be able to remove it .
This plan explicitly requires devices to be “ robust ” –meaning you cannot change them .
Its implementors will surely want to include GPL - covered software , trampling freedom No. 1 . This scheme should get “ AACSed , ” and a boycott of HD DVD and Blu-ray has already been announced ( http://bluraysucks.com/boycott).
Allowing a few businesses to organize a scheme to deny our freedoms for their profit is a failure of government , but so far most of the world ’s governments , led by the U.S. , have acted as paid accomplices rather than policemen for these schemes .
The copyright industry has promulgated its peculiar ideas of right and wrong so vigorously that some readers may find it hard to entertain the idea that individual freedom can trump their profits .
Facing these threats to our freedom , what should the free software community do ?
Some say we should give in and accept the distribution of our software in ways that do n’t allow modified versions to function , because this will make our software more popular .
Some refer to free software as “ open source , ” that being the slogan of an amoral approach to the matter , which cites powerful and reliable software as the highest goals .
If we allow companies to use our software to restrict us , this “ open source DRM ” could help them restrict us more powerfully and reliably .
Those who wield the power could benefit by sharing and improving the source code of the software they use to do so .
We too could read that source code–read it and weep , if we ca n’t make a changed version run .
For the goals of freedom and community –the goals of the free software movement –this concession would amount to failure .
We developed the GNU operating system so that we could control our own computers , and cooperate freely in using them in freedom .
To seek popularity for our software by ceding this freedom would defeat the purpose ; at best , we might flatter our egos .
Therefore we have designed version 3 of the GNU GPL to uphold the user ’s freedom to modify the source code and put modified versions to real use .
The debate about the GPL v3 is part of a broader debate about DRM versus your rights .
The motive for DRM schemes is to increase profits for those who impose them , but their profit is a side issue when millions of people ’s freedom is at stake ; desire for profit , though not wrong in itself , cannot justify denying the public control over its technology .
Defending freedom means thwarting DRM .

Everyone lies : it ’s just a question of how , when and why .
From the relationship saving “ yes , you do look thin in those pants ” to the improbable “ your table will be ready in 5 minutes ” , manipulating the truth is part of the human condition .
Accept it now .
I ’m positive that given our irrational nature and difficultly accepting tough truths , we ’re collectively better off with some of our deceptions .
They buffer us from each other ( and from ourselves ) , avoid unnecessary conflicts , and keep the wonderful confusion of our psychologies tucked away from those who do n’t care .
White lies are the spackle of civilization , tucked into the dirty corners and crevices our necessary , but pretentiously inflexible idealisms create .
Small lies prop up and support our powerful truths , holding together the insanely half honest , half false chaos that spins the world .
But lies , serious lies , should not be encouraged as they destroy trust , the binding force in all relationships .
One particularly troublesome kind of lie is known as Bullshit ( BS ) .
These are unnecessary deceptions , committed in the gray area between polite white lies and complete malicious fabrications .
BS is usually defined as inventions made in ignorance of the facts , where the primary goal is to protect oneself .
The aim of BS is n’t to harm another person , although that often happens collaterally .
For a variety of reasons BS can be hard to detect , which is why I ’m offering this missive as a crash B.S. in BS detection .
But be warned : to keep you on your toes there are several bits of BS tucked inside this essay which you will have to find for yourself .
Why people BS : a primer
The first lie in the Western canon comes from the same joyful tome as the first murders , wars and plagues : the Old Testament .
Despite my distaste for trips into religious texts , this one has supreme tragicomic value .
To recap from the book of Genesis , God tells Adam and Eve not to eat fruit from the tree of knowledge , as pretty as it is , for they ’ll die .
He wanders off to do some unexplained godlike things , as gods are prone to do , leaving the very tempting , and non pit - bull or electrified fence protected , tree out for all to see .
Meanwhile Satan slinks by and convinces
Eve apples are good : so she and Adam have an apple snack ( the bible refers to them only as fruit , apples are a western addition ) .
God instantly returns , scolds Adam , who blames Eve ; resulting in everyone , snakes , people and all , getting thrown out of Eden forever .
Please note that in this tale nearly everyone lied .
God lied [ 1 ] , or was deceptively ambiguous , about the apples ( they were n’t fatal in any modern sense , as if I told you reading this essay will kill you , you ’d expect I meant sometime today – please read the footnote if you ’re angered by critiques of scripture ) .
Satan misrepresents the apple ’s power , and Adam , approximates a lie in his wimpy finger pointing to Eve .
It ’s a litany of deception and a cautionary tale : in any book that makes everyone look bad in just a few pages , is it really a surprise how the rest plays out ?
People lie for three reasons ; the first is to protect themselves .
They may wish to protect something they want or need , a concept they cherish , or to prevent something they fear , like confrontation .
There is often a clear psychological need motivating every lie .
A well known fib , “ the dog ate my homework ” , fits the BS model .
In the desperate fear driven attempt not to be caught , children ’s imaginations conceive amazing improbabilities .
Fires , plagues , revolutions , curses , illnesses and absurd reinventions of the laws of physics and space - time have all been summoned by children around the world on the fateful mornings when they find themselves at school , sans - homework .
It ’s an emotional experience , this need to BS : as logically speaking , the stress of inventing and maintaining a lie is rarely easier than accepting the consequences of the truth .
Which leads to the second reason people lie : sometimes it works .
It ’s a gamble , but when it works , wow .
Did you lie to your parents about girls , boys , fireworks , drugs , grades , or where you were till 2 am on a school night ?
I sure did and still do .
My parents still think I ’m a famous painter / doctor / professor in London ( shhh ) , and my best friend still believes his high school girlfriend and I did n’t get it on every time I borrowed his car [ 2 ] .
Even my ever faithful dog Butch used to lie , in his way , by liberating trash from a house - worth of garbage cans , then hiding in his bed , hoping his lack of proximity to the Jackson Pollock of refuse that was formerly my kitchen would be indistinguishable from innocence .
Which gives us the third reason people lie , a truth saints and sinners have known for ages : we want to be seen as better than we see ourselves .
Sadly , comically , we also believe we ’re alone in both having this temptation , as well as the shame it brings with it ( e.g .
“ We ’re not alone in feeling alone “ ) .
The secret truth is everyone has moments of weakness : times when fear and greed melt our brains and we ’re tempted to say the lies we wish were true .
And for that reason the deepest honesty is found in people willing to admit to their lies , or their barely resisted temptations , and own the consequences .
Not the pretense of the saints , who pretend , incomprehensibly , inhumanly , to never even have those urges at all .
Ok , enough philosophy : lets get to detection .
BS detection
The first rule of BS is to expect it .
Fire detectors are designed to expect a fire at any moment : they ’re not optimists .
They fixate on the possibility of fires and that ’s why they save lives .
If you want to detect BS you have to swallow some cynicism , and add some internal doubt to everything you hear .
Socrates , the father of western wisdom , based his philosophy around the recognition , and expectation , of ignorance .
It ’s far more dangerous to assume people know what they ’re talking about , than it is to assume they do n’t and let them prove you wrong .
Be like Socrates : assume people are unaware of their own ignorance ( including yourself ) and politely , warmly , probe to sort out the difference .
The first detection tool is a question :
How do you know what you know ?
Throw this phrase down when someone force feeds you an idea , an argument , a reference to a study or over - confidently suggests a course of action .
People so rarely have their claims challenged , that asking someone to explain how they know something sheds light on whatever ignorance they ’re hiding .
It instantly diminishes the force of a BS driven opinion .
It works well in response to the following examples :
“ The project will take 5 weeks “ .
How do you know this ?
What might go wrong that you have n’t accounted for ?
Would you bet $ 10 k on this claim ?
$ 100 k ?
“ . How do you know this ?
What might go wrong that you have n’t accounted for ?
Would you bet $ 10 k on this claim ?
$ 100 k ? “ Our design is groundbreaking . ” Really ?
What ground is that ?
And who , besides the designers / investors , has this opinion ?
. ” Really ?
What ground is that ?
And who , besides the designers / investors , has this opinion ?
“ Studies show that liars ’ pants are flame resistant .. ”
What studies ?
Who ran them and why ?
Did you actually read the study or a two sentence press clipping ( poorly ) explaining the results ?
Are there any studies that claim the opposite ?
When you ask a flavor of “ how do you know what you know ? ” often they ca n’t answer quickly .
Even credible thinkers need time to sort through their logic , separating assumptions from facts : an an exercise that works in everyone ’s favor ( the fancy word for this is epistemology .
I wish there was a word like epistemologize , to describe when you challenge someone ’s epistemological basis for something ) .
Of course it ’s fine to hear : “ This is purely my opinion ” or “ It ’s a guess , as we have no data ” , but those are far weaker claims that most people , especially if they ’re making stuff up , typically make .
Identifying someone ’s opinion as speculation , rather than fact , disarms the threat of most kinds of BS .
The second tool is also a question :
What is the counter argument ?
Anyone who has seriously considered something will have seen enough facts
to fit their current argument as well as alternative position : ask for them .
It ’s a grade school assignment , intended to show there are many reasonable ways to interpret the same set of facts .
However , someone who is bullshitting you wo n’t have researched or thought through anything : they ’re making things up .
Asking for the counter argument will force them to either back up their position , or to end the discussion until they ’ve done due diligence .
( If they claim there is no counter argument , end the discussion .
They are not only BS’ing you , they think you ’re a moron ) .
Similarly useful questions include :
Who besides you shares this opinion ?
What are your biggest concerns , and what will you do to address them ?
What would need to change for you to have a different ( opposite ) opinion ?
Time & Pressure
A good thought holds together .
Its solid conceptual mass maintains its shape no matter how much you poke , probe , test and examine .
But BS is all surface .
Like a magician ’s bouquet of flowers , it ’s pretty as it flashes past your eyes , but its absence of integrity become obvious when you hold it in your hands .
Anyone creating BS knows this , and will tend towards urgency .
They ’ll resist reviews , breaks , consultations or the suggestion of sleeping on decisions before they ’re made .
Use time & pressure , the third tool of BS detection , in your favor : never allow big decisions to be mismanaged to the point where they must be made urgently .
Ask to withhold judgment for a day , and watch the response .
Invite people with expertise you need but do n’t have to participate in decisions to add intellectual and domain pressure ( Hiring them if necessary .
The $ 500 you pay a lawyer , accountant or consultant to review something effectively becomes a well spent BS insurance fee ) .
Be a leader in creating an environment unpleasant for BS .
If everyone knows the gauntlet of friendly , but rigorous , intellectual curiosity claims must run through , BS will be discouraged while still in the minds of the tempted .
Confidence in reduction
Especially in business and technology , jargon and obfuscation hide huge quantities of BS .
Inflated language is a technique of intimidation .
The bet is that if you do n’t understand what they ’re talking about , you ’ll feel stupid , or distracted , and give in to the appearance of their superior knowledge .
This is , of course , entirely bullshit .
To withstand BS you have to have an inner core of self - reliance , holding on to your doubts longer than the BS ’er holds onto their charade .
For example :
Our dynamic flow capacity matrix has unprecedented downtime resistance protocols .
If you do n’t understand what the hell this means , err on your own side .
Do n’t assume you ’re missing something : assume they are .
They ’re either hiding something , communicating poorly , or do n’t themselves understand what they ’re talking about .
BS deflating responses include :
I refuse to accept this proposal until I , or someone I trust , fully understands it .
Explain this in simpler terms I can understand ( repeat if necessary ) .
Break this into pieces you can verify , prove , compare , or demonstrate for me .
Are you trying to say “ our network server has a backup power supply ? ”
If so , can you speak plainly next time ?
Assignment of trust
The fourth tool of BS detection ( derived from the rule of expecting BS ) is careful assignment of your trust .
Never agree to more than your trust allows .
Who cares how confident they are : the question is how confident are you in them ?
It ’s rare that there is n’t
time for trust to be earned .
Divide requests , projects or commitments into pieces .
It ’s not offensive to refuse to take someone ’s word if they have no history of living up to it before ( especially if they ’re trying to sell you something ) .
And trust can be delegated .
I do n’t need to trust you , if you ’ve earned the trust of people I trust .
Anyone skilled in the BS arts has obtained that skill through practice , diminishing the odds that many BS - proof people have been successfully deceived by them in the past .
Nothing defuses BS faster than a collective of people that help each other detect and eliminate BS .
If a team of people witnesses the complete evisceration of someone ’s BS few will attempt it again : they ’ll know your world is a BS free zone .
Great teams and families help each other detect bullshit , both in others and themselves , as sometimes the real BS we need to fear
is our own .
Footnotes
[ 1 ]
One popular interpretation of Genesis 2:17 is that God meant “ you will be mortal ” when he said “ you will surely die ” , so its not a lie – this is in line with the many who believe in the omnibenevolence of god or the perfect nature of the bible .
While I question these positions , they are popular views and deserves mention .
More to my point , in the context of Genesis , there is no reason Adam could know , when told by God he ’d surely die , any of these modern interpretations of God ’s words , or the symbolic meaning of all these things , we know now in the present .

Sexy Voice Key To Large Sex Life
Gordon G. Gallup , Jr. , Susan M. Hughes and Franco Dispenza have found that people with sexy voices get more sex and have more symmetrical body shapes .
In " Ratings of voice attractiveness predict sexual behavior and body configuration , " published in the September issue of Evolution and Human Behavior , published by Elsevier , Susan Hughes , Franco Dispenza , and Gordon Gallup of the University 's department of psychology tested 149 men and women by having them listen to recorded , neutral voices counting from 1 to 10 .
They were then asked to rate the anonymous voices on a scale from " very unattractive " to " very attractive . "
The results were compared to surveys and morphological measurements taken among the speakers .
Researchers discovered that people whose voices are judged to be attractive tend to have sexual intercourse at an earlier age , have more sexual partners than those with voices rated less attractive , and are more prone to sexual infidelity .
They also have more sex partners among people involved in other relationships .
" In short , " Gallup said , " ratings of voice attractiveness are correlated with promiscuity in both men and women . "
The fact that people with more symmetrical bodies have sexier voices is especially interesting .
This suggests that the quality of development of a fetus translates into not just a more attractive symmetrical appearance but also into a throat shape that creates more pleasing vocal sounds .
The full paper is on - line . ( PDF format )
We investigated the relationship between ratings of voice attractiveness and sexually dimorphic differences in shoulder - to - hip ratios ( SHR ) and waist - to - hip ratios ( WHR ) , as well as different features of sexual behavior .
Opposite - sex voice attractiveness ratings were positively correlated with SHR in males and negatively correlated with WHR in females .
For both sexes , ratings of opposite - sex voice attractiveness also predicted reported age of first sexual intercourse , number of sexual partners , number of extra-pair copulation ( EPC ) partners , and number of partners that they had intercourse with that were involved in another relationship ( i.e. , were themselves chosen as an EPC partner ) .
Coupled with previous findings showing a relationship between voice attractiveness and bilateral symmetry , these results provide additional evidence that the sound of a persons voice may serve as an important multidimensional fitness indicator .
A sexy voice might be more important for a female than a male .
Males might be better off with bigger shoulders .
It is interesting that voice attractiveness was a better predictor of sexual behavior in females than WHR was .
The best predictor of promiscuity ( as measured by number of sexual partners ) in males was SHR , whereas in females , it was voice attractiveness .
As shown in Table 2 , the correlations between opposite - sex ratings of voice attractiveness and sexual behavior in females were consistently higher than those found for WHR and sexual behavior .
However , just the opposite was true for males ( see Table 1 ) .
Among males , SHR was a better predictor of sexual behavior than voice was .
For example , whereas opposite - sex voice attractiveness accounted for 13 % of the variance in promiscuity among males , SHR accounted for 28 % of the variance in male promiscuity .
The same sex differences held for the relationship between voice and body configuration .
Male SHR accounted for more variance ( 25 % ) in opposite sex ratings of voice attractiveness than did female WHR ( 14 % ) .
Perhaps people with unsexy voices should avoid talking much in bars .

With the Academy Awards handed out yesterday ( what do you think of the results ? ) , and Scorsese finally getting that prestigious 13.5 inch gold - plated statuette , I thought that it might be interesting to look back and see how Kurosawa ’s films did at the Oscars throughout the years .
We are all of course well aware of how Kurosawa himself never got a “ real ” Oscar ( he himself joked that his 1990 honorary award was given to him only because the Academy thought that he was going to die soon ) , but did you remember that films like Yojimbo and Dodesukaden actually gained nominations ?
Personally , I was also not aware that it was Out of Africa that robbed Kurosawa and a number of his crew of awards glory in 1986 — the only time when Kurosawa himself was nominated in the Best Director category .
Whatever your personal opinion is about the Oscars or film awards in general , I think that the following list that I compiled is nevertheless relatively interesting reading .
1952 : Rashomon
WON Honorary award : “ The most outstanding foreign language film released in the United States during 1951 . ” ( Equivalent to the ‘ Best foreign film ’ , a category that was officially created in 1956 . )
1957 : Seven Samurai
NOMINATED Best Costume Design , Black - and - White : Kohei Ezaki ( lost to Jean Louis for ‘ The Solid Gold Cadillac ’ )
NOMINATED Best Art Direction - Set Decoration , Black - and - White : So Matsuyama ( lost to Cedric Gibbons , Malcolm F. Brown , Edwin B. Willis , F. Keogh Gleason for ‘ Somebody Up There Likes Me ’ )
1962 : Yojimbo
NOMINATED Best Costume Design , Black - and - White : Yoshiro Muraki ( lost to Piero Gherardi for ‘ La Dolce Vita ’ )
1972 : Dodesukaden
NOMINATED Best Foreign Language Film ( lost to ‘ The Garden of the Finzi - Continis ’ )
1976 : Dersu Uzala
WON Best Foreign Language Film
1980 : Kagemusha
NOMINATED Best Foreign Language Film ( lost to ‘ Moscow Does Not Believe In Tears ’ )
NOMINATED Best Art Direction - Set Decoration Yoshiro Muraki ( lost to Pierre Guffroy and Jack Stephens for ‘ Tess ’ )
1986 : Ran
WON Best Costume Design : Emi Wada
NOMINATED Best Director : Akira Kurosawa ( lost to Sydney Pollack for ‘ Out of Africa ’ )
NOMINATED Best Cinematography : Takao Saitô , Masaharu Ueda and Asakazu Nakai ( lost to David Watkin for ‘ Out of Africa ’ )
NOMINATED Best Art Direction - Set Decoration : Yoshirô Muraki and Shinobu Muraki ( lost to Stephen B. Grimes and Josie MacAvin for ‘ Out of Africa ’ )

Anybody who objects to their personal details going on the new " Big Brother " ID cards database will be banned from having a passport .
More here ....
• Cameron to swop ID cards for guards
James
Hall , the official in charge of the supposedly - voluntary scheme , said the Government would allow people to opt out - but in return they must " forgo the ability " to have a travel document .
With one in every eight people saying they will refuse to sign - up , up to five million adults could effectively be refused permission to leave the country .
Campaigners reacted to Mr Hall 's remarks with fury , saying they were yet more evidence of the lurch towards " Big Brother " Britain .
Phil Booth , of the NO2ID group , said : " The idea that ID cards scheme is voluntary , and people can opt - out , is a joke .
" There are all sorts of reasons why people need to travel , not just for holidays .
There is work , visiting relatives .
" What are these people supposed to do ?
It stretches the definition of voluntary beyond breaking point .
They will go to any length to get personal information for this huge database .
Who knows what will happen to it then ? "
Mr Hall , chief executive of the Identity and Passport Service , delivered his warning during a Downing Street " webchat " .
One concerned member of the public , Andrew Michael Edwards , asked what would happen to people who refuse to join the £ 5.4 billion scheme .
Mr Hall replied : " There is no need to register and have fingerprints taken - but you will forgo the ability to have a passport " .
Officials later explained the meaning of his remark .
The first ID cards will be issued in 2009 , to anybody who applies for a passport .
People will be required to give fingerprints , biometric details such as a facial scan and a wealth of personal details - including second homes , driving licence and insurance numbers .
All will be stored on a giant ID cards Register , which can be accessed by accredited Whitehall departments , banks and businesses .
While The ID Cards Bill was going through Parliament , peers agreed an " opt out " with Ministers for people who needed a passport , but did not want to participate in the ID cards scheme .
It was the only way the Lords would accept the legislation , amid howls of concern that it represents yet another move towards a surveillance society .
But , as Mr Hall 's comments this week make clear , the opt - out only applies to being physically issued with a card .
In order to get a passport , people will still have to hand over all their personal details for storage on the ID cards Register - where they will be treated in the same was as those who agreed to sign - up .
They simply avoid getting the card - even though they will have to pay the full combined price of £ 93 for an ID card and passport .
It means that , despite the Government repeatedly insisting the scheme is voluntary , the only way to avoid signing - up is to never obtain or renew a passport .
Therefore , anybody who objects to ID cards on principle and wants to keep their personal details private must remain in the UK for the rest of their lives .
Critics said it was clear ID cards were being made compulsory by stealth .
Some 6.6 million people apply for travel documents each year .
Mr Booth said legal challenges were inevitable , as restricting the right of free movement is a grave breach of human rights law .
A YouGov survey , published three months ago , found 12 per cent of Britons would refuse to take part in the scheme , even if it meant paying a fine or serving a prison sentence .
Mr Booth predicted many of this group would be prepared to bring test cases to challenge the Government 's position in court .
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Nick Clegg said : " This comment confirms long standing suspicions that the government 's claim that the ID database will be voluntary is simply not true .
The voluntary claim is serving as a fig leaf for a universal compulsory system .
" Once again the government 's ID card plans are being pursued behind the backs of the British people . "
Labour has become increasingly obsessed with the introduction of ID cards , claiming they will help to beat fraud and illegal immigration .
But both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have fiercely opposed the scheme , amid concerns costs could spiral out of control .
Academics have predicted the final bill could reach up to £ 20 billion .
There are also concerns Ministers could be tempted to strike financial deals to pass on personal details , in a bid to recoup some of the enormous costs .
If the Tories win power , it will be scrapped immediately .
Mr Hall 's comments will fuel the suspicion that Ministers are involved in a desperate race against time to get the project off the ground , and get as many people 's details as possible before the next General Election .
The Home Office said it had never hidden the fact anybody refusing to give their biometric and other personal details to the ID cards database would not be eligible for a passport .
A spokesman said it was more cost effective to link the issuing of passports and ID cards , rather than allow people to register their details for one but not the other .

Lepo pozdravljeni !
Rad bi načel debato na temo " Kaj nam pomeni knjiga ? "
Teden knjige je sicer že mimo , zato tema ni preveč aktualna , je pa vendarle po svoje " večna " .
Ko sem sam zadnjič razmišljal o svojem odnosu do knjig , sem si pribeležil naslednje vrstice .
Človek , ki se je izselil iz stanovanja , kjer zdaj prebivam jaz , je za sabo pustil nekaj knjig .
Še iz male šole se spomnim , da je knjige treba spoštovati , zato jih nisem zavrgel , temveč sem jih otrl s krpo , malce potežkal in jih zložil na polico .
Kako prav sem ravnal , da sem jih shranil !
Zgodilo se je , da sem bil v zagati .
Vabljen sem bil k znancu , ki je obhajal neki jubilej , bilo je že pozno , darila pa nisem imel pri roki .
Vzel sem s police eno izmed knjig , ki sem jih dobil kot pritiklino stanovanja , in jo zavil v stanjol papir .
Prijatelj je bil vesel .
Šlo je za delo : " Elvis - kralj rokenrola " .
Vprašal me je sicer , kako to , da sem mu podaril ravno drugi del .
Nekoliko v zadregi sem se izgovoril , da zato , da bo toliko bolj te žko čakal naslednje leto , ko mu podarim prvega .
Ena od lastnosti človeka je , da ponavlja dobre prakse .
Tako sem ravnal tudi jaz , ko sem , kadar je bilo treba koga obdariti , segel na polico in zavil kak šno izmed knjig , do katerih sem prišel po srečnem naključju in brez odplatka .
Knjiga je navsezadnje lepo darilo !
Enkrat pa mi je telefoniral nekdanji sošolec Smilijan .
Prosil me je , če mu lahko pomagam iz težav .
Vabljen je bil na rojstni dan k dekletu , ob misli na katero mu je srce igralo .
Ona je bila do njega bolj hladna , a upal je , da je to zgolj prehodnega značaja .
Problem je bil v tem , da je bilo že pozno , on pa ni imel darila .
Rekel sem mu , naj pride , da bova skupaj že kaj našla .
Rekel je , da sem pravi tovariš , kajti šele v stiski spoznaš , kdo ti zares stoji ob strani .
Po tehtnem premisleku sem izbral knjigo " Dobrote iz medu " , ker jo je bilo mogoče odlično kombinirati z dodatnim darilom - še nedotaknjenim kozarcem medu , ki sem ga oni dan kupil v samopostrežni .
Kot posvetilo je Smilijan napisal : " Knjiga medenih dobrot naj bo vzpodbuda , da me povabiš na sladke medenjake s strani 247 .
Tvoj Smilijan .
" Darilo je bilo bomba .
Že ob izročitvi je dekle presenečenemu sošolcu padlo v objem in ga vroče poljubilo .
Povedala mu je , da ne bi mogel bolj zadeti .
Njen oče da je namreč amaterski čebelar , tako je bila že od otroštva v stiku z medom .
Toda z vabilom na sladke medenjake dolgo ni bilo nič .
Nekega dne pa je vendarle prišlo .
Dekle je Smilijanu razložilo , da je medenjake spekla že dvakrat , a da se ji niso nikoli zdeli dovolj dobri , da bi ga povabila .
V tretje so bili izvrstni in postala sta imeniten par .
Smilijan zdaj občasno pomaga bodočemu tastu , saj je mož prepričan da " fanta veselijo čebelarska opravila " .
Nekega dne sem opazil , da zaloga knjig na polici opazno kopni .
Veliko ljudi sem osrečil , zbirka pa se je s tem precej zredčila .
Med posameznimi preostalimi primerki so zevale velike škrbine .
Ugotovil sem , da sem naredil veliko dobrega , vendar pa da se moram zdaj ustaviti in osrečiti še sebe .
Tako sem preostanek knjig podaril - sebi .
Ob dolgih večerih pijem čaj in jih listam .
Preštudiral sem že zajeten šahovski priročnik , prebral nekaj kriminalk , se posebej skrbno posvetil knjigi Draga Ulage " Telesna vzgoja , š port , rekreacija " .
Trenutno berem " Življenje v dvoje " Marijana in Tee Košiček .
V knjigah je veliko znanja , zato jih nikar ne zavrzimo !
S knjigo je življenje bogatejše .
The laws governing the calculation of child support in Canada are shared by the provinces and territories , together with the federal government .
Generally , the federal legislation , the Divorce Act sets out the rules for the calculation of child support if you are already divorced or planning to divorce or planning to divorce .
In particular , the regulations under the Divorce Act called Federal Child Support Guidelines to specify the guidelines for the calculation of child support amounts .
( Provincial laws apply if you have never been married or are separated or planning to divorce but have decided not to divorce ) .
The Federal Child Support Guidelines consist of a set of rules and tables for calculating the amount of support that the paying party should contribute toward his children .
The guidelines are intended to make the calculation of child support fair , predictable and consistent for the benefit of the children .
Basically , the amount of child support awarded depends upon ; the income of each parent ; the number of children ; custody time ; and additional expenses to meet the children ’s needs , if any .
The amounts in the Federal Child Support Tables vary from one province to another because of differences in provincial income tax rates .
As regards tax treatment , the tables reflect the fact that child support payments are not taxable in the hands of the receiving parent and not deductible by the paying parent .
To find child support amounts in the Federal Child Support Tables , you must identify 3 items :
the province or territory where the paying parent lives ;
the paying parent ’s annual income ; and
the number of children that the paying and receiving parents have , who are eligible for child support .
The Federal Child Support Guidelines include other rules for using the tables , depending on the type of custody arrangement .
Note , however , that the Guidelines are just that : child support amounts can be adjusted to recognize a child ’s special expenses or to prevent undue financial hardship for a parent or a child in certain circumstances .
For example , more child support might be appropriate to cover child care costs where these costs are reasonable and necessary .
The Guidelines recognize that as a general rule , families with higher income spend more on their children .
Therefore , the paying parent ’s child support sum is set in accordance with the average proportion of income that a parent at that income level spends on their children .
In broad terms , the guidelines ask “ what would a parent with this income usually spend on his or her children ? ” and support payments are set accordingly .
Parents can agree amongst themselves , on the amount of child support , with the help of a mediator / lawyer .
If the parents file an agreement with the court regarding child support , the judge will :
look at the appropriate guidelines ;
find the appropriate amount ; and
determine whether the amount the parents agreed on is reasonable .
Usually , only the income of the paying parent is necessary to apply the tables .
However , the receiving party will have to provide income information in certain circumstances , for example , if either party is claiming undue hardship , or if there is split or shared custody .
If the income level of the paying parent changes , either parent may decide that it is appropriate to change the amount of child support .
This can be done by agreement or by court order .
( The paying parent does have an obligation to advise the receiving parent if there is a material change in circumstance , including , for example , a large salary increase ) .
If the paying parent is reluctant to provide the necessary financial documents , and for example , refuses to supply the documents needed to prove income , the court may order that he or she do so or face serious penalties .
The penalties could include being found in contempt of court or having to pay the other parent ’s legal costs .
The Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect on May 1 , 1997 .
But , if either parent wants to change the amount of a child support order or agreement made before May 1 , 1997 , he or she can amend the existing order or agreement with the other parent or make an application for a new court order .
Child Support Enforcement
In Canada , the provinces and territories are primarily responsible for child support enforcement .
Each province and territory has its own maintenance enforcement program .
In order to receive help from an enforcement program , the parent wanting to enforce the child support payment must register a child support order or agreement with the program in her province or territory .
If child support is not paid , the program can use a number of methods to enforce the order .
For example , some provinces have introduced driver ’s license denial programs .
If you have a concern that you will require the enforcement of your child support or order , you may want to contact the appropriate office in your province or territory to obtain a registration application see Provincial and Territorial Maintenance Enforcement Programs at Justice Canada .
The federal government also has some legislation to help provide the provinces and territories with the tools necessary to enforce child support parents for those parents registered in the respective programs : the Garnishment , Attachment and Pension Division Act and the Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act .
Federal legislation allows the provinces and territories to request the screening of specified federal databanks , including those of the Canada Revenue Agency , to locate parents who are behind in their support .
Also , once the provincial and territorial programs have exhausted all other remedies , federal law allows them to ask the federal government to deny specified federally regulated licenses to paying parents in “ persistent arrears ” .
These licenses includes passports and certain aviation and marine licenses .
I love Kathy Sierra .
I think that her work is fantastic and well - needed throughout the tech community .
So when i heard that she ’s getting death threats , i wanted to vomit .
The brief story is that three prominent bloggers got annoyed at another female blogger for not permitting mean - spirited comments in her blog .
They created a site called meankids.org as well as a spin - off .
These blogs encouraged people to say terrible things about others and it spun out of control .
The content by the sites ’ creators ( again , prominent bloggers ) was completely unacceptable – misogynistic , racist , and horrid speech .
Their words were bordering on hate speech so it ’s not that surprising that anonymous commenters took it one step forward .
There ’s nothing illegal about what the prominent bloggers did , but i think it is unethical at every level .
This is not an issue of censorship , but an issue of social responsibility .
What does it mean when the most prominent bloggers are encouraging speech that divides , particularly that which divides along the lines of race and gender ?
What kind of standard does that set ?
How can anyone support their practices , even as a “ joke ” ?
I believe in moral responsibility and key to that is a level of social respect , even for those with whom you disagree .
Without social solidarity , the moral fabric of society erodes .
When you allow room for intolerance , you breed hate .
This is not just an abstraction for me .
When i was in college , i was the recipient of unbearable hate - motivated speech , forcing me to leave Brown for a period of time .
In the computer science department , there was an anonymous forum called “ rumor . ”
It was the space for everything from critiques of professors to offending links to descriptions of how some women should be raped .
It was disgusting .
The speech from rumor spread beyond the anonymous forum ; i received blackmail phone calls .
My students received notices that they were not wanted ( these were minority students and it was clearly racially targeted ) .
Then , one day , i came in to find that my private emails about a lawsuit were posted to the forum .
I was accused of having left them around but after a series of investigations , we learned that / dev/ kmem was world writable on a machine in one of the labs and that root su-ed to my account on that machine .
We learned who was logged into the machine before root , but there was no way to guarantee that this was the person who took my files .
The police ( and various members of my department ) asked me to pursue legal action .
I declined because i realized that the cost for each email stolen was 30 years and i did not feel confident that i would ever know for sure who really was behind that machine .
The person logged in was a friend of my boyfriend ’s and i just did n’t want to go down that path .
It did n’t matter .
Everyone in the department blamed me , telling me that i deserved it .
People speaking with me in mind ( during the time in which i had left ) asked for the destruction of rumor ; i was accused of censorship .
Truth was i never thought that rumor should be destroyed technically .
I believed that it showed a failure in the department , proof of the destruction of social solidarity , proof of the intolerance that was bred .
I believed that it was a failure on the part of all who participated and allowed that forum to breed .
In other words , i did n’t want a technical solution – i wanted social responsibility .
I never got it .
That incident had long - lasting effects .
There were classes that i could not take because of it .
I was not allowed to hold positions in the department because of it .
Many people did not respect me .
I remember sitting outside a TA room listening to two of the friends of who i suspected discuss my exam .
They were shocked that i had aced it ; they assumed that i had some guy do my homework for me .
I remember going home and crying for hours .
I will never forget the descriptions of how me and my friends were to be raped .
And Kathy will never forget the descriptions of how she was to be harmed .
That ’s what it means to be terrorized .
How can we live in a community that permits that ?
How can we allow spaces like that to foster under the guise of “ free speech ” ?
We have a responsibility , a moral responsibility , to help generate spaces that breed tolerance , to speak out in support of those around us , and to bite our tongues rather than spit hatred when we ’re frustrated .
The web is persistent .
We bitch about what young people write on the web but how dare we promote it .
My hope is that this incident , as it spreads its way across the web , will make people think twice about the racist , sexist , homophobic , hate - filled , mocking , and otherwise cruel speech that they make space for .
I ’m all for deleting mean - spirited commentary ; i’ve done it time and time again on my blog .
I think that we have a responsibility to do our best to make the web a safe space so that we can make society a better place .
Airstrikes and artillery pound Gaza Israel says Interior Ministry building used in terror planning YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Israel Gaza Syria or or Create Your Own JERUSALEM ( CNN ) -- Israel rounded up members of the Hamas - led Palestinian government Thursday , and warplanes fired a rocket into the Palestinian Authority 's Interior Ministry building in Gaza City .
Early Friday , Palestinian and Israeli sources said offices of President Mahmoud Abbas ' Fatah Party were also hit in an airstrike .
Details of the attack were not immediately available .
The Israeli military said it targeted the Interior Ministry building because it was being used for " directing and planning terror activities . "
There were no immediate reports of casualties , but the building was in flames .
( Watch images from the aftermath of the strikes -- 7:02 ) Several other airstrikes hit in and around Gaza City about 2:30 a.m. Friday .
Targets hit included a Hamas training camp and what the Israeli military said was a weapons storehouse .
The raids knocked out power to some parts of the territory not blacked out Wednesday , when aircraft took out the main power plant before Israeli troops moved into southern Gaza .
The arrests of Palestinian Cabinet ministers and parliament members took place as the Israeli military continued its thrust into Gaza .
The Israel Defense Forces says the action is part of an attempt to rescue kidnapped army Cpl. Gilad Shalit .
On Thursday , the IDF fired more than 400 artillery shells into northern Gaza in an attempt to end the firing of Palestinian rockets into Israel , and troops moved through southern Gaza in search of Shalit .
Palestinians fired four Qassam rockets into Israel , but caused no damage or injuries , the IDF reported .
( Watch more Israeli strikes on Gaza -- 2:08 ) Palestinian sources said an expanded Israeli push into northern Gaza was delayed to allow time for diplomacy .
Israeli troops are moving slowly to avoid " undue misery , " said Daniel Ayalon , Israel 's ambassador to the United States .
He added that the Israeli operations were designed to put pressure on Palestinian leaders .
" We 're willing to wait .
There is some respite , and we will give diplomacy a chance as we have already been , " he said .
" But time is of essence and , of course , we cannot wait indefinitely . "
Egypt and Qatar have been working to broker a settlement .
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak told the government newspaper al - Ahram on Thursday that Hamas has approved a conditional plan for returning Shalit .
Cabinet arrests Israel , which has rejected calls for prisoner exchanges because of fears it would encourage more abductions , has not accepted the terms , Mubarak told al - Ahram .
The Palestine Liberation Organization said 84 people had been arrested , including seven Cabinet officials and 21 members of the Palestinian parliament .
The IDF said 87 people were arrested overnight .
Of those , it said , 64 were members of Hamas .
Another 23 belong to other factions .
Among the Cabinet members arrested were Labor Minister Mohammad al - Barghouti , Minister of Jerusalem Affairs Khaled Abu Arafeh , Minister of Local Governments Issa al Jaabari and Religious Affairs Minister Naif al Rajoub , Palestinian sources said .
Israeli officials said the Palestinians were arrested as suspected terrorists .
Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres said the arrests will put pressure on Hamas to decide what kind of organization it is going to be .
" They have to decide if they 're a government or if they belong to a terroristic organization , " Peres said .
" Their arrests were not arbitrary .
They will be put to trial , and they will be able to defend themselves in accordance with a legal system which is internationally recognized . "
Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat denounced the arrests .
" Kidnapping Palestinian lawmakers and holding the Palestinian government hostage will neither strengthen Israel 's hand in bargaining nor bring any good to anyone in the region , " Erakat said .
According to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz , the arrests were planned weeks ago but received approval from Israel 's attorney general Wednesday .
Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev denied the lawmakers were arrested in an effort to secure Shalit 's release , insisting the Israeli government had finally run out of patience with the political unrest in the territories .
When asked why the arrests were carried out at this time , Regev said Israel had been " giving time " to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .
" He said that he was trying to bring about positive changes , " Regev said .
" But if you look at what 's happened over the last few weeks and the last few days , really we 've had to draw a line in the sand . "
As part of Thursday 's operations , the IDF said it had attacked a car in Gaza City .
Islamic Jihad sources said the car was carrying members of the Palestinian militant group .
One person in the vehicle was injured , the sources said .
The IDF also said it was attacking areas in southern Gaza " in which terror cells " operate to " impair the ability of the terrorists to transfer the kidnapped IDF soldier . "
Elsewhere , Palestinian militants blew a hole in the fence along the Gaza border with Egypt , Palestinian sources said , and Palestinians were rushing to get through Thursday .
Security forces reportedly were trying to reseal the border .
Israel sealed all border crossings Monday .
Settler 's body found Early Thursday , a body found near the West Bank city of Ramallah was reported to be that of Eliyahu Yitzhak Asheri , 18 , a settler seized by Palestinian militants hours after Shalit 's kidnapping Sunday , Israeli security sources said .
The body was sent to the Pathological Institute in Israel for formal identification , sources said .
( Watch how the slaying may deepen the crisis -- 1:34 ) Asheri 's captors , a militant faction calling itself the Popular Resistance Committees , said the teen was killed " as a response to the targeting and killing of our leaders . "
On Wednesday , the PRC displayed Asheri 's identity card and said he would be " butchered " unless Israel stopped its incursion into Gaza .
Asheri lived in the Itamar settlement , near Nablus .
His family reported him missing Sunday , telling police he did not come back from the French Hill district of Jerusalem .
The body 's discovery was the latest in a series of events that began early Sunday , when Palestinian militants tunneled into Israel and attacked an army post near Israel 's border with Egypt and Gaza , kidnapping Shalit and killing two other soldiers .
( Watch friends and relatives mourn Asheri -- 1:44 ) Israeli intelligence indicated Shalit is being held in the Khan Yunis refugee camp .
An Israeli airstrike in Khan Yunis targeted what the Israeli military said was a storehouse for Qassam rockets .
Israeli warplanes have knocked out bridges connecting northern and southern Gaza and destroyed a power station in an effort to prevent militants from moving the captured soldier outside southern Gaza , according to the IDF .
On Monday , three Palestinian militant groups -- the military wing of Hamas , the PRC and the previously unknown Army of Islam -- claimed responsibility for Shalit 's kidnapping .
They issued a statement saying they would exchange information about the soldier if Israel freed all Palestinian women and youths under 18 who are in Israeli jails .
The Israeli government quickly rejected the offer and other calls to release Shalit as part of a prisoner exchange .
Pressure on Syria On Wednesday evening , Israeli jets buzzed the home of Syrian President Bashar al - Assad in Ladekye , outside Damascus .
Israeli television reported that the president was at home at the time .
Peres complained that Syria allowed the exiled Hamas political leader Khalid Meshaal -- operating out of Damascus -- to order the kidnapping of the Israeli soldier .
The flyover was seen as an attempt to bring pressure on al - Assad to rein in Meshaal .
Syrian state television called the Israeli move " an unacceptable , hostile and provocative act . "
Syria said its anti-aircraft batteries fired on the Israeli warplanes and chased them away .

Thread - based or event - based ?
The ongoing discussion of threadlets ( or fibrils , or whatever they will be called next week ) has considered the addition of a major new API to the kernel .
This discussion has , however , studiously ignored an important question : what about the longstanding kevent patch which , at some level , solves the same problems ?
The motivation for the first fibril patch was to make it easier to provide comprehensive asynchronous I/O in the kernel - and that was one of the reasons for kevents as well .
So it has been surprising that kevents have not figured into this conversation .
Kevents have finally become part of the discussion , however , resulting in an interesting exchange between kevent hacker Evgeniy Polyakov , threadlet ( and everything else ) hacker Ingo Molnar , and several others as well .
Benchmarks have been thrown around to illustrate the performance characteristics of both approaches , but the real question is this : what is the best way to allow user - space applications to juggle multiple simultaneous operations in a scalable manner ?
Evgeniy 's core claim appears to be that an event - oriented approach is inherently more scalable than using threads .
He says :
If things decreases performance noticeably , it is a bad things , but it is matter of taste .
Anyway , kevents are very small , threads are very big , and both are the way they are exactly on purpose - threads serve for processing of any generic code , kevents are used for event waiting - IO is such an event , it does not require a lot of infrastructure to handle , it only needs some simple bits , so it can be optimized to be extremely fast , with huge infrastructure behind each IO ( like in case when it is a separated thread ) it can not be done effectively .
In other words , using threads for event management is simply too slow .
David Miller has also argued that threads are inherently wrong for network - oriented tasks .
One of the big advantages behind the threadlet approach is that it is very fast in the non-blocking case , which is expected to be the situation much of the time .
In networking , however , one normally expects to block .
As a result , a highly multi- threaded networking application could create massive numbers of threads in short order .
Networking is inherently an event - oriented activity .
Ingo challenges the notion that using threads and the scheduler will be slower than maintaining lists of jobs which turn into events :
To me the picture is this : conceptually the scheduler runqueue is a queue of work .
You get items queued upon certain events , and they can unqueue themselves .
( there is also register context but that is already optimized to death by hardware )
So whatever scheduling overhead we have , it 's a pure software thing ...
Now look at kevents as the queueing model .
It does not queue ' tasks ' , it lets user - space queue requests in essence , in various states .
But it 's still the same conceptual thing : a memory buffer with some state associated to it .
Yes , it has no legacies , it has no priorities and other queueing concepts attached to it ... yet .
If kevents got mainstream , it would get the same kind of pressure to grow ' more advanced ' event queueing and event scheduling capabilities .
Prioritization would be needed , etc .
The point here is that the scheduler has been brutally optimized over the course of many years .
The actual overhead of switching contexts is quite small - perhaps less than that of a system call to manage events .
The only real difference is that the memory overhead of maintaining threads is quite a bit higher than the overhead of kevents .
But , says Ingo , with proper programming that should not be an insurmountable problem .
The real issue , though , tends to be one of ease of programming - on both the kernel and the user sides .
In user space , the classic pattern for an event - based application involves a central loop which only blocks when it is waiting for events .
Any actual work done within the loop must happen in a non-blocking manner ; should the loop block , events will pile up while the application is doing nothing .
Blocking in the wrong place can kill performance .
But avoiding blocking in all situations is tricky at best , and sometimes impossible .
The threadlet model lets the application developer stop worrying about blocking ; if an operation blocks , the application simply continues to run in a newly - created thread .
More generally , programs written as state machines - the style necessitated by event - driven models - tend to be hard for people to understand .
And there are a number of kernel operations ( opening a file , for example ) which can block in any of a number of places , and which are just about impossible to code in a state - machine style .
Multi - threaded programs present their own challenges for developers who are not prepared to think about concurrency issues , but they still tend to be easier for most to understand .
Threadlets , by making any sequence of calls easily implementable in a threaded model , should be relatively easy to program .
At least , that 's how the argument goes .
That argument applies to kernel space as well .
The struggle to bring event - based asynchronous I/O to Linux has occupied a number of highly - capable kernel developers for years - and the job is still far from complete .
It requires the addition of an entirely new infrastructure and the application of state - machine techniques to inherently sequential series of events .
The complexity of the retry - based asynchronous buffered file I / O patch set is a case in point : this code has seen work ( on and off ) for years , and it still has n't found its way into the mainline .
It still depends on worker threads for some of its operation as well .
Threadlets , it is argued , allow for any system call to be invoked asynchronously , with almost no added complexity or overhead at all .
Eventually the discussion reached a point where Linus jumped in to express a bit of frustration .
His position is that it's not a matter of choosing between event - based and thread - based mechanisms , since there is a place for both :
Use select / poll / epoll / kevent / whatever for event mechanisms .
STOP CLAIMING that you 'd use threadlets / syslets / aio for that ....
Event mechanisms are * superior * for events .
But they * suck * for things that are n't events , but are actual code execution with random places that can block .
In this view , it 's not a matter of picking one or the other , but providing both so that the right tool can be used for each job .
It seems likely that this opinion is fairly widespread , meaning that some sort of thread - based asynchronous mechanism will probably find its way into the mainline before too long .
Event - based interfaces will continue to be supported as well ; the big question there is whether the existing interfaces ( epoll in particular ) are sufficient , or whether the addition of kevents is called for .

I thought you'd be interested in knowing that the Wallace v. FSF case has been dismissed , with Mr. Wallace ordered to pay the Free Software Foundation 's costs .
Mr. Wallace 's fourth Amended Complaint was dismissed and the Free Software Foundation 's Motion to Dismiss was granted .
It 's the Order that tells Wallace to pay the Free Software Foundation 's costs .
Judges do that when they 'd like you to learn a good lesson .
It 's a signal you should n't have brought the case in the first place .
Honestly , pro se lawsuits tend to be disasters .
If you can't find a lawyer willing to represent you , it usually means you do n't have a case .
When you read the judge 's decisions , you will be able to count all the mistakes the plaintiff made .
I wo n't itemize , because I decided from the beginning not to educate Mr. Wallace and it feels kind of cruel , but the judge highlights a couple of them -- that despite the judge clearly telling him where his previous complaint was lacking , he did n't fix it .
As the judge explains , if you are granted an opportunity to fix a complaint and you fail to do so , the court is n't under any obligation to let you try , try again .
In this case , he had five tries .
When you have no legal training , you are bound to make mistakes .
People think that because the law is in English , that they get it .
I keep explaining that it 's English up to a point , but it 's really code -- words in the law do n't always have exactly the same meaning as the same word in normal use .
Then there are all the procedural rules that you wo n't know .
Like not attaching the GPL to your proposed complaint , unless you want the give the judge the opportunity to consider it when making his ruling , thus handing him an easy way to toss your case .
Do you know how hard it is to get a complaint tossed out ?
The judge himself explains the standard of review :
When ruling on a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12 ( b ) ( 6 ) , the court must accept as true the factual allegations contained in the complaint , as well as the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom .
A dismissal is appropriate only if the plaintiff can establish no set of facts , even if hypothesized , consistent with the allegations of the complaint that would entitle him or her to relief ....
Moreover , the court must examine only the complaint , and not the merits of the lawsuit .
And he still got thrown out , with everything weighted on his side .
Not only thrown out , he 's not allowed to amend again .
Here are the reasons you can be told you can't amend : " a court may deny leave to amend for undue delay , bad faith , dilatory motive , prejudice , or futility . "
Take your pick as to which one applies .
They 're all awful .
But the judge cites futility .
The lesson ?
It 's one thing to write " legal " nonsense on a message board ; it 's entirely different to present that nonsense in a court of law .
Nothing stops you if you just must , but you 'll end up losing and probably paying costs to boot .
Costs are not the same thing as lawyers ' fees , by the way .
If you really make a judge mad , you may end up paying those too .
So , the end result is , the GPL went to court , and the judge not only upheld it , he said this : [ T ]he GPL encourages , rather than discourages , free competition and the distribution of computer operating systems , the benefits of which directly pass to consumers .
These benefits include lower prices , better access and more innovation .
I 'm sure that was not Mr. Wallace 's intention , to strenghten the GPL .
But he did .
So , what do you think ?
Will we still have to listen to nonsense about the GPL not being a real license ?
That it 's never been tested in court ?
That it undermines the marketplace ?
That it 's unfair competition ?
All that SCO FUD was answered in a little courtroom in Indiana today .

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF INDIANA
INDIANAPOLIS DIVISION _____________________
DANIEL WALLACE , Plaintiff , v. FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION , INC . , Defendant .
___________________
1:05 - cv-0618-JDT - TAB ENTRY GRANTING REASSERTED MOTION TO DISMISS ( Docket No. 34 ) 1 ___________________
On November 30 , 2005 , Plaintiff Daniel Wallace filed pro se his Fourth Amended Complaint , in which he seeks injunctive relief to remedy alleged violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act , 15 U.S.C. § 1 . Two days earlier , in its Entry Granting Motion to Dismiss the Complaint ( Entry ) , the court had dismissed the previous iteration of Mr. Wallaces complaint , and granted him leave to amend the complaint to cure its deficiencies .
The Fourth Amended Complaint purportedly cures those deficiencies , and again seeks to enjoin  the restraint of trade by way of a licensing scheme to fix the prices of computer software products  allegedly perpetuated by Defendant Free Software Foundation , Inc. ( FSF  ) .
( Fourth Am. Compl .
1 . ) On December 29 , 2005 , FSF moved to dismiss the Fourth Amended Complaint , arguing that it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12 ( b ) ( 6 ) .
Mr. Wallace responded to the motion on January 3 , 2006 , with a reply brief being filed on January 24 , 2006 .
The motion to dismiss therefore is fully briefed and ripe for determination .
I. PLAINTIFFS FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT
The allegations raised for the first time in the Fourth Amended Complaint are set forth below .
Rather than repeat its previous summation of the remaining allegations , the court instead refers the parties to its November 28 , 2005 Entry .
Mr. Wallace now contends that FSF has conspired with International Business Machines Corporation , Red Hat Inc. , Novell Inc. and other individuals to pool and cross license their copyrighted intellectual property in a predatory price fixing scheme .
( Fourth Am. Compl . 2 -3. )
He contends that the scheme is carried out through a predatory price fixing agreement . . . to pool and cross license . . . intellectual property with others  ( id. 3 ) known as the GNU General Public License ( GPL  ) .
Mr. Wallace adds a section in the Fourth Amended Complaint entitled INJURY ,  in which he states that the predatory price fixing scheme is foreclosing competition in the market for computer operating systems . 
( Id . )
Specifically , it prevents Plaintiff Daniel Wallace from marketing his own computer operating system as a competitor . 
( Id. ) 2 II .
MOTION TO DISMISS
In its Reasserted Motion to Dismiss , FSF requests that the court dismiss the Fourth Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12 ( b ) ( 6 ) .
FSF contends that the complaint fails to address the deficiencies identified by the court in its November 28 , 2005 Entry , including that the injury allegedly suffered by Plaintiff is not one that the antitrust laws were meant to address .
( Mot. Dismiss 5 . ) Furthermore , FSF argues that Mr. Wallace lacks standing to bring the Fourth Amended Complaint because he does not allege any facts to show that in fact he is prepared to enter the market for providing computer operating systems .
( Id. ( citations omitted ) . )
FSF requests not only that the court dismiss the Fourth Amended Complaint , but also that it deny Mr. Wallace leave to further amend the complaint .
Mr. Wallace responds that his Fourth Amended Complaint adequately sets forth the three material elements of his claim under § 1 the Sherman Act .
He states that he has alleged 1 ) that the GPL constitutes a contract , combination or conspiracy  ( Resp. 2 ) ; 2 ) that the GPL creates an unreasonable restraint of trade ( id. 6 ) ; and 3 ) that the GPL has caused him injury ( id.10 ) .
As a result , Mr. Wallace contends that he has directly or inferentially alleged that the defendant has used an express contractual agreement to conspire with named co-conspirators and engage in an unreasonable restraint of trade by fixing prices at predatory levels . 
( Id. 13 -14 . ) 3 A. Standard of Review
When ruling on a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12 ( b ) ( 6 ) , the court must accept as true the factual allegations contained in the complaint , as well as the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom .
Forseth v. Vill. of Sussex , 199 F.3d 363 , 368 ( 7th Cir. 2000 ) ; Baxter by Baxter v. Vigo County Sch. Corp. , 26 F.3d 728 , 730 ( 7th Cir. 1994 ) .
A dismissal is appropriate only if the plaintiff can establish no set of facts , even if hypothesized , consistent with the allegations of the complaint that would entitle him or her to relief .
See Sanjuan v. Am. Bd. of Psychiatry & Neurology , Inc. , 40 F.3d 247 , 251 ( 7th Cir. 1994 ) .
Moreover , the court must examine only the complaint , and not the merits of the lawsuit .
See Autry v. Nw. Premium Servs. , Inc. , 144 F.3d 1037 , 1039 ( 7th Cir. 1998 ) .
B. The Plaintiff Again Has Not Alleged An Antitrust Injury .
In its November 28 , 2005 Entry , the court pointed to a fatal flaw in Mr. Wallaces Third Amended Complaint  he did not allege an antitrust injury upon which his claim under Section 1 of the Sherman Act could move forward .
( Entry 11 . )
The court noted that in order to assert a Section 1 claim , a plaintiff must allege that he or she suffered injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants  act unlawful .
Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl - O- Mat , Inc. , 429 U.S. 477 , 486 ( 1977 ) .
This generally means an anticompetitive effect .
Id. at 489 .
The court found that Mr. Wallaces purported injury , that he was  threaten[ed ] from entering into the market with his own computer operating system 
( Third Am. Compl. 3 ) , 4 was not of the sort that antitrust laws were intended to prevent , and dismissed his complaint with leave to amend .
( Entry 11 . ) Mr. Wallace has amended the complaint to add more detailed allegations relating to his injury .
He now asserts that the GPL is foreclosing competition in the market for computer operating systems .
( Fourth Am. Compl . 3 . ) Specifically , it prevents Plaintiff Daniel Wallace from marketing his own computer operating system as a competitor . 
( Id. ) Mr. Wallace argues that this amendment saves his complaint from dismissal .
The court disagrees .
The injury set forth in the Fourth Amended Complaint , which the court acknowledges is subtly different than that alleged in the previous complaint , still suffers from the same infirmity identified in the courts November 28 , 2005 Entry  it does not state an injury cognizable under antitrust laws .
First , while Mr. Wallace contends that the GPL is foreclosing competition in the market for computer operating systems  ( id. ) , his problem appears to be that GPL generates too much competition , free of charge .
The courts understanding from the GPL itself2 is that it is a software licensing agreement through which the GNU / Linux operating system may be licensed and distributed to individual users so long as those users cause any work that [ they ] distribute or publish , that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof , to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License . 
( GPL 3 . )
The GPL 5 purportedly functions to  guarantee [ users ] freedom to share and change free software .
( GPL Preamble . )
As alleged , the GPL in no way forecloses other operating systems from entering the market .
Instead , it merely acts as a means by which certain software may be copied , modified and redistributed without violating the softwares copyright protection .
As such , the GPL encourages , rather than discourages , free competition and the distribution of computer operating systems , the benefits of which directly pass to consumers .
These benefits include lower prices , better access and more innovation .
See Jason B. Wacha , Taking the Case : Is the GPL Enforceable , 21 Santa Clara Computer & High Tech L.J. 451 , 487 ( 2005 ) .
And the Sherman Act was enacted to assure customers the benefits of price competition , and . . . prior cases have emphasized the controlling interest in protecting the economic freedom of participants in the relevant market .
Assoc.d Gen. Contractors v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters , 459 U.S. 519 , 528 ( 1983 ) .
Therefore , the court finds that the Fourth Amended Complaint does not adequately set forth an injury to competition as a whole .
The allegation in the Fourth Amended Complaint that the GPL is foreclosing Mr. Wallace from entering into the market for operating systems also is not a cognizable antitrust injury .
The court understands Mr. Wallaces argument that the GPL may be preventing him from marketing his own operating system , and , for the purposes of the instant motion , accepts that allegation as true .
However , while this may be significant enough from Mr. Wallaces perspective , a plaintiff must prove not only an injury to him or herself , but to the market as well , Martin v. Am. Kennel Club , Inc. , 697 F. Supp. 997 , 1003 ( N.D. Ill. 1988 ) , which Mr. Wallace has failed to do .
As the court stated in its 6 November 28 , 2005 Entry , reduced opportunity as a competitor does not necessarily equate to an antitrust injury as recognized by the courts .
Brunswick , 429 U.S. at 488 .
Indeed , injury in fact is a different beast than antitrust injury .
Profl Sports Ltd. Pship v. Natl Basketball Assoc. , 961 F.2d 667 , 669 ( 7th Cir. 1992 ) .
And whenever the plaintiff and consumers have divergent rather than congruent interests , there is a potential problem in finding antitrust injury  . . . .
When the plaintiff is a poor champion of consumers , a court must be especially careful not to grant relief that may undercut the proper functions of antitrust .
Ball Meml Hosp. , Inc. v. Mutual Hosp. Ins. , Inc. , 784 F.2d 1325 , 1334 ( 7th Cir. 1986 ) .
Mr. Wallace has not alleged that anyone interfered with his freedom to compete in computer software market by creating his own operating system , one perhaps with features different from , or in addition to , that of the GNU / Linux operating system .
Indeed , Mr. Wallace has that ability , regardless of whether the GPL is in force or not .
For these reasons , the court finds that Mr. Wallaces Fourth Amended Complaint does not adequately allege an antitrust injury upon which his Section 1 claim may move forward .
3
The complaint therefore must be dismissed .
7 C. The Plaintiff is Denied Leave to Further Amend the Complaint .
FSF requests that the court deny Mr. Wallace leave to further amend his complaint , arguing that any fifth or subsequent amendment would be futile , particularly given Mr. Wallaces failure to state a claim thus far .
Even though Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 ( a ) provides that leave shall be freely given when justice so requires ,  a court may deny leave to amend for undue delay , bad faith , dilatory motive , prejudice , or futility .
See Foman v. Davis , 371 U.S. 178 , 182 ( 1962 ) ; Arazie v. Mullane , 2 F.3d 1456 , 1464 ( 7th Cir. 1993 ) .
The opportunity to amend a complaint is futile if  the complaint , as amended , would fail to state a claim upon which relief could be granted .
Glassman v. Computervision Corp. , 90 F.3d 617 , 623 ( 1st Cir. 1996 ) ) .
This standard is the same standard of legal sufficiency that applies under Rule 12 ( b ) ( 6 ) .
Id at 623 .
In this case , Mr. Wallace has had five opportunities to state a claim under Rule 12 ( b ) ( 6 ) .
And the court twice has determined that he failed to do so .
The courts November 28 , 2005 Entry even specifically highlighted Mr. Wallaces failure to allege an antitrust injury , but Mr. Wallaces subsequent complaint did not adequately address that failure .
In such a situation , where Mr. Wallace has failed to remedy a deficiency expressly noted by the court , he should not , and will not , be granted leave to further amend his complaint .
See Shanahan v. Chicago , 82 F.3d 776 , 781 ( 7th Cir. 1996 ) ( a district court need not permit a plaintiff to amend a complaint if the amended complaint suffers from the same defects as the original complaint ) .
8 III .
CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above , the court finds that Mr. Wallace has failed to allege an antitrust injury such that his claim under Section 1 of the Sherman Act may move forward .
The court therefore GRANTS the Reasserted Motion to Dismiss ( Docket No. 34 ) , filed December 29 , 2005 .
Mr. Wallace is DENIED leave to further amend his complaint .
An appropriate judgment will be entered .
ALL OF WHICH IS ENTERED this 20th day of March 2006 .

This Entry is a matter of public record and will be made available on the courts web site .
However , the discussion contained herein is not sufficiently novel to justify commercial publication .
2
The court may refer to the GPL in deciding the motion to dismiss because Mr. Wallace referred to it in his Fourth Amended Complaint .
See Venture Assocs .
Corp. v. Zenith Data Sys. Corp. , 987 F.2d 429 , 431 ( 7th Cir. 1993 ) .
3 FSF also argues that Mr. Wallace has not alleged that he is actually prepared to enter computer operating systems market .
In light of the courts ruling on the antitrust injury issue , it is unnecessary to address whether this contention is correct .

Earlier I reported that Google had a flaw in which it stores contact details in a JavaScript file on their server .
A website could in return declare the function “ google ”  , and put all your contacts and their details into an array .
From there it could have been parsed and sent to the malicious server using Ajax .
Earlier today there were reports on zdnet that said the flaw was fixed , however at the time it was n’t true .
Currently as of 8 PM EST the flaw has been fixed .
When attempting to execute the attack , all you get is a blank page now .
Visiting the old page on Google that revealed all the data in an XML file now gives an error :
google ({
Success : false ,
Errors : [ ]
} )
If you ’re visiting the page and it still give your contact ’s information , you need to log out of all Google services , and then log back in .
Doing so will now result in the error .
However the exploit will fail to work despite the fact that you have n’t logged out .
You have to give credit to them fixing the flaw on New Year ’s Day in under 24 hours .
Note
The link to the XML file on Google ’s server is n’t exploitable .
The hack worked using JavaScript , and the file that used JavaScript is now giving an error .
The XML file ca n’t be used to exploit GMail .
For the record , base2 does not alter any native JavaScript objects .
I wrote this about six months ago before starting work on base2 .
I decided not to post it at the time as I thought it sounded a little pompous .
On reflection , they are n’t bad rules and I managed to stick to them .
So , here the rules I wrote for myself back in October .

Comment : # 1 Dean , one src ( about 6 Kb on Gz compatible browsers ) , JS 1.5 Standard for every browser , without Object prototypes and with every prototype implemented as standard ( and few extra features not prototyped too ) .
This is to tell that You released a library ( Base2 ) that ’s not so different from my old JSL concept ( and goal ) and my new FW … but You was faster than me to release “ officially ” this cool library .
What do You think about merging our code for a better standard “ BaseFX ” library development ?
I can send
You my debugged sources ( point 4 and 5 of this post ) to implement correctly even XMLHttpRequest for IE 5 or greater ( as new perfect String . replace and every other Native methods ) Regards
Comment : # 2 I agree with most but life is tough in JavaScript land …
1 ) Being unobtrusive is not easy http://peter.michaux.ca/article/553
3 ) Do n’t extend built in objects at all .
Then you do n’t have to worry about clashes .
I do n’t see much difference in writing forEach ( myArray , function ( a ) {return a ;} ) then myArray .
forEach( function ( a ) {return a;} ) ;
It looks like there is some strong sniffing at the top of base2 - bom.js “ You must slavishly read every blog to find the next hack ” I do n’t think any code in a library should be a “ hack ” .
9 ) The Base OOP code seems quite long .
JavaScript OOP with “ super ” in eight lines : http://www.kevlindev.com/tutorials/javascript/inheritance/index.htm
11.1 ) Writing documentation is a valuable way to look at library code though a different set of glasses .
It really helps my development process .
11.2 ) Namespacing allows people to use a library in a legacy environment .
Those who do n’t want to type the namespaces can import the namespaced properties into the window object .
Without namespaces you are leaving out the legacy developers .
Just some thoughts .
The more JavaScript libraries the better since there is more ideas and analysis of browser scripting difficulties .
It is unfortunate that we all have such different sets of priorities and ca n’t just have one library .
Comment : # 3 The Base OOP code seems quite long .
Yes it is .
But I ’m happy with it .
I do n’t really like the other solutions available .
It looks like there is some strong sniffing at the top of base2 - bom.js
It is a JavaScript library .
My intent is that you should eliminate sniffing for the user of the library .
You must slavishly read every blog to find the next hack That was a joke .
Comment : # 4 [ … ]
Passend zum Thema hat Dean Edwards einige Regeln für Autoren von Javascript Bibliotheken aufgeschrieben , welchen ich sehr zustimme . [… ]
Comment : # 5 It is a JavaScript library .
My intent is that you should eliminate sniffing for the user of the library .
Then , if you ’re a fan of jQuery , why do n’t you introduce your library to the jQuery developers so as to drop all of their sniffing and depend on base2 ?
That way we could use jQuery and base2 together without problems I guess .
Comment : # 6 @knocte – if you like jQuery already then I really recommend that you continue to use it .
base2 offers nothing more than jQuery already provides .
Byte for byte , jQuery provides a lot more power .
This library is not really meant to compete with jQuery or Prototype .
Those libraries already provide lots of functionality that base2 does not .
base2.DOM is really aimed at : teachers and students who are learning JavaScript and the DOM
programmers , who are already familiar with JavaScript but do n’t want to learn a new API
web standards zealots

Dean Edwards : Rules For JavaScript Library Authors ( tags : javascript library rules bestpractices ) [… ]
Comment : # 8 Thank You Dean to ignore me totally , regards .
Comment : # 9 Indeed you are right on with all these , but this also leads me to believe that no library is doing all these things .
With my recent release of D|C I went through the annoying hassle of writing documentation .
I suppose some documentation is better than none , no matter how long your phone number is Predictability is also key since there ’s nothing worse than thinking something is something that it is n’t .
That is one main reason I allowed the ability to change D|C through registration .
Another thing … man I ’m really glad you posted this … because D|C has a simple plugin method which allows you to extend the library without touching the source … one thing I knew I needed to have .
And lastly your first rule .
Always a given .
That was my big argument over the “ just add a classname widget philosophy . ”
Das no good .
Comment : # 10 About point 4 ( Follow Standards ) Both your Function.apply and Number .
toFixed do n’t respect standards .
function bug ( ) {return [].slice.apply ( arguments )} ; alert ( bug ( 1, ( 2).toFixed ( 2) ,3 ) ) ; apply accepts one * optional * argument ( as call ) and ( 2).toFixed ( 2 ) should return string “ 2.00 ” .
As I said , bytefw has just solved these common problems … and , for example , the fastest version of unshift should be something like this [ ].unshift = function ( ) { this .reverse( ) ; while ( arguments.length ) this [ this.length ] = arguments [--arguments.length ] ; return this .reverse( ) . length };
This post just to tell
You that a collaboration should be better without wasted time and with less bugs because , as You said : look to see if it has not already been fixed and for example , again , your encodeURIComponent implementation is not standard too while mine one is ( and unescape as decodeURIComponent is a bad practice , imho ) .
bye
Comment : # 11 @ Andrea – what ’s wrong with my version of encodeURIComponent ( ) ?
And , can you keep questions about base2 on the base2 page please ?
Comment : # 12 Dean : how would you propose to implend for instance toJSONString ( ) without prototyping Object ?
Comment : # 13 [… ]
I do n’t think I ’d really call this a library .
It ’s more like a band - aid for browsers .
But if you are thinking of putting together your own library or band - aid , Dean has provided rules for JavaScript library authors .
In a nutshell , make it small , flexible and standards - based . [… ]
Comment : # 14 @ Dean , about your encodeURIComponent [ tested with FireFox ] example And , can you keep questions about base2 on the base2 page please ?
Sure but these are errors about fourth point of this list ( these functions do n’t respect standard and do n’t follow the Leader too ) Regards
Comment : # 15 @Tino Zijdel – you do n’t have to extend the Object .
prototype to make json work .
Prototype ( http://www.prototypejs.org/, rev 1.5.1rc2 ) has json support built in and they extend the Object singleton ( not the prototype ) .
var foo = Object.evalJSON ( myJSONString ) ; @ Dean – I dig your article .
Great points .
I like the idea of a build page to let me choose what components I want to add .
As libraries get bigger , and they do overtime , its nice to just pick out what you need .
For example , the Prototype SVN repo has all the main parts like ( ajax , string , number , event , core ) sep.
into their own files , but no official build page 8 ( .
@ Andrea Giammarchi – this is a post over Dean ’s work , not a place to promote your framework .
I like your blog posts too , but try to keep them separate .
Your comments on the bugs though , are great .
Frameworks should be beaten on by users .
Many times I miss little errors in my projects becuase I am too close to them .
An outside eye can really help .
Comment : # 16 j : what I was actually aiming at is that toJSONString ( ) and parseJSON ( ) are expected to be added in ECMA4 .
If you like to take the standards approach – as Dean is doing here with Base – that means that in order to have these ( near ) standard methods available in older ( now current ) browsers you probably need to prototype Object .
Another example : how would you ‘ backport ’ for instance the hasOwnProperty ( ) method to IE5 ?
Comment : # 17 @Tino – well some things are impossible .
Comment : # 18 “ 9 . Small is Better ”
You hit one of the points why I wrote jsPax .
A growing part of my js - code uses jQery and various plugins .
I had the options of make a huge bundle with all plugins and load it on every page , regardless if necessary .
That way the first visit to the web would be annoyingly slow .
make a smaller bundle for every page .
That makes the first page start up faster , but does not use the browser cache at all .
have quite a number of script tags in the head .
Only loads the scripts that are necessary and makes perfect use of browser cache .
With jsPax I usually have two script tags on a Page and still make perfect use of the browser cache .
BTW I can dynamically change the set of loaded libraries according to the content of the page .
That way I do n’t have to care if I change the HTML if the according script will be loaded .
Comment : # 19 [ … ]
Dean Edwards escreveu as regras para autores de bibliotecas JavaScript .
São regras que segundo ele , foram criadas para uso próprio , mas imagino que sirva para todos nós . [… ]
Comment : # 20 Although base is a different library as jQuery and has a different target audience , I still think that there should be more collaboration between you so as to give a really nice JS framework , avoid code duplication , etc .
Comment : # 21 I think you should add another two rules : 1 – test your code ( Mochikit seems pretty keen on this point )
2 – benchmark your code – speed optimization , stress testing , etc … I think the whole discussion about memory leaks apply here too .
On rules # 4 and # 5 : I must be the only person in the world who thinks forEach loops are bad =(

Dion Almaer wrote an interesting post today on Here ’s a quick excerptAs a library author you must keep up with the latest fashions .

Comment : # 24 11 + 7 pravidel pro psaní JavaScriptu Desatero rad pro psaní JavaScriptových kódů od Deana Edwardse ( s jedenácti body ) a sedmero dalších od Dustina Diaze
Comment : # 25 Dean , this is a very nice set of rules , and it is not pompous at all .
I would do great work if I was able to stick to just some of them , as I always have some memory leaks and over - extending is my specialty .
Thanks for the post , now I can see how many things I was doing wrong .
Comment : # 26 “ base2.DOM is really aimed at : teachers and students who are learning JavaScript and the DOM programmers , who are already familiar with JavaScript but do n’t want to learn a new API web standards zealots ” Dean
Your right im one of the students
And i fully agree with that what You say .
Comment : # 27 These are some great rules .
I totally agree with you on number 6 – Be Flexible , in my opinion it should be the most important rule and much more programmers should stick closely to it , including me .
It happened more than few times to me when I had to rewrite most of my code just to change one little behavior thing and that can be really frustrating .
So flexibility is a great thing if it can be achieved .
Comment : # 28
Are there any documents out there explaining a good way to lazy - load classes and utilities as needed ?
I am concerned with the size of my current js library ( one file ) growing with functions that are not necessarily needed on every single page that the library is included on .
Comment : # 29 Flexibility is a key to success .
I would make “ Be Flexible ” rule # 1 in this list .
Good luck with base2 Dean .
Regards , Marcus
Comment : # 30 I would reccomend that people who right JS libraries create different extensions , rather than stuff everything in one file , have the ability to extend it so you only have what you need , it is no good having some fuctions that will be rarely used in a website adding to the size of the file .
Have the ability to easy extend the library with files , as and when you need them .
I think this goes with rule 9 you mentioned , this will keep your code small , but still have the functionality to add different functions that you need I think that is a must have .
Do you know of the best way to allow extension inclusion ?
As in ways to load the extension files into the main core file .
Thanks for the guide Dean !
Comment : # 31 Nice , the tenth rule seems my favorite
Comment : # 32 Hi Dean , quite a nice collection of rules you have placed here .
But do n’t you think that in reality one is actually never able of keeping all rules at once ?
In my opinion everybody has to fix priorities and must find out which of the rules is the most important one for himself .
Rule Nr. 9 is very important for me .
It ’s difficult to understand why there are so many programmers who write that extremely exaggerated code .
There still exists a large of number of peoples who is only provided with a bad connection to the Internet and DSL is not yet very widespread .
Comment : # 33 2 . Object .
prototype is verboten !
=========================
I don´t know much about programming , nevertheless I sometimes stroll over pages like this , to get an impression and ideas . ( even without going deep into it , there are sometimes chances , and – what a luck – I have a programmer for such things .
But without understand a lot , I was smiling about using the german term “ verboten ” in relation to a seemingly strict “ order ” or recommendation about using a coding Please believe me : not everything in Germany is “ verboten ”
But if something is “ verboten ” – obey !
( ok , that ´s a little offtopic , just smile , as I did ! ) regards from sunny Munich , Germany Hans
Comment : # 34
Ha ha , I also studied German language in high school and I know that verboten is a really strong word !
Dean , cool rules collection , luckily not all of them are “ verboten ” so they can be bent a little , but if they were only a little bit respected they can be really helpful .
Comment : # 35 I love tenth rule – but thank you for whole list Greg
Comment : # 36 web standards zealots Yar !
Comment : # 37 Hi Dean ,
Thx for providing us rules for JavaScript library authors .

The current 1.2 development version of MooTools saw a promotion of the Hash Class up from a plugin to a Native type .
A Hash is basically a wrapper for native JavaScript Objects .
The reason it was created was because as we all know , the Object prototype is off limits !

So what can i do with this crazy new thing ? [… ]

Laura Bush is either getting top secret briefings on the situation in Iraq , or she 's a liar .
I think the public deserves to know which .
As Joe reported last night , the White House dragged Laura Bush out before the cameras , again , and as they always do when things are n't going well for them .
This time , Laura went on Larry King as an expert on Iraq policy .
Here 's what she had to say :
Many parts of Iraq are stable now .
But , uh , of course , what we see on television is the one bombing a day that discourages everyone .
Really ?
And how does the happy homemaker know this ?
How does Laura Bush know that many parts of Iraq are stable - and apparently she knows this through other sources that are NOT the media , since she informs us that the media is n't telling us the " real " story about Iraq .
So if Laura know the " real story " about Iraq , that is n't available to the public through the media , then Laura must be privvy to insider information about Iraq , classified information , and I 'd like to know why .
Because if she 's not being fed classified information that we are n't privvy to , then the woman is a liar .
And if Bush is going to use his wife to justify the biggest foreign policy disaster in decades , if not ever , then the public has the right to call her on her bullshit .
That ’s the only conclusion we at Truthdig can come to when faced with these facts :
Recruiters are increasingly admitting neo -Nazis and skinheads into the military , and the number of soldiers kicked out of the military for being gay rose 11 % over last year .
Also , allegations of harassment and outright crimes committed by military recruiters are up .
( story or .pdf report )
Southern Poverty Law Center :
Ten years after Pentagon leaders toughened policies on extremist activities by active duty personnel — a move that came in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing by decorated Gulf War combat veteran Timothy McVeigh and the murder of a black couple by members of a skinhead gang in the elite 82nd Airborne Division — large numbers of neo -Nazis and skinhead extremists continue to infiltrate the ranks of the world ’s best - trained , best - equipped fighting force .
Military recruiters and base commanders , under intense pressure from the war in Iraq to fill the ranks , often look the other way .
Neo - Nazis “ stretch across all branches of service , they are linking up across the branches once they ’re inside , and they are hard - core , ” Department of Defense gang detective Scott Barfield told the Intelligence Report .
“ We ’ve got Aryan Nations graffiti in Baghdad , ” he added .
“ That ’s a problem . ”

AP : … The Pentagon has said there were 726 military members discharged under the policy last year ?
up 11 percent from the year before ?
but did not publicly release base - specific information .

Reuters : Allegations of wrongdoing by U.S. military recruiters jumped by 50 percent from 2004 to 2005 , and criminal violations such as sexual harassment and falsifying documents more than doubled , a congressional agency said on Monday .
The Government Accountability Office , Congress ’ investigative agency , said the full extent of violations by military recruiters is unknown because the Defense Department does not have an oversight system .
While the GAO said available information likely underestimated the problem , it showed that allegations of recruiter wrongdoing increased to 6,600 cases in fiscal year 2005 from 4,400 a year earlier .

Drought - stricken Australia should heed a warning from a new study that shows a series of massive droughts killed giant kangaroos and other " megafauna " in south - east Queensland 40,000 years ago , according to researchers from the Queensland University of Technology .
Scientists Dr Gilbert Price and Dr Gregory Webb believe understanding how the prehistoric big dry caused extinctions could help predict how and if animals battling current climate change will survive .
The QUT research into the giant Australian marsupials and reptiles and the impact of climate change will be published in the December issue of the Australian Journal of Earth Sciences .
Dr Price and Dr Webb studied the fossil - rich Darling Downs area of south - east Queensland with the help of palaeontologists from the Queensland Museum and an amateur local fossil hunter , Ian Sobbe .
Dr Price said what the team unearthed showed that giant kangaroos and other large wildlife that roamed the area in the late Pleistocene age were drought - stressed when they died .
" What makes this research so relevant to climate change theories today is that the profile of the fossil kangaroo populations is identical to that of a modern drought - stressed kangaroo mob , " he said .
" It provides , for the first time , evidence which suggests that the megafauna kangaroos were greatly affected by a series of catastrophic droughts .
" These animals of the prehistoric Australian bush were the largest of their time and included gigantic wombats the size of cars , kangaroos that reached almost 2.5 metres tall , and massive emus and goannas .
" There 's nothing we can do now to save these animals - they 're all extinct .
" But if we can understand how those animals responded to the massive droughts and climate change events of the past , we might be able to go some way in predicting the effects of future climate changes and its impact on the way that we manage and conserve the precious habitats and wildlife of the Australian bush . "
Dr Price said the layers of fossils in the dig area at the Darling Downs were not consistent with some theories that humans had wiped out megafauna .
" Some scientists believe in the ' blitzkrieg ' megafauna extinction hypothesis which blames humans for over - hunting these giant marsupials , " he said .
" If that was the case , these fossils dating back thousands of years would show the animals dying out at the same point in time .
But they do n't .
These layers of fossils buried at a single site under the Darling Downs show a progressive , three - stage extinction over time that relates to periods of climate change . "
Dr Webb said the research had unearthed indicators that the Darling Downs had been a semi-arid environment 40,000 years ago , rather than sub-tropical or tropical .
" Sedimentological information shows that the Darling Downs was experiencing repeating cycles of wet and dry conditions , resulting in droughts and periodic flash flooding from storms , during the time when the megafauna populations were declining , " he said .
" The research found no evidence of humans being involved in the accumulation of fossils in the catchment at the time of deposition , but is perfectly consistent with their decline being caused by increasing aridity .
" So it 's most likely that Australia 's giant kangaroos and other megafauna in this area were driven to extinction by the hands of Mother Nature . "
Dr Price , who received his PhD this year for his research , and Dr Webb are both researchers with QUT 's School of Natural Resource Sciences and QUT 's Institute of Sustainable Resources .

Billions of pairs of disposable chopsticks are discarded each year
It produces about 45 billion pairs of chopsticks a year , consuming millions of trees and bamboo plants .
The move came as China said it would raise some consumption taxes next month in a bid to help the environment and narrow the gap between rich and poor .
Taxes on yachts , luxury watches , golf clubs , gas - guzzling cars and wooden floor panels are rising by 5 - 20 % .
" This is part of the government 's strategy of rebalancing growth and reducing energy demand , " said Ben Simpfendorfer , a strategist with the Royal Bank of Scotland in Hong Kong .
" The government wants to show that it is doing something to increase the tax burden on the richer segment of the population to reduce the widening disparity between the rich and poor . "
Reaction
The disposable splints of wood , usually between eight and 10 inches long , have long been a target for Chinese environmentalists .
School children have written to the Chinese prime minister asking for a ban on disposable wooden chopsticks , while students have persuaded some college cafeterias to replace them with spoons .
In recent years , the government has actually encouraged their use , in a bid to reduce the spread of infectious illnesses by sharing eating utensils .
Chinese diners are encouraged to bring their own chopsticks
Shanghai consumers gave a mixed response to the new tax .
" I think the shop owner should pay for it , " one person told the BBC .
" It 's no use , people will still throw it everywhere after they have their food and people will still buy disposable chopsticks , " was the view of another citizen who doubted if the tax would help protect the environment .
But others were in favour :
" It has some good impact .
It will make people buy less disposable products and buy more durable ones . "
Car tax
Many of the other tax increases are part of China 's attempts to curb the demand for luxury goods in its cities , which has expanded rapidly as the growing economy has drawn people in from rural areas .
Despite the rising incomes for many urban workers , an estimated 200 million Chinese still live on less than $ 1 a day each .
The government has raised the tax on cars with engines bigger than 2 litres from 8 % to 20 % , as it looks to reduce pollution and oil consumption .
Cars with smaller engines , between 1 and 1.5 litres , will have their taxes cut to 3 % from 5 % .
China is now the world 's third - biggest vehicle market after the US and Japan , and this has driven up its oil consumption .
Cars now account for one - third of China 's oil use .
Memorial for Leonard N. Zubkoff
by Richard P. Gabriel
( read at his memorial March 29 , 2003 )
Leonard was a modular manand given his relationship with computers there should be nothing surprising about this .
He kept pieces of himself in separate modules , separate compartments each different in some ways from the others , all of them sharing some common parts , and each one fully inhabited by the man we know as Leonard Zubkoff .
In this way he enacted his different selves :
Very few people who knew him as one persona knew him as another , and by doing this Leonard could make himself into the person he needed to be when he needed to .
I met him in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , in 1983 when I was working with some faculty members at Carnegie - Mellon University on a supercomputer project .
Like many major computer science schools back then , the department ’s large timesharing system could be accessed via dial - up , but at that time 9600 baud was high - speed , whereas today a fast dial - up connection is 48,000 baud , and it is not unusual for a home to have a 1.5 million baud connection .
At 9600 baud even text transmitted slowly , and at the remote end of the connection only a moderately stupid terminal was available not today ’s ubiquitous PCs .
Leonard had created a system in which the timeshared computer analyzed the text it was about to send for commonalities and patterns that could be used to send less computer data to create the same human - readable text at the other end .
Today we call techniques like this " compression , " but at that time compression was used only for reducing long - term storage for large files .
Most computer scientists then were sure that using an expensive timesharing system to compress text on the fly for transmission over a slow dialup was a waste of money and resources .
Leonard , somehow , knew better , and he constructed a system that used fewer resources because the effort expended finding patterns was more than compensated by the less work the system software had to do to send less data .
In the end , not only was it possible to work comfortably from home , but there was less stress on the timesharing system while doing so .
That was my first glimpse of Leonard ’s most prominent self the intellectual computer expert to whom the workings of our most advanced technologies were as transparent as a hike up a low mountain is to the rest of us .
But this was n’t my only introduction to Leonard .
I do n’t know what I expected the first time I saw him .
I had seen plenty of computer wizards but they were all long - haired and seemed dark to me they worked late at night and almost till dawn each day , they had pasty skin and poor hygiene , they wore long pants and were serious in a despondent way , as if the rigors of battle against the inflexible computer were too much for you see , though each of these other computer programmers was successful , each success was at the end of a long exchange with the computer in which the computer declared victory after victory over the programmer ’s bug - infused programs .
Leonard walked into my office at CMU laughing over some joke or remark he made or heard in the hallway .
He had short hair and a difficult beard .
He wore a shortsleeved shirt with thin stripes running around him like barrel hoops .
He wore light blue shorts , black stockings , and what looked to be Hush Puppies .
He said something like , " well , you must be the famous Dick Gabriel .
I ’m Leonard Zubkoff . "
Later we went with some folks to a hamburger joint perhaps the Oakland Original where I started to learn the ways of Leonard Zubkoff .
He spoke precisely , with an intelligence born both of the confidence he had in his intellect and the deep pools of knowledge he had accumulated in broad swatches .
I do n’t know what he ordered though I ’m certain it was n’t pork but he ordered it prepared according to exact directions , and when it arrived , he placed his cutlery and china precisely in relation to each other and to himself .
As he prepared to address his meal he noticed me wielding a bottle of luscious red Heinz ketchup .
I had been whapping its bottom like a doctor jump - starting a newborn , shaking it upside down like a cartoon character trying to shake loose the last of someone ’s loose change , and was likely about to start swinging it like Barry Bonds aiming for McCovey Cove over the right - field wall when Leonard said , " here , allow me . "
" You need to hold the bottle at a shallow angle to allow air to flow in behind the ketchup as it flows out .
Then you tap the bottle lightly on the side to loosen it . "
Ketchup flowed out smoothly onto the mass of fries I had ordered and he said , " here , why do n’t you try ? "
That evening we went to his place where I met his wife Jan .
It was a typical grad student house overfilled with grad student stuff , but at one end of the living room were two 8 - foot tall flat panel speakers with speaker wires about the size of my thumbs winding their way to a bank of electronics .
" Electro - static speakersvery linear , " was what Leonard said .
As I left he pointed out his Alfa Romeo with its precise handling though it was n’t that fast , he told me .
This was my introduction to Leonard Zubkoff ’s many modules of interest and expertise .
He loved people and rarely found harsher faults with them except for their acting " suboptimally " at times ; he loved women perhaps for the strangeness of their ways and mannerisms but certainly for the warmth of their companionship and the way their needs could be answered by his gifts .
He shared easily and helped often even when the help was needed to rescue someone from their own ineptness .
In 1985 when I was founding my company , Lucid , I immediately thought of Leonard as one of my main technical guys and his wife Jan as my office manager .
I flew to Pittsburgh to talk to them and they agreed , though Leonard wanted to finish his PhD .
He said all he had to do was write up what he had and he should be out within a month or two .
Jan came out early .
Leonard had trouble finishing , and we decided he would come out and finish while working at Lucid .
He never did finish , and I ’ve often wondered why .
He certainly worked hard enough , and was smart enough .
Perhaps the messiness of writing a dissertation was not suited to his neat mind .
Perhaps his faculty advisors were n’t able to see the brilliance in the anti-tradeoff he had discovered maybe to them it was just a neat hack , but it defied not only the common sense but the deep mastery of the day , and nowadays , the approach he invented is used in every corner of the Internet .
But I did n’t care because I had him .
He joined what I still think was the most elite software development team Silicon Valley has ever witnessed , and he and just one or two others were its cream .
We created what everyone said could not be created a compiler - based software - only implementation of a programming language widely known to require special hardware to run reasonably , and our implementation was portable with almost the push of a button to nearly any hardware and operating system platform .
Leonard was at the center of many of the innovations Lucid created .
He was a manager ’s dream :
He told you exactly what it would take to get the job done , and on the day promised it would be delivered .
He wanted the best , and he thought of himself as the best .
His only complaint to me was to make sure his compensation was what it deserved to be in the company he never talked about the higher salaries available elsewhere nor did he ever threaten to quit .
He was n’t a founder , but soon he had as many stock options as anyone in the company and I often told him he’d be the one to turn off the lights if things went bad .
Leonard ’s spirit was generous , Unlike many technical wizards , Leonard did n’t use the extremes of his intelligence to belittle or humiliate others .
Though he never said it to me , I came to understand that he let people be who they were , and he recognized that a person could do only what he or she could do .
In every picture of him I ’ve ever seen , he ’s smiling .
His best look : amusement .
During the first year of Lucid ’s life , I was trying to be both its president and a technical person .
I even volunteered to do part of the implementation the memory manager .
I had written one before , and I thought it would be easy .
But I was also mindful of the fact that the implementation had to be easily portable to many different operating systems with different memory management policies .
I had just finished a project where the motto seemed to be " why use lead when gold will do , " and so I created a science - fiction - type design and embarked on the implementation .
At the same time , I was negotiating OEM deals , running a brand - new company , meeting with reporters and analysts , trying to keep the venture capitalists happy , and maintaining a high profile outside the company , which was part of our allure .
I really could only get work done late at night , starting around 10 pm after a business day that started at 8 am and went until 6 or 7 pm .
I made a mess of the implementation .
It was in a hopeless state in which it sort of worked and sort of did n’t .
We had promised our Board a demonstration of the system to take place in two weeks , and I was hosed .
Leonard walked into my " office area " and asked if I ’d like some help .
He looked at the design and said it was clever and could work , but it would likely take too long to figure out what my implementation was doing wrong .
He suggested a quick and dirty approach suitable for a Unix - style memory manager and that we postpone the real thing until we needed it for a more sophisticated operating system .
We sketched a new design on a whiteboard and wrote down some invariants and started to code .
At least , I ’d like to think we sketched the design I think he came up with it , but he lead me through it in such a way that I thought I was contributing .
Even with his simple design , it took both of us each working 180 hours over those two weeks to get it working well enough for the demo .
That was 1985 .
That Lisp system is still in use , having won some awards along the way , and that same memory manager is still the one it uses , though a clever ephemeral collector was grafted onto it .
We were saved by the fact that a more sophisticated operating system than Unix never became popular .
That and endurance .
Leonard loved endurance , and endurance came from quality .
Not quality to show off , but quality for the purpose of excellence .
The two 8 - foot tall electro - static speakers have been replaced by two one - foot - tall ones sitting like munchkins on 3 - foot pedestals in Crystal Bay , Nevada .
Leonard ’s technical work was his Apollonian sideserene , rational , and self - disciplined .
Apollo was the god of light , order , and sanity ; Dionysius was the god of darkness , chaos , and insanity .
While Apollo behaved himself and expected everyone to do so as well , Dionysius was the ribald deity who devoted himself to music and revelry .
Most people learn to strike a balance between their Apollonian and Dionysian sides , often by integrating them into a mellow whole .
Leonard fought to understand these aspects of himself and temporarily solved the problem by creating modules little boxes for each of his interests where he could dial in how much like Apollo , how much like Dionysius he could be .
Each box encompassed a mostly separate set of friends .
Leonard was a technologist and scientist , but he also was into music , good food , fast cars , helicopters , science fiction , Filk , clear - voiced female singers , hearty physical relationships , hiking , kayaking , witchcraft , spirituality , the future , Linux , and long , long life .
He was an optimist , a lover of life , he smiled all the time except when he was concentrating on hard work , alone at the keyboard , struggling to be again the best at what he was best at .
My favorite Leonard story has to do with his Apollonian and Dionysian sides battling on a technological battlefield .
Lucid had been granted an important contract by IBM to port our software onto a secret computer system they were about to announce .
Through the complexity of contract negotiations , we had a nearly impossible schedule to meet .
And IBM being IBM , they decided to withhold from us a crucial piece of software the symbolic debugger .
I wo n’t explain what it is in detail , but it is a medium - sized program whose proper operation depends on its implementor having a detailed understanding of the innermost aspects of a computer .
Normally it takes a team of 2 programmers 36 months to write a commercial quality debugger .
As its name suggests , it helps other programmers find the errorsor bugs in their programs .
IBM did n’t supply one because then we would know the name of the company that created it .
We needed one pronto .
I was sitting out on Lucid ’s second - floor porch with Jan when Leonard came out as I had requested .
He wore a shortsleeved shirt with thin stripes running around him like barrel hoops .
He wore light blue shorts , black stockings , and what looked to be Hush Puppies .
He had been given control of the project .
It was mid-afternoon on a Friday in early Spring , as I recall , and already the project had had some fits and starts .
I had asked Leonard how long it would take him to implement a good - enough symbolic debugger and this is when he would tell me .
How Lucid fared depended on his answer , because I knew he was always dead - on with estimates .
Two weeks .
Apollo had spoken .
Where were the chaos - bringers , the sweeteners of sense , the light - bearers , the disturbers of good order ?
I turned to Jan. Jan , do you remember Jeff Rubin ?
We can hire him as a consultant to do this .
Leonard , Rubin was on the S1 project back in 1978 .
He is a code - writing savant .
I watched him write an emulator for the S1 computer in 4 days .
The S1 was a complex instruction set , 16 - processor machine with over 4000 instructions including matrix multiply and FFT , 32 non-regular registers , and dozens of addressing modes .
He wrote the 60,000 line program in PDP - 10 assembly language in 4 days .
He debugged it for half a day and 30 people used it every day for 6 years and never found a bug .
He wrote the optimizing assembler for it immediately after 40,000 lines in 3 days , a few hours of debugging and no bugs found in 6 years .
[ This is writing code as fast as a person can type it in . ]
Let ’s hire Rubin .
So let ’s see , he does n’t know the RT PC at all , so an hour to learn the machine , instruction set , and Unix operating system .
He does n’t know the programming language C , so 15 minutes for that .
Two hours to type in the code , an hour to debug it .
Let ’s round that up to a day , double it for safety .
What do you think , $ 2000 a day ?
Jan wrote down the details .
The day was cloudless and perfect .
A warm breeze blew over the freshly mowed lawn and up to the porch .
I squinted my eyes to look toward the ridge where the sun was going down behind it a mound of white fog was humping up .
Leonard said , " hmmm , let ’s talk on Monday . "
Monday he told me , " here is your debugger . "
Dionysius , the risk taker .
The ecstatic in Leonard could not deny the challenge .
His inner critic could not stand up to the challenge Jeff Rubin ’s story provided .
Jeff Rubin is real , and so is his story .
I ’m here to tell you , so is Leonard Zubkoff .
Last Fall Jan and I drove up to Crystal Bay so she could run some errands at Leonard ’s house there .
Since Lucid collapsed about 10 years ago , I had seen Leonard only sporadically , and I thought I could find some trace of him there .
We walked into his third - floor entryway common for homes built on the sides of hills .
While Jan fussed with her errands , I wandered the upper floor .
Glass sculptures with several layers of glass , multiple gathers , layers of color frit and overlays , wraps , and pick ups of dichromatic glass .
Hand - crafted Purpleheart and madrone dining room table , chairs , and buffet .
A gourmet kitchen including the de rigueur Viking stovetop and SubZero refrigerator , separate wine coolers for red and white , an ice - maker , and several ovens .
And along one whole wall , floor - to - ceiling windows looking through a sparse stand of firs onto Crystal Bay , Lake Tahoe .
Tahoe , like Santa Fe and Asheville , North Carolina , is one of the most spiritual places for American Indians .
I ran my fingers across his boxed collection of C.S. Lewis .
I flipped through his book of Black blues masters .
In the garage , unopened boxes of Calphalon cookware and Henckels knives were stacked .
His king - sized bed dwelled in the middle of the master suite .
All the Farscape DVDs were neatly lined up in the walk - in closet .
The Adobe Font Folio sat on the bottom shelf of a Steelcase cabinet .
The walls of his office were lined with outlets .
The sauna was colder inside than the adjacent guest quarters .
Leonard was a man of modules , each one separate , each equally inhabited by Leonard as he moved from one to the other just as I walked from room to room , trying to find him through his tastes .
Walking from room to room .
Trying to find him .
Let ’s follow the laughter .
The documents also show how Britain made hundreds of shipments to Israel of material which could have helped in its nuclear weapons programme , including compounds of uranium , lithium , beryllium and tritium , as well as heavy water .
Israel asked Britain in 1966 to supply 10 mg of plutonium .
Israel would have required almost 5 kg of plutonium to build an atomic bomb , but British defence intelligence officials warned that 10mg had " significant military value " and could enable the Jewish state to carry out important experimental work to speed up its nuclear weapons programme .
Documents show that the decision to sell plutonium to Israel in 1966 was blocked by officials in both the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office , who said : " It is HMG 's policy not to do anything which would assist Israel in the production of nuclear weapons . "
But the deal was forced through by a Jewish civil servant , Michael Michaels , in Tony Benn 's Ministry of Technology , which was responsible for trade in nuclear material , according to Newsnight .
Peter Kelly , who was British defence intelligence 's expert on the Israeli nuclear weapons programme , knew Mr Michaels .
He told Newsnight he believed Mr Michaels knew that Israel was trying to build an atomic bomb , but that he had dual loyalties to Britain and Israel .
Mr Benn told the programme that civil servants in his department kept the deals secret from him and his predecessor , Frank Cousins .
He had always suspected that civil servants were doing deals behind his back , but he never thought they would sell plutonium to Israel .
He told Newsnight : " I 'm not only surprised , I 'm shocked .
It never occurred to me they would authorise something so totally against the policy of the government .
" Michaels lied to me , I learned by bitter experience that the nuclear industry lied to me again and again . "
He thought Wilson may not have known that Britain was helping Israel to get the bomb .
Last year Newsnight showed that in the late 1950s Harold Macmillan 's Conservative government provided Israel with 20 tonnes of heavy water to start up its Dimona reactor .
Newsnight said it learned that Jack Straw had admitted to the Liberal Democrat leader , Sir Menzies Campbell , that Britain knew the heavy water was destined for Israel , and that in 1961 , Macmillan even made a failed attempt to get it back .
Nearly every organism has developed its own mechanism to cope with starvation or reduce food availability , whether for hours or months .
In the arctic winter , penguins and polar bears store up huge amounts of fat but stay active .
Hibernators such as squirrels and groundhogs fatten up for the winter then lower their metabolism by sleeping off .
But desert snakes do n't display any such outward manifestation that might hint at how they manage to survive blistering summers while remaining relatively active .
Presenting a paper in an American Physiological Society session at Experimental Biology 2006 , Marshall McCue notes that " birds , fish and mammals including humans have been studied in terms of food - deprivation , but surprisingly , the desert snakes have n't been studied in this regard considering that in the wild they 'll go for up to two years without food .
So McCue carefully studied 16 diamond - back rattlesnakes for 168 days , nearly 5 ½ months .
* Paper presentation : " Characterizing the starvation syndrome in the western diamond - back rattlesnake , a species well - suited to tolerate long - term fasting , " 12:30 p.m.- 3 p.m. Monday April 3 , APS Physiological Ecology & Evolutionary Physiology Section 492.4 / board # C769 .
Research was by Marshall D. McCue , Department of Biology , University of Arkansas , Fayetteville .
First McCue came up with the phrase " starvation syndrome " to reflect the whole range of physiological coping mechanisms that the snakes employ .
" Perhaps the greatest adaptation in this species is their ability to reduce energy expenditures by an average of 80 % over 168 days of starvation , " McCue said .
In addition to slowing down to conserve energy , McCue found that the snakes " chiefly ' fed ' on their energy - rich lipid stores .
The continual conversion of internal protein by these snakes into carbohydrates prevented glucose ' crashes ' similar to those that can result from diabetic conditions in humans , " he noted .
Another surprising finding was that despite literally eating themselves from within , the snakes actually grew over the 5 ½ months of starvation .
Earlier reports on some starving reptiles said they actually shrank , but McCue found in this study of 16 diamond - backs – as well as another with rat snakes , but not pythons – measured growth .
" This supports the long - standing hypothesis that a snake 's length correlates with physiological fitness , " McCue said .
But beyond that and more .
In a sense , he says , even though the snake 's mass is shrinking , as it must although it 's increasing its own water content probably to maintain cellular shape , " it is n't panicking .
Another line of evidence is the increased amount of relative calcium , which in fact doubled over the experiment .
Because it takes more energy to grow than to eat yourself , the snake changes shape by reducing its girth and putting its resources into skeletal muscles and bone . "
Among the many other metabolic changes , McCue pointed to an increase in fatty acids in the snakes .
But as time went on , " the fatty acids became less saturated and they became polyunsaturated because in addition to beta-oxidation , they 're undergoing some really dramatic changes as enzymes ' pick off ' bits of hydrogen for energy . "
In addition to the possible diabetes implications , McCue believes that all these metabolic changes point to ideas on " how we might be able to engineer diet so animals , and say humans in space , can tolerate food - deprivation better .
Probably we can't do that with amino acid manipulation , but perhaps with fatty acids , " he said .
Another place where reduced food intake is vital , he adds , is in some post - operative recuperation where food intake needs to be strictly controlled .
Property Paranoia
Wealth is beginning to reduce our freedoms
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 31st January 2006 .
A few days ago , after a furious argument , I was thrown out of a wood where I have walked for over 20 years .
I must admit that I did not behave very well .
As I walked away I did something I have n’t done for a long time : I gave the gamekeeper a one - fingered salute .
In my defence I would plead that I was overcome with unhappiness and anger .
The time I have spent in that wood must amount to months .
Every autumn I would spend days there , watching the turning colours or grubbing for mushrooms and beechmast and knapped flints .
In the summer I would look for warblers and redstarts .
I saw a nightjar there once .
It was one of the few peaceful and beautiful places in my part of the world that ’s within a couple of miles of a station : I could escape from the traffic without the help of a car .
Part of me , I feel , belongs there .
Or it did .
It is not that I was n’t trespassing before .
Nor has the status of the land changed : it is still owned , as far as I know , by the same private estate .
No one tried to stop me in those 20 - odd years because no one was there .
But now there is a blue plastic barrel every 50 yards , and the surrounding fields are planted with millet and maize .
The wood has been turned into a pheasant run .
Having scarcely figured in the landowner ’s books , it must now be making him a fortune .
And I am perceived as a threat .
The words that rang in my ears as I stomped away were these .
“ You ’ve got your bloody right to roam now – why do you need to come here ? ”
It struck me that this could be a perverse outcome of the legislation for which I spent years campaigning : that the right to walk in certain places is seen by landowners as consolidating their relations with the public .
All that is not permitted will become forbidden .
But this , I expect , is a secondary problem .
The more important one is surely the surge of money foaming through the south - east of England .
A thousand woods can be filled with pheasants and still there are not enough to serve the people who have the money required – the many hundreds of pounds a day – to shoot them .
We were told that the rising tide would lift all boats .
But I feel I am drowning in it .
Two weeks ago , writing in the Financial Times , the economist Andrew Oswald observed that “ the hippies , the Greens , the road protesters , the downshifters , the slow - food movement – all are having their quiet revenge .
Routinely derided , the ideas of these down - to - earth philosophers are being confirmed by new statistical work by psychologists and economists .
” (1) As I qualify on most counts , I will regard this as a vindication .
Oswald ’s point is that the industrialised countries have not become happier as they ’ve become richer .
Rates of depression and stress have risen , and people report no greater degree of satisfaction with their lives than their poorer ancestors did .
In the United States , the sense of well - being has actually declined .
One of the problems is that “ humans are creatures of comparison … it is relative income that matters : when everyone in a society gets wealthier , average well - being stays the same . ” ( 2 )
The same point has been made recently by the New Economics Foundation ( 3 ) and by Professor Richard Layard , in his book Happiness ( 4 ) .
New developments in both psychological testing and neurobiology allow happiness to be measured with greater confidence than before .
Layard cites research which suggests that it peaked in the United Kingdom in 1975 .
Beyond a certain degree of wealth – an average GDP of around $ 20,000 per head – “ additional income is not associated with extra happiness ” .
Once a society ’s basic needs and comforts have been met , there is no point in becoming richer .
I am astonished by the astonishment with which their findings have been received .
Compare , for example , these two statements :
“ So one secret of happiness is to ignore comparisons with people who are more successful than you are : always compare downwards , not upwards . ” Richard Layard , 2005 ( 5 ) .
“ It put me to reflecting , how little repining there would be among mankind , at any condition of life , if people would rather compare their condition with those that are worse , in order to be thankful , than be always comparing them with those which are better , to assist their murmurings and complainings . ”
Daniel Defoe , 1719 ( 6 ) .
We have been led , by the thinking of people like the psychologist John B. Watson and the economist Lionel Robbins , to forget what everyone once knew : that wealth and happiness are not the same thing .
Comparison is not the only reason the professors of happiness cite for our failure to feel better as we become richer .
They point to the fact that we become habituated to wealth : Layard calls this “ the hedonic treadmill ” .
They blame the longer hours we work and our deteriorating relationships .
But there is something I think they have missed : that wealth itself can become a source of deprivation .
Having money enhances your freedom .
You can travel further and you can do more when you get there .
But other people ’s money restricts your freedom .
Where you once felt free , now you find fences .
In fact , you MUST travel further to find somewhere in which you can be free .
As people become richer , and as they can extract more wealth from their property , other people become more threatening to them .
We know that the fear of crime is a cause of unhappiness , but so is the sense of being seen as a potential criminal .
The spikes and lights and cameras proclaim that society is not to be trusted , that we live in a world of Hobbesian relations .
The story they tell becomes true , as property paranoia makes us hate each other .
The harmless wanderer in the woods becomes a mortal enemy .
It is hard to see how that plague of pheasants could be deemed to have caused a net increase in happiness .
A group of very wealthy people , who already have an endless choice of activities , have one more wood in which to shoot .
The rest of us have one less wood in which to walk .
The landowners tell us that by putting down birds they have an incentive to preserve the woods – this was one of the arguments the gamekeeper used as he was throwing me off .
But what good does that do us if we are not allowed to walk there ?
The Countryside and Rights of Way Act of 2000 , which granted us the right to roam on mountains , moors , heath , downland and commons , has surely increased the sum of human happiness .
But in those parts of the country which retain very little habitat of that kind ( because it has been destroyed or enclosed by the landowners ) , the gains we made then might already have been cancelled out by the losses , as the landlords ’ new opportunities for making money reduce our opportunities for leaving money behind .
We need the full set of rights we were once promised , and which , in Scotland , have already been granted : access to the woods , the rivers and the coast as well as the open country .
But as these places are turned into money - making monocultures , the question changes .
Will we still want to visit them ?

The Department of Homeland Security released long - delayed requirements for the standardization of state identification documents Thursday .
States must start issuing the new internal passports by May 2008 , or else their citizens will not be able to board planes or enter federal courthouses .
Civil libertarians say the requirement , known as the REAL ID Act , creates a national identity card that presents significant privacy risks to Americans .
Many states oppose the rule as an unfunded mandate and an encroachment on states rights .
UPDATE : Full Wired News story here .
The regulations are complex , ranging from the kinds of documents required to get a license , how states databases will interact , the required elements on a compliant I.D. document 's face , how states need to store copies of your breeder documents , and how states can attempt to deal with homeless people and other cases , such as judges , police officers and victims of domestic violence and stalking .
Full regulations here ( .pdf ) .
DHS explanation here .
While some expected Homeland Security to require the licenses to have smart cards or RFID chips , DHS instead proposes a 2D bar code ( magnetic stripe ) similiar to those used on many licenses .
That information will not be encrypted .
DHS estimates that it will take only 44 minutes for a current driver 's license holder to get a certified copy of their birth certificate , travel to the DMV and get a new license when it expires .
No current driver 's license holder will be allowed to renew a license by mail .
They estimate the costs to states and individuals over 10 years will be $ 23 billion .
Congress may move to negate this ruling by repealing the Act or reverting to an earlier process .
27 b would love to hear your analysis of the regs .
UPDATE 1:40 pm : Reader EJ rightly points out in the comments that today 's proposed rules allow states to apply for an extension until January 1 , 2010 .
And there are bills in Congress that could make all of these regulations useless .
UPDATE 2 : 9:40 am PST Friday :
The machine readable spec is not the mag stripe that I indicated .
Instead , what is proposed is a 2D barcode spec known as PDF417 .
This is already widely used on state identification documents .
Thanks to reader Jordan for the correction .

I 'm tasked with busting some " Old West " myths .
And we 're light in the idea department on this one .
Now we 've already done a whole bunch of sharpshooting myths , and gunslinger myths , and they still want more !
I 'm asking the hive mind : are there any myths you can think of regarding cowboys or indians or anything to do with the old west .
( cue black humor about the donner party etc. )
All suggestions taken seriously .
Mostly .
Mythbusting Question : can you help me find inspiration in the old west ?
My favorite war movies are the ones where people  soldiers or civilians  escape from a prison camp or a concentration camp .
I saw The Great Escape when it first came out in 1963 , and have seen it at least five times since .
I still remember my mother , as soon as we got home from the movie , playing the theme song on the piano .
I missed Von Ryan ’s Express when it first came out , but I ’ve seen it on TV , in whole or in part , more than a dozen times since .
My second - favorite escape movie is Escape From Sobibor , which is about civilians , mainly Jews , escaping from a Nazi concentration camp .
Part of what makes it so compelling is that in the last few minutes , as the prisoners escape , the action freezes on a person or couple every few seconds , and the narrator , the late Howard K. Smith of TV - news fame , tells us where those people live now  some in Israel , some in New York , some in Los Angeles , etc .
That makes the escape so real because it reminds us that this movie is about real human beings .
My all - time favorite escape movie is Schindler ’s List .
What I like about escape war movies is , well , the escape .
In the usual war movie , even when I ’m cheering for the Allies , I remember that that poor German soldier was probably drafted and was probably about as innocent as the American or British soldier .
But in escape movies , the people escaping are mainly trying to save themselves and are n’t trying to kill others , except those who prevent them .
I thought of all this while watching Fox News Channel journalists Steve Centanni and Olaf Wiig being interviewed by Greta van Susteren on Aug. 29 .
They recounted how they were freed by some Palestinian kidnappers after almost two weeks of captivity in Gaza .
I know that writers on Antiwar.com rarely mention Fox News without criticizing it , but what I saw on Aug. 29 was a wonderful human hour .
Reporter Centanni and cameraman
Wiig described how they were captured and treated , and told of the range of emotions they went through  fear of being murdered , hope that people on the outside were working to free them , and elation at finally being freed .
My heart went out to them .
Here they were  totally innocent people just doing their job , which was simply to report on Palestinians in Gaza .
Yet they were kidnapped by some pretty nasty people .
Whenever an innocent person is freed , I feel elation .
One of the best parts of the one - hour show was the interview with Wiig ’s wife , Anita McNaught , a reporter for a New Zealand television station .
McNaught is truly an impressive woman .
At the time her husband was kidnapped , she was in Damascus .
As soon as she heard , she hurried to Gaza and took charge .
McNaught recounted :
" But , basically you ’re after a number of things .
You need to find information out about where he might be , who might have him , and then find out the why .
And , in finding out the why , perhaps you find an answer to how to get him out .
" You ’re trying to take the cultural temperature , you know .
Is hostage taking a popular thing or an unpopular thing ?
What ’s the public mood ?
Is there going to be a way that you can get the public on [ your ? ] side in some way to get pressure applied from behind , if you like , to release him ?
" You ’re looking to find sympathetic people who will go beyond what is safe or normal for them to take you to information that might find them .
And , in addition , you ’re trying to get some kind of reassurance or message to the guys who are in there and you do n’t know what they ’re going to find out from it . "
Notice that McNaught made distinctions among individuals .
She did n’t say , " Oh , those horrible Palestinians . "
Instead she realized that she needed information so that she could distinguish the horrible ones  the kidnappers and those who supported them  from the good ones  those who were against the kidnapping .
And her quest was rewarded .
McNaught continued :
" Gazans came to us and said , ‘ We ’re appalled by this . ’
" They came to us as individuals .
They came to us as mothers and wives of prisoners in Israeli jails .
And they came to us as journalists .
And they came to us as politicians .
There was n’t anyone we met who did n’t think this was disastrous . "
Similarly , Fox News correspondent Jennifer Griffin got involved from the start , talking to Palestinians and asking them to get cooperation from locals so that they could identify the kidnappers .
On the Aug. 31 episode of Hannity and Colmes , Griffin told how her and her team ’s careful intelligence work paid off .
They were finally able to determine who had done the kidnapping and communicate this fact to the various other Palestinian factions .
This gave them leverage over various powerful Palestinians , who then persuaded or threatened the kidnappers to release the hostages .
So not just McNaught of New Zealand television , but also Griffin of Fox , made distinctions among individuals .
Why do I emphasize this ?
Because so many of the reporters and commentators on Fox News lump together everyone in a particular country and attribute to them the characteristics they do n’t like about some of the people in that country .
I ca n’t count the number of times I ’ve heard Fox News analysts Fred Barnes or Mort Kondracke , for example , talk about " the French " with a supercilious sneer , as if all French people are cowards who just want to appease militant Islam .
Why did Griffin and other Fox employees in the Middle East make distinctions among Palestinians ?
Because the stakes were so high .
Fox had two employees , two flesh - and - blood human beings whom they cared about , whose lives were in danger .
With such huge stakes , Griffin et al. made the careful distinctions that needed to be made .
How , you might ask , could two lives be such a big stake when thousands of other lives in the Middle East , those of Palestinians , Iraqis , U.S. soldiers , and British soldiers , do n’t seem to be a big stake ?
That does n’t make sense , does it ?
Actually , and unfortunately , it does .
The Fox News people cared about their employees and colleagues and acted accordingly .
But they do n’t care nearly as much , understandably , about strangers  even if many strangers are in danger and if some of those strangers are Americans .
Thus , we often get the sloppy analysis of the stakes in Iraq or in the Middle East in general , rather than the focused careful analysis that Anita McNaught and Jennifer Griffin engaged in when their loved ones and colleagues were at risk .
If you think I ’m exaggerating , ask yourself this .
Imagine you ’re an innocent person captured by a Middle Eastern group .
What would you prefer to be : an employee of Fox News , a random Palestinian , or a random U.S. soldier ?
If you ’ve answered that you ’d opt to be a Fox News employee , you ’ve said that you trust your employer more than you trust , among others , the U.S. government .
Me too .
So does it really make sense to put the U.S. government in a position where it has power over not two people , but , instead , millions of people ?

The newfound python carved from stone in a cave in the Tsodilo Hills of Botswana contained more than 400 indentations that could only have been made by humans .
A startling discovery of 70,000 - year - old artifacts and a python 's head carved of stone appears to represent the first known human rituals .
Scientists had thought human intelligence had not evolved the capacity to perform group rituals until perhaps 40,000 years ago .
But inside a cave in remote hills in Kalahari Desert of Botswana , archeologists found the stone snake [ image ] that was carved long ago .
It is as tall as a man and 20 feet long .
" You could see the mouth and eyes of the snake .
It looked like a real python , " said Sheila Coulson of the University of Oslo .
" The play of sunlight over the indentations gave them the appearance of snake skin .
At night , the firelight gave one the feeling that the snake was actually moving . "
The bigger surprise
More significant , when Coulson and her colleagues dug a test pit near they stone figure , they found spearheads made of stone that had to have been brought to the cave from hundreds of miles away [ image ] .
The spearheads were burned in what only could be described as some sort of ritual , the scientists conclude .
" Stone age people took these colorful spearheads , brought them to the cave , and finished carving them there , " Coulson said today .
" Only the red spearheads were burned .
It was a ritual destruction of artifacts .
There was no sign of normal habitation .
No ordinary tools were found at the site . "
The discovery was made in a remote region of Botswana called Tsodilo Hills , the only uplifted area for miles around .
It is known to modern Sanpeople as the " Mountains of the Gods " and the " Rock that Whispers . "
Their legend has it that mankind descended from the python , and the ancient , arid streambeds around the hills are said to have been created by the python as it circled the hills in its ceaseless search for water .
That legend made the discovery of the stone python all the more amazing .
" Our find means that humans were more organized and had the capacity for abstract thinking at a much earlier point in history than we have previously assumed , " Coulson said .
" All of the indications suggest that Tsodilo has been known to mankind for almost 100,000 years as a very special place in the pre-historic landscape . "
Yet another surprise
The scientists found a secret chamber behind the python carving .
Worn areas indicate it 's been used over the years .
" The shaman , who is still a very important person in San culture , could have kept himself hidden in that secret chamber , " Coulson explained .
" He would have had a good view of the inside of the cave while remaining hidden himself .
When he spoke from his hiding place , it could have seemed as if the voice came from the snake itself .
The shaman would have been able to control everything .
It was perfect . ”
The shaman could also have made himself disappear from the chamber by crawling out onto the hillside through a small shaft , the scientists found .
Paintings in the cave appear to support part of modern San mythology .
While cave paintings are common in the Tsodilo Hills , inside the python cave there are just two small paintings , of an elephant and a giraffe .
The images were painted at the exact spot where water runs down the wall .
One San story has the python falling into water , unable to get out .
It 's saved by the giraffe .
The elephant , with its long trunk , is often a metaphor for the python in San mythology .
" In the cave , we find only the San people ’s three most important animals : the python , the elephant , and the giraffe , " Coulson said .
" That is unusual .
This would appear to be a very special place .
They did not burn the spearheads by chance .
They brought them from hundreds of kilometers away and intentionally burned them .
So many pieces of the puzzle fit together here .
It has to represent a ritual . "
Lost Remote have a post up on a blogger , called Spocko , who criticized a Disney owned radio station for â€œits ultra - right - wing commenteryâ€ .
The radio station , KSFO , have branded themselves with The News And Views You Wonâ€™t Hear Anywhere Else , which the following quote from Lost Remote sure proves ( more over at Spockoâ€™s Brain ) :
( For example , the hosts demanded that callers mock Islam , called for public hangings of New York Times editor Bill Keller and suggested that a Searsâ€™ Diehard battery be attached to an African - Americanâ€™s testicles . )
Spocko recorded and published sound clips from the radio show in question , which got the Disney lawyers fired up and landed Spocko host Blogger with cease - and - desist orders .
The blog is still up though .
Sure , Spocko is probably breaking the law by putting up audio clips to prove his point , but Disney is making a huge mistake pulling out like this .
The negative impact it has on the company for giving room to the radio show hostsâ€™ political incorrect opinions is one thing , but then standing up for them by taking their side is a PR nightmare to say the least .
Iâ€™m not impressed , but then again Disney hasnâ€™t been giving me good vibes in a long , long time .

How to Remove Tourists from Your Photos
Taking the Photos
The technique I will describe here applies to photos you have yet to take .
Unfortunately , there is no single easy way to get rid of people in the shots you already have .
But instead of agonizing over long clone - stamping sessions , you can take shots that will yield vacant sites with only minimal PhotoShop work .
To start , you ’ll want to be taking your photos with a tripod .
A remote release or timer will also help ( it will minimize the possibility that you may inadvertently move your camera between shots ) .
You will also want to shoot using manual settings .
As the scene changes , your camera meter may change your exposure values and that will make your PhotoShop work more difficult .
At busy sites , once you have composed your shot , you will find there is no end of tourist flow through your frame .
You may find yourself quickly giving up on an image because you know that as soon as one group of visitors starts leaving , another will soon take its place .
You might get lucky and everyone will flee the scene , but if you are short on time and / or patience , you may not be able to hold out forever .
The trick is , with your tripod - mounted camera , you can take your shot with people in it .
Then , once people have moved a bit , you can take a second photo .
As an example , look at this photo I took at the ruins of Ta Prohm in Cambodia near Angkor Wat :
A lot of tourists loitering in the scene do n’t make for such a great photo of a place that evokes imagery of explorers discovering a long - lost ruin .
But with a little patience , I was able to get another shot of the scene with fewer people :
What ’s important to note in this scene is where the tourists are and where they are not :
Make a mental note of the parts of the scene that were occupied by people .
Then , as those parts of the scene empty , take a shot .
The rest of the scene does n’t need to be vacant , just the parts that were previously full :
Now , while still thinking of our mental note of what areas need to be vacated , we can still see one man occupying part of the photo .
When he moves , we can take our final shot .
Putting it Together in PhotoShop
Once you have your sequence of shots you will want to open all of them up in Photoshop then copy and paste all of them into a single document as separate layers with your first shot as the bottom layer in the document .
If you are shooting in RAW format , make sure that if you change settings for one of the images , you make the same changes to all of the images so that their exposures , white balance and other settings match .
Image Alignment
If there are small differences between the alignment of your images , select the Move Tool and use the arrow keys to nudge the layers into alignment .
A handy trick for this is to change the blending mode of the top layer to “ Difference , ” then nudge the layer using the arrow keys .
The closer the resulting image is to black , the better the alignment .
Once you have finished the alignment , change the blending mode of the top layer back to “ Normal . ”
Masking
For now , we will make the top layer invisible ( click the eye icon next to the Photo 3 layer ) .
Next with the Photo 2 layer selected , create an empty mask for that layer , by clicking the mask icon while holding down OPTION on the Mac and ALT on the PC .
Your mask should now be black and the entire layer is hidden .
Now it ’s time to get rid of the people in your photo .
Select the brush tool and use a brush with a feathered edge .
Make sure the foreground colour is white , then Start painting into the mask of the Photo 2 layer in the places occupied by tourists .
You will see the people magically disappear from the image !
Once you have removed as many people as you can by painting on the Photo 2 layer , make the Photo 3 layer visible , create an empty mask for it and paint out the remaining person .
If you have to take more than three photos , keep repeating the process to erase any remaining stragglers .
You now have a landmark free of people !
Click here to see a larger version .
And check here for more of my photos from Ta Prohm and Cambodia .
Notes
While shooting , if you waiting for any appreciable period of time between shots , the light in the scene may have changed .
Once you have completed your masking and removed the people , you may be able to discern differences in lighting in the areas where the people were and where they now are not .
If the difference is n’t too off , you can correct this by making active the layer where the people are not present .
Then , you can either any of PhotoShop ’s tools in the “ Image > Adjustments ” menu to correct the change in light between the shots .
The federal government is moving to eliminate the jobs of nearly half of the lawyers at the Internal Revenue Service who audit tax returns of some of the wealthiest Americans , specifically those who are subject to gift and estate taxes when they transfer parts of their fortunes to their children and others .
The administration plans to cut the jobs of 157 of the agency ’s 345 estate tax lawyers , plus 17 support personnel , in less than 70 days .
Kevin Brown , an I.R.S. deputy commissioner , confirmed the cuts after The New York Times was given internal documents by people inside the I.R.S. who oppose them .
The Bush administration has passed measures that reduce the number of Americans who are subject to the estate tax  which opponents refer to as the “ death tax ”  but has failed in its efforts to eliminate the tax entirely .
Mr. Brown said in a telephone interview Friday that he had ordered the staff cuts because far fewer people were obliged to pay estate taxes under President Bush ’s legislation .
But six I.R.S. estate tax lawyers whose jobs are likely to be eliminated said in interviews that the cuts were just the latest moves behind the scenes at the I.R.S. to shield people with political connections and complex tax - avoidance devices from thorough audits .

Arabsat 4A was launched on a Proton rocket
The rocket section exploded on 19 February , generating as much debris as the destruction of a satellite by China last month , if not more .
This space wreckage could remain in orbit for years , experts say .
The anti-satellite test conducted by China on 11 January generated 817 confirmed fragments .
These risk elevations , in contrast to the Chinese event , are longer lasting
Heiner Klinkrad , Esa
But this figure is likely to fall over the coming months as some fragments burn up in the atmosphere .
The most recent explosion was caused by a Breeze - M upper stage which was part of a Proton rocket launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 28 February 2006 .
It was intended to deliver the Arabsat 4A satellite into a geosynchronous orbit around Earth .
However , the booster rocket on the upper stage malfunctioned , putting the satellite in the wrong orbit .
The satellite itself was intentionally de-orbited .
But on 19 February this year , almost a year after the failed launch , the upper stage - which still contained some of its fuel , exploded .
The US Space Surveillance Network has so far picked up 1,111 pieces of debris .
Fuel dump
After rockets deliver their payloads into orbit , it is standard practice to release remnant fuel , in order to avoid explosions .
This operation could not be performed by the failed Breeze stage , leaving a sizeable amount of propellant inside the stage , and triggering a high - energy explosion .
Esa officials estimate that the risk of a mission critical collision between debris from the Breeze - M stage and the ISS has been raised by 10 % .
Nasa says there is little threat to the space station ( Image : Nasa )
" The closest point to Earth is maintained [ by the debris ] at a fairly constant altitude for a long , long time , " Heiner Klinkrad , head of Esa 's orbital debris office told BBC News .
" These risk elevations , in contrast to the Chinese event , are longer lasting . "
The Breeze - M upper stage is in an eccentric orbit which ranges from 15,000 km - 500 km from Earth .
Its closest approach to Earth brings it into proximity with scientific , military and commercial satellites as well as the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
The two events , which occurred within weeks of each other , are the worst for space debris in the history of space launches .
Increased risk
Ruediger Jehn , an orbital debris analyst at Esa , said the Chinese A - Sat test alone had caused roughly a 10 % increase in collision warnings for the European Envisat and ERS remote sensing satellites .
About 10 - 30 % of objects curently orbiting close to the satellites are debris from the Chinese A - Sat test .
Nasa officials said the debris was not expected to pose a threat to the International Space Station or the upcoming launch of space shuttle Atlantis in March .
Only particles of about 10 cm or above can be tracked using radar .
But both explosions would have generated millions of smaller fragments which are difficult to detect .
The space station has shields to protect it against objects under 1 cm in size .
Anything larger than 1 cm would be perfectly capable of penetrating these shields .
If a threat arises from objects of 5 - 10 cm and above , the space station can adjust its position to avoid the debris .
But that leaves a gap , objects intermediate between these two size ranges are difficult to avoid .
No one is sure what caused the 19 February 2007 explosion of the Breeze - M stage .
It could have been due to the corrosive hypergolic fuel it carried .
Alternatively , it could have been caused by the impact of another piece of space debris , or a micrometeor .
Top 5 Social Bookmarking Services
If you spend a lot of time online or do any kind of web based research , chances are the Bookmarks menu in your browser is no longer sufficient for you .
If you browse the web from more than one computer , storing bookmarks in the browser is downright counterproductive .
It is time to choose an online bookmarking tool .
Here are Pandia ’s top 5 social bookmarking services .
Social bookmarking means storing your bookmarks online , tagging them to remember why you wanted to save them and what you might want them for in the future .
You can also share them with others who might value your web surfing experiences .
And do n’t worry - you can always choose to keep some or even all of your bookmarks private if , for some reason , you do n’t want to share .
Social bookmarking sites are in many ways the ultimate folksonomies , categorising web content by an open process of tagging .
The result is a road map of the web , based on the recommendations of people who have traveled it extensively .
In many ways , the information gathered by social bookmarking services is like the wild , young sibling of the web directories .
But now , every web surfer is a potential editor , licensed to categorize and recommend all kinds of web sites .
You probably browse the web from home , at work and possibly on your smartphone .
If you do , storing bookmarks in the browser can be annoying and counterproductive .
You need an online bookmarking tool to have easy access to all your favorite web sites regardless of which device you use to get online .
Here are Pandia ’s top 5 social bookmarking services .
Social bookmarking is like a quiet , clever sister among her fancy Web 2.0 siblings .
YouTube and Facebook are so much fun ; they get all the attention .
But the social bookmarking services are in many ways much more useful for most people and they are equally social ( or at least they could be ) .
What to look for
When researching for this article , I registered with and tested over 20 tools for social bookmarking .
Some were discarded because of bugs or spam .
The remaining were sorted by these criteria :
A decent amount of users is necessary .
Otherwise the whole social aspect looses relevance .
The service has to have quite extensive documentation , FAQ and / or help pages , to guide users .
More advanced users will want good import and export possibilities .
Import is necessary for bringing old bookmarks from your browser or from another online bookmarking service , export is important for backup copies and to ensure that your bookmarks can go with you to another service if you decide to switch .
A good bookmarking service should have feeds ( RSS and / or Atom ) of tags or groups of tags .
I would want my bookmarking service to have a blog so I can be kept up to date about new features , bugs , bug fixes and more .
All the top 5 social bookmarking services in this article comply with these criteria , except for Bluedot which does n’t have an export option .
And the winners are …
Furl
LookSmart ’s
Furl is one of the seniors of social bookmarking and definitely among the most advanced .
If you are serious about your online research , this is the tool for you .
Navigating among all of Furl ’s features is easy - everything is stored behind four tabs .
The tab My Archive displays all of your bookmarks .
All the essential tools are kept in a neat little box .
It lets you search your own bookmarks , all of Furl or the entire web .
Drop - down menus let you sort your bookmarks by tag , by date or both .
The bookmark list has lots of tools that make it easy to move , delete or email bookmarks , and clicking on the Edit tool lets you store and edit all kinds of information .
If you are a blogger or a webmaster , code is available that will display your recent Furl entries on your web site .
Furl is among the few services that store a copy of the whole web page when you bookmark it .
This can be a very useful tool .
Unfortunately , no copies are generated for my imported bookmarks .
I also ran into another problem when importing bookmarks from del.icio.us :
Bookmarks with more than one tag had their tags melted into one , e.g. a single tag called “ google , searchengine_news ” in stead of the two tags “ google ” and “ searchengine_news ” .
Netvouz
Netvouz is a powerful tool for social bookmarking .
You can view and sort your bookmarks in many ways — all bookmarks or new bookmarks , tag list or tag cloud , like many other bookmarking services .
You can also sort bookmarks by rating , date or name .
Netvouz is the only bookmarking service that lets you place groups of tags in folders that are displayed high up on the page .
You may also add “ Hotpicks ” — your most frequently used bookmarks — that always are available on the very top .
These features are of great help for those of us who are storing hundreds of bookmarks online .
Netvouz also has an automatic link checker that regularly verifies that all your bookmarks are valid and alerts you in case they are not .
I have n’t seen this anywhere else .
The only downside is the community part .
Nervouz has no support for recommendations , friends or groups like many other social bookmarking services .
All that is on offer is “ New public links ” and “ Popular tags ” on the front page .
Del.icio.us
Del.icio.us is by far the most popular social bookmarking tool out there .
It is not the most powerful , though .
I have kept my bookmarks on del.icio.us for some time now and the reason I stay on is the community .
The tools for sharing are not very powerful — you can add people to your network and share links with them , and that ’s about it .
The effect of sharing can be great , though , because of the size of the community .
On del.icio.us you can view your bookmarks as a tag list or a tag cloud .
Tags can be sorted alphabetically or by frequency .
Behind the Help link you find tips for advanced searching and navigation and some unofficial tools that can make del.icio.us work for more demanding users .
Among the advanced features are network badges , link rolls , and tag rolls that help bloggers and webmasters to display their del.icio.us activities on their own blogs and sites .
There are no very powerful tools for sorting or editing bookmarks .
Paradoxically , this might be a reason for del.icio.us ’ popularity .
It offers just what the average web surfer needs .
Mister Wong
Mister Wong is developed in Germany and is Europe ’s largest bookmarking service .
Though it started in German , Mister Wong is now available in English , Russian , Chinese , Spanish , and French .
If you navigate better by way of images than text , Mister Wong is for you :
Each bookmark is represented by a thumbnail of the web page it links to in addition to the title and any description you add .
If the thumb nail is too small to yield the necessary information — or if Mister Wong has failed to produce a thumb nail ( this happens ) — you can point your mouse to an icon next to the bookmark title to have a larger preview pop up .
Next to the preview icon is another useful tool : a star icon you can click to add a bookmark to your top bookmarks .
These are always easily abailable from the bookmark menu .
Unfortunately , Mister Wong no longer supports groups .
You can still be social and share bookmarks through a network of friends , called Buddies .
Simpy
Simpy is another old - timer in the world of social bookmarking .
Unlike Furl , Simpy has n’t updated its look much .
This gives it an odd but cute retro look .
This does not compromise ease of use , though .
In addition to storing your bookmarks , Simpy also stores notes .
With the Note This !
bookmarkletbookmarklet you highlight and save text .
Notes are private and each note gets a title and you can add tags to it , just like the bookmarks .
When searching , you can choose to search notes or bookmarks — your own or everyone’s .
Simpy supports groups , but you ca n’t add people as friends .
In stead , Simpy has watchlists that let you subscribe to the bookmarks of other users .
Simpy keeps track of new links that you have not yet seen and alerts you when a watchlist has new links .
Another neat social feature is that when you add a bookmark to Simpy , you get the option to send the link to a friend in addition to saving it to saving it to your account .
All you do is add a Simpy user name or an email address .
Diigo
Diigo is fun !
It is my absolute favorite .
This service has an enormous amount of tools and features — it is more than a bookmarking service , it is a complete tool for online research .
To start with the basics , Diigo is easy to use .
Tabs and pull - down menus in addition to the tag cloud makes it easy to navigate , sort and edit bookmarks and tags .
I have 1000 + bookmarks , so this is important to me .
If you do research online , you ’ll soon value these tools .
In addition to being a bookmark tool , Diigo lets you add sticky notes and highlight text on any web page just like you would on paper .
This way , information can be highlighted on web pages for easy scanning later and snippets of information can be saved for sharing , editing and reference .
The highlights and sticky notes are private by default , but can be shared with your Diigo friends in a number of ways .
The possibilities for social networking on Diigo are unequaled in the world of social bookmarking .
Diigo has a group tool for collaborative research that allows groups of people to pool their findings through shared bookmarks , highlights , sticky notes , and forum discussions .
There are also communities formed around web sites ( like Wikipedia ) and tags ( like Web 2.0 ) .
Ma.gnolia
Ma.gnolia has the sleekest design of all the social bookmarking services .
And even though beauty is generally considered to be skin deep , high quality web design with lots of white space and easy navigation makes me happy .
Never underestimate the value of beautiful design .
At Ma.gnolia there are tutorials , a FAQ and even a wiki for support , and if you send a mail to the support team , you get an answer quickly , even at weekends .
With contacts , groups and discussions , there are plenty of ways to share bookmarks both within and outside of Ma.gnolia .
You can search your bookmarks ( or the bookmarks of all Ma.gnolia members ) or browse them as a tag list or a tag cloud .
You can rate your bookmarks , which is convenient , and it is easy to edit single bookmarks or all the bookmarks with a certain tag .
Furl and Ma.gnolia are the only bookmarking services I have come across that save a copy of the web pages you bookmark .
There is also a widget that lets you quickly add a link roll of your saved Ma.gnolia bookmarks to your blog or web page .
But if you have many bookmarks with the same tag , it can be difficult to scroll through them in Ma.gnolia .
What I miss is a list view where each bookmark takes up no more than a couple of lines and you can choose to view , say , 25 , 50 or 75 bookmarks at a time .
Bluedot
Bluedot is the bookmarking tool for the MySpace crowd .
The main focus is inviting friends and sharing dots ( your annotated bookmarks ) .
You can import contacts from your AOL , Gmail , MSN or Yahoo !
account and then invite them to your Bluedot network .
You edit your profile with information about your location and interests and add a photo or an avatar if you like .
Of these top 5 bookmarking tools only Ma.gnolia has a similar profile option .
You can choose to view your dots as a list ( which is not very useful once you have more than 25 bookmarks ) or as a list of tags .
Each tag is displayed as a stack , showing the name of the tag and the number of dots in it .
There are no other sorting options , but there are plenty of options for sharing :
You can comment on your own dots or those of others or you can share dots by email , and each dot has a permalink that displays name , rating , comments and more .
I would have liked an option to view more than 10 dots per screen .
And is it really necessary with two prominent Google Ads banners on each page displaying dots ?
What about the rest ?
There are many great bookmarking services out there .
These five are my favorites , but I would also recommend Yahoo ’s MyWeb which is a quite powerful tool or Blogmarks which is good looking and includes thumbnail previews of your bookmarked pages .
But where ’s Google ?
The Google Bookmarks tool is simply no good compared to these top 5 tools .
The design is uncluttered and the service looks deceptively easy to use , but you need to spend a lot of time figuring out how things work .
There is no Help link in sight and the help I found searching Google ’s help base was n’t always useful .
Google should either start spending some serious money developing this tool or go out and buy one , like Simpy , which is a very decent service with good community features .
Here is an example of a del.icio.us tag roll displaying some of my tags :
Bookmarking and search
You may use these services to find high quality web sites , the premise being that sites bookmarked by real human users have been through a rather thorough review process .
The search engines know this , and when Yahoo ! bought del.icio.us — in spite of the fact that it already had its own bookmarking service — this was partly because it knew that bookmarks can be interpreted as a vote for web page quality .
Del.icio.us has a lot of bookmarks !
In other words : Yahoo !
may use data from the bookmarking service as a factor in its search engine algorithm .
Whether the company actually does so , we do not know , but the search engine companies are definitely considering such a move .
Note :
This is a text only archived version of previously published article " Top 5 social bookmarking services " ,
We made it available to the users mainly because it is still one of the most search article from old site .
Much of the content should be outdated now .
My name is Jack Campbell , until September , CEO of a manufacturing company producing Apple Computer related products .
Just over one - year ago , my company , DVForge , announced a $ 25,000 prize for the first virus developer who could infect two Powermac G5 computers located in our office , both with plain - Jane installations of OS X , by propagating that new virus over the internet .
In the onslaught of correspondence that quickly then began streaming into our office we found enough wisdom to convince us to cancel that contest , due almost completely to potential risks to legal liabilities .
But , the flare was shot into the sky , and the challenge received a huge degree of worldwide press attention , in both Apple press and mainstream press outlets .
Presumedly , any virus coders who had not previously eyed the Apple platform would have seen some of this press exposure , and would have been enticed by the challenge , regardless of the retraction of the cash prize .
Well , more than a year has passed .
And , surprisingly ( or not , to some of us ) , there is still not one self - replicating virus in the wild that attacks the Mac OS X operating system .
That 's right , folks ... not one .
Not the first .
Ever. Never. Zero .
Against this reality -- zero actual propagating OS X viruses in the wild -- there has been a groundswell of press attention offered recently to the notion that , somehow , Mac OS X is " nearly " as vulnerable to such afflictions as is Windows XP .
In fact , this idea has become the darling for seemingly every writing hack in the industry to use as a stepping off point for whatever brand of yellow journalism they wish to pen .
When I announced the OS X Virus Contest , OS X had been on the market for four years , with still not one single in the wild virus .
Now , it has been more than five years .
And , guess what ?... still not one in the wild virus !
We structured the contest last year to isolate the threat of an in the wild , self - replicating , self - propogating virus as that is the one true worldwide threat to any computer operating system .
This can be seen from at least two hugely publicized attacks by just these creatures against the Windows OS in just the past two - years .
Worldwide panic and devastation to millions of computers was the result in both instances .
These were not " malware " or " trojan " attacks ... and despite the yellow journalist 's efforts to blur the distinction between these various security threats , the fact remains that it is the self - propagating virus , that launches from computer to computer without conscious involvement by the user , that poses the highest risk of devastating damage .
So , that is where we focused .
Today , in honor of the many people who so vocally supported our virus contest last year , I am publicly challenging the many tech industry writers who have so loudly heralded " the growing OS X security risk " over the past few days to step up and show me one thing : just one in the wild virus that infects Mac OS X .
Show me that one item , and I will shut up .
From HaskellWiki
A quick introduction to QuickCheck2 , and testing Haskell code .
Motivation
In September 2006 , Bruno Martínez asked the following question :
-- I 've written a function that looks similar to this one getList = find 5 where find 0 = return [ ] find n = do ch <- get Char if ch ` elem ` [ ' a ' .. 'e ' ] then do tl <- find ( n - 1 ) return ( ch : tl ) else find n -- I want to test this function , without hitting the filesystem .
In C++ I -- would use a istringstream .
I could n't find a function that returns a -- Handle from a String .
The closer thing that may work that I could find -- was making a pipe and convertind the file descriptor .
Can I simplify -- that function to take it out of the IO monad ?
So the problem is : how to effectively test this function in Haskell ?
The solution we turn to is refactoring and QuickCheck .
Keeping things pure
The reason your getList is hard to test , is that the side effecting monadic code is mixed in with the pure computation , making it difficult to test without moving entirely into a " black box " IO - based testing model .
Such a mixture is not good for reasoning about code .
Let 's untangle that , and then test the referentially transparent parts simply with QuickCheck .
We can take advantage of lazy IO firstly , to avoid all the unpleasant low - level IO handling .
So the first step is to factor out the IO part of the function into a thin " skin " layer :
-- A thin monadic skin layer getList :: IO [ Char ] getList = fmap take5 getContents --
The actual worker take5 :: [ Char ] -> [ Char ] take5 = take 5 . filter ( ` elem ` [ ' a ' .. 'e ' ])
Testing with QuickCheck >=2.0
Now we can test the ' guts ' of the algorithm , the take5 function , in isolation .
Let 's use QuickCheck .
First we need an Arbitrary instance for the Char type -- this takes care of generating random Chars for us to test with .
I 'll restrict it to a range of nice chars just for simplicity :
import Data .
Char import Test.QuickCheck -- Arbitrary Char is now part of the library {- instance Arbitrary Char where arbitrary = choose ( ' \ 32 ' , ' \ 128 ' ) coarbitrary c = variant ( ord c `rem` 4 ) -}
Let 's fire up GHCi ( or Hugs ) and try some generic properties ( its nice that we can use the QuickCheck testing framework directly from the Haskell prompt ) .
An easy one first , a [ Char ] is equal to itself :
* A > quickCheck ( ( \ s -> s == s ) :: [ Char ] ->
Bool ) +++ OK , passed 100 tests .
What just happened ?
QuickCheck generated 100 random [ Char ] values , and applied our property , checking the result was True for all cases .
QuickCheck generated the test sets for us !
A more interesting property now : reversing twice is the identity :
* A > quickCheck ( ( \ s -> ( reverse .
reverse ) s == s ) :: [ Char ] ->
Bool ) +++ OK , passed 100 tests .
Great !
Testing take5
The first step to testing with QuickCheck is to work out some properties that are true of the function , for all inputs .
That is , we need to find invariants .
A simple invariant might be :
So let 's write that as a QuickCheck property :
\ s -> length ( take5 s ) == 5
Which we can then run in QuickCheck as :
* A > quickCheck ( \ s -> length ( take5 s ) == 5 ) *** Failed !
Falsifiable ( after 1 test ) : " "
Ah ! QuickCheck caught us out .
If the input string contains less than 5 filterable characters , the resulting string will be less than 5 characters long .
So let 's weaken the property a bit :
That is , take5 returns a string of at most 5 characters long .
Let 's test this :
* A > quickCheck ( \ s -> length ( take5 s ) <= 5 ) +++ OK , passed 100 tests .
Good !
Another property
Another thing to check would be that the correct characters are returned .
That is , for all returned characters , those characters are members of the set [ 'a ' , 'b ' , 'c ' , 'd ' , 'e ' ] .
We can specify that as :
And in QuickCheck :
* A > quickCheck ( \ s -> all ( ` elem ` [ ' a ' .. ' e ' ] ) ( take5 s ) ) +++ OK , passed 100 tests .
Excellent .
So we can have some confidence that the function neither returns strings that are too long , nor includes invalid characters .
Coverage
One issue with the default QuickCheck configuration , when testing [ Char ] , is that the standard 100 tests is n't enough for our situation .
In fact , Quick Check never generates a String greater than 5 characters long , when using the supplied Arbitrary instance for Char !
We can confirm this :
* A > quickCheck ( \ s -> length ( take5 s ) < 5 ) +++ OK , passed 100 tests .
QuickCheck wastes its time generating different Chars , when what we really need is longer strings .
One solution to this is to modify Quick Check 's default configuration to test deeper :
deepCheck = quickCheckWith ( stdArgs { maxSuccess = 10000 } )
This instructs the system to find at least 10000 test cases before concluding that all is well .
Let 's check that it is generating longer strings :
* A > deepCheck ( \ s -> length ( take5 s ) < 5 ) *** Failed !
Falsifiable ( after 186 tests and 16 shrinks ) : " aaaaa "
We can check the test data QuickCheck is generating using the ' verboseCheck ' hook .
Here , testing on integers lists :
* A > verboseCheck ( ( \ s -> length s < 3 ) :: [ Integer ] ->
Bool ) Passed : [ ]
Passed : [ ]
Passed : [ ]
Passed : [ ]
Failed : [ 1 , 3 , - 4 ] *** Failed !
Passed : [ ]
Passed : [ 3 , - 4 ] Passed : [ 1 , - 4 ] Passed : [ 1 , 3 ] Failed : [ 0 , 3 , - 4 ] Passed : [ ]
Passed : [ 3 , - 4 ] Passed : [ 0 , - 4 ] Passed : [ 0 , 3 ] Failed : [ 0 , 0 , - 4 ] Passed : [ ]
Passed : [ 0 , - 4 ] Passed : [ 0 , - 4 ] Passed : [ 0 , 0 ] Failed : [ 0 , 0 , 4 ] Passed : [ ]
Passed : [ 0 , 4 ] Passed : [ 0 , 4 ] Passed : [ 0 , 0 ] Failed : [ 0 , 0 , 0 ] Passed : [ ]
Passed : [ 0 , 0 ] Passed : [ 0 , 0 ] Passed : [ 0 , 0 ] Falsifiable ( after 5 tests and 4 shrinks ) : [ 0 , 0 , 0 ] --
Need to add in an overview of the shrink process .
Going further
QuickCheck is effectively an embedded domain specific language for testing Haskell code , and allows for much more complex properties than those you 've seen here to be tested .
Some sources for further reading are :
Note , QuickCheck does n't need to just be an embedded domain specific language for testing Haskell code .
By making instances of Arbitrary for FFI types you can use Haskell and QuickCheck to check code in other languages .
Foreign backpackers visiting Queensland have been earning money as illegal prostitutes and damaging legitimate operators , the legal brothel industry has claimed .
Queensland Adult Business Association Nick Inskip said the illegal sex industry was undermining efforts by the legal industry to make a profit and uphold health and safety standards .
Mr Inskip said many backpackers counted on making extra cash during their visit .
Expert hands point way to moon mission By Traci Watson , USA TODAY
They are grayer , 35 years after the glory days , and their memories are not as keen .
But the engineers who landed Americans on the moon are as enthralled as ever by the romance of space travel .
And today some find themselves , to their delight , working once again to send humans to the lunar surface .
Now in their 60s or older , veterans of the Apollo program have been called away from their tennis games , their grandchildren and their puttering to pursue President Bush 's goal of returning astronauts to the moon by 2020 .
Some are serving as part - time consultants to NASA or private companies .
Others are working full time on the new moon program .
All say the work is a joy , not a burden .
" I 'm about to fulfill a dream I 've had for 30 years , which is to be a part of getting back to exploration , " says former Apollo engineer Leonard Nicholson , 67 , now a leader of a Boeing - Northrop Grumman team designing a possible moon ship .
" It 's a blast for me . "
" The excitement is incredible , " says Mel Rimer , 67 , who is contacting fellow alumni of the lunar - lander program to ask whether they would like to work on the latest model .
" Some of the e-mails that we get : ' Ca n't wait to come back . ' "
No human footfall has stirred the moon 's fine dust since 1972 , when astronaut Eugene Cernan climbed back into his spaceship and declared that humans , " God willing ... shall return , with peace and hope for all mankind . "
After that last mission , Apollo team members swallowed their disappointment and found work in other programs .
They 've been top bosses of the space shuttle fleet , helped run the International Space Station , studied nuclear - powered spaceships .
But they have not forgotten the business left unfinished on the moon .
Image gallery Check out how NASA plans to use elements of the Apollo and shuttle programs for the next moon mission .
" We had plans ( that ) ... the moon would become an outpost for experimentation and exploration , " says Bob Haslett , 69 , who , like Rimer , worked on the lunar lander and is now tracking down old colleagues and advising NASA .
" It never happened .
So I personally feel good about going back . "
Going back should not pose the same challenge as in the 1960s , the Apollo alumni say .
More is known about the moon — for example , that a lander wo n't sink out of sight into the lunar dust , as was feared back then .
Technological progress will also give today 's engineers a leg up .
Apollo veterans remember sketching out plans on a drawing board rather than a computer screen , relying on slide rules instead of calculators and standing in line at the painfully slow photocopiers of the day .
To run even a simple computer program , " you had to make punch cards , " Haslett recalls .
" Then a keypunch operator would punch them in , and God forbid somebody would drop your box of cards and they 'd get all out of order . "
Yet the plan devised with this rudimentary technology was so good that NASA has decided to reuse it nearly intact .
As in the Apollo program that went to the moon in the 1960s and ' 70s , the next moon vehicle will detach from its rocket to descend to the lunar surface .
As in Apollo , the ship will be wingless , and parachutes will cushion its touchdown on Earth .
" We tried hard initially to not make this new ( effort ) look like Apollo , " says John Connolly , a leader of the NASA team that designed the new moon mission .
But " we started coming to the realization more and more that the Apollo guys were pretty darned smart . "
So smart that NASA Administrator Michael Griffin invited a group of Apollo veterans to Washington several times to review NASA 's findings .
Griffin called them " the graybeards , " says Robert Seamans , 87 , who was NASA 's deputy administrator for much of the moon program .
Seamans declines to discuss his advice to NASA .
Connolly says Seamans outlined the pros and cons of a lunar lander that returns to Earth straight from the moon 's surface , rather than having to hook up with its rocket and control systems in lunar orbit .
NASA decided that Seamans and his team chose rightly : NASA 's new plan , like Apollo , relies on the second option , though studies done in the 1990s favored the first .
Another " graybeard , " former Apollo engineer Bob Sieck , 67 , used the trips to Washington to argue for simplicity .
It 's a virtue he learned in part from the 1967 fire that killed three astronauts as they sat in their Apollo capsule on the launch pad .
The capsule , as basic as it was , was still so complex that engineers never pinpointed the fire 's exact cause , Sieck says .
" That just reinforces that , hey , the simpler you can make these vehicles , the better off you are , " Sieck says .
" Sure , take advantage of the new technology ... but that does n't mean you have to make it so complicated that you generate more opportunities for errors . "
Rimer says he surprised younger NASA engineers by telling a cautionary story about the first moon landing .
It was widely believed that Neil Armstrong nearly ran out of fuel setting his ship down on the lunar surface .
Not so , Rimer says .
The real problem was a badly designed fuel gauge , which was uncovered months later and is little known today .
" If you try to do it the same way ( as on Apollo ) ... you get the same problem , " Rimer says .
The veterans are enthusiastic about resuming moon flights , which they say the nation was shortsighted to end .
But they are also cautious about the chance of success in the 21st century .
Today 's rocket scientists , they say , may have zippier computers .
But they lack some of the crucial assets that made Apollo a success .
" When we needed something , all we had to do was ask , " Sieck recalls .
" The people that had the checkbook said , ' Fine , it 's on its way . ' " Whether the USA will spend the estimated $ 100 - billion - plus it will take to return Americans to the moon is a big " if , " he says .
Seamans notes another key factor : national resolve .
" Back then , there was a tremendous trauma each time the Soviets put something up , " he says .
" There was great pressure for NASA to do much more .
... Today , I do n't see that . "
Despite their skepticism , none of them wants to be left out if the project proceeds .
If the program advances , " I 'd love to get involved again .
I 'd love to do things , " Rimer says .
" I hope they 'll say ... ' Sieck may have some ideas about this , ' " Sieck adds .
" I do n't have an unlisted number .
I 'm available . "
This DJ is simply amazing : he manages to mix some techno beats into the very own Star Wars theme song .
Rock on !
I will say right now that I am not an avid Lost fanatic .
I lost interest in the show after the anticlimactic finale of season one .
I am curious as to what the ultimate solution to the whole island mystery is going to be , but I have strong suspicions that the final answer will not be entirely satisfactory or make much sense , so I am reluctant to invest much of my personal time agonizing over the deeper meanings of the show , when it would be simpler to wait for the entire series to finish and then watch the whole thing at once .
I am , however , a mathematician .
And these numbers , 4 , 8 , 15 , 16 , 23 and 42 , are interesting .
They were first brought to my attention by a Lost fan I know online .
He knew I was into maths so after the episode " Numbers " aired he IMed me asking me if this was a known sequence .
I did n't recognise it - I found nothing in the On - Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences either .
Mathematically these number have no real structure - they appear to have been chosen to be as random as possible .
However , it is possible to force any sequence of numbers to have structure by a method called Lagrange Interpolation .
By this method we can construct a polynomial which passes through each number one at a time .
Seeing as there was no other way to make sense of the numbers , I have constructed a Lagrange Interpolating Polynomial for the Lost numbers .
Just out of idle curiosity , you understand .
What I found was this , which I shall call the Lost Number Function :
2400 - 4896n + 3670n2 - 1175n3 + 170n4 - 9n5 f( n ) =
---------------------------------------------
40
This formula gives
f (1 ) = 4 f( 2 ) = 8 f( 3 ) = 15 f ( 4 ) = 16 f( 5 ) = 23 f( 6 ) = 42
Which you can see graphed here :
From this we can see that the next number in the sequence is
f (7 ) = 46
And also that the zeroth number in the sequence , the one coming before 4 , is
f (0 ) = 60
Beyond these points the graph shoots off towards infinity or minus infinity .
The eighth Lost number is - 52 , the ninth is - 426 , and so on .
What can we make of this ?
Well , nothing really .
I just thought that you Lost nutters might be interested .
Does the number 46 turn up anywhere on the island ?
Probably ...
Enjoy !
This guy is being asked which one of four objects gravitates around the Earth .
The price is three thousand euros and , just in case , he has the option to ask the public ’s opinion …
Would be funny , if it were n’t so sad .
Reminds me of those people that justify their inability to write correctly saying that they are scientists .
I had a colleague that always retorted to them : no , you ’re not a scientist , you ’re just silly !.

Best backyard astronomy aid
After a telescope , this is the best astronomy educational tool I ’ve seen .
At night this AAA battery powered green laser pointer can seemingly touch the stars millions of miles away .
Compared to a red laser pointer , the green beam remains visible and penetrates the air much farther .
Because of its particular spectrum you see the beam and not just the end dot .
Also , it ’s about 50 times brighter than an ordinary red laser pointer — using the same safe low power .
On a clear night it can easily shine a dot a mile away .
With its sharp laser beam you can pinpoint the exact star you want , which greatly accelerates mapping and learning the constellations .
I ’ve been amazed at how much faster I ’ve learned the heavens with one of these in hand .
The problem with green laser pointers has been their stiff price .
Only recently have they dropped below $ 50 .
You need a good 50 milliwatt ( 50 mw ) powered laser to cut through the moist air at night .
You can get a decent reliable 50 mw on Amazon for about $ 40 , but you can also find many cheaper varieties for as low as $ 15 , which is about what they cost on the street in China .
These pens may be in a legal gray zone in terms of their power and use .
Do n’t be dumb and point them at anyone .
In my experience their quality varies , but given intermittent use , the cheap ones can work for the occasional star gazing .
Incidentally , you can purchase higher powered lasers of all colors from Wicked Lasers .
Their scary / astounding 100 mw green lasers are incredibly bright at night , but overkill for an astronomy aid .
These blasts are good for lights shows , though .

Why is a married Christ so threatening ?
Over the Holiday Break I was feeling a bit heretical and decided to read The DaVinci Code , and a similar book called the Expected One .
One of the basic premises of these books , if you do n’t know , is that Jesus of Nazareth married the woman named Mary Magdalene .
In one of the books ( I do n’t remember which one ) one of the characters asks a question amounting to , “ Why is a married Christ so threatening to the Church ? ”
When I read this it sorta resounded with me .
We as the Church so often make the claim that the Christ was fully God and fully Man .
But do we really believe this ?
We so often minimize the fact that Jesus did live here on Earth for approximately 33 years .
If he was fully Man , why would n’t he have gotten married ?
As Man , the Christ knew all the feelings and emotions that we do .
He had to have felt some sort of romantic love .
Not doing so would have been unhuman , completely contradicting what we are always saying .
And it ’s not like the sexual act and marriage are a sin .
We are told that , “ For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife , and they will become one flesh . ”
And then the Apostle John states in his Gospel , “ Jesus did many other things as well .
If every one of them were written down , I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written . ”
Is it possible that this marriage was so well known and assumed by the Christians of the day , that maybe the Gospel narrative does n’t include it because there so many other things that needed to be told ?
Maybe the way that Dan Brown presents it is n’t 100 % accurate , but should we dismiss this so quickly ?
Peace and Love ,
His Child , the Wayfarer
今日か らCambridgeのOLPCオフィスで仕事。Mary Louのデザインした新しいボードはまだ世界に15枚位しかなくて、OLPCのオフィスには2枚しかないのだが、そのうちの一台が繋がったボードにSqueakを載せてどのように見えるかを実験。
1200x900のディスプレイで、カラーモードにしても結構まともに見えるのに驚き。ディスプレイは新しいもので、「安く作る」という目標の中で新しいディスプレイをデザインする、というのがなかなか野心的だったのだが、低消費電力で安くてちゃんと見えるものが出てきたのはなかなかすごい。

_ 数十人でデブサミ 角谷さんの伝説のライブ（再演）を堪能しに永和システムマネジメントを訪問。どうもありがとうございました。 いやぁ、これはデブサミのセッションとしては異質だっただろうなぁと想像できる。キーノートプレゼンのミソは黒地に部分着色した文字かな、と思ったのも含めて。 プログラミングはおもしろいわけだが、そのおもしろさのうちの相当の部分は書いたコードの美しさによって決まるような気がする。（だからカッコの美学という主張はわかるし、実際のところカラム7の美学もわかるし、逆にインデントを美学ではなく必要に変えてしまうセンスは嫌いなのだがもっとも食わず嫌いの可能性もあるだろうけど）
きれいというのはいろいろ主観に依存すると思う。
最初、こういうのがきれいだと思った。 int axe = 3 ; int exe = 4 ; int longname = 8 ; long lonlon = 1L ; が、へたなプログラムほどこういう書き方をしているのを目にして、次の書き方へ移行した。 int axe = 3 ; int exe = 4 ; int longnmae = 8 ; long lonlon = 1L ; 最初の書き方って、カラム7の美学の文化圏だ。後者の書き方へ移ったときに、おれは多分、自由を少しばかり手に入れたのだと思う。

“ The reason Republicans are not coming over the hill like the cavalry is the best defense you can give is it was poorly handled , ” said Senator Lindsey Graham , Republican of South Carolina , a member of the Judiciary Committee .
“ That is as good as it gets . ”
The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday is to consider subpoenas of its own .
Senator Patrick J. Leahy , the Vermont Democrat who is the chairman of the panel , said Wednesday evening that he expected to win the authority to force the testimony .
“ Every day there are thousands of good , loyal Americans who stand in courtrooms , raise their right hand and swear to tell to truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth and are proud to do it , ” Mr. Leahy said .
“ It is amazing that thousands of ordinary Americans can do it , but they are kind of special and they do n’t have to . ”
Some Congressional Republicans said privately that the administration ’s proposal might be a tough sell because many Americans would question why the officials were unwilling to talk under oath — a position the administration attributes to a desire to not set a precedent .
But others sought to make the case that those appearing would still be required to be truthful or face a charge of misleading Congress .
“ If we find that there ’s a lie , these people can go to jail just like they were under oath , ” said Representative Chris Cannon of Utah , the senior Republican on the subcommittee that approved the subpoenas .
Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee met privately Wednesday to discuss their approach , and a group of them later had lunch at the Justice Department with Mr. Gonzales , who was trying to bolster his core support before their committee ’s session Thursday .
Senator Jon Kyl , Republican of Arizona , whose position on the fate of Mr. Gonzales wouldprobably influence other colleagues , said the attorney general assured them that none of the prosecutors was removed to halt a criminal inquiry — an accusation that has helped fuel the furor .
“ He again reiterated to us that in none of the cases of U.S. attorneys being asked to resign was it because of any ongoing investigation , let alone an investigation involving a political person , ” said Mr. Kyl , who said there was no talk of Mr. Gonzales ’s resignation at the meeting .
Ever since the so called Cognitive Revolution replaced behaviorism with cognitive science , in psychology , human memory and the human mind have been modeled as computer - like .
But now , the internet security challenge brings forth what computer scientists call “ human limitation with precise recall ” .
This refers to our inability to remember and recall with precision a variety of random character combinations that , as internet users , we need to keep safe our different accounts and corporate networks .
Yet , even though it contradicts everything we have learned about human memory in everyday life , such recall ability has been postulated by all Cognitive Science models of human memory .
Moreover , they have , supposedly , been proven by laboratory experiments on nonsense groups of syllables and alike .
However , real people are striking back and the computer scientist is rediscovering human limitations in precise recall .
Limitation ?
In applying cognition , we have a strong preference for creating , remembering , and manipulating meaningful symbols .
This is actually our greatest strength and the engine of creative endeavors in science , arts , literature , music , etc .
However , it is this strength of human minds that clashes with and is threatening Internet Security .
Internet users pick up meaningful words to be their passwords .
Breaking a truly random 8 - character password would take more than 13 years on average even for password - cracking programs that can test nearly 8 million combinations every second .
But majority of passwords are not made of random characters .
Rather , they are meaningful words that can be easily remembered .
Sometimes , they have a few numerical extensions , which do not complicate the hacker ’s life to any significant extent .
Hacking
Hackers can crack most of commonly used passwords in less than a minute .
And once they discover passwords on one server , they frequently can access other servers .
Having stolen digital keys to a large fraction of the accounts on the network , an intruder can wander about maintaining the facade of a legitimate user .
This is why the password security threat is a serious problem .
“ Passwords are one of the biggest security problems that corporate America has , ” according to Chris Pick , associate vice president for product strategy at PentaSafe Security Technologies .
And an interesting problem it is , for both the psychology of human memory and enforcing internet security .
1 . My work speaks for itself .
I was tired of my boss constantly looking over my shoulder and telling me I was n't good enough .
The feedback I get from my clients is truly attributable only to myself ; no one can take that from me .
2 . Office attire now consists of slippers , yoga pants and a hoodie .
And yes , I start everyday with a shower .
3 . No more “ 9 to 5 ” .
If I want to work at 7 am then take a yoga class at 11 am , I can .
Likewise if I choose to sleep in a little and work late .
Plus , I love those afternoon siestas !
4. Plenty of opportunities to make WAY more money .
I am no longer slave to the “ you ’re - not - worthy - of - your - full - bonus - even - though - there ’s - no - reason - you - should n’t - have - it - other - than - I - do n ’t - like - you - and - I - want - a - new - in - ground - pool - installed . ”
5 . I create my own challenges and accept the projects I want – and at the rates I choose .
6 . I am no longer “ stuck ” with a boss or colleagues ; I get to choose who I want to work with .
7 . More freedom to meet and network with people .
If someone asks for a coffee meeting at 10:30 in the morning , I do n’t have to tell the boss where I ’m going or make excuses .
I just go .
8 . I get to spend more time with my cat .
9 . Lunches do n’t come in plastic containers ; I make it all fresh .
10 .
No more office politics .
I play by my own rules .
Wall Street Women : Underperforming and Overpromoted ?
Here ’s an interesting new working paper by T. Clifton Green , Narasimhan Jegadeesh , and Yue Tang , all of Emory University , who looked at nearly 8,000 sell - side Wall Street equity analysts in order to assess gender and job performance .
In terms of sheer representation , they found that women actually lost ground from 1995 to 2005 , from 16 % to 13 % of analyst positions ; larger firms , however , hire more women .
And here is what they have to say about the women ’s performance versus the men’s :
We find women cover roughly 9 stocks on average compared to 10 for men .
Women ’s earnings estimates tend to be less accurate .
After controlling for forecast characteristics , the difference in accuracy is roughly equivalent to four years of experience .
Despite reduced coverage and lower forecast accuracy , we find women are significantly more likely to be designated as All - Stars , which suggests they outperform at other aspects of the job such as client service .
If you assume that an All - Star designation ( bestowed by Institutional Investor ) increases one ’s chances of promotion , this would seem to suggest that female analysts are overpromoted despite underperforming their male colleagues .
The study also seems to suggest that women ’s quantitative skills are worse than men’s but their “ people skills ” are better .
PDF stands for Portable Document Format and it was created by Adobe to ease document exchange .
doPDF is a free PDF printer that does what the name suggests , creates PDF files .
Once installed it will allow you to convert any type of printable documents to PDF files .
doPDF installs itself as a virtual PDF printer driver so after a successful installation will appear in your Printers and Faxes list and also in the list of All Programs .
Using doPDF you can convert to PDF in two ways :
Print to PDF via the virtual printer driver doPDF .
You would do this exactly as you print to a regular printer , just the result will be a PDF file , not a printed piece of paper .
Using the doPDF Startup window .
doPDF has an executable file ( accessible from the start program group ) that you can run in order to start a conversion wizard .
The remark , which raised a loud laugh from the assembled press pool , capped a joint appearance that exposed how relations between the two men have become strained in the past two years , since Washington began criticising Putin 's iron grip on Russia 's media and politics .
Bush said that , during two hours of discussions , ' I talked about my desire to promote institutional change in parts of the world like Iraq where there 's a free press and free religion .
I told [ Putin ] a lot of people in our country ... would hope that Russia would do the same thing .
I fully understand , however , that there will be a Russian style of democracy . '
Putin replied , smiling : ' I 'll be honest with you : we , of course , would not want to have a democracy like in Iraq . '
Bush interrupted to say ' Just wait ' - a reference to Iraq 's democracy being in its infancy - before Putin continued : ' Nobody knows better than us how we can strengthen our own nation .
But we know for sure that we cannot strengthen our nation without developing democratic institutions .
And this is the path that we 'll certainly take ; but certainly we will do this by ourselves . '
Bush likes to speak of his close friendship with Putin ; the White House claims it enables a frank exchange on sensitive issues such as the alleged backsliding of democracy in Russia and Putin 's outright opposition to the Iraq war .
Putin , however , is cooler about his friendship with Bush .
But the two men did present some show of harmony in resurrecting an old idea to combat the threat of nuclear terrorism by setting up international enrichment centres to control atomic material under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Prime Minister Tony Blair secured a coup at the summit by ensuring that a separate discussion will be held in St Petersburg on progress towards meeting the ambitious goals to free Africa from poverty , made at the last G8 meeting in Gleneagles a year ago .
Blair himself will lead the discussion , which will also embrace efforts to combat climate change , including using new mechanisms outside the Kyoto Protocol as a way of engaging the Americans .
Blair is also increasingly hopeful that the summit will kickstart trade development talks , which have failed to make progress owing to disputes between America , the EU and Brazil .
Number 10 is not expecting a deal , but hopes progress will be made on the details over the next month .
If nothing happens in the next few weeks , Bush will lose his mandate to negotiate with the WTO and will have to go back to an increasingly protectionist Congress to try to get it renewed .
With Russia determined to pursue its agenda on energy security - code for greater Russian access to European markets - Blair is eager to widen the discussion from the supply of energy to its over - use and impact on the climate .
The talks otherwise ended with little real progress .
Discussions over Russia 's membership of the WTO stalled again .
Bush and Putin were vague over their joint approaches over North Korea and Iran .
Bush said : ' I 'm confident that we can get something done at the United Nations . '
Putin added : ' If the Iranians see that the US and Russia are working together , they will see the seriousness of our intent . '
When a project with the size and scope of KDE gets to be as big as it is , sometimes changing a decision established almost a decade earlier is very difficult .
KDE has relied on autotools to build most of the project since its inception , but for the last year , KDE 4 has been building with CMake , a newer build system that is rapidly becoming a heavyweight contender in the world of buildsystems .
Read on for more ...
This article focuses on CMake , which is not actually part of KDE , but is developed independently by Kitware and a team of open source developers .
It is released under a BSD - style license .
I can't really show much in the way of screenshots for a build system , but I will do my best to explain why CMake has been a welcome change to the KDE development process .
But before we talk about CMake , a little history lesson about KDE and autotools .
KDE has used Qt since the beginning , and one of the nice features of Qt is the meta - object compiler ( moc ) .
Autotools had to be extended to support using moc as a pre-processor for most of KDE 's header files .
That was only the beginning though , as KDE developers wrote the ground - breaking DCOP communication protocol which also had the side effect of adding more types of files that had to be autogenerated during the build process .
The developers added document compilers , tools that automatically handled translations , and tools that compiled configuration file classes from XML : Qt's User Interface compiler ( for .ui files ) was born and needed to be supported by the build system .
They also needed to add a whole suite of new configure checks , options , etc. to support all of the features that KDE was using .
The KDE build system was evolving into a very complex animal , and using autotools did not scale well .
By the KDE 3 series , there were only a select handful of elite build gurus who could understand the whole of KDE 's build system .
KDE developers had trouble even moving things from one folder to another without having to spend hours tweaking build files to get it to compile again .
And in some cases , starting an independent KDE project meant shipping up to 500 KiB of autotools support files for even a simple ' hello world ' type application .
Something obviously had to be done for KDE 4 to improve this situation , and at an Akademy 2005 meeting , it was decided to explore other build system options .
Initially , SCons was prototyped for building KDE , but it was slow going , and after several months of work it still did not handle kdelibs well enough to dump autotools .
One of the bigger problems with SCons was its lack of modularity .
So , as is often the case with KDE , he who codes , decides : Alexander Neundorf stepped in and did the initial port to CMake which went very smoothly , and he did so with the support of the CMake developers .
It took only a few weeks to get much of KDE building smoothly using CMake , and autotools was finally dumped !
The CMake developers have been very supportive of KDE 's transition .
They even joined KDE 's buildsystem mailing list to help out .
This relationship has been beneficial to both projects .
When KDE started to really stress the capabilities of the still - maturing CMake system , KDE developers started a dialogue with them suggesting improvements - and they were happy for the feedback .
As a result , CMake has seen improvements that are beneficial to all projects using the buildsystem .
Our working relationship aside , CMake has greatly improved the process of building KDE .
Projects using CMake take less time to get started , since there is less time spent fighting with the build system .
One KDE developer says , " CMake does n't make you want to shoot yourself with a nailgun when building your project anymore . "
The way CMake works is by processing an easy to read file called ' CMakeLists.
txt ' which the developer adds to their source folder .
When you run the ' cmake ' command , it looks for this file , and based on its contents , it generates Makefiles ( on UNIX ) , or using a command - line switch it can generate XCode project files so you can build Mac applications using OS X's XCode developer tools , or using yet another command , it can even generate MSVC projects from your sources .
One of the best KDE - related features of CMake is that it can automatically generate KDevelop project files based on the same ' CMakeLists.txt ' used to generate the Makefiles .
KDE 's code ( with a few exceptions ) was already pretty portable , however it was nearly impossible to build KDE on systems like Windows , where autotools was not as well suited .
Now much of KDE 's improved platform support is thanks to the ease of building on these systems ( And of course , Qt being available as GPL on these systems ) .
In KDE 3.x , building KDE using the recommended methods looked something like this :
% ./ configure -- prefix= / foo --enable - debug
% make
# make install
As you can tell , this is pretty standard autotools - style building , except that the scripts which controlled the build process are pretty hard to understand .
With CMake , there are some syntax changes ( which may actually be less obvious than the old , familiar configure switches ) , but the commands are mostly the same .
% cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/ foo \
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull .
% make
# make install
This syntax does not look like a huge improvement , but looks can be deceiving .
CMake searches for dependencies several times faster than the './ configure ' process did .
CMake builds KDE 4's kdelibs about 40 % faster than autotools build KDE 3.5.6's kdelibs , mostly due to a lack of libtool in the toolchain for CMake .
The CMake toolchain ( for UNIX ) looks something like : cmake + make , whereas the autotools chain for KDE 3.5.6 looked something like : automake + autoconf + libtool + make + sh + perl + m4 .
I 'm going to rely on some of my own personal experiences here to help explain how much easier CMake is to use : Aaron Seigo asked for some help to port some of kdesktop 's components into krunner so that kdesktop could finally be killed off in the KDE 4 tree .
This is the sort of task that I would not have attempted to tackle in the KDE 3.x tree , not because the code was any harder , but because the build system was so difficult to deal with .
In all likelihood , I would not have volunteered for such a task for KDE 3 , but with KDE 4 and CMake , after moving the code around and doing some class renaming and such , I smoothly inserted the ported code into the build system , modifying only two or three lines of krunner 's CMake build files .
It built after a few minutes , and linked and installed .
I was so impressed that I 've kept contributing porting help .
In KDE 3 , I probably would have been stumped by the build system ( not the actual KDE code ) and given up , not bothering to commit my code to KDE SVN .
This only goes to show that the build gurus of KDE can worry a lot less these days , as anyone can get their projects up and running .
Your milage may vary , but many developers have expressed similar feelings when dealing with the ' CMakeLists.txt ' syntax vs. ' autotools ' .
However , almost all of the KDE developers would now be considered CMake newbies .
The CMake developers have been personally involved in ensuring that KDE 's transition is as smooth as possible .
The switch to CMake is n't the first time KDE has changed one of the technologies central to its development .
When KDE was younger , we used CVS to control access to the sources .
Maintenance of the CVS server was not scaling well as KDE was growing , amassing enormous amounts of code dating back to its original commits .
Subversion ( SVN ) offerred a promising new revision control system that was a better fit for what KDE needed to accomplish , and was easier on our servers .
At the time , however , no project the size of KDE had migrated to SVN , and it was a real test for the Subversion software .
But KDE and SVN have been a pretty good fit , and since KDE migrated , many other projects have since followed in its footsteps .
KDE 's use of CMake has helped to raise the public profile of the buildsystem , much like how the switch to Subversion helped their profile .
Other projects have been switching to CMake too , including ( but not limited to ) : Scribus , Rosegarden ( switched from SCons ) , PlPlot , ChickenScheme , and more .
There is also work being done to support building KDE 3.x programs using CMake ( KPilot for KDE 3 can build using CMake , for example ) .
Projects looking for an easier way to build whilst adding support for more platforms should give CMake a try .
Adding a ' CMakeLists.txt ' file to your sources does not interfere with your project 's existing build system and can give you a good overview of what CMake can do for you .
And , like KDE , if there 's something it cannot handle , the CMake team is very open to improvements .

The Cassini radar image ( left ) shows one of Titan 's seas is larger than Lake Superior ( right )
The dark features , detected by Cassini 's radar , are much bigger than any lakes already detected on Titan .
The largest is some 100,000 sq km ( 39,000 sq miles ) - greater in extent than North America 's Lake Superior .
It covers a greater fraction of Titan than the proportion of Earth covered by the Black Sea .
The Black Sea is the Earth 's largest inland sea and covers about 0.085 % of our planet 's surface .
The newly observed body on Titan covers at least 0.12 % of that world 's surface .
Cassini team members argue that this gives them reason to call it a sea .
Since Cassini's radar has caught only a portion of each of the new features , only their minimum size is known .
Details were presented here in Texas at the 38th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference .
Methane and ethane
Titan is the second largest moon in the Solar System ; only Jupiter 's Ganymede satellite is bigger .
While there is no definitive proof that these seas contain liquid , their shape , their dark appearance in radar that indicates smoothness , along with other properties , point to the presence of liquids .
The liquids are probably a combination of methane and ethane , given the conditions on Titan and the abundance of methane and ethane gases and clouds in Titan 's atmosphere .
BIGGEST MOONS ( TOP 10 ) ( 1 ) Ganymede - Jupiter ( 2 ) Titan - Saturn ( 3 ) Callisto - Jupiter ( 4 ) Io - Jupiter ( 5 ) Moon - Earth ( 6 ) Europa - Jupiter ( 7 ) Triton - Neptune ( 8 ) Titania - Uranus ( 9 ) Rhea - Saturn ( 10 ) Oberon - Uranus
" Carl Sagan [ the astronomer ] said that Titan must be covered with oceans , and that these replenished the atmosphere with methane , " explained Charles Wood , chair of space studies at the University of North Dakota , US .
But that vision of hydrocarbon oceans had to be scrapped when Cassini peered through Titan 's organic haze and found a chaotic , geologically active surface , but no large bodies of liquid .
Recently , the orbiter started to spot lake - like features at Titan 's northerly regions .
" They are limited to about 65 degrees latitude , " said Charles Wood , although he added that river - like channels seemed to be everywhere on Titan .
The discovery of these even larger bodies might hold the solution to the problem of replenishment of the atmosphere with methane .
After making these findings , Cassini team members plan to re-point the orbiter 's radar instrument during a May flyby so that it can pass directly over the large dark features imaged by the cameras .
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of the US space agency ( Nasa ) , the European Space Agency ( Esa ) and the Italian Space Agency ( Asi ) .

Hubble was last serviced by the shuttle in 2002
Without another servicing call by shuttle astronauts , Hubble is expected to last another two to three years .
At the crux of this is whether to risk flying astronauts on the shuttle without the International Space Station available as an emergency shelter .
Nasa administrator Michael Griffin is expected to announce on Tuesday whether the mission will go ahead .
Nasa looked to the station as an orbital safe haven after the Columbia shuttle broke apart on re-entry in 2003 .
Columbia 's heat shield was damaged unknowingly during launch .
The shuttles cannot fly from Hubble 's orbit to reach the station , so if a Hubble repair crew 's ship was too damaged to safely fly home , Nasa has little time to mount a rescue before the shuttle 's power runs out .
' Do-able thing '
" A lot of things are lining up that says Hubble is going to be a do - able kind of thing , " said deputy shuttle program manager John Shannon .
" The real question on Hubble is going to be the launch - on - need .
You just do n't have the orbital lifetime on a Hubble mission to be able to get another vehicle launched .
It 's going to be very tough .
" We 're going to have to go into the Hubble decision not counting on the launch - on - need vehicle , " Mr Shannon added .
" That 's the difficult question the agency 's going to have . "
If the mission is approved , astronauts will add two new science instruments and replace the telescope 's batteries and gyroscopes , which are used to point and position the observatory .
The improvements and upgrades should extend Hubble 's orbital lifetime to at least 2013 , Nasa says .
Since the accident , Nasa has made three shuttle flights to test post -Columbia safety and design changes and to resume space station assembly .
The tests bode well for a Hubble flight , with astronauts successfully demonstrating how the shuttle 's robot arm and a new extension boom could be used for thorough heat shield inspections during flight .
Stable boom
The boom also proved to be a stable enough work platform if spacewalking astronauts had to leave the shuttle to make any heat shield repairs .
Shuttles now fly with an assortment of heat shield patches , fillers and application tools .
The biggest hurdle was to fix the problem that damaged the shuttle Columbia in the first place , namely foam falling off the ship 's external fuel tank during liftoff .
Nasa 's initial redesign failed , but its next two flights successfully showed far less tank foam shedding during the crucial moments after liftoff .
Additional improvements will be made on tanks slated to fly next year .
Confidence in the programme has grown to the point where Nasa plans to resume in December nighttime launchings of the space shuttle , a practice that opens many more flight opportunities for station assembly missions .
Daylight launch requirements were imposed after the accident to assure cameras had clear views of the tank to detect any flyaway foam .
Nasa is under a strict deadline to finish the station by 2010 when the shuttle fleet is scheduled to be retired .
Aside from the possibility of one flight to Hubble , targeted for 2008 , all remaining missions are devoted to station assembly .
Hubble , which was launched in 1990 , has become the world 's flagship astronomical observatory , delivering to audiences worldwide unprecedented pictures of the universe and gathering information that has led to new understanding of how the cosmos formed and what it contains .
" I think everyone is quite hopeful that this Hubble mission can happen , " said Harry Ferguson , an associate astronomer with the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , Maryland , " The political desire is there .
Quite honestly , it 's a technical decision now . "
Firefox memory leak ?
It does n’t have one .
Unfortunately , because of the way it ’s configured to run out of the box it * looks * like it has one .
Follow these simple steps to get your Firefox memory usage under control .
These configuration changes are a trade - off between internet browsing speed and memory usage .
They are most useful if you are multitasking and need Firefox to be less of a memory hog while using other applications .
# 1 : about : config
Type “ about : config ” into your address bar to access the hidden configuration options for Firefox .
# 2 : browser.cache.memory.capacity
Controls how much memory is used to cache pages .
Right click on the page and choose New then Integer and create an integer called browser.cache.memory.capacity and set it to a low number .
This controls how many kilobytes of memory are used for the browser ’s cache .
NOTE : number in screenshot is too small .
Aim for 80 % of whatever the default is .
# 3 : browser.cache.disk.capacity
Controls how much disk space is used to cache pages in kilobytes .
Set browser.cache.disk.capacity to between 5000 or 15000 .
128 MB to 512M -> 5000 .
512 BM to 1GB of RAM -> use 15000
# 4 : config.trim_on_minimize ( optional )
Configure Firefox to swap memory to disk when minimized .
This will make Firefox less responsive if you minimize / maximize a lot , but it is good if you need to free memory while multi-tasking to other applications .
Right click on the page and choose New then Boolean and create a boolean called config.
trim_on_minimize and set it to true .
Now when you minimize the window it will free up memory .
# 5 : network.prefetch-next
Network link prefetch will download all pages with the rel= ” prefetch ” tag .
This uses up more memory than you would otherwise think .
Set network .
prefetch - next to false .
# 6 : browser.sessionhistory.max_total_viewers
This controls how many pages of history are kept in the back / forward buttons .
Lower the value to something acceptable .
If you do not use back / forward often then you can set this very low .
Set browser.sessionhistory.max_total_viewers to a low number .

One of the purest and most fascinating examples of the “ wisdom of crowds ” in action comes courtesy of a unique online contest called Probability Sports run by mathematician Brian Galebach .
In the contest , each participant states how likely she thinks it is that a team will win a particular sporting event .
For example , one contestant may give the Steelers a 62 % chance of defeating the Seahawks on a given day ; another may say that the Steelers have only a 44 % chance of winning .
Thousands of contestants give probability judgments for hundreds of events : for example , in 2004 , 2,231 Probability Football participants each recorded probabilities for 267 US NFL Football games ( 15 - 16 games a week for 17 weeks ) .
An important aspect of the contest is that participants earn points according to the quadratic scoring rule , a scoring method designed to reward accurate probability judgments ( participants maximize their expected score by reporting their best probability judgments ) .
This makes Probability Sports one of the largest collections of incentivized1 probability judgments , an extremely interesting and valuable dataset from a research perspective .
The first striking aspect of this dataset is that most individual participants are very poor predictors .
In 2004 , the best score was 3747 .
Yet the average score was an abysmal - 944 points , and the median score was - 275 .
In fact , 1,298 out of 2,231 participants scored below zero .
To put this in perspective , a hypothetical participant who does no work and always records the default prediction of “ 50 % chance ” for every team receives a score of 0 .
Almost 60 % of the participants actually did worse than this by trying to be clever .
Participants are also poorly calibrated .
To the right is a histogram dividing participants ’ predictions into five regions : 0-20 % , 20 -40 % , 40-60 % , 60 - 80 % , and 80 - 100 % .
The y - axis shows the actual winning percentages of NFL teams within each region .
Calibrated predictions would fall roughly along the x=y diagonal line , shown in red .
As you can see , participants tended to voice much more extreme predictions than they should have : teams that they said had a less than 20 % chance of winning actually won almost 30 % of the time , and teams that they said had a greater than 80 % chance of winning actually won only about 60 % of the time .
Yet something astonishing happens when we average together all of these participants ’ poor and miscalibrated predictions .
The “ average predictor ” , who simply reports the average of everyone else ’s predictions as its own prediction , scores 3371 points , good enough to finish in 7th place out of 2,231 participants !
( A similar effect can be seen in the 2003 Probability Football dataset as reported by Chen et al. and Servan - Schreiber et al . )
Even when we average together the very worst participants — those participants who actually scored below zero in the contest — the resulting predictions are amazingly good .
This “ average of bad predictors ” scores an incredible 2717 points ( ranking in 62nd place overall ) , far outstripping any of the individuals contributing to the average ( the best of whom finished in 934th place ) , prompting someone in this audience to call the effect the “ wisdom of fools ” .
The only explanation is that , although all these individuals are clearly prone to error , somehow their errors are roughly independent and so cancel each other out when averaged together .
Daniel Reeves and I follow up with a companion post on Robin Hanson ’s OvercomingBias forum with some advice on how predictors can improve their probability judgments by averaging their own estimates with one or more others ’ estimates .
In a related paper , Dani et al. search for an aggregation algorithm that reliably outperforms the simple average , with modest success .

With all the tumult in the news media today – the decline of the old media , the rise of the citizen journalist , the startling discovery that a woman can , in fact , read a teleprompter from behind a big desk just like a man – it is sometimes the subtle changes that go unnoticed .
Take , for example , the recent decision by Time magazine to hit the newsstand on Fridays instead of Mondays .
What difference does a few days make ?
Possibly a big one .
And the fact that it is going to happen at all shows how much the news media are changing .
For years the newsweeklies have been a picture of stodgy stability .
The three big titles – Time , Newsweek , and US News & World Report – have changed their tone over time , focusing less on " hard news " and more on trend , health , and entertainment coverage .
But their essential formula , a weekly low - cost digest of a little bit of everything , has stayed relatively constant .
That 's what makes the doings at Time so interesting .
Soon after the magazine announced that it would hit newsstands on Friday starting in January , stories also surfaced that Time was considering reducing the costs of maintaining its circulation by allowing its reader base to drop by as much as 25 percent .
Why the big changes ?
This is an industry in need of some changing .
Since 1988 , Time 's circulation has fallen by about 13 percent .
US News & World Report has also dropped by about 13 percent .
Newsweek , meanwhile , has lost about 6 percent of its paid readership .
But during that same time period , other titles have thrived .
Take The Economist .
The British news weekly has seen its circulation jump by about 300 percent , despite the fact that it is less flashy , more serious , and costs more than twice as much as its US counterparts .
And since its launch in 2001 , The Week , a new kind of Reader 's - Digest - type summary of news accounts from other organizations , has attracted 439,000 readers .
So maybe it's all about format and content , and maybe Time 's moves indicate that the other weeklies are beginning to notice .
Time 's new publishing schedule will mean it hits the streets on the same day as its British competitor .
And Time 's idea about circulation , placing less emphasis on quantity , suggests an approach that several publications , including The Economist , have pursued :
It 's not how many subscribers you have ; it 's who they are .
The strategy is practiced by media outlets that are sometimes called the " elite media . "
They aim at better educated , more - affluent audiences that have more money to spend on news and are more desirable to advertisers .
The news outlets that serve them place a premium on trying to bring more depth and breadth to their coverage .
Among newspapers , the rise of the elite media can be seen in the growing and increasingly nationalized circulations of The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal .
On radio , it can be calculated in the increase of National Public Radio 's audience .
In magazines , the prime example is The Economist .
If Time , which , like the other newsweeklies , has n't made serious changes for decades , is considering joining that club , it may signify a kind of tipping point for the American media .
A great segregation of media outlets may be upon us , with many more news organizations choosing a specific path for their coverage .
There would be definite advantages to a flourishing " elite " media .
Those interested in more complex news coverage would have a broader list of places to go and , overall , the quality of the news available to consumers might increase .
But there is a twofold problem as well : 1 ) " serious coverage " might be considered an " elite media " trait only , and 2 ) the growth of these outlets might lead to a dumbing down ( OK , maybe a further dumbing down ) among other mainstream news sources .
As wealthier , more news - focused audiences leave mainstream outlets , those outlets will be forced to reach out to different groups to fill the holes in their audience – groups that probably have lighter definitions of news .
In other words , a small group of coverage - rich news media will get richer while the rest get poorer in their content .
Is that good or bad ?
Both , probably .
But good or bad , if we drift down that road , it will mean a different kind of democracy and a different society .
Just think , there may come a day not too long from now when Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes 's baby not only finds time on the network news – as baby Suri did last week on CBS – but leads the newscast .
The good news is you wo n't have to watch it .
The bad news is a lot of others will tune in and possibly find little else .

For a long time now , on and off , I 've been writing a Lisp tutorial for regular programmers .
The idea was not to explain intricate details of Lisp , but help people understand what exactly the nature of the language is , and why some of its features are great for modern software development .
I 'm very interested in feedback so I can improve upon the tutorial and explain things people still do n't understand .

I am haunted by Gabriela Ocampo .
Last year , she dropped out of the 12th grade at Birmingham High School in Los Angeles after failing algebra six times in six semesters , trying it a seventh time and finally just despairing over ever getting it .
So , according to the Los Angeles Times , she “ gathered her textbooks , dropped them at the campus book room and , without telling a soul , vanished from Birmingham High School . ”
Gabriela , this is Richard :
There 's life after algebra .
In truth , I do n't know what to tell Gabriela .
The L.A. school district now requires all students to pass a year of algebra and a year of geometry in order to graduate .
This is something new for Los Angeles ( although 17 states require it ) and it is the sort of vaunted education reform that is supposed to close the science and math gap and make the U.S. more competitive .
All it seems to do , though , is ruin the lives of countless kids .
In L.A. , more kids drop out of school on account of algebra than any other subject .
I can hardly blame them .
I confess to be one of those people who hate math .
I can do my basic arithmetic all right ( although not percentages ) but I flunked algebra ( once ) , barely passed it the second time -- the only proof I 've ever seen of divine intervention -- somehow passed geometry and resolved , with a grateful exhale of breath , that I would never go near math again .
I let others go on to intermediate algebra and trigonometry while I busied myself learning how to type .
In due course , this came to be the way I made my living .
Typing : Best class I ever took .
Here 's the thing , Gabriela :
You will never need to know algebra .
I have never once used it and never once even rued that I could not use it .
You will never need to know -- never mind want to know -- how many boys it will take to mow a lawn if one of them quits halfway and two more show up later -- or something like that .
Most of math can now be done by a computer or a calculator .
On the other hand , no computer can write a column or even a thank - you note -- or reason even a little bit .
If , say , the school asked you for another year of English or , God forbid , history , so that you actually had to know something about your world , I would be on its side .
But algebra ?
Please .
Gabriela , sooner or later someone 's going to tell you that algebra teaches reasoning .
This is a lie propagated by , among others , algebra teachers .
Writing is the highest form of reasoning .
This is a fact .
Algebra is not .
The proof of this , Gabriela , is all the people in my high school who were whizzes at math but did not know a thing about history and could not write a readable English sentence .
I can cite Shelly , whose last name will not be mentioned , who aced algebra but when called to the board in geography class , located the Sahara Desert right where the Gobi usually is .
She was off by a whole continent .
Look , Gabriela , I am not anti-algebra .
It has its uses , I suppose , and I think it should be available for people who want to take it .
Maybe students should even be compelled to take it , but it should not be a requirement for graduation .
There are those of you , and Gabriela you are one , who know what it is like to stare at an algebra problem until you have eyeballed a hole in the page and not understand a thing you 're seeing .
There are those of us who know the sweat , the panic , the trembling , cold fear that comes from the teacher casting an eye in your direction and calling you to the blackboard .
It is like being summoned to your own execution .
Almost 20 years ago , I wrote a similar column about algebra .
Math teachers struck back with a vengeance .
They made so many claims for algebra 's intrinsic worth that I felt , as I once had in class , like a dummy .
Once again , I just did n't get it .
Still , in the two decades since , I have lived a pretty full life and never , ever used -- or wanted to use -- algebra .
I was lucky , though .
I had graduated from high school and gone on to college .
It 's different for you , Gabriela .
Algebra ruined many a day for me .
Now it could ruin your life .
I am so mad right now .
I devote a small part of each and every day to perusing some of the dopiest , most inane websites on the net .
There are about a dozen creationist web sites I monitor on a daily basis , not to mention several very right - wing political sites .
I 've grown so accustomed to their relentless stupidity that I barely notice it anymore .
But I read a number of other sites that are supposedly more reliable .
At those sites I expect to read things that will provide some food for thought , even if , in the end , I disagree with them .
So encountering breathtaking , creationist - level stupidity at such a site is just too depressing .
I 'm sure you 've figured out by now that I am referring to this column , by Richard Cohen , from the February 16 edition of .
We consider it in full : I can blame them .
I 'll bet real money that every one of those kids who dropped out of school on account of algebra had problems that go well beyond difficulties in math .
Were these students who were generally doing well in their other subjects but , doggone it , just could n't pass algebra ?
Or were these people who did n't take school very seriously , had little in the way of discipline , and were just scraping by in their other , less demanding classes ?
I 'm sorry , but no one of normal intelligence fails algebra six times simply because the subject is just so darn difficult .
I 'm glad to hear that LA now requires a year of algebra and a year of geometry to graduate .
I 'm amazed that only 17 states do likewise .
Incredibly , though , that 's not the supid part of the column :
It is a truism among mathematicians that mathematics is the only subject that people brag about being bad at .
Cohen thinks it 's just the cutest thing that he has trouble with percentages .
Can you think of any other academic subject where he would proudly joke about how bad he is at it ?
The following fantasy conversation plays in my mind from time to time : NICE PERSON AT PARTY : What do you do ?
ME : I 'm a mathematician .
NICE PERSON : Oh , ( giggles ) , I was never any good at math .
ME : That 's because you 're an idiot .
I never say that of course .
No , usually I say something tactful like , “ You just never had the right teacher . ”
But it really is irritating when otherwise intelligent and well - educated people act like you 're the weird one for being good at math .
The fact is that things like math phobia , or the idea that people 's brains are wired differently , or that some people just can't do math , are total bilge .
Hostility towards mathematics has nothing to do with any of those things .
In reality it is just standard anti-intellectualism .
Nothing more glamorous or interesting than that .
Actually , though , we still have not reached the truly dumb part of the column : Nowone of the dumbest things I 've read in a while .
And remember , I read websites that say things like : “ If humans evolved from apes , why do we still have apes ? ” First , how on Earth does Cohen know what Ms. Ocampo will need to know later in her life ?
The fact is that if she wants to pursue any sort of scientific subject she will inevitably need to know algebra to do that .
As evidence that Ms. Ocampo will never need algebra , Cohen presents the fact that he has never had to use it .
He 's never even rued not knowing it !
I have no doubt that Cohen is telling the truth here , but that only proves that Cohen has led an empty , intellectually impoverished , life .
It says nothing about what students should learn in high school .
He then presents a standard caricature of what algebra is .
He has apparently overlooked the possibility that sometimes you use an unrealistic , contrived situation to illustrate a more general principle .
But the idea that calculators and computers can do “ most of math ” is really just too much .
Calculators and computers do not do math at all .
They do computation .
It 's clear at this point that Cohen thinks algebra , and mathematics generally , is just about manipulating symbols according to arbitrary rules .
That 's like saying that carpentry is about hammering nails and sawing wood .
Mathematics is about the reasoning process you go through in taking the information you have and inferring the things that you need .
Algebra and computations are just tools you use in the course of implementing such reasoning .
Incredibly , Cohen then tells us that computers can't reason - not even a little bit .
Well , duh !
That 's the whole point !
And then , to cap off this masterpiece of inanity , Cohen offers up his examples of genuinely useful subjects : History and English .
Oh , for heaven 's sake .
Thirty seconds with a good internet connection is enough to learn any bit of history you might be interested in .
And ?
Has anyone other than an English professor ever needed to read Dickens or Shakespeare ?
Of course , the problem here is that Cohen has a pathetically empty idea of what education is all about .
Education is n't job training .
Education is n't about teaching you how to use an ATM , or balance a checkbook , or any of those other things you need to know in your day - to - day life .
You do n't need school to teach you those things .
The reason you learn about history , or read great literature , or study math and science when you 're in school is precisely because you wo n't do these things in your day - to - day life .
You do n't read Dickens because you think it is going to get you a job someday .
You read Dickens because the man could write , and your life will be just a little richer for being shown what the English language can be made to do .
You read Dickens because by doing so you realize that the things people worried about a hundred years ago are mostly the same things they worry about today .
Likewise for any of the other things you learn in school .
Cohen seems to have this idea that education is about learning a bunch of facts .
And if those facts do n't materially help you in the course of your professional life , then it was a waste of time to learn them in the first place .
When teenagers display attitudes like that we chalk it up to immaturity and the lack of a long - term perspective .
Columnists for major newspapers do n't have that excuse .
Cohen continues :
And this paragraph is n't even coherent .
Writing is the highest from of reasoning ?
What ?
The proof of this is that some old classmate of his aced algebra but could n't find the Sahara Desert on a map ?
Does this guy understand what reasoning is ?
Reasoning is what you do when you are told that a hen and a half can lay an egg in a half in day and a half and want to determine how long it will take seven hens to lay seven eggs .
Finding the Sahara Desert on a map is just a matter of being in possession of certain facts .
Cohen continues :
Why not take that attitude with every subject ?
Maybe we should just make every subject available to students who want to study it , but then leave it up to the kids to decide what they need to know ?
As for the uses of algebra , do I really need to point out that every bit of technology Cohen uses every day was invented by scientists , that virtually every major branch of science has mathematics at its core , and that no matter what branch of mathematics you are using it is certain that algebraic manipulations reside at its foundation ?
Of all the subjects he could have labelled as useless , Cohen could not possibly have made a worse choice .
As for the rest of this paragraph , I 'm getting weepy .
When you 're not understanding what you are reading in your textbook , the solution is to work harder and ask questions .
Everyone has subjects they 're not good at .
But we do n't whine and blame the subject .
As for being called to the blackboard , I do n't know many algebra teachers who actually do that .
And I know even fewer who , when the student says he does n't know how to do the problem , ridicules the student for his ignorance .
Cohen closes with : Sorry , but I do n't think it 's unreasonable for a high school diploma to certify that you know a tiny amount of higher mathematics .
As I said , I expect this sort of stupidity and short - sightedness from the creationists and the right - wingers .
But Cohen is supposed to be one of the Post 's liberal columnists .
Yet here he is promoting the very silliness he 's supposed to be fighting against .
Ugh .

If you ’re an antiwar conservative or libertarian , remember when it was OK to oppose the war but support the troops ?
Remember when it was OK to " criticize your commander in chief during a time of war " without committing treason ?
Remember when you were n’t accused of hating your country , God , and kittens for questioning the official reasons for going to war ?
Ah , the glorious old days in the spring of 1999 .
I ’m referring to the war in Kosovo , of course .
This was a war to stop " ethnic cleansing " and " end hatred . "
Serbian atrocities were vastly overstated and the now - deceased Slobodan Milosevic was painted as the Hitler of the 1990s , even though he was losing a province every couple of years and his country was falling apart .
This was another " good war , " a liberal ’s war .
We were on a mission to stop ethnic hatred and mass murder ; at least , that ’s what we were told .
Over seven years later , however , the region is still a mess .
Hatred , murder , and chaos still reign in Kosovo and the rest of former Yugoslavia .
It ’s probably safe to say that most Americans lost interest quickly after the two - and - a - half month NATO bombing campaign ended in 1999 and peacekeepers arrived .
It is perhaps appropriate to say that the war in Kosovo is today ’s " Forgotten War . "
The Left by and large supported this war , with some dissenting voices .
The Right was split , but for the most part opposed the war .
Even though it was technically a NATO mission , the United States and Britain led the charge for military action .
Former President Bill Clinton was instrumental in getting America heavily involved in the region .
Today , however , the Left is generally antiwar , and the establishment Right is generally supportive of Bush ’s policies in Iraq .
Could the massive " flip - flopping " on both sides be boiled down to politics instead of principle ?
What else could explain it ?
That the majority of the Right was against the Balkans adventure is well documented .
In March 1999 , the Washington Times ran an informative article , " Conservatives Not Behind Kosovo Effort , ” which detailed vast opposition to Clinton ’s war .
The article quotes academic Angelo Codevilla as saying , " You can shoot a canonball through the ranks of conservatives and not find anyone who supports this war . "
According to Brent Bozell III , " Sentiment is very strong that there is no rhyme or reason to get involved in Kosovo . "
Bozell later used his media watchdog organization to blast coverage of the war in Iraq that was not favorable enough to the cause .
A search for " Iraq " at Bozell ’s Media Research Center yields numerous results blasting " antiwar " coverage and personalities ( with " antiwar " often meaning " insufficiently enthusiastic about the war " ) .
An even more entertaining column detailing the transformation of the hawks - turned - doves - turned - hawks can be found from the folks over at Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting ( FAIR ) , a " progressive " media watchdog group .
In a spring 2003 article titled “ Dissent , Disloyalty , and Double Standards , " analyst Steve Rendell compiled a number of great on - the - record quotes from notable conservative figures who turned in their peace pipes for machine guns between 1999 and 2003 .
For instance , in a May 1999 " Limbaugh Letter , " Rush asked , " Why Kosovo ? "
Not only that , but he criticized both the rationale for and the execution of the war .
According to FAIR , Rush was also critical of the " shifting justifications " for war in the Balkans .
We must pause at this point to ask ourselves :
Why did Rush hate our troops ?
What was he eating that spring that caused him to be a " Blame America First " antiwar agitator ?
Luckily , by 2003 Rush came to his senses about those antiwar sissies .
Here ’s what Rush had to say about the opponents of the Iraq war : “ I want to say something about these antiwar demonstrators .
No , let ’s not mince words , let ’s call them what they are : anti-American demonstrators . ”
Apparently , it ’s only OK for a conservative to oppose a war if it ’s a Democratic president who is dropping the bombs .
If it ’s a Republican president , then all critics are anti-American and should move to France , where they belong .
Rush was n’t the only born - again warmonger .
Also in his legion are loud supporters of the current war such as Sean Hannity , Michael Savage , Joe Scarborough , and others .
According to FAIR , Savage called for the arrest of anti-Iraq - war activists .
According to Savage , " Then we can stop some of these maniacs who are encouraging our enemies , weakening our troops ’ resolve , and confusing the American people . "
Savage , however , was singing a much different tune in a 1999 column , " The Oily Tracks Running Through Kosovo . "
According to Savage , " Kosovo was about oil and nothing but oil , with maybe some uranium thrown in and a dash of ‘ wag - the - dog . ’
And you thought it was to save the poor Kosovar Albanians . "
Moreover , the NATO bombing campaign was " shameful and cowardly . "
Sounds almost like the kind of talk from conspiratorial leftists that conservatives love to hate .
Here ’s another quote directly from Savage ’s column :
" Big Oil required a pipeline through Kosovo and the poor Serbs just happened to own the wrong real estate at the wrong time .
How do I know that the Kosovo action was about oil or , to be exact , about establishing a safe haven for an oil pipeline ?
Just recently Bill Clinton signed an historic agreement with Azerbaijan on this very matter . "
Somebody call Michael Moore !
Perhaps
Savage can supply him with some juicy material for a documentary on the Balkans .
There ’s more .
Savage had this to say about the president of the United States and the U.S. Army general who led the NATO forces :
" These international war criminals were led by General Wesley Clark ( a Rhodes Scholar from Arkansaw [ sic ] ) who clicked his shiny heels for the commander - in - grief , Bill Clinton ( another Rhodes Scholar from Arkansaw [ sic ] ) . "
How dare Michael Savage say these kinds of things about our troops and especially our commander in chief !
If he did n’t like it here in America and could n’t support Our President , then he should have just left !
Thank heavens
Savage saw the light before the 2003 invasion , when he said , " Take a look at what ’s happening with Iraq .
You have outright treason being committed by senators like Barbara Boxer .
They might as well be working for Saddam Hussein . "
Savage also professed trust in President Bush because " he ’s the commander in chief , not me , not you , not anyone else " and had information available that the rest of us did n’t have ( information that turned out to be false ) .
The FAIR article also turns up some interesting quotes from individuals such as Bill Bennett , who said Clinton ’s Kosovo policy was " nuts "  but later concluded that opponents of the Iraq war were " obviously helping Saddam Hussein . "
( There were some proponents of the Kosovo war on the Right , including many establishment conservatives .
Some neoconservatives such as Bill Kristol and the Weekly Standard crowd  who never met a war they did n’t like  did support military action in Kosovo .
Even though I strongly disagree with their principles and worldview , at least they are consistent . )
It ’s funny how things change in a few years , or more precisely , how things change from a Democratic president to a Republican president .
According to my fellow conservatives , when a Democrat was president , it was OK to criticize his leadership .
When a Democrat was president , one could " support the troops " and be a patriot in good standing while opposing the Balkans intervention .
When a Democrat was president , humanitarian wars were bad , and indicative of the " New World Order . "
When a Democrat was president , repeatedly changing the rationale for a war was cause for ridicule .
But when a Republican takes office and leads a poorly executed war , based on bad intelligence , with constantly shifting justifications , everything completely changes .
This drastic change in thinking is nowhere more evident than in the minds of many of my fellow Christian Rightists .
The Right in general and the Christian Right in particular utterly despised Clinton , thinking him to be a liar and a pervert .
When he was president , I did n’t hear many admonitions from fellow Christians to " pray for our commander in chief . "
Many Christian conservatives opposed the war in the Balkans and rightly hammered away at Clinton for his foreign policy excesses .
To many Christian conservatives today , however , criticism of President Bush , particularly in the area of foreign policy , is off - limits and a violation of Romans 13 , where the Apostle Paul tells Christians to respect governing authorities ( balance this , however with Revelation 13 and Acts 4:19 - 20 ) .
But when Clinton was president , it was not a sin to be critical of his war efforts .
Funny how things change .
There were of course many conservatives who truly believed the war in Kosovo was wrong and continue to believe that the war in Iraq will prove to be right in the long run .
Fair enough .
But they should not say that those of us conservatives ( or anyone else , for that matter ) who oppose the current war do not have a right to criticize the government , when they did the same thing just over seven years ago .
If the claim is that we must blindly follow President Bush and " support " the war in Iraq even if it is indeed the wrong thing to do , then the conservative flip - floppers all sinned an administration ago when they stood up against Clinton ’s wars .
They must explain why we cannot still love our country and care about our soldiers while opposing the current foreign policy , when they did the same thing under Clinton .
I had thought that the Right ’s opposition to Clinton ’s interventions was a return to the principles of the Old Right and a readjustment of outlook after the Cold War .
Instead , the mainstream Right has blessed and sanctioned the most egregious offenses to liberty in the name of " fighting terrorism " and meddling abroad .
Yes , 9/11 " changed everything , " all right .
Or was it political opportunism that changed everything ?

The above image illustrates where the brain matured during the study participants ' freshman year .
Specifically , changes were observed in the cingulate ( blue , yellow ) , caudate ( red ) , and insula ( orange ) .
( Image courtesy of Baird , Bennett )
Two Dartmouth researchers are one step closer to defining exactly when human maturity sets in .
In a study aimed at identifying how and when a person 's brain reaches adulthood , the scientists have learned that , anatomically , significant changes in brain structure continue after age 18 .
The study , called " Anatomical Changes in the Emerging Adult Brain , " appeared in the Nov. 29 , 2005 , on - line issue of the journal Human Brain Mapping .
It will appear in a forthcoming issue of the journal 's print edition .
Abigail Baird , Assistant Professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences and co-author of the study , explains that their finding is fascinating because the study closely tracked a group of freshman students throughout their first year of college .
She says that this research contributes to the growing body of literature devoted to the period of human development between adolescence and adulthood .
" During the first year of college , especially at a residential college , students have many new experiences , " says Baird .
" They are faced with new cognitive , social , and emotional challenges .
We thought it was important to document and learn from the changes taking place in their brains . "
For the study , Baird and graduate student Craig Bennett looked at the brains of nineteen 18 - year - old Dartmouth students who had moved more than 100 miles to attend college .
A control group of 17 older students , ranging in age from 25 to 35 , were also studied for comparison .
The results indicate that significant changes took place in the brains of these individuals .
The changes were localized to regions of the brain known to integrate emotion and cognition .
Specifically , these are areas that take information from our current body state and apply it for use in navigating the world .
" The brain of an 18 - year - old college freshman is still far from resembling the brain of someone in their mid-twenties , " says Bennett .
" When do we reach adulthood ?
It might be much later than we traditionally think . "

Story Highlights • Amanda Baggs , 26 , is part of new generation of adults with autism
• Baggs communicates using a computer or a voice synthesizer
• 600,000 adults have autism in the U.S. , according to the Autism Society of America
• No cure for autism ; precise causes unknown

( CNN ) --
When I walk into her apartment , Amanda Baggs makes no eye contact .
She does n't come to the door or raise her hand to greet visitors .
In fact , I 'm having a hard time discerning whether she even knows I 'm there .
I say hello and introduce myself , but she remains silent , sitting at her desk , staring out the window , rocking slightly back and forth .
Amanda Baggs is a 26 - year - old woman with autism .
I 've been corresponding with her for weeks via e-mail .
I 've read her Web site , and from her I 've learned a great deal about living with autism .
A video she posted recently on the Internet describes how she experiences the world .
" My language is not about designing words or even visual symbols for people to interpret , " she says in the video .
" It is about being in a constant conversation with every aspect of my environment . "
Admittedly , it 's hard to recognize her in real life , after meeting her online persona first .
( Read Dr. Sanjay Gupta 's thoughts after meeting Amanda Baggs . )
I awkwardly carry on a one - sided conversation , until she grunts .
My attention shifts to her computer slowly booting up .
She clicks on a program .
A keyboard diagram fills the screen .
She begins to type at a staccato pace .
We begin a conversation .
I talk .
She types .
( Watch Amanda communicate in her own way )
This is the Amanda I 've come to know over the past few weeks .
She 's highly intelligent , well read and has a great sense of humor .
She never makes eye contact , but there is no doubt she is interacting with me .
Amanda is part of a new generation of adults with autism .
The Autism Society of America estimates that 600,000 adults are living with autism in the United States .
That number will most likely skyrocket , given the CDC 's recognition of an increase in the numbers of children with autism .
The newest numbers suggest that one in every 150 children has autism .
" The field as a whole has really neglected adults with autism , " says Dr. Eric Hollander , psychiatrist and head of the Seaver and New York Autism Center of Excellence .
Adults with autism live normal life spans and may require long - term medication , therapy and residential placement .
Hollander says the average cost of caring for an individual with autism over a lifetime can be several million dollars .
Autism treatment and research are undeniably centered on children .
The goals are early diagnosis and intervention .
They 're aimed at reducing disruptive behaviors and eventually mainstreaming children with autism into school and society .
At its core , autism is a developmental disorder of communication .
There is no cure .
No one knows the precise causes , but recent science points towards a genetic component with a possible environmental trigger .
Amanda Baggs has severe autism .
She did n't cry when she was born .
She had to be taught how to nurse .
As a little girl , she rocked her head back and forth but could speak .
As she grew , she would go longer and longer without speaking , until her spoken language disappeared altogether .
( Read Amanda 's post to the AC 360 blog on CNN.com . )
She slowly learned how to type .
Now , she relies on her computer or a voice synthesizer linked to a keyboard to interact with people .
According to Hollander , " You might think that these individuals are mentally retarded or have no verbal skills , but in fact , they 're not mentally retarded .
They really understand what is going on and if they utilize a communication device , they can really communicate what they are thinking and feeling . "
For Amanda , it takes a great deal of energy to think in words .
It is not her natural state of mind .
" It 's like being bilingual , " she types .
" A lot of the way I naturally communicate is just through direct response to what is around me in a very physical sort of way .
It 's dealing with patterns and colors rather than with symbolic words . "
( Watch why " normal " communication is n't for Amanda )
The Internet has allowed Amanda to communicate to the whole world .
While standard body language and facial expressions are lost on many with autism , she says many non-verbal people with autism have the ability to communicate with one another through autistic body cues .
Thirty or 40 years ago , life would have been different and much harder for Amanda , says Morton Ann Gernsbacher , a cognitive psychologist who specializes in autism at the University of Wisconsin - Madison .
" The Internet is providing for individuals with autism , what sign language did for the deaf , " she says .
" It allows them to interact with the world and other like - minded individuals on their own terms . "
( Ask Amanda your questions about autism . )
These days , Amanda Baggs lives on her own terms .
With the help of an agency , she moved from California to Vermont about a year and a half ago to be closer to a friend .
And what does Amanda think is the hardest thing about living with autism ?
" Having to navigate a world that is , on all levels , is built for the abilities and deficits of people who are not built remotely like me . "
A. Chris Gajilan is a senior producer with CNN Medical News
Last week , from AP we learned that confidentiality in a couple of traditionally sacrosanct instances has been tossed out the window :
WASHINGTON - The National Security Agency could have legally monitored ordinarily confidential communications between doctors and patients or attorneys and their clients , the Justice Department said Friday of its controversial warrantless surveillance program .
In light of this report , I have a couple of questions for the two factions - the corporatists and the Christianists - that make up the unholy alliance of the GOP .
First , for the country club corporatists :
Are you comfortable with the notion that the executive branch believes it can accumulate information on your attorney - client communications ?
All those patents pending , disturbing research studies you want to suppress , strategy discussions about doing a run-around EPA regulations , positioning yourself against your rival corporations ?
Sure , you gave to Bush - Cheney 2004 until it hurt , but what if a competitor gave until it hurt a little bit more ?
It is n't like BushCo is shy about lending a helping hand to specific favorites , at least according to a recent report from AP :
FEMA breaks promise on Katrina contracts
Agency will extend , not rebid , deals with politically connected firms WASHINGTON - FEMA has broken its promise to reopen four multimillion - dollar no -bid contracts for Hurricane Katrina work , including three that federal auditors say wasted significant amounts of money .
...
Acting FEMA Director R. David Paulison pledged last fall to rebid the contracts , which were awarded to Shaw Group Inc. , Bechtel Corp. , CH2M Hill Inc. and Fluor Corp .
Later , the agency acknowledged the rebidding would n't happen until February .
...
The Shaw Group 's lobbyist , Joe Allbaugh , is a former FEMA director and friend of President Bush .
Bechtel CEO Riley Bechtel served on Bush 's Export Council from 2003 - 2004 , and CH2M Hill Inc. and Fluor Corp. have done extensive previous work for the government .
Are you absolutely certain this gang would n't drop a hint garnered from electronic surveillance to one of these favored companies ?
Or pit you in a bidding war for who really owns this presidency ?
And for you Christianists : Obviously , you never need to see a lawyer because you never break the law .
And G -d knows you never have to see a doctor for embarrassing STD 's like the satanic liberals or consult about sexual dysfunction ( after all , if the Lord wanted you to have sex , he 'd give you an erection , right ?
You resigned yourself to that years ago . ) .
So clearly you 're safe on the attorney / physician front .
But ...
What about conversations with your pastor ?
What about the time you were in need of Scripture citations about how you found Mrs. Kopansky 's bosoms distracting during the church supper ?
Or found yourself a little more interested in Brad Pitt 's musculature as Achilles than in the storyline ?
Or felt the slight call of cybersex with sheep being only a click on the internet away ?
What about those painful and humbling conversations in which you bared your soul , sought guidance for your lusts and greed , described in detail your temptations , asked for forgiveness and some appropriate verses to keep you on the straight and narrow ?
It 's really only a hop - not even a skip and a jump - from violating attorney and physician confidentiality to listening in on G - d 's chosen wrestling with demons with their pastors .
Of course , you and the Blessed President are on the same side in this holy war against the godless ... except , of course , for the time you posted an " Amen ! " and " Hallelujah ! " at www.bushdoesnthatefagsenough.com in response to Family Research Council 's Tony Perkins ' declaration / threat that elected Republicans need to do more to replace the Constitution with biblical law .
Surely your president and his minions will excuse over - enthusiasm for the common Christian cause .
After all , the only religious organizations the administration feels compelled to listen in on without oversight are those of the Islamic infidels , right ?
Which is A - okay with you .
So both the corporatists and the Christianists may feel secure in their private communications under this steadfast administration , I suppose .
Only crazy liberals and enemies will be targeted , of course .
But ... but ... but ....
Not to fan the paranoia flames , but what happens to these mountains of unsifted data under President Hillary Clinton ?
I guess you could pray all hoarded information will be destroyed before the incoming administration takes over , but those in power have n't proven themselves exactly cyber - swift , if you get my drift .
I mean , more than four years after 9/11 , the FBI can't even manage to get all its agents email addresses .
And powerhouse political fundraiser Jack Abramoff and fellow scamp Michael Scanlon apparently do n't even know how to locate " delete " in their email inboxes when they refer to their clients as " monkeys , " " troglodytes " and " idiots . "
Imagine the Bush administration responsible for clearing out all the hard drives , disks , tape back - ups , internal memos , message boards , print - outs and in - boxes across all agencies ( with new ones we 've never even heard of popping up each day ) that have access to all your personal and corporate information .
Not exactly a comforting scenario , is it ?
Here 's a piece of advice I 'm sure you of the unholy alliance wo n't take , but I feel compelled to give anyway : Object to this privacy invasion .
Strongly .
Clearly .
In no uncertain terms .
Alternatively , the corporatists can start building a war chest to pay off the next Democratic administration and see if that works .
As for the Holy Warriors of Wingnut Righteousness ... I suggest you start praying .
The malaria parasite is spread by mosquitoes
It is already known that the insects are very sensitive to carbon dioxide in exhaled breath .
Now a team led by Rockefeller University has found that they sense the gas using protein receptors in the structure extending from their jaws .
Writing in Nature , they say the discovery could aid the fight against insect - born diseases , such as malaria .
The identification of the carbon dioxide receptor provides a potential target for the design of inhibitors that would act as an insect repellent
Professor Leslie Vosshall
Rockefeller University
The Rockefeller team first examined fruit flies .
They discovered two protein receptors , Gr21a and Gr63a , which enable the fly to sense carbon dioxide with its antennae .
The researchers worked on fly nerve cells that did not normally respond to carbon dioxide .
They found that , if the Gr21a and Gr63a receptors were both switched on , the cells became excited by the gas .
They also showed that when Gr63a was mutated , the mutant flies no longer responded to the high levels of carbon dioxide that wild type flies avoid .
Assessing environment
The researchers went on to examine malaria mosquitoes and found similar receptors in the insects ' maxillary palp - a tiny finger - like structure extending from the jaws .
Lead researcher Professor Leslie Vosshall said : " Insects are especially sensitive to carbon dioxide , using it to track food sources and assess their surrounding environment .
" The neurons in insects that respond to carbon dioxide were already known , but the molecular mechanism by which these neurons sense this gas was a mystery .
" Though we do n't know what other proteins might be involved in the signalling pathway , the identification of the carbon dioxide receptor provides a potential target for the design of inhibitors that would act as an insect repellent .
" These inhibitors would help fight global infectious disease by reducing the attraction of blood - feeding insects to humans . "
Dr Simon Hay , an expert in malaria at the University of Oxford , said : " Curiously , the work could also open the opportunity for the development of attractants , used to lure mosquitoes away from humans .
" Increasing the distance mosquitoes have to fly for blood meals has long been known to increase their mortality and thus decrease disease transmission . "
Cut down on flying , sell the car and recycle your bottles .
But if you really want to tackle global warming , you should stop your cow from burping .
According to scientific estimates , the methane gas produced by cows is responsible for 4 % of greenhouse gas emissions .
And now , German scientists have invented a pill to cut bovine burping .
The fist - sized plant - based pill , known as a bolus , combined with a special diet and strict feeding times , is meant to reduce the methane produced by cows .
" Our aim is to increase the wellbeing of the cow , to reduce the greenhouse gases produced and to increase agricultural production all at once , " said Winfried Drochner , professor of animal nutrition , who has led the ground - breaking project at the University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart .
" It is an effective way of fighting global warming . "
Prof Drochner wants to use the pill to trap some of the energy from the methane , which is naturally produced in the fermentation process when a cow digests grass and is later mostly burped out through their mouths .
Until now it has been wasted .
" We could use the energy to boost the cow 's metabolism , " he said .
The idea is that the cows would use the methane to produce glucose instead of passing it as wind .
In turn this should help them to produce more milk .
" The fist - sized tablets mean that microbiotic substances can slowly dissolve in the cow 's stomach over several months , " said Prof Drochner .
Over the past 50 years the concentration of methane in the atmosphere has increased six - fold .
With meat consumption growing , it is set to rise further .
Dave over at the Mutant Palm blog has uncovered pictures of those Chinese cyborg pigeons – and the scientists controlling their implanted minds .
So now we 'll know what to look for , when our half - robot , half - flying - rat enemies attack .

Going to Canada ?
Check your past / Tourists with minor criminal records turned back at border
There was a time not long ago when a trip across the border from the United States to Canada was accomplished with a wink and a wave of a driver 's license .
Those days are over .
Take the case of 55 - year - old Lake Tahoe resident Greg Felsch .
Stopped at the border in Vancouver this month at the start of a planned five - day ski trip , he was sent back to the United States because of a DUI conviction seven years ago .
Not that he had any idea what was going on when he was told at customs : " Your next stop is immigration . "
Felsch was ushered into a room .
" There must have been 75 people in line , " he says .
" We were there for three hours .
One woman was in tears .
A guy was sent back for having a medical marijuana card .
I felt like a felon with an ankle bracelet . "
Or ask the well - to - do East Bay couple who flew to British Columbia this month for an eight - day ski vacation at the famed Whistler Chateau , where rooms run to $ 500 a night .
They 'd made the trip many times , but were surprised at the border to be told that the husband would have to report to " secondary " immigration .
There , in a room he estimates was filled with 60 other concerned travelers , he was told he was " a person who was inadmissible to Canada . "
The problem ?
A conviction for marijuana possession .
In 1975 .
Welcome to the new world of border security .
Unsuspecting Americans are turning up at the Canadian border expecting clear sailing , only to find that their past -- sometimes their distant past -- is suddenly an issue .
While Canada officially has barred travelers convicted of criminal offenses for years , attorneys say post - 9/11 information - gathering , combined with a sweeping agreement between Canada and the United States to share data , has resulted in a spike in phone calls from concerned travelers .
They are shocked to hear that the sins of their youth might keep them out of Canada .
But what they do n't know is that this is just the beginning .
Soon other nations will be able to look into your past when you want to travel there .
" It 's completely ridiculous , " said Chris Cannon , an attorney representing the East Bay couple , who asked that their names not be used because they do n't want their kids to know about the pot rap .
" It 's a disaster .
I mean , who did n't smoke pot in the ' 70s ? "
We 're about to find out .
And do n't think you are in the clear if you never inhaled .
Ever get nabbed for a DUI ?
How about shoplifting ?
Turn around .
You are n't getting in .
" From the time that you turn 18 , everything is in the system , " says Lucy Perillo , whose Canada Border Crossing Service in Winnipeg , Manitoba , helps Americans get into the country .
Canadian attorney David Lesperance , an expert on customs and immigration , says he had a client who was involved in a fraternity prank 20 years ago .
He was on a scavenger hunt , and the assignment was to steal something from a Piggly Wiggly supermarket .
He got caught , paid a small fine and was ordered to sweep the police station parking lot .
He thought it was all forgotten .
And it was , until he tried to cross the border .
The official word from the Canadian Border Services Agency is that this is nothing more than business as usual .
Spokesman Derek Mellon gets a little huffy when asked why the border has become so strict .
" I think it is important to understand that you are entering another country , " Mellon says .
" You are not crossing the street . "
OK , but something changed here , did n't it ?
" People say , ' I 've been going to Canada for 20 years and never had a problem , ' " Lesperance says .
" It 's classic .
I say , ' Well , you 've been getting away with it for 20 years . ' "
A prior record has always made it difficult to cross the border .
What you probably did n't know was that , as the Canadian Consulate 's Web site says , " Driving while under the influence of alcohol is regarded as an extremely serious offense in Canada . "
So it is n't as if rules have stiffened .
But what has changed is the way the information is gathered .
In the wake of 9/11 , Canada and the United States formed a partnership that has dramatically increased what Lesperance calls " the data mining " system at the border .
The Smart Border Action Plan , as it is known , combines Canadian intelligence with extensive U.S. Homeland Security information .
The partnership began in 2002 , but it was n't until recently that the system was refined .
" They can call up anything that your state trooper in Iowa can , " Lesperance says .
" As Canadians and Americans have begun cooperating , all those indiscretions from the ' 60s are going to come back and haunt us . "
Now , there 's a scary thought .
But the irony of the East Bay couple 's situation is inescapable .
Since their rowdy days in the ' 70s , they have created and sold a publishing company , purchased extensive real estate holdings and own a $ 3 million getaway home in Lake Tahoe .
" We 've done pretty well since those days , " she says .
" But what I wonder is how many other people might be affected . "
The Canadian Border Services Agency says its statistics do n't show an increase in the number of travelers turned back .
But Cannon says that 's because the " data mining " has just begun to pick up momentum .
" It is too new to say , " he says .
" Put it this way .
I am one lawyer in San Francisco , and I 've had four of these cases in the last two years , two since January .
And remember , a lot of people do n't want to talk about it ( because of embarrassment ) . "
Asked if there were more cases , attorney Lesperance was emphatic .
" Oh , yeah , " he says .
" Just the number of calls I get has gone up .
If we factor in the greater ability to discover these cases , it is just mathematically logical that we are going to see more . "
The lesson , the attorneys say , is that if you must travel to Canada , you should apply for " a Minister 's Approval of Rehabilitation " to wipe the record clear .
Oh , and by the way , if you do n't need to travel to Canada , do n't think you wo n't need to clear your record .
Lesperance says it is just a matter of time before agreements are signed with governments in destinations like Japan , Indonesia and Europe .
" This , " Lesperance says , " is just the edge of the wedge . "
Who would have thought a single , crazy night in college would follow you around the world ?

I 'm still investigating
When 10,000 honeybees fly the coop to hunt for a new home , usually a tree cavity , they have a unique method of deciding which site is right :
With great efficiency they narrow down the options and minimize bad decisions .
Their technique , says Cornell University biologist Thomas Seeley , includes coalition building until a quorum develops .
The Seeley group 's study , which is published in the May - June issue of American Scientist , might well be used to help improve human group decision - making , he says .
Scientists had known that honeybee scouts " waggle dance " to report on food .
Seeley and his colleagues , however , have confirmed that they dance to report on real estate , too , as part of their group decision - making process .
The better the housing site , the stronger the waggle dance , the researchers found , and that prompts other scouts to visit a recommended site .
If they agree it's a good choice , they also dance to advertise the site and revisit it frequently .
Scouts committed to different sites compete to attract uncommitted scouts to their sites , the researchers have discovered , but because the bees grade their recruitment signals in relation to site quality , the scouts build up most rapidly at the best site .
As soon as 15 or more bees are at any one site , the researchers found , the scouts signal to the waiting bees in the swarm that it 's time to warm up their flight muscles in preparation for takeoff .
Each scout does so by scrambling through the swarm cluster and briefly pressing its vibrating thorax against the other bees to stimulate them to activate their wing muscles .
Once every bee has its thorax warmed to 95 degrees Fahrenheit , the swarm lifts off toward its new home .
advertisement
" This is a striking example of decision making by an animal group that is complicated enough to rival the dealings of any department committee , " said Seeley , a professor of neurobiology and behavior at Cornell and lead author of the article .
For more than 10 years , Seeley , University of California - Riverside entomologist Kirk Visscher ( Cornell Ph.D. ' 85 ) and Ohio State University engineer Kevin Passino have been observing , videotaping , devising experiments and mathematically modeling honeybee swarms .
" The bees ' method , which is a product of disagreement and contest rather than consensus or compromise , consistently yields excellent collective decisions , " said Seeley .
When a hive gets too crowded , its queen and half the hive will swarm to a nearby tree and quietly wait while several hundred scouts go house hunting .
To explore the decision - making process , the researchers conducted a series of experiments .
To study the waggle dancing for house hunting , the researchers :
* labeled all 4,000 bees in a swarm and recorded the scouts reporting on their site visits .
At first , no one site dominated the dancing , but toward the end of the 16 - hour decision - making process , one site was advertised much more heavily and eventually became the chosen home .
* offered bees both mediocre and superb nest sites .
The better the site , the longer the bees waggle danced -- making 100 circuits for a first - rate site versus 12 for a mediocre one .
The swarms almost always chose the excellent site .
advertisement
To test whether the bees decide by quorum or consensus , the researchers :
* offered swarms two first - rate sites on Appledore Island in the Gulf of Maine , site of Cornell 's Shoals Marine Laboratory , both equidistant from the swarm .
As soon as about 15 bees were seen at one site , the swarm would take off for it , even though some scouts were still dancing strongly for the other site .
* offered five desirable nests and found that it took much longer for a quorum to develop at any one site , and takeoff took almost twice as long .
To study whether bees always choose the best site , the researchers offered swarms four small and one superior site in size .
Although the superior site was never the first one found , it was almost always chosen .
These group decision - making methods , which include an open forum of ideas , frank " discussions " and friendly competition , just might help human committees " achieve collective intelligence and thus avoid collective folly , " conclude the researchers .
Whether the quorum - setting method of aggregating independent opinions could substitute for a democratic vote remains to be seen , but it sure could speed up the process toward a swift , but smart , decision , Seeley said .
Is the gyroball a myth , or is it real ?
And if it is real , what exactly is it ?
Kazushi Tezuka says he has the answer , and he flew from Japan to the United States this week to reveal it .
Tezuka , a Japanese trainer who is credited with creating the gyroball 12 years ago , walked to the mound at Scottsdale Stadium on Wednesday to show off his invention .
Tezuka used a standard fastball grip .
He went into a basic motion .
Only at the end of his delivery did he deviate .
He turned the inside of his throwing arm away from his body and released the ball as if it were a football , making it spiral toward home plate .
The pitch started on the same course as a changeup , but it barely dipped .
It looked like a slider , but it did not break .
The gyroball , despite its zany name , is supposed to stay perfectly straight .
“ That ’s it ! ” Tezuka said , laughing hysterically on the mound .
“ That ’s the gyro ! ”
For all of the kids who launch balls around the backyard , baseball is slow to invent new pitches , and even slower to recognize them .
The last pitch to be adopted by major leaguers was the split - fingered fastball , about 30 years ago .
The gyroball is not going to revolutionize the sport .
Like a four - seam fastball , a four - seam gyroball is designed to surprise hitters with its speed .
Like a changeup , a two - seam gyroball is designed to fool hitters with its slower pace .

The early 90s were exciting .
Tim Berners - Lee invented HTML and created the first of the many internets we have today .
A bunch of dancing dudes in foil costumes built the first Pentium processor .
And who can forget Eritrea gaining independence from Ethiopia ?
Well , I could , but I was n't following Ethiopian politics so much those days .
At the time , Chilton W. was working at a company that provided software that auto insurance companies used to keep track of users , policies , cars , etc .
Things were going great , too .
They had sold their software to one third of all auto insurance providers in the U.S .
The architecture consisted of a main system ( which they owned ) at each insurance provider 's location , physically linked to other systems on a local network .
This did n't work under the typical client / server model , though , it was a daisy - chained , peer - to - peer setup .
Often just one computer on the network could connect to the internet via dialup , so troubleshooting was a matter of dialing into the main system , checking for problems , then walking a user through the steps of testing each networked computer .
It was usually the low man on the totem pole at the client 's site that would get tied up for a few hours , changing configuration settings and testing .
It was a tremendously tedious process , and the answer was generally either a bad cable , bad software install , or a dead hard drive .
Chilton saw an opportunity to simplify the process by deploying a remote diagnostics application .
Deployment was , in fact , pretty easy — a batch file could upload the utility to the insurance provider 's main system , then someone there could copy the utility to a floppy and manually get it out across all the other systems .
Chilton still did n't like that he'd have to explain to each user how to copy the utility , though , so he added the ability for the utility to replicate itself across the network .
Chilton 's script was a godsend .
He could easily diagnose problems with one call , one batch file upload , and one execution of the utility .
A few minutes later , a log file would be created that could easily and accurately identify the problem .
Chilton 's productivity skyrocketed to the point that he could solve ten or more problems in the same time it took his coworkers to diagnose one .
The future was bright for Chilton .
He began showing others how to use the utility , and everyone loved it .
When a relative offered to send him back to finish college , though , he put in his two weeks ' notice .
His boss requested that he write documentation about the utility , so he printed up the batch script and wrote extensive documentation about how it worked .
A few days later , he left .
A year later , he ran into one of his old coworkers and asked how things had been going at the company .
" A month after you left , everything went crazy , " he said .
" Management said we had to wipe all of our hard drives and recall our systems from the field .
Tech support was down for months ! "
" What ? " asked Chilton .
" Why ? "
One of the comments Chilton had left in his script read " this self - replicates , similar to how a virus works . "
It was read by the wrong person , and a " security expert " was immediately brought in .
His conclusion was that this was clearly viral batch file , undetectable by every antivirus software product on the market .
The fear that an elusive virus had permeated throughout the network lead to the company hiring very expensive investigators to look into the issue .
The head investigator found nothing , though , so he was fired and the investigation ended .
Ultimately , new computers were bought for everyone , and tech support was able to get back on track .
This week I helped dealing with performance problems ( part MySQL related and part related to LAMP in general ) of system which does quite a bit of content delivery , serving file downloads and images – something a lot of web sites need to do these days .
There were quite a bit of mistakes in design for this one which I though worth to note , adding some issues seen in other systems .
Note this list applies to static content distribution , dynamic content has some of its own issues which need different treatment .
DNS TTL Settings
The system was using DNS based load balancing , using something like img23.domain.com to serve some of the images .
I ’m not big fan of purely DNS based load balancing and HA but it works if configured well .
In this case however the problem was zero TTL set in DNS configuration .
This obviously adds latency especially for “ aggregate ” pages which may require images to be pulled from 10 different image servers .
Keep Alive
In my previous post I wrote you often do not need keep alive for dynamic pages ( there are also exceptions ) but you really should have Keep Alive enabled while serving images .
It especially hurts not to have one if 30 thumbnails are loaded per page if you do not have one .
Use Proper Web Server
This one is pretty interesting .
Many learned apache is not good for serving static content especially with many thousands of keep - alive connections .
Lighttpd is often named as faster alternative .
It is surely true if you server static content from memory or serving large files ( in which case read - ahead helps ) but if you ’re serving many millions of thumbnails it may not work well .
Lighttpd 1.4 is single threaded and that single threads is used to handle both network and IO which is not going to scale especially if you have storage build from large number of hard drives .
This problem is fixed in Lighttpd 1.5 which is however still in pre-release ( though we have it running in production ) .
There are other solutions such as nginx which does not seems to have this problem .
My point with this item is not advice you which exactly web server to use but to point out serving dynamic content , serving in - memory static content and serving static content from the disk are different tasks and should not be mixed .
Use noatime mount option Serving images you rarely need last access time tracked for them , especially as this tracking can be quite expensive if there are a lot of different files accessed concurrently .
It is especially worth to note updating access time needs io even in case content is in OS cache .
Simple solution is use noatime mount option for your static content partition .
Some web servers also support for O_NOATIME file open flag on newer Linux versions , which also can be used .
Using PHP to serve files
This usually comes in play if security control for files or traffic limit per user needs to be enforced .
Serving file by simply reading from PHP or any other heavy programming language and sending it back is worse thing you can do .
The optimal solution would be to using some server modules for access control or hacking one if you need some special functionality , few people however have skills to do this kind of job .
The other solution is to use X - send - file or similar custom headers which make PHP script just to check restrictions and have web server to send the file .
This technique actually was used in the project we ’re speaking about with exception of resuming file downloads .
In lighttpd 1.4 you could not tell server to send only part of the file so it had to be implemented in php .
However even small portion of such downloads caused a lot of trouble especially as lighttpd tries to buffer all content it gets from PHP script which means many megabytes for large files .
Partial file sending happily was added in lighttpd 1.5 which was one of the reason to move to it quickly .
Thumbnail size
In many cases you need multiple sizes of thumbnails , such as very small size to show in list mode , standard size to show in preview mode and may be something else .
It looks very attractive to keep only one thumbnail and simply set browser image sizes if you need to stick it to smaller space .
It is not so good in practice however .
First browsers may not resize image with optimal quality and it may just look ugly compared to properly created thumbnails .
It also makes things a lot slower .
I for example seen 8 K thumbnail in the case when smallest one should have been less than 1KB in size .
With 30 images on the page it is 30 KB worth of download vs 240KB which makes quite a bit of difference especially on slower connection speeds .
Forgetting to set expire Static content rarely changes , in many implementations it may never change as loading new version of the same object will result in different url .
This means you really need to have expire headers for them set , otherwise you will be getting a lot of cache revalidation requests which still require stat ( ) calls on web server side and which can be avoided .
How far in the future you want expire to be … it depends on the application of course .
It can range for few hours for objects changes to which you want to be quickly visible to infinity for objects which only change with their urls .
Server side caching
The benefit of server side caching is not so obvious for serving static content , or better say it depends on situation .
If you serve a lot of small files which can fit in squid ( for example ) in - memory cache it may work quite well and in fact will give better memory utilization as OS cache has single page granularity ( meaning 100 bytes file will still take 4 KB in cache ) .
For serving large set of files ( which does not fit in memory ) you can have performance to go down as request will be frequently made to the main server to get the file .
Also it frequently does not make sense to use disk cache for static content as getting it from the server may be close in speed .
It also of course depends on the server which you ’re using – apache in prefork mode ( ie same server used for static and dynamic content ) would likely to benefit a lot from one .
Using different servers
As I already mentioned serving different content requires different skills from web servers or different configuration , so it is good idea to use dedicated server name , such as static .
domain.com for serving static content , so even if you do not need it now you have flexibility in the future .
Also even for same server it allows to configure different virtual host with different settings easily .
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Thursday December 21 2006
The Bush administration is weighing options for a naval build - up in the Gulf as a show of force and a warning to Iran on its nuclear programme and its support for Shia militias in Iraq , it emerged yesterday .
Under the proposed build - up , first reported by CBS television , the Pentagon would send an aircraft carrier to join one already in the region .
The proposed deployment was described as a message to Tehran not to take provocative steps , and was not preparation for an attack .
The idea of sending a second aircraft carrier was raised this month by the commander of US forces in Iraq , General John Abizaid .
But it also comes amid mounting pressure from Saudi Arabia against a withdrawal of US forces from Iraq .
Pentagon officials were considering Gen Abizaid 's request , but few other details were immediately available .
A Pentagon spokesman said there would be no comment on military movements .
" The administration has been pretty clear about Iran 's role in the region , which is that Iran has to stop being provocative , " the White House spokesman , Tony Snow , told reporters .
The aircraft carrier USS Dwight D Eisenhower has been in the region since September , along with four other ships and submarines carrying 6,500 sailors .
The navy could move other carriers into the region within six weeks .
The USS Stennis , a cruiser which was scheduled to deploy in early 2007 in any event , would be the most likely ship to be deployed .
However , if the US were to contemplate a military strike , it would need far more than two carriers , said Reva Bhalla , an analyst at Strategic Forecasting Inc .
The US deployed five carriers ahead of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
Outgoing UN secretary general Kofi Annan said yesterday that military intervention in Iran would be " unwise and disastrous " , as the Security Council debated a resolution that would impose sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear programme .
" I believe that the council , which is discussing the issue , will proceed cautiously and try and do whatever it can to get a negotiated settlement , " he said .
The latest draft resolution would order all countries to ban the supply of specified materials and technology that could contribute to Iran 's nuclear programmes .
Reports that the US is leaning towards an even stronger posture against Iran reflects indications that Washington wants to deepen its military presence in the region .
It follows warnings from Saudi Arabia that it would fund Sunni militias in Iraq in the event of a US troop withdrawal .
" The aircraft carrier is a way of assuring the Saudis that the inclination is to do more rather than less , and that we are not going to leave them in the lurch , " said John Pike , a military analyst .
The tougher posture on Iran and a temporary troop surge in Iraq would both run counter to the findings of the Iraq Study Group earlier this month which recommended a withdrawal of US combat forces from Iraq by early 2008 , and the opening of diplomatic talks with Iran and Syria .
George Bush has yet to unveil his new strategy for Iraq , postponing a planned policy address until the new year .
However , a series of leaks suggest that the White House is in favour of sending an extra 20,000 to 30,000 more troops to Iraq for the next six or eight months .
Bush told Washington post on Tuesday he plans to expand the size of the US military to deal with the long - term fight against terrorism .
The Pentagon believes the US can only bolster its forces in Iraq by extending deployments , a course that would eventually wear down the army .
Meanwhile , the administration is concerned at evidence that Shia militias are receiving support and training from Iran .
A Pentagon report on Monday said that the Mahdi Army , the armed militia loyal to the radical Shia cleric Moqtada al - Sadr , had eclipsed al - Qaida as the most dangerous agent of sectarian violence .
The quarterly assessment from the Pentagon was the bleakest to date , describing the security situation in Iraq as " tragic " .
Violence rose by 22 % over the past three months to a new high of 959 attacks a week against US and Iraqi forces , and the Pentagon warned that the continued bloodshed was eroding the legitimacy of the prime minister , Nouri al - Maliki .
The growing power of Shia militias has come to occupy a greater share of US attention , and fuelled frustration with Mr Maliki .
The Iraqi prime minister is dependent on both militia , and so far has resisted US pressure to confront them .
Escalating violence
The Pentagon report said attacks on US and Iraqi troops and Iraqi civilians jumped in recent months to the highest level since Iraq regained its sovereignty in June 2004 .
· From mid-August to mid-November , the weekly average number of attacks increased 22 % from the previous three months
· There were an average of 959 attacks a week on US and Iraqi forces during the three months ending in November
· Ninety - three Iraqi civilians are killed or injured every day .
Attacks against Iraqi security forces reached a new high at 33 a day
· Injuries and deaths among US forces stood at 25 a day .
Illusionz was too far away to enjoy often , and even if we had made it out there our twenty bucks - administered biweekly - was n’t going to save the place .
An imposing acre -wide indoor cavern , its unchanging arcade selection came to resemble a kind of mausoleum - still inside , with the heroes of another era laid ‘ round .
The first time we met Robert , it became clear to us that we would run Penny Arcade over a reef in our efforts to sustain it .
We did n’t know him well enough to trust him , and also we do n’t trust anyone , so we just accepted that we ’d never find the person we needed and resigned ourselves to imminent failure .
We talked about it on our way to Illusionz , in fact , and upon entering the establishment we saw Robert himself on the DDR machine in an umber head - to - toe sweatsuit , every inch the AZN .
For some reason , watching him drop Holic on Heavy proved something about him that our previous conversation had not .
It has long been our fantasy to shipwreck our lives with the fabulous expense of a doomed arcade , and this dark dream sprouted anew with the collapse of that Issaquah institution .
We have chosen to do a storyline about it , in the hope that it will bind up this urge and dissipate it .
Recent Sonic titles have been so bad that their taint creeps backward along the bloodline , corrupting the classics that begat the franchise .
Sonic Riders ( for example ) is a game whose perversions language cannot entirely contain : it is almost pure anguish .
It is the arm of Cain raised over his pure brother Abel in murderous rage , its charred seed germinated in human sin .
The recent 1 up piece by Jeremy Parish re :
The Sonic Problem offers real solutions to a company that has lost its mind and perhaps even its soul .
But when they succeed , we must mark it : Sonic Rush on the DS is the most authentic series entry in years .
Okay , we ’re done .
But Sonic and the Secret Rings I ’m actually looking forward to .
Take the raw speed of the original games to bear the name , and place the camera behind our azure protagonist .
Use motion sensing controls to avoid obstacles , grab rings , and attack crabs .
So , Sonic On Rails .
The term " On Rails " is typically used a pejorative , often produced with a sneer and accompanied by a snort of derision .
This is all according to some Gamer Law whose origin is n’t clear to me .
I think it is because the human spirit yearns for freedom , and they feel as though the rails amount to a kind of " Man " who is " coming down " on " them . "
All games are on rails , and these rails are of varying thickness and ornamentation .
Characters that never change .
Environments that shunt players .
Severely constrained interactivity .
Punitive gameplay mechanics .
All of these things are acceptable .
But when you restrain certain classes of player movement , oh ho , then the game is on rails .
Superficially it reminds me of Jungle Beat , which might be one of my favorite games .
Nintendo ’s insane " bongo platformer " was more about momentum than anything else , about making strings of correct choices under radical time constraints , and the best videos of Secret Rings carry this idea in them .
I played a prehistoric version of what was then called " Sonic Wildfire " at The Last E3 Ever , enough to know that they were onto something , but tuning player input on the Wii is like witchcraft and simply takes time to smooth out .
I was unable to invest myself in the game because I expected them to shove it out the door for the system launch .
That they did not do so has allowed this old heart to hope .

IT 'S still there , and just as bad as ever .
The outside world has all but forgotten Zimbabwe , where Robert Mugabe continues to preside over economic and political collapse .
But the southern African country is marking miserable milestones by the day .
Four out of five adults are now unemployed .
Zimbabwe suffers the world 's highest inflation rate , a stratospheric 1,600 % and rising .
Toilet paper is more valuable than bank notes .
The price of bread ( when it 's available ) more than doubled in January ; mealie meal , a staple , rose by 500 % last week .
Price freezes mean that basics , like milk and sugar , are rarely available .
Many recently printed bank notes have not been issued because they are already worthless .
Roughly 3 m people , by some estimates , have fled the country , leaving about 12 m behind .
On Monday February 19th the European Union — to little fanfare — agreed to renew “ smart ” sanctions , including an arms embargo and travel ban for Zimbabwe 's leadership , that have been in place for years .
The cause of Zimbabwe 's collapse , ultimately , is Mr Mugabe 's refusal to leave office .
Increasingly under pressure from unhappy Zimbabweans , he has lashed out at an array of enemies , including black opposition leaders , white farmers , trade unions , women 's groups , urban voters and Britain — the former colonial power .
By seizing commercial farms and handing them to political cronies , Mr Mugabe may have staved off the end of his political career , but at the cost of ruining an economy dominated by agriculture .
Aid and investment have dried up .
Manufacturing has slumped .
The prolonged economic collapse is more typical of a country wrecked by war .
The purchasing power of the average Zimbabwean today , for example , is back at levels last seen soon after the second world war , according to the Centre for Global Development , a think - tank in Washington , DC .
Given widespread AIDS and hunger , this translates into thousands of unncessary deaths each year .
When will anything be done about it ?
Weary analysts have stopped trying to predict how far the economy will have to collapse , or for oppression to worsen , before something snaps .
But even leaders in the ruling ZANU - PF party know that recovery depends on getting the old crocodile out of office .
Investors , farmers , refugees , tourists and others will not return while Mr Mugabe 's misrule continues .
Yet managing his exit is proving impossible .
Rival camps in the ruling party are vying for eventual control , so nobody dares push the chief to go .
( Indeed Mr Mugabe may be dividing his allies for precisely this reason ) .
The army is watching suspiciously .
The big neighbour — South Africa — is reluctant to get involved , fearing that any intervention may backfire .
The opposition , deflated after seeing general elections rigged and its supporters crushed , has become timid and divided .
Many of the brightest and bravest , in any case , are moving abroad .
Nor are sustained street protests likely , though there are occasional signs of violence in the townships around the capital , Harare .
Strikes are becoming more common .
At the weekend heavily armed riot police in Harare crushed an opposition rally — despite High Court approval for it to go ahead — by firing teargas and using water cannon .
Protesters responded by throwing stones .
Over 120 people were arrested .
This week , to mark his birthday , Mr Mugabe will have a lavish party , to which teachers and nurses have been forced to contribute .
He will also give a speech in which he is expected to mention his succession .
Officially , after nearly three decades in office , he is supposed to go in March 2008 .
But a presidential election scheduled for that month may well be postponed for another two years , when he will be 86 .
In any case he has told foreign journalists , perhaps in jest , that he plans to rule until he is “ a century old ” .
Is anything like that dismal prospect possible ?
Mr Mugabe is relatively healthy and alert , and has the tacit support of both other African countries and of China , which is asserting itself on the continent .
And though outsiders occasionally grumble about the misery in Zimbabwe — America has called it an “ outpost of tyranny ” — the West has broadly decided that ignoring Mr Mugabe is the least bad strategy .
Any change , therefore , is going to have to come from within .
And , so far , Mr Mugabe has proved a master at stamping that out .

I ’m a single , college guy so how bout some articles on creative , free dates or something .
I ’m sure this could apply to married men as well .
Great question — I particularly love it because it ’s something that I ’ve become good at myself over the years .
Yes , I ’m a cheapskate , but I ’m also a bit of a romantic .
So I ’ve had to get creative in order to win my date over without spending too much .
What follows are just some ideas — the key is to use your imagination , and you ’ll be able to come up with a bunch of your own .
But here are some that have worked for me ( read : I got another date instead of being rejected as usual ) , and that I hope work for you :
Picnic .
One of my favorites .
I like to pack a basket with home - made sandwiches ( really hearty , good ones with good bread ) , fruits , cheese , desserts , candies , wine , snacks and all the utensils and napkins .
Find a great spot for the picnic — sunset is probably the most romantic time .

Pasta or steaks are easy and sure bets ( although I do n’t eat steak anymore ) .
A good dessert tops it off well .

Two FBI Whistleblowers Confirm Illegal Wiretapping of Government Officials and Misuse of FISA
State Secrets Privilege Was Used to Cover Up Corruption and Silence Whistleblowers
The National Security Whistleblowers Coalition ( NSWBC ) has obtained a copy of an official complaint filed by a veteran FBI Special Agent , Gilbert Graham , with the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General ( DOJ - OIG ) .
SA Graham ’s protected disclosures report the violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) in conducting electronic surveillance of high - profile U.S. public officials .
Before his retirement in 2002 , SA Gilbert Graham worked for the FBI Washington Field Office ( WFO ) Squad NS - 24 .
One of the main areas of Mr. Graham ’s counterintelligence investigations involved espionage activities by Turkish officials and agents in the United States .
On April 2 , 2002 , Graham filed with the DOJ - OIG a classified protected disclosure , which provided a detailed account of FISA violations involving misuse of FISA warrants to engage in domestic surveillance .
In his unclassified report SA Graham states : “ It is the complainant ’s reasonable belief that the request for ELSUR [ electronic surveillance ] coverage was a subterfuge to collect evidentiary information concerning public corruption matters . ”
Graham blew the whistle on this illegal behavior , but the actions were covered up by the Department of Justice and the Attorney General ’s office .
Click here to read the unclassified version of SA Graham ’s Official Report .
The report filed by SA Graham bolsters another FBI whistleblower ’s case that became public several months after Graham ’s official filing with the Justice Department in 2002 .
Sibel Edmonds , former FBI Language Specialist , also worked for the FBI Washington Field Office ( WFO ) , and her assignments included the translations of Turkish Counterintelligence documents and audiotapes , some of which were part of espionage investigations led by SA Graham .
After she filed her complaint with the DOJ - OIG and Congress , she was retaliated against by the FBI and ultimately fired in March 2002 .
Court proceedings in Edmonds ’ case were blocked by the assertion of the State Secrets Privilege by then Attorney General John Ashcroft , and the Congress gagged and prevented from investigating her case through retroactive re-classification of documents by DOJ .
To read the timeline on Edmonds ’ case Click here .
Edmonds ’ complaint included allegations of illegal activities by Turkish organizations and their agents in the United States , and the involvement of certain elected and appointed U.S. officials in the Department of State , Pentagon , and the U.S. Congress in these activities .
In its September 2005 issue , Vanity Fair ran a comprehensive piece on Edmonds ’ case by reporter David Rose , in which several former and current congressional and Justice Department officials identified former House Speaker Dennis Hastert as being involved in illegal activities with the Turkish organizations and personnel targeted in FBI investigations .
In addition , Rose reported : “ … much of what Edmonds reportedly heard seemed to concern not state espionage but criminal activity .
There was talk , she told investigators , of laundering the profits of large - scale drug deals and of selling classified military technologies to the highest bidder . ”
In January 2005 , DOJ - OIG
Another Former Veteran FBI Counterintelligence and Espionage Specialist at FBI Headquarters in Washington DC also filed similar reports with DOJ - OIG and several congressional offices regarding violations of FISA implementation and the covering up of several espionage cases involving FBI Language Specialists and public corruption cases by the Bureau .
The cases reported by this whistleblower corroborate those reported by SA Graham and Sibel Edmonds .
In an interview with NSWBC investigators the former FBI Specialist , who wished to remain anonymous , stated : “ … you are looking at covering up massive public corruption and espionage cases ; to top that off you have major violations of FISA by the FBI Washington Field Office and HQ targeting these cases .
Everyone involved has motive to cover up these reports and prevent investigation and public disclosure .
No wonder they invoked the state secrets privilege in Edmonds ’ case . ”
William Weaver , NSWBC Senior Advisor noted that , ” These abuses of power are precisely why we must pay attention to whistleblowers .
Preservation of the balance of powers between the branches of government increasingly relies on information provided by whistleblowers , especially in the face of aggressive and expanding executive power .
Through illegal surveillance members of Congress and other officials may be controlled by the executive branch , thereby dissolving the matrix of our democracy .
The abuse of two powers of secrecy , FISA and the state secrets privilege , are working hand in hand to subvert the Constitution .
In an abominably perverse arrangement , the abuse of FISA is being covered up by abuse of the state secrets privilege .
Only whistleblowers and the congressional and judicial oversight their revelations spawn can bring our system back into balance . ”
Several civil liberties and whistleblowers organizations have joined Edmonds and NSWBC in urging congress to hold public hearing on Edmonds ’ case , including the supporting cases of SA Graham and other FBI witnesses , and the erroneous use of state secrets privilege by the executive branch to cover up its own illegal conduct .
The petition endorsed by these groups is expected to be released to public in the next few days .

The perfect place to work and live
Media Transparency reports that Pres .
Bush ’s faith - based initiative is taking some flak , nothing new , I ’ve blogged about this before .
2/14/2007
Americans United for Separation of Church and State is suing the state of Iowa for using state funds for government sponsored proselytizing .
The kicker , they ’re using the funds in prisons .
Despite some legal battles currently playing out in the courts , Bush ’s program seems to be running quietly under the radar .
The National Journal reports :
“ Under the public radar , federal , state , and local governments are funding , training , and even helping to create religious social service organizations . ”
I see it right here in my small city of 300,000 .
The local school system is farming out their at - risk students to an after - school program put on by a local Baptist church .
“ More than $ 2 billion in federal funding — and an un-tallied but growing amount of state and local support — is pouring into church - affiliated organizations around the country annually . ”
And now faith - based organizations can go up for $ 20 billion in funding .
People tell me that these organizations are filling a void and I should n’t worry because they ’re helping people .
I ’ve seen how some of these same organizations operate personally in Africa .
“ Here ’s some food , let ’s talk about Jesus . ”
Churches are just like businesses , instead of profits they look at the number of souls “ saved . ”
This is n’t a case of “ us ” against “ them , ” it goes back to the establishment clause .
For example , the at - risk students attending after - school activities at the local Baptist church .
Religion might be the answer to their needs but the government ca n’t be pushing it on them .
My tax dollars should not be going to the operating costs of any church .
Once there was a Christian who was a normal human in most respects .
Normal intelligence , health , strength , etc .
We 'll call him Clark .
Clark prays one day for additional physical strength so he can do more good for the glory of God .
God grants this prayer request and Clark continues with his life now with slightly greater physical strength .
Now the net good of the world is slightly greater .
More good is being achieved .
Perhaps it is only barely noticeable , but the world is a slightly better place .
Clark can now carry slightly more groceries in each armful at the food bank .
He can dig ditches for longer for some orphanage .
You get the idea .
Humbly Clark asks God again for more abilities to do good for His glory .
This time God grants him additional intelligence .
Now Clark can organize his day more efficiently and have more time to help the poor .
He is able to cure some heretofore incurable disease , etc .
The world is a slightly better place .
Clark continues to pray .
And each time God rewards him with additional abilities .
More strength , more intelligence , super speed , invulnerability , ability to fly , turn invisible , see into the future , etc .
He 's becoming a veritable superman .
And the world is becoming a better place .
Ghettos rehabilitated , hunger cured , ignorance educated , global warming reversed , crimes solved and prevented .
And still Clark humbly prays for more abilities .
One might say that he is becoming more like a god with every prayer answered .
One of his powers is super - humility so he would never think this of himself , of course .
Yet it is clear that for almost any definition of god that man has ever used , he is close to it and exceeding it in many ways .
The world has never been a better place .
It 's a veritable paradise .
Barely using even a fraction of his powers Clark can foresee conflict and mediate it before it gets out of hand .
Clean , renewable energy is more abundant than air .
It 's heaven on earth .
But still he prays for more abilities .
God is so impressed with Clark that he decides to let Clark be God .
Clark is most of the way there anyway and God would like to tend to some of his other dimensions for a while .
Clark would be a perfect adoptive god for this universe .
So God elevates Clark all the way to full godhood .
And a strange thing happens .
The world returns in every way back to its pre-Clark state .
Once again we have the world as it was when God alone was in charge in the first place .
All the wars , rapes , murders , starvation , cruel words , ravaging diseases , etc.
So what happened ?
Why is a universe with a nearly infinitely powered good hearted superman such a better place than one with an infinitely powered deity ?
Where did the love go ?
Economists at the Fed are n't obsessed with short - term pocketbook issues like high oil prices -- and not just because many of them commute to work in Washington on the Metro .
Rather , they focus on long - term economywide issues .
" You want to make sure that short - term monetary policy is n't responding to a phenomenon that is just going to go away in a few months , or even a year , " said Stephen G. Cecchetti , economics professor at Brandeis University .
" A change in an interest rate today will have an effect on inflation one to two years from today . "
We would not have wanted the Fed to act as if the post - Katrina spike in gasoline prices were permanent , he noted .
What 's more , the Fed tends to focus on things that it can control .
Not even a Fed chairman as powerful as Alan Greenspan can affect the price of oil by manipulating interest rates .
" There 's nothing the central bank can do about that , unless it figures out how to produce more oil , " said Michael F. Bryan , vice president and economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland .
But the Fed can control the amount of money circulating in the economy relative to the quantity of goods available .
" So it tries to find the inflation signal common to all prices throughout the economy , " Mr. Bryan said .
Thus considered , the core C.P.I. may be the best tool the Fed has to monitor long - term changes in prices .
Still , economists see two good reasons not to ignore the headline number today .
First , inflation in a crucial category like energy can worm its way into the entire system .
" If high energy costs persist , and if they continue to rise , they may ultimately seep into the core , " Professor Owen said .
The second reason has less to do with hard economic realities than with softer perceptions .
The cost of gasoline is the economy 's most visible price .
People see it every day even if they do n't buy gas every day , said Matthew Martin , senior economist at Economy.com .
And most people buy food every week .
" If prices for those two things go up quickly , consumers will form the impression that inflation is high , " he said .
" And if consumers begin to expect more inflation , they might be more tolerant of price increases . "
If that happens , the headline C.P.I. number could dominate the headlines .

Many cloned mice survived into adulthood
Despite notorious difficulties in producing animals through cloning , nine of 19 mice who were born survived into adulthood .
The scientists replaced the nucleus from an unfertilised egg with the nucleus from an adult skin stem cell .
Embryos produced in this way may also be a useful source of stem cells , say the researchers in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
It may one day be possible to generate tailor made embryonic stem cells from a patient 's skin stem cells
Dr Elaine Fuchs , Howard Hughes Medical Institute
Researchers have previously managed to clone mice using other kinds of adult cells , but it has been an inefficient process .
In this study , scientists from Rockefeller University and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute used a type of stem cell found in the skin , called keratinocytes , which are attractive to scientists because they are easily accessible .
The cells were found in hair follicles lying underneath the skin and are involved in hair growth and in repairing skin wounds .
The existence of these cells has been known about for some time , but scientists have only recently discovered that they can self - renew and produce many different types of cells - the hallmarks of stem cells .
Finding ways of isolating these cells has also proved problematic .
Cell production
But the team have now been able to create mouse embryos by removing the nucleus from an unfertilised egg cell and replacing it with the nucleus from an adult skin cell .
These were then cultured in the lab to become early - stage embryos called blastocysts .
These were then put into the wombs of adult mice and pregnancies were allowed to develop .
Usually , just one to two per cent of such blastocysts survive to birth and many cloned mice are not healthy .
In this study , the success rate was only 1.6 % using skin cells from female mice and 5.4 % using cells from male mice .
They suggest the difference may be caused by the female cells undergoing more complex changes than the male cells .
As well as being a good starting point for cloning mice , the researchers from said their method could be useful for generating embryonic stem cells .
The blastocysts created could be used as a source of embryonic stem cells , they said .
In turn these cells could , in theory , be used to produce any other type of cell , such as nerve cells or muscle cells .
Technical hurdles
Researchers are hoping that embryonic stem cells could one day be a useful treatment for many conditions such as Alzheimer 's and heart disease .
If they could be produced from individual patient 's skin cells for use in their treatment , it would avoid problems of rejection , said the researchers .
Dr Elaine Fuchs , of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute who was one of the researchers on the study , said : " This work opens the door for generating embryonic stem cells , which is easier than cloning mice from adult skin stem cells .
" If researchers overcome the current technical hurdles of making human embryonic stem cells by nuclear cloning , it may one day be possible to generate tailor made embryonic stem cells from a patient 's skin stem cells . "
John Martin , professor of cardiovascular medicine at University College London , said : " It 's an interesting result , but predictable .
" It 's part of a process of understanding how we can achieve a practical solution by taking stem cell medicine into man .
" This is a long process that 's going to go on for five to 10 years before we get anything therapeutic out of it . "
Recently there has been a burst of criticisms concerning Common Lisp .
If you do n’t know what I am talking about , or simply want to catch up on the current discussion before you read the rest of this piece you should visit : Steve Yegge ’s blog , the usenet response , a usenet debate on CL suckage , and a usenet proposal for improving CL .
Although they have been accused of hating Lisp , my impression is that the majority of these critics love Lisp , and simply want to see it become better .
For those of you who got lost in the flames let me provide a quick summary of the major complaints : 1 - macros : there is no hygienic defmacro , but define - syntax may be too cumbersome for some , and also it is hard to hook some aspects of the source with macros .
2 - CLOS : CLOS is becoming dated , looks too much like a hack , and is too hard to use .
The object system needs to be rewritten , possibly from scratch .
3 - There is no type system outside of run-time checking .
4 - The Lisp community has become too fragmented , even Common Lisp implementations tend to provide features that makes them incompatible with each other .
5 - Common Lisp has stagnated for too many years , and there is no way to implement changes that will be adopted outside of a single implementation , which ensures that no serious improvements are made .
In my opinion these are valid criticisms and , although they are directed primarily at Common Lisp , Scheme is not without its own flaws .
I do n’t believe that accepting these criticisms as valid implies that one should drop Lisp , even with its flaws I think that Lisp is still the best language , it just could become better .
However I am not writing this piece to discuss the criticisms or to propose solutions , what I want to address here is the response of the community to them , which I found appalling .
Some people ’s responses were scarily reminiscent of religious authorities trying to cast out heretics , which is not an appropriate attitude for a computer scientist .
As scientists we should always be looking to improve our tools and methods , and this means trying new things to find out what changes constitute an improvement .
Let me discuss what makes some responses I have heard especially ridiculous .
The difficulty argument :
We should leave confusing / ill designed feature untouched because it makes Lisp harder , and thus keeps out the riff - raff .
This is a flawed argument because a large volume of users is more important than a few brilliant users .
Even mediocre programmers can write useful libraries / promote the language .
Libraries especially make a language attractive to even more programmers , and for use in commercial applications .
Basically if you want to make a living using Lisp then you should hope more programmers use Lisp , even if they are n’t as “ 133t ” as you .
The fear of change argument :
We should n’t change feature X ( often CLOS ) because it is used so widely that changing it would force me to learn new things / update my code .
This is a flawed argument because other languages ( with supposedly dumber programmers ) are able to change themselves without problems .
If you depend on a removed feature you can always use an older compiler for the code , for example Visual Basic 6 is still used to build some older applications that are n’t compatible with Visual Basic .
Net .
The perfection argument :
Feature X is perfect they way it is .
This is unbelievable because perfection tends not to be humanly possible ; we simply try to approximate it with a greater and greater degree of accuracy .
It is possible that a change could be worse than the current way of doing things , but once we are open to the idea of change there is nothing stopping us from changing it again until we revert it to the original state or really do find something better .
The “ it could be worse argument ”
Sure Lisp has problems , but it is better than languages X , Y , Z and that is good enough for me .
I admit that Lisp is better now , but you ca n’t really be sure that will always be the case .
If Lisp does n’t move forwards than we can rest assured that something better than Lisp will be invented eventually .
The diversity argument
Fragmentation gives you options .
Sure it does , you just ca n’t have them all at once .
If you want feature Y in implementation A you have to give up Z in implementation B. Experimenting with variants is important of course , but that is why people write toy versions of languages , to try out new ideas .
Ideally the best features are then incorporated into the next version of the standard implementation (s ) .
The problem with Common Lisp is that such features do n’t make their way to the spec. , and it looks like they never will .
Also , confusing the versioning of a language with Common Lisp ’s fragmentation is so ridiculous that I am not even going to address it .
The personal attack argument :
You do n’t really use Common Lisp !
Go out and code instead of bitching !
God forbid we not be content with the status quo !
What should be done ?
So what should you do if you think Lisp could use some fixing ?
Go out and fix it .
Go write a toy version , it does n’t have to be fast or efficient .
However if you can use it to demonstrate something cool that fixes a problem people will either help you make it faster and smaller , or your feature will be adopted by a more professional implementation .
Do this enough and you just might end up with a new popular Lisp dialect .
These bills have been introduced in accordance with the rules of the U.S. House of Representatives , which allows for States to initiate the impeachment process through the Jefferson Manual .
Once passed through the State ’s congress , our U.S. Congress will be compelled to consider impeachment .
Jefferson ’s Manual is a sort of interpretive guide to parliamentary procedure , and is included ( along with the Constitution ) in the bound volumes of the Rules of the House of Representatives .
It is ratified by each congress ( including the current one ) , and has been updated continuously through the history of our democracy .
Within the Manual itself , the section covering impeachment is designated Section LIII .
Section 603 refers to the section of the entire volume ( including the Constitution and Rules ) in which you ’ll find the listing of acceptable vehicles for bringing impeachment motions to the floor .
It reads :
by charges preferred by a memorial , which is usually referred to a committee for examination ( III , 2364 , 2491 , 2494 , 2496 , 2499 , 2515 ; VI , 552 ) ; or by a resolution dropped in the hopper by a Member and referred to a committee ( April 15 , 1970 , p. 11941 - 2 ) ; by a message from the President ( III , 2294 , 2319 ; VI , 498 ) ; by charges transmitted from the legislature of a State ( III , 2469 ) or Territory ( III , 2487 ) or from a grand jury ( III , 2488 ) ; or from facts developed and reported by an investigating committee of the House ( III , 2399 , 2444 ) . "
" In the House of Representatives there are various methods of setting an impeachment in motion : by charges made on the floor on the responsibility of a Member or Delegate ( II , 1303 ; III , 2342 , 2400 , 2469 ; VI , 525 , 526 , 528 , 535 , 536 ) ; or by a resolution dropped in the hopper by a Member and referred to a committee ( April 15 , 1970 , p. 11941 - 2 ) ; by a message from the President ( III , 2294 , 2319 ; VI , 498 ) ; or Territory ( III , 2487 ) or from a grand jury ( III , 2488 ) ; or from facts developed and reported by an investigating committee of the House ( III , 2399 , 2444 ) . "
Contact these reps before they become dug - in on a position :
Beetle Bailey goes positively meta
In tune with our recent posts about substitutions for taboo language , a few days ago Beetle Bailey looked outside the frame and produced a strip that is actually somewhat funny :
There 's also a serious anthropological point here , one that I never thought of before .
Many cultures ( and some of our own subcultures ) proscribe praise just as much as blasphemy , scatology or obscenity .
For example , as the Wikipedia explains ,
Ashkenazi Jews in Europe and the Americas routinely exclaim Keyn aynhoreh !
( also spelled Kein ayin hara ! ) , meaning " No evil eye ! " in Yiddish , to ward off a jinx after something or someone has been rashly praised or good news has been spoken aloud .
Some milder residues of such attitudes remain in expressions like " knock on wood " .
But I 've never seen anyone using typographical bleeping to disguise the written expression of praise or good news , as has been done with blasphemy , scatology and obscenity in English texts at least since the end of the 17th century ..

Über Karl Valentin und Stochastik Peter Riedlberger
Ein bedenkliches Urteil über Zitate in Vorlesungsskripten im Internet
Ein Münchner Mathematikprofessor hielt im Wintersemester 2003/2004 eine Vorlesung " Einführung in die Stochastik " .
Zur Vorlesung erstellte er ein ausformuliertes Skript im Umfang von 277 Seiten , das sukzessive während der Vorlesung auf der Website zur Vorlesung erschien und auch später dort noch zum Download bereit stand .
Die Einleitung schloss mit zwei längeren Karl - Valentin - Zitaten , nämlich der Radfahrerszene aus " Theater in der Vorstadt " ( zwei Skriptseiten ) sowie dem ungekürzten " Der ängstliche Hausverkäufer " ( drei Skriptseiten ) .
Die erste Passage illustrierte den umgangssprachlichen höchst verschiedenen Umgang mit dem Begriff " Zufall " , die zweite höchst seltene , dafür höchst teure Zufallsereignisse , wie sie Rückversicherer berücksichtigen müssen .
Strafbewehrte Unterlassungserklärung im Namen von Karl Valentins Enkelin
Ein knappes Jahr später , im Dezember 2004 , fand der " Verwalter des urheberrechtlichen Nachlasses " das Skript im Netz und ließ dem Professor im Namen von A. K. , Enkelin und Erbin von Karl Valentin , umgehend eine strafbewehrte Unterlassungserklärung zustellen :
Er solle sich verpflichten , die ( a ) Valentin - Passagen weder im Internet zu veröffentlichen noch ( b ) in einem Skript für Vorlesungen zu vervielfältigen und zu verteilen .
Der Hochschullehrer nahm den
Text sofort aus dem Netz , gab aber die verlangte Erklärung nicht ab .
Daraufhin beantragte die Gegenseite eine einstweilige Verfügung , die jedoch nicht erlassen wurde .
Stattdessen fand am 19 .
Januar eine mündliche Verhandlung am Landgericht München I statt , bei der es , nachdem ein Vergleich scheiterte , zu einem Urteil kam .
Das Urteil fasst die Pressestelle des Gerichts folgendermaßen zusammen :
Dies gab der 21 .
Zivilkammer die Gelegenheit zu einer grundsätzlichen Entscheidung über den Widerstreit des Eigentumsgrundrechts und der ebenfalls grundrechtlich geschützten Freiheit von Forschung und Lehre .
Sie kam zu dem Ergebnis , dass auch längere Zitate geschützter Werke vom Inhaber des Urheberrechts hinzunehmen sind , wenn diese dazu dienen , Studenten den Vorlesungsstoff in plastischer Weise anschaulich zu machen .
Dass die Werke Karl Valentins hierzu geeignet sind , hat nicht zuletzt die Diskussion in der mündlichen Verhandlung gezeigt .
Eine Veröffentlichung ganzer Werke im Internet als Zitate in einem Vorlesungsskript untersagte die Kammer jedoch , wenn nicht durch technische Maßnahmen sichergestellt ist , dass entweder der Zugang oder die Möglichkeiten des ausschnittsweisen Kopierens aus dem Skript beschränkt sind .
Das Gerichte urteilte , dass es in Ordnung sei , die Skripten mit den Valentin - Passagen auch ohne Placet der Rechteinhaber in der Vorlesung auszuteilen .
Dagegen sei es nicht erlaubt , sie " einfach so " ins Internet zu stellen .
Man müsse das Skript entweder per Passwort schützen oder aber das Herauslösen der Valentin - Passagen ( durch Copy - Sperre ) verhindern - dann könnte man es auch ohne Zustimmung auf die Website setzen .
In der Urteilsbegründung erkennt das Gericht an , dass das Zitatrecht nach § 51 UrhG die Verbreitung der gedruckten Skripte deckte .
Das Gericht prüfte dabei gar nicht weiter , ob das Stochastik - Skript als wissenschaftliches Werk ( Ziffer 1 des § 51 ) anzusehen sei .
Vielmehr brachte es die allgemeinere Ziffer 2 des § 51 in Anwendung , in der es generell um " Sprachwerke " geht .
" haben die Verwertungsinteressen der Urheberrechtsinhaber ... zurückzutreten "
Hintergrund ist eine Entscheidung des Verfassungsgerichts aus dem Jahr 2000 zu " Germania 3 " .
Germania 3 ist ein Stück von Heiner Müller , in dem der Autor freigebig aus zwei Brecht - Szenen zitiert .
Als das Stück in Buchform erschien , zogen die Brecht - Erben vor Gericht , um eine weitere Verbreitung des Buchs zu verhindern .
Das OLG München gab den Erben im Jahr 1998 Recht , das Bundesverfassungsgericht kassierte im Jahr 2000 das Urteil :
Auf die Verfassungsbeschwerde des Verlegers von Heiner Müllers Werken hat die Kammer diese Entscheidung aufgehoben , weil das OLG München Bedeutung und Tragweite der Kunstfreiheit ( Art. 5 Abs. 3 Satz 1 GG ) grundlegend verkannt hat . [...]
Mit der Veröffentlichung steht ein Werk nicht mehr allein seinem Inhaber zur Verfügung .
Es tritt in den gesellschaftlichen Raum und kann damit zu einem eigenständigen , das kulturelle und geistige Bild der Zeit mitbestimmenden Faktor werden .
Es löst sich mit der Zeit von der privatrechtlichen Verfügbarkeit und wird geistiges und kulturelles Allgemeingut . [...]
Steht ein geringfügiger Eingriff in die Urheberrechte ohne die Gefahr merklicher wirtschaftlicher Nachteile der künstlerischen Entfaltungsfreiheit gegenüber , haben die Verwertungsinteressen der Urheberrechtsinhaber im Vergleich zu den Nutzungsinteressen für eine künstlerische Auseinandersetzung zurückzutreten .
Genau auf dieses Urteil beziehen sich die Richter bei dem Valentin - Urteil .
Aus der Urteilsbegründung :
Die Kammer ist der Ansicht , dass die Ausführungen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts im Beschluss vom 29.6.2000 ( GRUR 2001 , 149 Germania 3 ) zur Berücksichtigung der grundrechtlich geschützten Kunstfreiheit im Rahmen des Zitatrechts nach § 51 Ziff. 2 auch auf die Berücksichtigung der ebenfalls grundrechtlich geschützten Freiheit der Lehre übertragen werden müssen .
Denn der Gesichtspunkt , dass Gedanken , die in urheberrechtlich geschützten Werken enthalten sind , die Nachwelt zur Weiterentwicklung und Vertiefung anregen sollen , [...] gilt nicht nur für den Bereich der Kunst , sondern auch für den Bereich der Lehre .
Also : Nach der Analogie mit der Germania - 3 - Entscheidung verwenden die Richter § 51 Ziffer 2 . Bei der Ziffer 1 hätte erst geprüft werden müssen , ob das Zitat " zur Erläuterung des Inhalts " aufgenommen wurde .
Da die Richter aber Ziffer 2 verwendeten , gibt es nur eine zu berücksichtigende Voraussetzung : " in einem durch den Zweck gebotenen Umfang " , was aber vom Gericht anerkannt wird .
Damit hätte eigentlich die Geschichte abgeschlossen sein können , und das Gericht hätte die Unterlassung der Verbreitung sowohl als Hardcopy wie per Netz abschmettern können .
Bei den physischen Skripten war dies auch der Fall , nicht so beim Webzugriff :
Ein " ungeschriebenes Merkmal "
Denn zur Internetverbreitung meint das Gericht :
Der Verfügungsbeklagte war hierbei nicht durch [...] § 51 gedeckt , da die Nutzung nicht mehr vom Zitatzweck umfasst war . [...] so ist das Erfordernis der Geeignetheit zur Erreichung des Zitatzwecks als ungeschriebenes Merkmal auch bei dieser Tatbestandsalternative zu berücksichtigen .
Das Gericht wägt dann die Grundrechte der beiden Parteien gegeneinander ab und kommt zu dem Schluss , dass die ungeschützte Veröffentlichung im Internet nicht erforderlich war .
Der Mathematik - Professor hätte ja das Skript per Passwort schützen oder das auszugsweise Kopieren verhindern können .
Technisch hat das Gericht natürlich Recht : Beides sind zwei Optionen , die sich bei Adobe Acrobat oder Konkurrenzsoftware setzen lassen .
Dennoch kann man mit dem Urteil in dieser
Form keineswegs glücklich sein , denn hier kriechen Zugangsbeschränkungen in den Paragraphen 51 , die sich dort nicht finden ( höchstens ungeschrieben ) .
Es sei daran erinnert , dass in der Verfassungsgerichtsentscheidung um ein publiziertes Buch ging , nicht um ein im kleineren Kreis aufgeführtes Theaterstück .
Was würde passieren , wenn der Mathematik - Professor sein Skript als Buch drucken lassen würde ?
Vom Umfang und vom Grad der Ausarbeitung her wäre dies kein Problem .
Offenbar ginge es dann immer noch um dasselbe Grundrecht der Freiheit der Kunst , Wissenschaft und Lehre , doch der Zitatzweck wäre ein anderer .
Insofern müsste doch , analog zu Germania 3 , die Publikation möglich sein .
Was aber , wenn der Professor sein Buch nicht in Papierform , sondern als PDF im Internet publiziert und sich damit nicht mehr nur an " seine " Studenten , sondern an jeden Stochastik - Interessenten wendet ?
Merkwürdig auch , dass der höchst umstrittene Paragraph § 52 a in der ganzen Urteilsbegründung unerwähnt bleibt .
Er erlaubt , kleinere Teile eines Werks zur Veranschaulichung im Unterricht im Netz zu veröffentlichen - solange der Nutzerkreis aber auf die Unterrichtsteilnehmer begrenzt wird .
Achtung : Hier geht es nicht um Zitate , sondern um einzelne Teile ( also etwa Übungsaufgaben aus einem Buch o.ä. ) .
Solche Textstücke , die nicht als Zitat eingebaut werden müssen , erhalten diesen speziellen Schutz der Benutzerkreiseinschränkung .
Möglicherweise negative Auswirkungen auf Zitate im Internet
Das Münchner Urteil hat durchaus positive Aspekte - insbesondere die Anwendung von Germania 3 auf die Lehre .
Höchst bedenklich ist aber , dass die Münchner Richter dem Zitatrecht Zugangsbeschränkungen aufpropfen - denn diese werden weder im Gesetzestext , noch im Germania - Urteil , das sie ja als Vorlage nennen , gefordert .
Diese Fortentwicklung des Zitatrechts könnte möglicherweise negative Auswirkungen auf jeden haben , der im Internet aus nicht gemeinfreien Texten zitiert .
( Peter Riedlberger )
Joseph Dobbie is someone to feel really sorry for .
He met a girl at a party , sent a dreadfully poetic 500 - word email to her , she forwarded it to her sister and her sister forwarded it to some friends .
Then her friends forwarded it to the world .
By last Sunday his email was in my inbox and by Monday he was all over the papers - the latest victim of a technology which allows us to be highly entertained by emails featuring idiot stockbroker shag - braggers and wantonly cruel about people like Dobbie .
One email even read : ' Let 's see if we can get him in Metro [ the free London newspaper ] on Monday . '
We did much better than that .
I can't exactly stand in judgment .
I forwarded it on to a couple of friends , the subject field reading : ' I feel really bad about forwarding this ...' as though that makes it better .
Actually it 's worse : I was only number seven on the chain of emails , which came from my boyfriend , which came from his mate , which came from the sister 's mate .
Since a lot of my friends are journalists , I could conceivably be the reason it reached the media .
I sort of feel bad , but even though I 've seen his picture in the papers , it 's as if he does n't exist , which encapsulates the alarming beauty of the internet : when you 've pinged that email off into cyberspace , you can easily delude yourself into thinking it 's vanished into the ether , never to be read .
This , of course , is a long way from the truth .
Joseph may not feel any better , but there but for the grace of God go most of us .
I could probably be fired for some of the things that have emanated from my outbox .
My productivity has been seriously compromised by hours spent wondering whether referencing Chekhov in an email to a potential pull will make me look erudite or geeky , and questioning whether , ' Yeah , party was fun .
Felt well hungover today though .
best , T' , means , ' Let 's engage in a meaningful relationship that will definitely result in children , ' or , ' Was she the really drunk one who told the same story twice in 10 minutes ? '
All of which poses the question of how to flirt , score , start a loving relationship in an email without scaring the recipient or , alternatively , coming across as so cold as to be almost pathologically uninterested in other human beings .
I frequently find new and exciting ways to make a fool of myself , especially concerning boys , and preserving such moments in written form is one of my favourite ways to do so .
This flirtatious email etiquette guide is based on my own sorry experiences , with help from some equally inept friends .
1 Never use capitals
Or if you must , use them sparingly .
You are far too busy and important to worry about such piffling matters , you have hundreds of other more interesting people to send emails to , who are all a great deal more attractive than the recipient of this particular one .
That you might have to go through your tirelessly constructed email that obviously took you the best part of a working day to write and remove any accidental capital letters is beside the point .
Occasional spelling mistakes are also a good thing , the odd ' hte ' or ' adn ' emphasises that spellcheck is for losers with too much time on their hands .
However ...
2 Your punctuation must be perfect
This is for two reasons : good punctuation makes any writing flow better , thus adding to the impression that you are clever , witty , glib and likely to be extremely good company over a bottle of wine à deux .
Second , bad punctuation enrages some people and they will never go out with you if you email : ' they 're is going to be a party next weekend if youd like to come ' , as they will think you 're very stupid .
And they 'll be right .
3 Observe the two ' two ' rules
Always wait two hours to reply to an email - you may be hyperventilating with joy that they 've expressed interest in having a pint ' at some point ' , but waiting two hours will ( hopefully ) prevent you from writing something rash , such as , ' when ? now ? '
And if you write them two emails in a row and do n't get a reply , do n't write again .
Do n't ever be tempted to write : ' We 've had trouble with our servers today and so I just thought I 'd send this again since you have n't replied to the last couple of times I sent it so I just thought I 'd be sure just in case you did n't get them . '
It makes you look mad .
4 Do n't get overexcited by a large volume of emails
I enjoyed what I took to be the beginning of a promising e-romance on the basis that I 'd exchanged approximately one email every 10 minutes with a lovely - looking man at work for about two weeks , only to be told at the end of our one and only evening in a bar that I had ' rather different expectations ' than he did , especially since he had a girlfriend .
I thought ' kindred spirit ' , he thought , ' I am bored by my job and she makes inaccurate references to Chekhov , how diverting . '
5 Do not send highly personal and / or explicit emails from work
Yes , it 's all very enticing , the thrill of being caught etc but - take it from someone who knows - when you accidentally delete an important document and have to call IT to recover it , you do n't want some stranger reading your ' I really want you right here right now ' emails .
Emailing about having sex where you should n't is illicit and fun .
Having that nice , fatherly Barry who helps you retrieve files when you crash your PC know exactly what and where you next plan to ' do it ' and what underwear you are planning to wear , is not .
6 Do not be fooled into thinking that a charming , hilarious and sweet email equals a charming , hilarious and sweet sender
Do not be fooled into , oh , I do n't know , sleeping with someone on the first date on the basis that a couple of weeks of apparently deep and meaningful emails are equivalent to actually getting to know someone .
You might not notice that they are , in fact , a bit of a git who clearly spent just as long as you did artfully creating a personality for himself that was about as far removed from reality as your own nebulous e-personality , hence your complete mismatch .
7 Do n't nick an attractive stranger 's email address from a group email
This is what Dobbie did and look where it got him .
There is nothing scarier than an email that starts off , ' You do n't know me but ...'
As a one - time sender ( note to self : when really pretty boys do n't chat you up at a party , it 's because they do n't fancy you ) and one - time recipient ( ' We were at university together but I never plucked up the courage to talk to you ...
I was the one who dressed in army fatigues .
Do you like war games ? ' ) , it 's a lose - lose for all concerned .
8 Do n't get annoyed by being made to wait for a response
The rule is that people you are trying to impress may be left for up to four days without an answer .
This ensures the sender is left hanging on for a return email , unless of course they are equally cool .
Being left hanging means one of two things : they 're a bit of a player or they really like you and are scared of coming on too strong .
Good luck at figuring that one out .
If they answer , after a suitably long pause , ' fine . tuesday ? ' then they are a player .
So you 've got problems .
9 Do n't be deliberately cruel
Do n't dump someone over email .
Do n't forward heartfelt but unwanted declarations of love .
Do n't , as a friend of mine did , wait for someone to return from backpacking and create a fake email address to convince them they are going to have a Mexican lovechild .
Karma is a wonderful thing and we are all just one accidental ' send to all ' away from universal ridicule and a P45 .
10 And , finally , do n't send 500 - word , Dobbie - style emails
Ever .
And never include sentences like this , of Dobbie 's : ' I know that it makes me feel good to believe that maybe , if you are ever upset , knowing that I will be keeping your smile alive might help you through ' to people with mean sisters who might forward them to horrid journalists .
Like me .
Trust no one and good luck .

Hello Kate ,
It 's Joe - we met at Andrew 's party ...
It was wonderful to meet you on Saturday , and I wonder if you would consider meeting me for coffee sometime ; maybe at the Tate Modern ?
OK .
This is where my common sense is telling me to stop - keep it simple and positive , Joe ...
This is the part where I throw caution to the wind ; the part where I listen to my heart and remember that I should live my life as an exultation and revel in the opportunity to try ; the part where I refuse to apologise for who I am ; the part where I trust that the lady I met on Saturday night is , as I suspect , able to see sincerity where others would see cliche ...
Exceptions and Error Codes By Kyle Wilson
Wednesday , May 03 , 2006
As software engineers , we are admonished by the doyens of C++ programming that the correct way to report error conditions is to throw exceptions .
As game developers , we are the heirs to a vast body of common wisdom holding that exception handling overhead is too expensive for high - performance games , and that error codes are the only acceptable mechanism for propagating errors in game code .
What should we believe ?
Should we write this ?
int Function ( ) { if ( error ) return - 1 ; return 0 ; } Or this ?
void Function ( ) { if ( error ) throw std::exception ( ) ; } And why ?
Why Are Exceptions Good ?
Throwing an exception is , in many ways , like returning an error value from a function .
It returns control of the program to the scope from which a function was called and it indicates that an error occurred during execution of the function .
Yet Herb Sutter -- C++ guru , chairman of the ISO standards committee , man about town -- and co-author Andrei Alexandrescu advise us to " prefer using exceptions over error codes to report errors " [ 1 ] .
Why do modern software engineering practices encourage us to prefer exceptions ?
Because exceptions have a number of features which error codes lack : Exceptions can signal errors from within constructors and overloaded operators .
With exception handling disabled , the only mechanism for handling operator and constructor failures is the cumbersome one of setting an error flag in the object itself , which must be queried to see whether the object is in a valid state .
Exceptions cannot be ignored .
Functions that use error codes to indicate failure to their calling scope must be wrapped in FAIL_RETURN macros or some similar mechanism to propagate errors to the scope in which they will be handled .
This is unsightly and easy to forget .
Exceptions will propagate automatically .
Exceptions that are not handled will terminate the program , which is preferable to leaving the program executing in an invalid state .
The standard library uses exceptions .
The std :: string class can throw std::out_of_range .
Standard new can throw std::bad_alloc .
Calls to dynamic_cast can throw std:: bad_cast .
All of these standard mechanisms must be evaluated and adapted into other error - handling mechanisms or ignored by programs that run with exception handling disabled .
As I 've mentioned in a previous article , I achieved substantial memory savings and modest speed improvement by turning off exception handling in MechAssault 2 .
But it would be shortsighted to decide that exceptions are a bad idea because one can efficiently disable them in a program that does n't use them .
That program is already paying the branch - miss cost of conditional checks around every function that can return an error code .
In theory , a program that uses exceptions to indicate error conditions could be more efficient , if the exception - handling overhead were small enough in the absence of an exception and if exceptions were thrown relatively infrequently .
What Do Exceptions Cost , In Theory ?
It 's possible for a compiler to implement exception handling in such a manner that there is no performance cost unless an exception is actually thrown [ 2 ] .
To do so , the compiler generates table data that maps any possible instruction pointer address to a description of objects in the current scope that must be destroyed and to try / catch blocks in the current scope that are active .
This is quite a bit of data , though it could be kept contiguous so as not to interfere with cache locality until an exception occurs .
Zero -overhead exceptions are expensive when an exception is actually thrown , however , since every function on the unwinding call stack requires a fresh search through the table data for its instruction pointer location .
Neither Microsoft C++ nor GCC implement zero-overhead exception handling .
Instead , both compilers add prologue and epilogue instructions to track information about the currently executing scope .
This enables faster stack unwinding at the cost of greater runtime overhead when an exception is n't thrown .
As Vishal Kochhar describes in [ 3 ] , the Microsoft C++ compiler creates hidden local variables in each function that reference an exception handler function and a data table .
The data table is similar to the one I described zero - overhead exception handling implementations using , but in Microsoft 's implementation there is a small table for each function instead of a single large table for the entire instruction address space .
In Microsoft C++ , the overhead of exception handling in the absence of an exception is the cost of registering an exception handler as each function is entered and unregistering it as the function is exited .
As far as I can tell , that 's three extra push instructions and two movs in the prologue , and three more movs in the epilogue .
Cache locality is also negatively affected by exception handling overhead , as exception handlers are now scattered throughout the instruction space .
The overhead of exception handling when an exception is thrown is the cost of unwinding the stack , iterating over the function info tables for each function .
Each function 's data table must be searched to find stack objects requiring destruction and to check for type - appropriate catch blocks for the exception that was thrown .
Even with the additional bookkeeping that Microsoft 's implementation does at runtime , this is likely to be very slow .
What Do Exceptions Cost , In Practice ?
To measure the true cost of exceptions , one should compare them to an alternative mechanism for indicating errors .
For my tests , I wrote two functions , each of which fails with an error some small fraction of the time : int ErrorCodeFunction ( int count , int errorMod ) { EmptyClass emptyObj ; if ( count % errorMod == 0 ) { return - 1 ; } return 0 ; } void ExceptionFunction ( int count , int errorMod ) { EmptyClass emptyObj ; if ( count % errorMod == 0 ) { throw std::exception ( ) ; } } Each function contains a local variable of an empty class type , the constructor and destructor for which are defined in a separate translation unit .
This prevents the compiler from eliding the usual exception - handling prologue and epilogue when stack - unwinding is enabled .
I called each function from a loop of the form : for ( int I = 1 ; I < iterations ; ++i ) { ERROR_FAIL_RETURN ( ErrorCodeFunction( i , errorMod ) ) ; }
In my actual test code , I unrolled the loop sixty - four times so that my tests would n't be dominated by loop iteration overhead .
I #defined variants of the ERROR_FAIL_RETURN macro so that the tests for ErrorCodeFunction would return any failing ( non-zero ) error code returned .
The tests for ExceptionFunction simply called through to the function ; any exceptions thrown propagate up the stack automatically .
The interesting numbers to compare here are the performance of ErrorCodeFunction with stack unwinding disabled and of ExceptionFunction with stack unwinding enabled .
I give timings below for my home PC .
My computer is a 3.2 GHz Pentium D with three gigs of RAM .
My tests were compiled with Microsoft C++ v. 8.0 .
Relative results on the Xbox 360 , also using Microsoft 's compiler , were similar .
In my initial tests , I made " errorMod " greater than the number of iterations , so that no error was ever actually returned and no exception was ever actually thrown .
The results of this test bear out the conventional wisdom of game development .
Sixty - four million iterations of the error code function with stack unwinding disabled take 1.411 seconds .
The same number of iterations of the exception - throwing function with stack - unwinding enabled ( compiler option / EHsc ) take 1.525 seconds .
Exception handling is substantially more expensive than error codes .
With stack - unwinding enabled , the error code function was even more expensive , taking 1.600 seconds .
If you compile with support for exceptions , you pay the cost whether you use them or not -- so you might as well use them .
As well as being curious about the overhead of error - checking in error - free code , I was also curious about the costs of actually returning errors and throwing exceptions .
So I modified my unrolled timing loop to continue to the next iteration if a call to an error code function failed and wrapped the exception version in a try block with an empty catch .
Results were : Continue 1/1000000 Error Code Function 1.59981977 s Continue 1/1000000 Exception Function 1.53195719 s Continue 1/100000 Error Code Function 1.59838406 s Continue 1/100000 Exception Function 1.53634095 s Continue 1/10000 Error Code Function 1.59790273 s Continue 1/10000 Exception Function 1.57429491 s Continue 1/1000 Error Code Function 1.55498578 s Continue 1/1000 Exception Function 1.96710075 s
The fractions in the test names are the frequency with which errors are returned .
As can be seen , exceptions become more efficient than error codes when the error frequency is between one in one thousand and one in ten thousand .
Best Practices
The conventional wisdom of game development holds true .
If you 're writing a performance - critical game , you should compile with stack unwinding disabled and not use exceptions in your code .
You should use error codes where possible .
You should factor out possible constructor failures using the construct / initialize idiom .
If you write overloaded operators that can fail , you 'll have to indicate failure by setting flags on the object being operated on .
If you 're writing minesweeper , though , or writing tools in which realtime performance is n't so essential , exceptions should still be preferred for their greater flexibility or functionality .
Should they be preferred to error codes in all situations ?
In their article on the subject entitled " Graceful Exits " [ 4 ] , Jim Hyslop and Herb Sutter suggest that exceptions are appropriate for serious errors , because they cannot be ignored , but that less critical errors could appropriately be signaled by error codes .
I 'd argue that exceptions are appropriate for truly exceptional circumstances ; based on the profiling results above , they should be preferred for efficiency reasons if an error will occur 0.01 % of the time or less .
That class of events comprises truly unusual behavior , like disk failures to read or other hardware failures .
Exceptions may also signal constructor or operator failures , though in general it's best to avoid situations where these could occur in the first place .
Finally , no comment on error - handling best practices would be complete without mention of exception safety .
An exception - safe program is one which remains in a valid state if an exception is thrown .
When an exception occurs , such a program will leak no resources and voilate no class invariants .
Exception safety is facilitated by a variety of idioms : resource acquisition is initialization ( RAII ) , the PIMPL idiom , smart pointers , and nothrow - guaranteed swaps .
The key point that I want to make here is that exception safety is n't just something to be concerned about if you actually use exceptions and compile with stack - unwinding support .
Whether you throw an exception or return an error code , whether you 're calling a function that throws an exception or you 're wrapping a function call in a FAIL_RETURN macro , you should write functions that can safely exit at any point .
Even if you think you know all the return points in your code and have done all necessary clean - ups before each , someone else is going to have to modify your function someday , and there 's no reason to leave him or her a brittle function that 's easy to break .
Even in performance - critical game code compiled without exception support , prefer to use the idioms of exception safety except where they incur measurable costs .
Use smart pointers and RAII , and make sure that the functions you write are safe to exit at any point , and you 'll make your entire engine more stable and robust for your co-workers and for your future self .

Any opinions expressed herein are in no way representative of those of my employers .
Equine Herpesvirus Type 1 ( EHV - 1 ) has been in the news throughout the country recently , with outbreaks of the virus occurring in locations as varied as Florida , Connecticut and California .
A week ago we got the news that this nasty virus was closer than we thought .
The state ordered an immediate quarantine of the Virginia Tech Marion DuPont Scott Equine Medical Center after veterinary doctors reported a suspected infection of the neurological form of equine herpesvirus in three hospitalized horses .
By the next day it was being reported that the quarantine now involved 175 horses and 4 counties in the immediate area .
EHV - 1 is a highly infectious disease that usually affects the respiratory system .
Occasionally , the virus may also cause neurological disease .
Transmission likely occurs by inhaling infected droplets or ingesting material contaminated by nasal discharges or aborted fetuses .
The disease can prove fatal in approximately 40 percent of cases .
In severe cases , the affected horse will become unable to stand ; these cases have a very poor prognosis .
To date , there is no effective treatment for EHV - 1 .
Local horse owners are taking this potential outbreak very seriously .
Proof is evident throughout Virginia 's horse country and the region , with event cancellations , self - imposed quarantines , and the halt of all horse sales and auctions in the state of Virginia .
The appearance of EHV - 1 in Northern Virginia has affected casual horse - hobbyists to 4 - H - ers ; from fox - hunt clubs to top - flight trainers .
My facility is less than 25 miles from the Marion Dupont Center , where the virus first appeared .
I feel relatively safe knowing that none of the horses here have been off the grounds in the last six months , and no one is going anywhere until this thing blows over .
Unfortunately putting your barn on lock down is n't enough when dealing with a disease as dangerously contagious as EHV - 1 .
There is no fail safe way to prevent any horse from developing EHV - 1 .
Several types of vaccine are available for the four known strains of EHV ( 1 - 4 ) , though none have proven fully effective against the neurological strain .
Your best defense , as they say , is a good offense
There is an old saying : " An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure . "
Biosecurity is the best possible way to prevent the spread of EHV - 1 at your facility .
Biosecurity means doing everything you can to reduce the chances of an infectious disease being carried onto your farm by people , animals , equipment , or vehicles , either accidentally or on purpose .
Many local stables are limiting visitors to one entrance and making a foot bath to walk through before entering the Barn .
Instructions for preparing an easy foot bath
You will need :
1 . A low plastic pan or bin , wide enough to fit an adult ’s foot , shallow enough to step into easily
2 . A plastic doormat ( the “ fake grass ” mats work well )
3 . A disinfectant that works when manure or dirt is present , such as Tek - trol or One Stroke Environ or bleach
4. Water
Mix the disinfectant with water following label instructions .
Put the doormat in the plastic pan .
Add disinfectant so that the bottom of the “ grass ” is wet .
Ask visitors to walk through the footbath , wiping their feet on the mat .
The “ grass ” scrubs their shoes a bit as they wipe them , and applies the disinfectant .
When the liquid starts to get dirty , empty it and put in new disinfectant .
There are several good websites with further information on EHV - 1 and how to prevent it .
Here are a few that I found helpful .

Meet Sally - young , inescapably female and a gadget obsessive .
She 's not alone .
Forget the idea that technology is the preserve of pale men in darkened rooms .
Now big business , from top fashion houses to hi-tech manufacturers , is scrambling to get a piece of the new woman consumer .
Polly Vernon introduces the new nerds
Sally Dixon has several mobile phones , a Nokia 7200 Navigator ( which is a bit like a BlackBerry and , actually , she 's got one of those too ) , four plasma screen TVs , a car that she can activate by remote control from her flat ( so that it 's warmed up by the time she gets to it on frostier mornings ) , an iBook and a super hi-spec Mac G5 .
She 's got a pair of Bang & Olufsen telephones , a digital camera and a Bose Lifestyle entertainment system that controls the individual output of each of the four amps she has wired into different rooms in her house .
She 's got a first generation iPod and was the first person she knew to hear about MP3 players , let alone actually possess one .
' And then I got a mini iPod too , because , well , it was pink . '
Sally Dixon loves gadgets .
' I just think it 's fascinating , the things they can do , ' she says .
' I covet gadgets like I covet handbags , like shoes .
Probably more in fact .
It has been ages since I spent loads of money on a handbag .
I go to the Selfridges technology department , just for a look , just to pass the time .
Whenever I 'm in an airport , I 'll have a quick look in Dixons .
I always want something new .
If I see someone else with something new , I want that , too .
I 've got a wish list in my head .
I 'm a little bit obsessed .
Do I sound like a freak ? '
Perhaps less of a freak , and more of a pioneer .
She 's hardly your traditional technology consumer - your gadget - fixated , spec-obsessed nerdy archetype .
She is a young , glamorous , fashion editor for the glossy magazine B - and quite inescapably female .
Sally Dixon is the technology consumer of the future .
In fact , increasingly , she and women like her are the technology consumers of right now .
According to a recent report ( commissioned early this summer by Dixons , who are unsurprisingly keen to tap into this burgeoning market ) electronics retailers have experienced a 20 % increase in female customers over the course of the past two years .
Silke Schilde , press officer for Sony , claims that in the UK last year , ' the number of female versus male purchasers of laptops , cameras and TVs is about the same .
Women seem to be buying gadgets , just as much as men . '
New research by ICM suggests women spend three times as much on gadgets as they do on beauty products and treatments each year - an average of £ 634 on MP3 players , digital cameras and mobile phones , compared with £ 222 on cosmetics , facials and manicures .
And in the teen market , statistics show that girls aged 13 - 18 are more likely to use mobile phones , digital cameras and DVD players than their male equivalents .
Two things are widely believed to have fuelled British women 's love affair with technology : increasingly good styling and developments in ' sociable ' gadgetry - gadgets such as mobile phones and digital cameras that enhance , accommodate and facilitate their user 's social life rather than limit it , as televisions are perceived to do .
' Fashion and technology are converging rapidly , ' says Joanne Illingworth , brand marketing manager of Dixons .
' Look at the number of adverts devoted to gadgets .
They 're taking up space and time slots that were previously occupied by fashion or make - up .
Technology is a fashion statement .
What 's the first thing anyone does when they get to a pub or a restaurant ?
They get their phone out of their bag and put it on the tabletop - partly in case they get a call or a text , but partly because they 're showing off .
Women need their mobiles , and their gadgets generally , to make a statement . '
Katie Lee , journalist and editor of Shiny Shiny , a weblog for gadget - obsessed women , agrees - to an extent .
' Women want good design , absolutely , and there 's nothing wrong with that .
But also women , more than men even , need to see a use in every gadget .
They need to know exactly how it 's going to fit into their lives , what it 's going to do for them . '
Lee is sitting in an east London pub with the contents of her handbag strewn across the table .
It 's an impressive array .
She possesses gadgets I 've never heard of and accoutrements ( such as a phone charm made of Swarovski crystal ) that send me spiralling into what Sally Dixon calls ' gadget envy ' .
' More than styling , size has had a big impact , ' says Lee .
' As things have got smaller , women have got more interested because physically these laptops , phones , whatever , are easier to carry around .
So there 's a straightforward appeal in things being pink or sparkling or cute .
But if they do n't do what we need them to do , or if they 're too big , we do n't care . '
Lee agrees that the social function of gadgets is crucial to women : ' Women like gadgets that have nothing to do with sitting in a darkened room , hunched over a keyboard .
They like mobile gadgets .
That 's why mobile phones were such a major gateway gadget for so many women .
Watch this .'
Lee takes a picture of me with her phone and fiddles about with its keypad for a few seconds .
' Now you 're on my moblog , ' she says .
' It 's a mobile weblog , a photo log .
I take pictures with my phone as I go about my day , post them on my moblog , and people can have a look to see where I am and what I 'm up to . '
It 's taken the various major electronics manufacturers a surprising amount of time to catch on to the fact that they should be marketing directly to Lee , Dixon and their female contemporaries .
Apart from Apple - who were way ahead of the game when they launched their jewel coloured iMacs in the late nineties , machines that evolved into all - white iBooks , the much - coveted iPods and the white , airy , women - pleasing flagship stores in Manhattan and Regent Street - and Samsung , who , Lee points out , have pretty much built an entire business on the back of a female market with their elegant , compact - like silver phones , it 's only really over the course of the past year that most companies have started targeting female customers .
But they 're getting the hang of things now .
Dixons , for example , has doubled its training budget in the interest of teaching staff about body language , speech patterns and attitudes that might help them engage with female consumers .
By 2008 , they hope to have at least a 45/55 split on female / male employees .
In mid-June 2005 , they also launched an evening entitled ' Glam , Gizmos and Geek Chic ' , a women - only shopping event that will roll out through their UK stores over the course of the next few months .
While general opinion indicates that they would do well to put some of that cash towards prettifying their stores and carrier bags , you have to commend Dixons for the effort .
Elsewhere , Sony 's sleek , chic , boutique - styled stores , which are located on major shopping thoroughfares , sandwiched between shoe shops and fashionably contemporised department stores , were certainly developed with a female consumer in mind .
Siemens is in the process of planning a ' women 's only ' launch of a mobile phone designed by an all - female team , while Sky + was launched with a keen eye on the female market .
Fashion designers Matthew Williamson and Cath Kidston have even been drafted in to design limited edition Sky+ boxes .
Kate Rainbow , the 31 - year - old owner of a communications company , is a woman with both a personal and a professional interest in technology .
She believes dressing up gadgets so they appeal to more women will be the next huge growth area .
' It 's only now becoming obvious , but the market in accessorising is huge , ' she says .
' Swarovski crystal covers for BlackBerries , laptop bags , phone fascias and phone charms .
The potential to customise phones and gadgets will grow immensely .
People , women in particular , want to make their gadgets individual in some way .
I 've customised every phone I 've had .
The technology wo n't differentiate between male and female consumers .
But the packaging , the styling and the accessorising will .'
Lee agrees : ' Increasingly the lines between jewellery or accessory and gadget are being blurred .
You can literally wear your phone or your digital camera around your neck on necklaces designed for that purpose ( although I 'm not keen on that look ) .
You can strap your iPod shuffle round your arm with the bracelet provided .
You carry your laptop in a Roland Mouret or a Julian McDonald laptop bag - laptops are quickly becoming the new handbags . '
But there are rumblings of discontent about all this from certain factions of the female technology market .
There is , perhaps , something offensive in suggesting women should be sold to as one undifferentiated lump , and that you 'll charm the hard - earned cash from their Mulberry purses simply by coating electronics in sparkles and Hello Kitty logos .
Lee receives a lot of flack from disgruntled female bloggers who object to Shiny Shiny 's appreciation of gratuitously pink gadgets .
Even she thinks the girlification of gadgetry has its limits .
' I went to Paris recently for the launch of a Roja phone , ' she says , ' and it had a mirror on it and a specially designed perfume to go with it .
Let 's face it , that is pretty patronising .'
And despite her pink mini iPod and her stylist sensibilities , Dixon prides herself in knowing a huge amount about the interiors of her gadgets , which she often researches hard before she makes a purchase .
' I can generally fix them .
I 'm good , particularly with computers . '
She will certainly not be availing herself of the services of companies such as Geeks on Wheels , freelance IT men who charge a premium to speed round to the homes of girls incapable of unfreezing their iPod screens or resetting their Freeview boxes .
Lee thinks that the manufacturers , the female consumers and society at large still have some way to go .
Popular culture , she says , is refusing to acknowledge women 's interest in gadgets .
' Carrie Bradshaw had an iBook in Sex and the City , and everyone had mobile phones .
But , apart from that , you do n't see a lot of evidence of female take - up of technology reflected on TV . '
Lee has written sporadically for women 's magazines on the subject ' but they only ever print very half - hearted coverage .
Sooner or later they give up .
They simply do n't understand the level of interest there actually is .'
But this will change .
We 're unknowingly raising a generation of kids who are so technologically literate that they make Dixon and Lee look positively 20th century .
Paul Jackson of Forrester Research , a company that specialises in technology market research , thinks both male and female teenagers embrace consumer electronics products simply because they 've grown up with them .
' They do n't necessarily see it as technology any more , ' he says .
' They just accept it , like we accept electricity or television . '
' My niece is 14 , ' adds Lee .
' She had a CD player , a DVD in her room before she was in her teens .
She got an iPod as soon as she could .
She has countless email accounts .
She was IMing ( instant messaging ) before I was .
She does n't like gaming though . '
What 's next for women and gadgets ?
Dixon thinks it 'll all be the gadgeting up of our homes .
' People look for technological extras when they 're buying new houses , ' she says .
' That 's why I incorporated so many into mine .
I spent more time and cash on them than I did the soft furnishings . '
Jo Illingworth of Dixons thinks televisions will become more important to the female buyer .
' Women love plasma screens .
Because they 're flat they do n't take up any space .
Women are n't so interested in the high definition , but more in the way TVs fit into their homes . '
Rainbow thinks the future of women and technology rests on targeting different types of women and beyond .
It 'll be about all sorts , she says , ' about breaking down specific markets .
For example , early this year Nokia developed an incredibly simply mobile in Japan , that had huge buttons and only two functions - to make and receive calls - and they launched it as a granddad phone .
It proved incredibly successful .
I think we 'll see more of that .'
Which , of course , would be the best idea all round .
Never mind technology for women .
The future is technology for individuals .
As Lee says : ' Just make things that are small and look nice - because men like nice , small things as well . '

The FCC has just released its amended numbers for complaints of all kinds that were filed in the third quarter of 2006 .
Dealing as it does with such a wide range of communications issues , the FCC hears complaints that cover everything from cell phone billing practices to digital television issues to electrical interference .
Most interesting of all , though , are the obscenity complaints — and there were a lot of them .
The FCC received 162,170 indecency / obscenity complaints between July and September 2006 .
The complaints were not evenly distributed within those three months , though , which is a pattern we 've seen before .
In July , only 179 people complained .
In August , 404 people complained .
But September is apparently the filthiest month of all , as it generated a whopping 161,587 complaints to the FCC — a one - month increase of 40,000 percent .
What generally happens is that activist groups like the Parents Television Council ( " Because our children are watching " ) monitor the dirtiest shows on television , then write up the foul language and sexual activity in excruciating , pornographic detail ( if you think I 'm kidding , look halfway down the PTC page about Nip / Tuck for the paragraph beginning " Sex acts depicted ... " ) .
Video clips are also archived and shown in order to generate the requisite outrage .
Periodic , large - scale campaigns are then mounted to flood the FCC with complaints over particular shows , and whenever one of these is successful , there 's a massive spike in obscenity complaints .
Judging from the numbers in July and August , few Americans care enough to contact the FCC without such prompting .
This holds true in areas besides obscenity .
Although disgust with the customer service offered by cable companies and big telecom firms is widespread around the office water cooler , that does n't translate into many official complaints .
Only 678 people complained about wireless service quality in the entire three - month period , and only 2,032 complained about any sort of billing or rate problem .
Only 100 people were upset about their cable bills .
Surprisingly , 5,741 people complained about unsolicited faxes , which raises the obvious question : people still use faxes ?
( I kid , I kid . )
Faced with public demonstrations of discontent by its employees , Wal - Mart Stores has developed a wide - ranging new program intended to show that it appreciates its 1.3 million workers in the United States and to encourage them to air their grievances .
As part of the effort , Wal - Mart managers at 4,000 stores will meet with 10 rank - and - file workers every week and extend an additional 10 percent discount on a single item during the holidays to all its employees , beyond the normal 10 percent employee discount .
The program , described in an internal company document , was created during a volatile six months period , starting when the company instituted a set of sweeping changes in how it managed its workers .
Over that time , Wal - Mart has sought to create a cheaper , more flexible labor force by capping wages , using more part - time employees , scheduling more workers at nights and weekends , and cracking down on unexcused days off .
Under the agreement , the first part of the aid — 50,000 tons of fuel oil , or an equivalent value of economic or humanitarian aid — will be provided by South Korea , Russia , China and the United States ; in the case of the United States , doing so requires congressional approval , which Mr. Bush is likely to have a difficult time securing .
Image The North Korean delegation to the six - party negotiations in Beijing , led by Kim Kye- gwan , center , applauded after the agreements details were announced during closing ceremonies .

In return for disabling the reactor and declaring all its nuclear programs , the North is to eventually receive another 950,000 tons of oil in stages .
Further negotiations among the six nations are scheduled to begin on March 19 in Beijing .
“ It ’s about actions for actions , ” Gordon Johndroe , a spokesman for the National Security Council , said this morning .
“ We have leverage because they ’re under a U.N. Security Council sanctions regime . ”
The agreement was read aloud this morning to all the delegates , gathered in a conference room at a Chinese state guesthouse in Beijing .
The Chinese envoy , Wu Dawei , then asked if there were any objections .
When none were made , the officials all stood and applauded .
Though Mr. Hill and other envoys spoke to reporters about the accord as soon as it had been reached , in the small hours of this morning , the formal announcement was not made by China , host of the talks , until this afternoon .
During a ceremony televised nationally , the chief Chinese negotiator , Wu Dawei , praised the participating nations for their flexibility and declared the deal a “ successful ending . ”
Negotiators spent five days trying to reach a deal but were stymied until the very end by North Korean demands for large amounts of energy aid .
Mr. Hill said he and the North Korean envoy , Kim Kye-gwan , had initially agreed at an informal January meeting in Berlin that the amount of energy promised to the North would not be specified until working groups were established .
But the North insisted at the neijing talks that a hard figure be set in the new agreement .
Ultimately , the delegations agreed on 1 million tons of fuel oil .
But the pil will not all come right away :
After the first 50,000 tons are delivered in the initial 60 - day period , the remainder will be tied delivered as the North meets later requirements to disclose and disable its nuclear arsenal .
Hating John Searle
I think John Searle might be my favorite living philosopher .
But when I tell my friends this , they recoil in horror .
“ That bastard ? ” one friend cries .
“ He tripled my rent ! ” “ Oh geebus , ” another cries .
“ The Chinese Room argument is awful . ”
I will not profess to have an opinion on whether the fourteenth amendment requires the City of Berkeley to provide a rational basis for only allowing its landlords to raise rents at forty percent of the increase in the consumer price index , but I must admit I fail to see what the question has to do with Searle as a philosopher .
The other complaint seems less ad hominem , but I think is fundamentally similar .
Reading Searle ’s published books , it ’s striking how little space the Chinese Room Argument takes up .
Indeed , his book on the subject of consciousness —
The Rediscovery of the Mind — gives it little more than a paragraph and notes that his more recent argument against functionalism is far more powerful .
Nonetheless , I will defend the Chinese Room Argument .
The basic idea , for those who are n’t familiar with it , is this : imagine yourself being placed in a room and given instructions on how to convert one set of Chinese symbols to another .
To outsiders , if the instructions are good enough , it will seem as if you understand Chinese .
But you do not consciously understand Chinese — you are simply following instructions .
Thus , no computer can ever consciously understand Chinese , because no computer does more than what you ’re doing — it ’s simply following a set of instructions .
( Indeed , being unconscious , it ’s doing far less . )
The Chinese Room Argument works mainly as a forcing maneuver .
There are only two ways out of it : you can either claim that no one is conscious or that everything is conscious .
If you claim that no one is conscious , then there is no problem .
Sure , the man does n’t consciously understand Chinese , but he does n’t consciously understand English either .
However , I do n’t think anyone can take this position with a straight face .
( Even Daniel Dennett is embarrassed to admit it in public . )
The alternative is to say that while perhaps the man does n’t consciously understand Chinese , the room does .
( This is functionalism . )
I think it ’s pretty patently absurd , but Searle provides a convincing refutation .
Functionalists argue that information processes lead to consciousness .
Running a certain computer program , whether on a PC or by a man with a book or by beer cups and ping pong balls , will cause that program to be conscious .
Searle points out that this is impossible ; information processes can’t cause consciousness because they ’re not brute facts .
We ( conscious humans ) look at something and decide to interpret it as an information process ; but such processes do n’t exist in the world and thus ca n’t have causal powers .
Despite the obvious weakness of the arguments , why do so many of my friends continue to believe in functionalism ?
The first thing to notice is that most of my friends are computer programmers .
There ’s something about computer programming that gets you thinking that the brain is nothing more than a special kind of program .
But once you do that , you ’re stuck .
Because one property of computer programs is that they can run on any sort of hardware .
The same program can run on your Mac or a PC or a series of gears and pulleys .
Which means it must be the program that ’s important ; the hardware ca n’t be relevant .
Which is patently absurd .
I used to think that part of the reason my friends believed this was because they had no good alternatives .
But I ’ve since explained to them Searle ’s alternative — consciousness is a natural phenomenon which developed through evolutionary processes and is caused by the actions of the brain in the same way solidity is caused by the actions of atoms — and it has n’t caused them to abandon their position one bit .
So I tried a different tack .
I asked them what they thought was wrong with Searle ’s position .
And the answer always seems to come down to a confusion between ontology and epistemology .
Ontology is a fancy word for the facts of the matter — what actually exists out in the world .
And epistemology is the world for the way we know about it .
Unless you subscribe to a bizarre philosophical theory , things in the world exist irrespective of whether we know them or not .
Behind the TV game show door , there either is a car or there is n’t , even if no one can see in to tell which one is the case .
Furthermore , things continue to exist even if we can’t even know them in principle .
There appears to be no way for me to ever tell what it feels like for you to taste an orange ; nonetheless , there is indeed something that it feels like for you .
My programmer friends ’ argument always ends up coming down to this : if a computer program acted conscious , if it plaintively insisted that it was conscious , if it acted in all respects like the conscious people we know in the real world , then it must be conscious .
How could we possibly tell if it was not ?
In short , they believe in the Turing Test as a test for consciousness — anything that acts smart enough to make us think it ’s conscious must be conscious .
This was the position Ned Block was trying to refute when he postulated a computer program known as Blockhead .
Blockhead is a very simple ( although very large ) computer program .
It simply contains a list of all possible thirty minute conversations .
When you say something , Blockhead looks it up in the list , and says whatever the list says it ’s supposed to say next .
( Obviously such a list would be unreasonably long in practice , perhaps even when heavily compressed , but let us play along theoretically . )
Having a conversation with Blockhead would be just like having a conversation with a real person .
But nobody could seriously claim the program was conscious , right ?
Well , in fact they do .
One wonders whether these people think their cell phones are conscious .
After all , talking to a properly - enabled cell phone works just like talking to a properly - enabled person !
( I asked one friend this and his response was that the whole system containing the cell phone and the wires and the person on the other end was conscious . )
The point is that we do n’t assign consciousness purely based on behavior .
Blockhead acts like it ’s conscious and a completely paralyzed person acts like they ’re not , yet we all know that the first is n’t conscious and the second is .
Instead , we assign consciousness based on causes .
We know dogs are conscious because we know they have brains that are very much like ours which cause behavior very much like ours .
We do n’t make that judgment based on behavior alone .
Criticisms aside , what is the positive argument for John Searle ?
First , he has done important work in a wide variety of fields .
As far as I can tell , he began following up the works of his teachers ( like J. L. Austin ) on the topic of speech acts , which he generalized to the subject of intentionality , which he solved by saying it was a property of conscious beings , which led him to develop a theory of consciousness .
Second , all of his points seem quite reasonable to me and ( with a few exceptions ) I agree with them .
Third , he writes extremely clearly and entertainingly and for a popular audience .
These three seem like a fairly low bar — they ’re about what I would expect from myself were I a philosopher — but its shocking how few prominent philosophers seem to meet them .
Daniel Dennett is a dreadfully prolix writer and is insane .
Thomas Nagel comes close but is a fairly committed dualist .
Hilary Putnam does n’t write for a popular audience .
Peter Singer does n’t seem to develop any actual theories .
So I ca n’t think of any .
Can you ?

A law passed late last week right before the 109th Congress wrapped up its final session will outlaw pretexting , the practice of obtaining someone else 's phone records without their permission .
Pretexting has been going on for years , but the practice recently moved into the public consciousness with the recent scandal over HP 's investigation into leaks of confidential information by one or more of its board members .
Passed by voice vote on Friday night , the legislation calls for fines of up to $ 250,000 and up to 10 years in prison for individuals engaging in pretexting .
Companies caught pretexting would face fines of up to $ 500,000 .
The law 's passage marks a small victory for consumers , but a larger one for phone companies .
Some consumer groups wanted the phone companies forced to tighten their own security procedures and to impose penalties on companies that gave out information to unauthorized parties .
Currently , the practice is illegal in 12 states .
In areas where pretexting is not specifically outlawed , prosecutors have been forced to bring action under existing anti-fraud or consumer - protection statutes .
The new federal law will supersede state legislation , which will help consumers in states like California .
The MPAA lobbied against pretexting legislation in California , working for the defeat of a bill that would have made pretexting illegal .
The MPAA told legislators that it needed to ability to " pose as someone other than who we are to stop illegal downloading . "
Phone records are now in the same category as financial records when it comes to pretexting .
Obtaining someone else 's financial records under false pretenses was outlawed in 1999 .
Repeal the Military Commissions Act
by : J. Clifford Cook
recipient : Nancy Pelosi , Speaker , United States House of Representatives
The Military Commissions
Act of 2006 presents a grave threat to liberty and the rule of law in the United States in the following ways :
It revokes habeas corpus , thereby giving the power to imprison people without trial for as long as the President likes
It legalizes torture
It creates a secret committee controlled by the President that can declare anyone to be an enemy , and thereby strip away their legal rights guaranteed by the Constitution
It ends protection of prisoners of war by the Geneva Conventions
It removes the right to a speedy trial It gives George W. Bush and other top officials legal amnesty for any war crimes has committed
It sets up absurd kangaroo courts that fail to meet the most fundamental standards of justice recognized by free nations , with unfair trials kept hidden from the American public
The Military Commissions
Act does nothing to make America more secure .
Rather , the Military Commissions
Act makes America less secure by crippling the accountability of American government to the people .
Partial fixes are not enough .
Amendments to certain aspects of the Military Commissions
Act that leave other aspects intact fail to address the full scope of the problem .
Therefore , we ask for a simple and complete solution :
The absolute and total repeal of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 .

We call upon the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate to pass legislation that
As a promotion , Skype began allowing its users to place free domestic “ SkypeOut ” calls from their computers to traditional and mobile phones last May .
At the time , the company said the promotion would extend only through year ’s end .
The company is offering a half - price subscription to those who sign up before Jan. 31 .
Calls from one computer to another have been and will continue to be free .
“ We see a willingness by consumers to make SkypeOut calls that are well priced , ” said Don Albert , Skype ’s general manager for North America .
He noted that the cost was still a fraction of the typical $ 25 monthly fee that other Internet phone providers charge for unlimited calls .
Mr. Albert declined to predict the adoption rate for the plan or the revenue it could bring in .
Despite the relatively low cost of the service , industry analysts said Skype was not considered to be serious competition in the telecommunications business .
Skype , unlike Vonage , the cable companies and other competitors , generally requires users to download software and to make calls from the device on which it is installed .
“ Skype requires a behavioral change .
Consumers have grown quite comfortable using their telephones , ” said Jeffrey Halpern , a telecommunications services industry analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company .
“ I do n’t view Skype as a real threat to the telephone companies or even Vonage or the cable companies . ”
Over all , the Internet calling business is booming .
Mr. Halpern said that by the end of the third quarter , there were around 8 million subscribers to Internet calling plans in the United States , up from 6.5 million in the previous quarter .
That figure did not include users of Skype .
Last Friday , at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , Rupert Murdoch sat on a panel where he lamented what he described as a “ loss of power ” due to the ascension of the Internet and other new media .
The notion that this captain of one of the most dominant media conglomerates in the world is trembling in the shadow of bloggers is simply absurd .
Especially when you consider the fact that his company is also a dominant player on the Internet with an aggressive acquisitiveness that includes MySpace , the world ’s largest online social networking site .
But there was a more shocking exchange that took place that ought to have caused more of a stir amongst professional journalists and all freedom loving people .
It was an exchange that revealed something that most conscious beings knew , but which I have never seen explicitly articulated .
Murdoch was asked if News Corp. had managed to shape the agenda on the war in Iraq .
His answer ?
“ No , I do n’t think so .
We tried . ”
Asked by Rose for further comment , he said : “ We basically supported the Bush policy in the Middle East … but we have been very critical of his execution . ”
Let me repeat this : “ We Tried ! ”
Setting aside the nonsense that they had ever been critical of Bush ’s adventures in Baghdad , having confessed to being deliberatly deceitful raises some questions .
For instance , how can anyone ever again take seriously Fox News or any of Murdoch ’s other instruments of bias ?
How can News Corp. continue to pretend that they are “ fair and balanced ? ”
How can any other media company exhibit the slightest expression of respect or patronization ?
And speaking of other media companies , where are they now ?
The Chairman and CEO of a media empire that includes the number one rated cable news network , and numerous newspapers around the world , has just admitted that he tried to use that empire to “ shape the agenda ” in support of a partisan political goal with consequences of life , death , and global destabilization .
Why has the media , who you might think would have some interest in this subject , virtually ignored these remarks ?
We know they were there because , on the very same day , there was a media tempest over remarks by John Kerry on whether Bush had turned the U. S. into an international pariah .
That trumped up commotion was led , of course , by Fox News .
Even the Hollywood Reporter downplayed the most startling portion of Murdoch ’s presentation by headlining their story : “ Big media has less sway on Internet . ”
They apparently felt that that was a more weighty revelation than the attempted thought - control exposed by Murdoch .
Where is the outrage ?
Where are the calls to disband this mammoth and unlawful propaganda machine ?
Murdoch , who was made an American citizen by an act of Congress because , otherwise , he could not own an American television network , should have his citizenship revoked and be deported back to Australia .
Think of the precedent this sets for any other wealthy and ambitious ideologue that seeks to manipulate public opinion .
There are plenty of wealthy and ambitious ideologues in the Middle East and elsewhere who may view Murdoch as a role model .
At the very least , it needs to be broadcast far and wide that News Corp. and Fox News are nothing but a tool of the neo-con operatives in government .
You might say we already knew that , but this is different .
We are not merely accusing them of this stance , they have now admitted it .
And it can not be tolerated !
Not by any standard of journalistic ethics .
Not by a nation that values a free press so much that it incorporated that freedom into its Constitution .

Hawking has still to provide a fully worked mathematical proof
His popular science book A Brief History of Time was a publishing sensation , staying at the top of the best - seller lists longer than any other book in recent history .
But behind the public face lies an argument that has been raging for almost 30 years .
Hawking shot to fame in the world of physics when he provided a mathematical proof for the " Big Bang " theory .
This theory showed that the entire Universe exploded from a singularity - an infinitely small point with infinite density and infinite gravity .
Hawking was able to come to his proof using mathematical techniques that had been developed by Roger Penrose .
However , Penrose 's techniques were developed to deal not with the beginning of the Universe but with black holes .
Science had long predicted that if a sufficiently large star collapsed at the end of its life , all the matter left in the star would be crushed into an infinitely small point with infinite gravity and infinite density - a singularity .
Hawking realised that the Universe was , in effect , a black hole in reverse ; instead of matter being crushed into a singularity , the Universe began when a singularity expanded to form everything we see around us today - from stars to planets to people .
Hawking realised that to come to a complete understanding of the Universe , he would have unravel the mysteries of the black hole .
Leaking holes
Hawking and his fellow physicist embarked on an extraordinary intellectual expedition - to tame the black hole .
The period from the early 70s to the early 80s became known as the " Golden Age " of black hole research .
Slowly physicists were coming to understand its nature .
But Hawking realised that there was something missing from the picture that was emerging .
All work on black holes to that point used the physics of the large - scale Universe .
The physics of gravity - first developed by Newton and then refined by Einstein 's general theory of relativity .
Hawking realised that to come to a full understanding of black holes , physicists would also have to use the physics of the small - scale Universe ; the physics that had been developed to explain the movements of atoms and sub-atomic particles known as quantum mechanics .
The only problem was that no one had ever combined these two areas of physics before .
This did n't deter Hawking .
He set about developing a new way to force the physics of quantum mechanics to co-exist with Einstein 's relativity within the intense gravity of a black hole .
After months of work , Hawking came up with a remarkable result .
His equations were showing him that something was coming out of the black hole .
This was supposed to be impossible - the one thing that everyone thought they knew about black holes was that things went in but nothing , not even light itself , could escape .
The more Hawking checked , the more he was convinced he was right .
He could see radiation coming out of the black hole .
And it led him to the realisation that this radiation ( later called Hawking radiation ) would cause the black hole to evaporate and eventually disappear .
Shocking revelation
Although Hawking 's theories about black hole evaporation were revolutionary , they soon came to be widely accepted .
But Hawking felt that this work had far more fundamental consequences .
In 1976 he published a paper in Physical Review D called , " The breakdown of predictability in gravitational collapse " .
In this paper , Hawking argued that it was n't just the black hole that disappeared .
He said that all the information about everything that had ever been inside the black hole disappeared , too .
The understanding of black has accelerated in recent years
The reason physicists cling on to the idea that information can't be lost is that it 's their link with either the past or the future .
If information is lost then science can never know the past or predict the future .
There are limits to what science can know .
For many years , no one took much notice of Hawking 's ideas until a fateful meeting in San Francisco .
Hawking presented his ideas to some of the world 's leading physicists , and in the audience were two particle physicists , Gerard t'Hooft and Leonard Susskind .
They were shocked .
They both grasped that Hawking 's " breakdown of predictability " applied not only to black holes but to all processes in physics .
The long search
According to Susskind , if Hawking 's ideas were correct then it would infect all physics ; there would no longer be any direct link between cause and effect .
Physics would become impotent .
Since that meeting the " information paradox " has come to be seen as one of the most fundamental and most difficult problems in physics .
Arguments effectively boiled down into two camps .
On the one side , Susskind and those who believed that Hawking was wrong and that information could not be lost - and on the other , Hawking and those who believed that physics would have to be re-written to take into account the uncertainty about information that Hawking had uncovered .
For 20 years , arguments raged .
No side was willing to admit defeat ... until a paper emerged written by a brilliant young Argentinean mathematician known as Juan Maldacena .
This paper claimed to be a rigorous mathematical explanation of what happened to information in black holes - and it showed that information was not lost .
Hawking , it seemed , was on the losing side .
But Hawking was not convinced .
Hawking set to work with a young research student , Christophe Galfard , to try to pick apart the Maldacena paper .
They thought they could use the same mathematical techniques employed by Maldacena to prove that information was in fact lost .
But after two years ' work , they still could not prove their thesis .
Then disaster struck , Stephen Hawking was taken ill with pneumonia and rushed to hospital ; doctors feared for his life .
Hawking was kept in hospital for over three months .
But whilst others fussed over his health , Hawking was thinking .
Finally , on what many feared might be his death bed , he thought he'd come across what had eluded him for the past 30 years - a solution to the information paradox .
Bold claims
Once again , Hawking defied doctors ' dire predictions and was soon at work , working on a new proof for the information paradox .
Then in July last year , at one of the most prestigious conferences in physics , Hawking made a dramatic announcement .
Hawking presented his new position in a Dublin lecture
Hawking presented the outline of a proof that he hoped would at last solve the problem that he had posed almost 30 years earlier .
However , despite the bold claims , some physicists remain unconvinced .
Over a year has passed since the conference and Hawking has still not presented a fully worked mathematical proof to back up his ideas .
But Hawking is a stubborn man .
If he is going to change his mind on a belief he held for almost 30 years then it will be with his own proof , in his own time .
In spite of failing health and increasing problems communicating with his colleagues , Hawking is still working on the proof .
If he succeeds in completing a proof that convinces his colleagues , he will not only have solved one of the most difficult problems in physics but he will have produced ground - breaking work at the very end of his career .
That would be a feat that even his hero Einstein could not accomplish .
Horizon : The Hawking Paradox was broadcast on BBC Two at 2100 BST on Thursday , 15 September .
The concept of wireless power is not a new one , but it is just now beginning to break out into the consumer world with real products that are ( or almost are ) actually in production .
At last week 's CES in Las Vegas , two companies — eCoupled and Powercast — introduced their " wireless " power systems to the awe of many spectators , in hopes of making our experiences with the fabled Cord Gnome a thing of the past .
e Coupled 's wireless power solution is actually not so much " wireless " as it is " cord eliminating . "
The technology involves a single powered electrical pad — that does indeed need a cord — that can power other battery - powered devices that are placed on the pad , such as cell phones , digital music players , digital cameras , and even laptops .
The mousepad - sized technology makes use of short - range induction , like that used in most electrical toothbrushes : you do n't plug something in , you just place the toothbrush loosely into its holder and moving electrical fields ( induction ) take care of the rest .
The second wireless power technology demoed at CES is in fact " wireless " in most senses of the word .
Powercast actually won CES 's " Best of Show for Emerging Technology " award last week for its system for wirelessly operating low - power devices within a certain space ( such as a home office ) .
Use of the Powercast system involves a transmitter and a receiver chip embedded into the user 's devices .
The company emphasizes that the system is for smaller , less juice - sucking devices such as cell phones , PDAs , game controllers , and hearing aids , indicating that it might be something like a lower - powered , shorter - range version of MIT 's wireless power model announced last November .
The Powercast 's transmitter broadcasts a certain radio frequency over a short distance ( the company says about 3 feet , compared to MIT 's 3 to 5 meters ) and the receivers are programmed to sync up to that frequency and draw power from it .
The difference between the two will likely end up being cost , and the eCoupled seems like it will be the more wallet - friendly of the two .
Both of them , however , will need to convince third parties to start embedding the receivers into their products in order for either of the " wireless " power options to work — Powercast says that it expects " multiple manufacturers " to ship Powercast - enabled technology this year , and eCoupled says that the company is working with Fulton Innovation , Visteon , Motorola , Herman Miller , and Mobility Electronics to commercialize its own system .
Neither company has a product out yet , so many of our wireless power fantasies are still tethered to the ground .
An alternative to aspirin ?
Researchers carried out tests on 139 " chocoholics " who were disqualified from another study because they could not give up their habit .
Previous research has suggested that chocolate is good for the heart .
The study , by Johns Hopkins University , featured at an American Heart Association meeting in Chicago .
Eating a little bit of chocolate or having a drink of hot cocoa as part of a regular diet is probably good for personal health
Professor Diane Becker
The Johns Hopkins team started out examining the effects of aspirin on platelets , the tiny solid particles in blood that clump together to form a clot .
However , 139 people who signed up for the study were disqualified because they were unable to give up eating chocolate as required .
Researchers have known for almost two decades that dark chocolate can lower blood pressure and has other beneficial effects on blood flow .
But the " chocoholic " group gave the Johns Hopkins team an ideal chance to probe why this might be a little further by carrying out a biochemical analysis .
Clumping
They carried out tests comparing how long it took platelets taken from the " chocoholics " and others who had not eaten chocolate to clump together when they were run through a mechanical blood vessel system .
Platelets from those who stayed away from chocolate clotted faster , at 123 seconds , compared with 130 seconds for the chocolate group .
Researcher Professor Diane Becker said : " What these chocolate ' offenders ' taught us is that the chemical in cocoa beans has a biochemical effect similar to aspirin in reducing platelet clumping , which can be fatal if a clot forms and blocks a blood vessel , causing a heart attack .
There are more effective ways of looking after your heart than using chocolate as a medicine
Vicky Evans
British Heart Foundation
" Eating a little bit of chocolate or having a drink of hot cocoa as part of a regular diet is probably good for personal health , so long as people do n't eat too much of it , and too much of the kind with lots of butter and sugar . "
Professor Becker said two tablespoons of dark chocolate a day was enough to have a beneficial effect .
It is thought compounds called flavonoids , in which chocolate is rich , may be the key ingredient .
Vicky Evans , a cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation , said : " The chemicals in cocoa beans may have some benefits for our circulation but chocolate is more often part of the problem for heart health rather than a solution .
" This is particularly the case for milk chocolate which tends to be higher in fat and sugar .
" We are certainly not suggesting people totally avoid chocolate - everyone can enjoy a treat from time to time - but there are more effective ways of looking after your heart than using chocolate as a medicine .
" Eating five portions of fruit and vegetables a day is a far better way to get heart - protective flavonoids without having to worry about the fat and sugar packed into each chocolate bar . "

Can you see any use for these objects ?
Are they universal for some category diagram ?
I have partial answers to these questions but maybe you can make more sense of them than me .
Update : Ocaml version by Matias Giovannini .
A comment by a friend and a puzzle on Lambda the Ultimate made me realise that the functionthat I defined a few weeks back does have a nice application .
The problem it helps to solve is this : building circular datastructures in Haskell , otherwise known as Tying the Knot solves this problem in a very generic way that imposes the minimum of restrictions on the user .
Remember how in my previous article I showed how you could viewas a kind of spreadsheet evaluator .
You have a container of functions and that is converted into another container by applying these functions to the final container .
This is a circular definition , we 're applying the functions to the final result to get the final result .
If we think of the final container as a collection of answers to a bunch of problems , allows each element to be constructed using references to any of the other answers in the container , even if they have n't actually been found yet .
This is exactly what we need to make circular references .
Firstly , let 's look at doing something similar to the Tying the Knot web page to solve Derek 's puzzle .
Here potential links are made by using a dictionary structure to allow names of objects to stand for direct references to objects .
So define an operator to perform pointwise concatenation of string - valued functions :
Now define lookup into the dictionary , substituting a default value if needed :
And now we can translate some example equations into Haskell by hand .
I 'm consideringand .
Note how it 's trivial to write a parser to make these objects because there 's nothing circular going on :
We now just applyto get a dictionary containing the actual values :
We can use a similar method to make a doubly linked list .
Here is " A " , " B " and " C " in a list with each letter pointing to its predecessor and successor if it exists : is now a doubly linked list and we can useandto walk up and down it .
And here 's a nice advantage of using .
You do n't have to restrict yourself to storing information about links in a dictionary .
Any functorial container will do .
For example here 's a doubly linked circular list of the integers from 0 to 99 made without using any names :
Note how working your way up and downis a slow process because you need to use the slowto access elements .
But stepping up and down any element oftakes time O ( 1 ) .
Potentially very useful !
But there is a slight problem with .
I 'd like to be able to handle errors better and the obvious way to do that is by allowing the use of monads to handle exceptions , for example if a name lookup in a dictionary fails .
I attempted to do this as follows : But attempting to evaluateoverfows the stack .
It also failed when I tried modifying it to use .
So here 's a puzzle .
Can you write a monadic version of ?
It seems like something that would be very useful for writing interpreters for programming languages that allow mutually recursive definitions .
So my original intuition a few weeks back was right .
Taking an interesting axiom of modal logic , interpreting as a type , and them finding an implementation , did lead to something useful .
By the way , while I was thinking aboutI was led to consider what I call tautological containers .
These are containers where each element tells you how to extricate it from the container .
For example , these can be thought of as tautological :

・ 埼玉県 セフレ アプリセフレ 埼玉県 セフレ アプリで出会うのは限界がありますので、必ず相手会員になりましょう。輝編集数が全然多いことで、圧倒的に出会えることが埼玉県 セフレ アプリの長文として挙げられます 。
ページでも出会いの口コミでも、アクティブさをマッチング出来ているのは評価の対象になります。
中には使い分けしている人もいますが、男性とメールをたくさん運営をしたい女性にとっては埼玉県
セフレ アプリですよね。 特定のコン系女性や男女系アプリに、サクラがいるかあまりにかは運営会社にしかわからないのです。簡単語を送信して多いのは、イベントが丁寧語を止めるか、止めようと調整してきた時だけです。
毎回毎回、迷惑なギャップかちょっぴりかを見極めるのは多いですし、非常でもあります。
しかし、他の出会い系アプリに比べ使用管理がすぐしているので返信女性と出会えることは確かです。そして、埼玉県 セフレ アプリで活用できるコンテンツをネット活用したところ、徐々に外見や女性がもらえるようになりました。ここが多くても埼玉県 セフレ アプリのチャンスがなければ、業者と出会うことすら難しいですよね。一方実際に、検索した後はこういう中から実際に会う出会いをスクリーニングしていきます。連絡までにいくつか壁はありますが、見事入会できれば、東カレデートの埼玉県 セフレ アプリはお金持ち・美女・ハイスペックの楽園となっています。男性という言えば、カメラ出会いのほうが女性の掲示を解説できます。セフレを良く作るために、メインの友達以外でも近所との女性を築いておきましょう。
たまに普通に埼玉県 セフレ アプリっぽいのがありますが、これは省いてアプローチしてみましょう。
使い方系アプリは体優良で入会している男性は不安に多く、女性はチェックしています。
状態は、本当の会社よりもあまりに年収に機能しても問題はありません。業者系アプリ出会い使いで確実に女性に出会う木村ケイマッチングアプリの自分を紹介したものの、「人気だけしか利用しない」に対してのはオススメしません。
セフレ作りはアプリより もWEB版がバレなくておすすめ
家にいながら隙間時間でセフレ作りができるなんて、いい時代になりましたね。
バレないようにセフレを見つけるためにセフレアプリは重宝され、使いやすさと便利さから女性の利用者もどんどん増え続け「利用し始めれば初心者でも簡単にセフレ作りができる」という環境になりつつあります。
しかし、バレないようにセフレアプリを利用することは非常に難しく、どうしても怪しまれてしまいます。
もし隠れた出会いを本気で見つけたいのならば「 WEB版」を利用することが最適でしょう。
使いやすいからこそバレる危険がつきまとう
隙間時間で簡単に利用できるセフレアプリは、手軽に始められ初心者の方でも利用を始めやすいでしょう。
アプリに大勢いる女性とのやり取りは今までの日常とは全く違うものになり、のめり込んでしまう男性もいるほどです。
ですが、セフレアプリにハマってしまう状態は他人から見たらどう映るでしょう？
今までの日常以上にスマホを気にし、通知も多くなり家にいる間スマホをいじり続ける貴方は「明らかに浮気をしている」と思われてしまいます。
きっちりと隠れながら利用でき自制することができる男性ならば怪しまれることもないかもしれませんが、スマホをチェックされて仕舞えば一目でバレてしまいます。
つまり、隠れてこっそりセフレ探しをしたいという人ほど「スマホアプリは向いていない」のです。
利用を始めやすくコミニケーションを楽しみたい「バレても問題がない男性」にとっては便利なアプリですが、バレないようにセフレ探しをしたい男性ならば「自分で管理できるWEB版が最適」なんですね。
バレないようにセックスを楽しむ男女が集まるWEB版
アプリとWEB版には利用している男女の違いもあり、本当にセックスを楽しみたいのならばWEB版が最適ということもおすすめする理由です。
アプリを利用する女性の多くは「 SNSのように利用している」ことがほとんどです。承認欲求を満たすために活動している女性が多く、目的は「出会いではなくコミニケーション」であることが多いんですね。
その点、バレないようにセフレ探しをしている男女が集まるWEB版では「出会いを強く求めている女性」が多くいます。
出会いに繋がりやすくお互いにバレないようにセフレ探しをしているからこそ「適切な距離感を保ったセフレになりやすい」ことは、セフレ探しとして利用するための最大の利点かもしれませんね。
バレないように出会いやすい相手を探すのならば、WEB版の利用を一度考えてみてください。

・ 埼玉県 セフレ アプリ埼玉援 この足あと適用を使って検索することで、埼玉県 セフレ アプリの返信率はかなり上がります 。
会員数はメール３３０万人を確認し、毎日２０，０００組ものマッチングが確認しているマンモスマッチングアプリです。
みんなについて書いてしまうとかつ程度が膨大になってしまうので、他記事にまとめるか、また追記しようと考えています。
他のアプリよりは実際キャンペーンイメージが強く、話が埼玉県 セフレ アプリで進むこともあります。
男性にぴったり感を見せるために、なぜその相手にメッセージを送ったのかが伝わる埼玉県 セフレ アプリにしましょう 。
とても全員な出会いに注意しなければならないのかというと、ハッピーメールや理由ご飯に巻き込まれる可能性があるからです。セフレを作った３０％以上の人がいくら埼玉県 セフレ アプリやアプリで会ってそうね。
今度は飲みにいこうに関して話になってますが、正直、出会い業界が無いのでもっと出会いたいと期待してしまい男性に毎日女性しています。最近は男性がペアーズなどの目的マッチングアプリに移行しているので、事情的なアプリです。
配信的な排除もあるようですが、サクラでピークぶりに目的に顔を見せた口コミが泣きそうになりながら殺到するのを聞いて、時間の時期が来たんだなと人というは目的だと感じました。ただし、使ってみて業者の数は簡単利用よりいい印象でした。
有料系のような方法が出会う継続には、たくさんの会員が必要です。アプリ版で相手を結婚する際は、１４００円から購入可能です。
以上のように、課金のアドレスを出して、スピードを上げようとしてきますが、携帯のメールアドレスには全く繋がらず、フリー利用のアドレスと獲得が始まります。
ちなみにＰＣＭＡＸにはキャッシュバッカーと呼ばれるケースはほぼいません。女性はサイトやＣＡ、意味嬢またそれらと同等並みの容姿を持った方がゴロゴロいます。
ですから、ブライダル短期間の料金は初期費用０円、月額３，９８０円のみです。私の場合会員が重なったこともあり最初から何人かの方と縁を持てました。
しかし、料金はしっかり高めなので、アクション的にユーザーがある時におテレビで、登録することを登録します。それに、値段のマッチングアプリを調査している遊びは、有名優良の本当なども新しく、関係体制やセキュリティがしっかりしているので利用して利用することができます。
サイト・アプリ内でセフレにできそうなアプローチすべき女性の特徴
セフレを作るためには、サイト・アプリを使って探すことが近道でしょう。
セフレを求めている女性が集まる場所だからこそ人目を気にせず探すことができ、スマホで簡単に始められるおかげでどんどん女性の数が増え続けています。
セフレ目的で出会いを求めている女性がいるサイト・アプリでは、きっと貴方に合う女性が見つけられるはずです。
しかし、大勢いる女性の中から「セフレになりやすい女性」を探し出そうとすると難しいでしょう
。これには経験がどうしても必要で、成功している男性は「セフレになりやすい女性を狙っている」おかげなのです。
それさえ知っていれば初心者でもセフレを作ることは難しいことではありませんので、是非実践してみてください。
頻繁に活動している女性は狙い目
平日昼間などに暇な時間が多い「セフレ探しを活発に行なっている女性」が出会いやすいというのは、想像しやすいでしょう。
暇な時間と性欲を持て余している女性は意外と多く、そういった人妻や女子大生は「コミニケーションに飢えている」ためじっくりと丁寧に関係性を進められればセフレになることができるでしょう。
その判断基準として、 「プロフィールや日記に注目する」ことが重要です。
プロフィールの充実具合や日記の更新頻度、これは「セフレを求める本気度」といっても過言ではありません。
掲示板やメッセージでの返信頻度が高い女性も、コミニケーションに飢えている狙い目女性と言えるかもしれませんね。
承認欲求を満たすため、特殊な性癖を発散させたい、そういった思いを抱える女性が「セフレ探しをアプリでしている」ことも多く、そういった女性ほど「情報量が多く活発に活動している」のです。彼女たちの情報をしっかりと把握し、コミニケーションに繋げることが出会うためには重要ですよ。
出会いを目的としていない女性はセフレになりやすい女性
プロフィールや日記に注目すると、「出会いを求めていない」という女性がいることに気がつくでしょう。
メッセージでのやり取りで最初に言われることも多く、セフレを探している男性のほとんどはそこで諦めてしまうはずです。
ですが、そういった女性は多くの男性がアプローチを止めるからこそ狙い目だと言えます。
「 競争率」が非常に低く、そういった女性とのやり取りを続ければ「特別な男性」と信頼してもらうことも簡単なのです。
つまり、出会いを求めていないという女性は「体目的の男性との出会いを求めていない女性」なのです。
出会いの先にあるセックスのことを考えている「出会い目的ではない女性」ほど、性的な欲求が強い場合も多いです。
彼女たちが求める 「信頼できる特別な男性」になることができれば、他の女性を狙うよりも遥かに簡単に出会うことができるのです。

Almost 90 years after Einstein postulated his general theory ofrelativity -- our current theory of gravity -- scientists have finallyfinished collecting the data that will put this theory to anexperimental test .
For the past 17 months , NASA 's Gravity Probe - B( GP - B ) satellite has been orbiting the Earth using four ultra-precisegyroscopes , about a million times better than the finest navigationalgyroscopes , to generate the data required for this unprecedented test .
As planned , the helium that cooled the experiment and powered itsmicro - thrusters has run out , ending the data - collection and finalinstrument calibration phase of the experiment .
All the data — 50 weeks ' worth — has been downloaded from the spacecraft and relayed to computersin the GP - B Mission Operations Center at Stanford University , whereGP - B scientists have begun the final painstaking task of data analysisand validation .
Was Einstein correct ?
They wo n't know for another 15 months , when the analysis has been completed , but physicists around theworld are eagerly awaiting the results .
" This has been a tremendous mission for all of us , " said Stanford 'sFrancis Everitt , GP - B's principal investigator .
" Gravity Probe Bpresented many challenges along the way and the team rose magnificentlyto every occasion .
With all the data now gathered , we are nowproceeding very deliberately over the next 15 months to make sure thateverything is checked and re-checked in as many ways as possible .
NASAand Stanford can be proud of what has been achieved so far . "
This year , physicists celebrate the 100th anniversary of Einstein 's " miraculous year , " in which he received his doctorate in physics fromthe University of Zurich and published four seminal papers , includingthe special theory of relativity and a paper on light that garnered himthe Nobel Prize in 1921 .
But Einstein 's crowning achievement came in1916 , with his publication of the general theory of relativity , inwhich he expanded the special theory of relativity to include theelusive concept of gravity .
With general relativity , Einstein foreverchanged our Newtonian view of gravity as a force , postulating ratherthat space and time are inextricably woven into a four - dimensionalfabric called spacetime , and that gravity is simply the warping andtwisting of the fabric of spacetime by massive celestial bodies .
Eventhough it has become one of the cornerstones of modern physics , generalrelativity has remained the least tested of Einstein 's theories .
Thereason is , as Caltech physicist Kip Thorne once put it : " In the realmof black holes and the universe , the language of general relativity isspoken , and it is spoken loudly .
But in our tiny solar system , theeffects of general relativity are but whispers . "
And so , anymeasurements of the relativistic effects of gravity around Earth mustbe carried out with utmost precision .
Over the past 90 years , varioustests of the theory suggest that Einstein was on the right track .
But , in most previous tests , the relativity signals had to be extracted froma significant level of background noise .
The purpose of GP - B is to testEinstein 's theory by carrying out the experiment in a pristine orbitinglaboratory , thereby reducing background noise to insignificant levelsand enabling the probe to examine general relativity in new ways .
Deceptively simple
Launched on April 20 , 2004 , from Vandenberg Air Force Base on the California coast , GP - B has been using four spherical gyroscopes tomeasure precisely two extraordinary effects predicted by Einstein 'stheory .
One is the geodetic effect — the amount by which the Earth warpsthe local spacetime in which it resides .
The other effect , calledframe - dragging , is the amount by which the rotating Earth drags localspacetime around with it .
How does GP - B measure these effects ?
Conceptually , the experiment issimple : Place a gyroscope and a telescope in a satellite orbiting the Earth .
( GP - B uses four gyroscopes for redundancy . )
At the start of theexperiment , align both the telescope and the spin axis of the gyroscopewith a distant reference point — a guide star .
Keep the telescope alignedwith the guide star for a year as the spacecraft orbits the Earth morethan 5,000 times .
According to Einstein 's theory , over the course of ayear , the geodetic warping of Earth 's local spacetime should cause thespin axis of the gyroscope to drift away from its initial guide staralignment by a minuscule angle of 6.6 arcseconds ( 0.0018 degrees ) .
Likewise , the twisting of Earth 's local spacetime should cause the spinaxis to drift in a perpendicular direction by an even smaller angle of0.041 arcseconds ( 0.000011 degrees ) , about the width of a human hairviewed from 10 miles away .

As the late Stanford physicist and GP - B co-founder William Fairbankonce put it : " No mission could be simpler than Gravity Probe B .
It 'sjust a star , a telescope and a spinning sphere . "
However , it took theexceptional collaboration of Stanford , NASA , Lockheed Martin and a hostof other physicists , engineers and space scientists almost 44 years todevelop the ultra- precise gyroscopes and the other cutting - edgetechnology necessary to carry out this deceptively " simple " experiment .
The ping - pong - ball - sized gyroscope rotors , for example , had to be soperfectly spherical and homogeneous that it took more than 10 years anda whole new set of manufacturing techniques to produce them .
They 'renow listed in the Guinness Database of Records as the world 's roundestobjects .
Similarly , it took two years to make the flawless roof prismsin the GP - B science telescope that tracks the guide star .
Somescientists have mused about how Einstein , himself once a patent clerk , would have enjoyed reviewing these extraordinary technologies .
Stanford 's Bradford Parkinson , GP - B's co-principal investigator andwinner of the 2003 Draper Prize in Engineering , said : " Optimism wasrampant [ in 1960 , when GP - B began ] .
We did n't have any idea how hardthis was , and I would contend it was probably not until 30 years laterthat we brought [ into existence ] the technology to make perfectspheres , the coating technology , the readout technology , the cryogenictechnology , the [ telescope ] pointing technology .
Â… None of this waspossible in 1960 . "
Running on empty
At launch , the Dewar , a giant Thermos bottle that comprises most ofthe body of the spacecraft , contained approximately 650 gallons ofhelium , cooled to a superfluid state just above absolute zero .
Thehelium in the Dewar served two vital functions : First , it was thesuperfluid bath that kept the four gyroscopes at a superconductivetemperature , required for the readout of their spin axes .
Second , helium gas that constantly evaporated from the bath was reused as thepropellant for the spacecraft 's micro-thrusters to maintain both itsproper orientation and roll rate in orbit and to keep it pointed at theguide star .
When designing the Dewar , the team carefully calculatedthat 650 gallons of helium would be adequate to sustain the GP - Bmission for at least 16 months , and that a Dewar large enough to holdthat amount would just barely fit in the nose of the Boeing Delta IIrocket that would launch the experiment .
When the helium in the Dewarwas depleted on Sept. 29 , it had outlived the team 's initialcalculations by more than three weeks .
Mac Keiser , GP - B chief scientist who heads the data analysis team atStanford , said : " Getting 50 weeks of data from the satellite has beenparticularly important — not only because it will allow us to reduce ourstatistical errors but also because the Earth has made almost acomplete revolution around the sun .
This complete cycle will allow usto take full advantage of one of our calibrating signals and eliminatepotential sources of systematic error . "

Next - to - last milestone
The completion of data collection marks the last milestone prior toannouncing and publishing the results of this historic 44 - year program .
It is a time of both triumph and emotion for the GP - B team .
Some teammembers have been working together on the program for more than 15 years .
As the focus of the mission shifts from spacecraft operations todata analysis , it is time for many of the team 's engineers and missionoperations specialists to move on , and this naturally brings a note ofsadness into the otherwise joyful spirit of accomplishment .
" It 's a bit like sending your kid off to college , " said GP - B ProgramManager Gaylord Green .
" Our operations team became a familyaccomplishing this mission , and after a good job the members will bedeparting to the next phase of their lives . "
Added Tony Lyons , NASA 's GP - B program manager from Marshall SpaceFlight Center in Huntsville , Ala . : " The completion of the GP - B missionis the culmination of years of hard work , training and preparation bythe GP - B team .
Every team member should feel proud of thisaccomplishment . "
It will take the GP - B science team more than a year to complete thedata analysis , followed by up to six months of preparing and submittingpapers to major scientific journals detailing the experimental results .
Following NASA protocols used for other missions with precisequantitative measurements , there will be no preliminary announcementsof results nor any speculation about the data before a formalannouncement and publication of results , expected early in 2007 .
Analysis
Two weeks ago , business leaders at Davos gave their blessing to Linden Lab's Second Life .
They hailed the spectacular growth of its virtual economy while politicians spoke of democracy itself moving into its online world .
But little of this coverage questioned its true popularity , or how sustainable its " virtual economy " might be .
Second Life went live in 2003 , burning through $ 8 m of venture capital investment over the next three years .
And it remained invisible until recently - with a few mentions on enthusiast weblogs .
But in March 2006 , Linden Lab used some of an $ 11 m additional investment from VC firms , and from Amazon 's Jeff Bezos , eBay 's Pierre Omidyar , and the Open Source Foundation 's Mitch Kapor , to hire a professional agency , Flashpoint PR .
It was now business journalists who began to spread the word .
The Wharton School , Business 2.0 , the Harvard Business Review - all wrote approvingly of Second Life 's virtual economy .
Newsnight 's business correspondent , Paul Mason , entered it and interviewed an " in world " entrepeneur .
The Guardian 's former business editor Victor Keegan declared it , " the beginning of a whole new world . "
But , the most enthusiastic business reporter following Second Life has been Business Week 's Robert D Hof .
He has reported that it could challenge Windows as a way to create business software .
The coverage was less than complete , however .
For example , there was scant mention of Linden Lab 's scaling issues .
Second Life 's servers - which are hosted exclusively by Linden Lab - can only support between 50 and 100 avatars in one place at one time .
Newsnight 's party crashed after only 30 " guests " arrived .
Melbourne 's The Age reported Ben Folds launching an album before an " in world " audience of 25 .
Virtual maths
Second Life needs large numbers of both producers and consumers if it is to represent the " new , new economy " .
However , its own estimation of user numbers is questionable .
Last October , Linden Lab claimed it had a million residents .
By December , it was reporting two million .
Second Life 's front page now proclaims 3.1 million residents .
A " resident " of Second Life , as defined by Linden Lab , is a login of its software .
Remove the clients belonging to the same email address or payment details and the number of residents falls by over half a million .
Remove the number of clients resolving to the same IP address , and it falls still further .
Only 15 per cent of those who became residents in October of last year ever logged in again after their first 30 days - a churn rate that might surprise and dismay executives from other industries .
Remove all those who never returned to Second Life after their first month and the figure falls from a then two million residents to around a quarter of a million .
Typically , there are only around 15,000 clients logged in to Second Life at any one time .
In other words , this economy has a population about the size of Ilkeston , Derbyshire , or Troutdale , Oregon .
And each business has the prospect of a market of no more than 100 people in one place - a number easily accommodated by a church hall .
The Coming Entitlement Meltdown
by Ron Paul by Ron Paul
DIGG THIS
David Walker , Comptroller General at the Government Accountability Office , appeared on the show  60 Minutes last evening to discuss the federal budget outlook .
If you saw the show , you know that he painted a very sobering picture regarding the federal government ’s ability to meet its future obligations .
If you did n’t see the show , Mr. Walker ’s theme was simple : government entitlement spending is like a runaway freight train headed straight at American taxpayers .
He singled out the Medicare prescription drug bill , passed by Congress at the end of 2003 , as probably the most fiscally irresponsible piece of legislation since the 1960s . 
When it comes to Social Security and Medicare , the federal government simply wo n’t be able to keep its promises in the future .
That is the reality every American should get used to , despite the grand promises of Washington reformers .
Our entitlement system ca n’t be reformed — it ’s too late .
And the Medicare prescription drug bill is the final nail in the coffin .
The financial impact of the drug bill cannot be overstated .
Government projections that the program would cost $ 400 billion over the next decade were a joke , as everyone in Congress knew even as they voted for the bill .
The real cost will be at least $ 1 trillion in the first decade alone , and much more in following decades as the American population grows older .
The Medicare trust fund is already badly in the red , and the only solution will be a dramatic increase in payroll taxes for younger workers .
The National Taxpayers Union reports that Medicare will consume nearly 40 % of the nation ’s GDP after several decades because of the new drug benefit .
That ’s not 40 % of federal revenues , or 40 % of federal spending , but rather 40 % of the nation ’s entire private sector output !
The politicians who get reelected by passing such incredibly shortsighted legislation will never have to answer to future generations saddled with huge federal deficits .
Those generations are the real victims , as they cannot object to the debts being incurred today in their names .
The official national debt figure , now approaching $ 9 trillion , reflects only what the federal government owes in current debts on money already borrowed .
It does not reflect what the federal government has promised to pay millions of Americans in entitlement benefits down the road .
Those future obligations put our real debt figure at roughly fifty trillion dollars — a staggering sum that is about as large as the total household net worth of the entire United States .
Your share of this fifty trillion amounts to about $ 175,000 .
Do n’t believe for a second that we can grow our way out of the problem through a prosperous economy that yields higher future tax revenues .
If present trends continue , by 2040 the entire federal budget will be consumed by Social Security and Medicare alone .
The only options for balancing the budget would be cutting total federal spending by about 60 % , or doubling federal taxes .
To close the long - term entitlement gap , the U.S. economy would have to grow by double digits every year for the next 75 years .
The answer to these critical financial realities is simple , but not easy :
We must rethink the very role of government in our society .
Anything less , any tinkering or reform ,  wo n’t cut it .
A good start would be for Congress to repeal the Medicare prescription drug bill .
Dr. Ron Paul is a Republican member of Congress from Texas .
The Best of Ron Paul

Texas to raise speed limits to conform to driver habits
Texas is considering raising the speed limit on two major interstate highways to match how most motorists drive .
The state 's director of traffic operations , Carlos Lopez , said research found that 85th percentile speed of traffic was 79 mph .
Thus , speed limits are likely to raise from 75 mph to 80 mph .
The Texas Department of Public Safety said raising the limit to conform to the speed the majority of drivers travel will make roads safer .
" If people begin to think that the number on the sign is unreasonable , then they wo n't respect it , " Lopez said .
" Just putting up a lower number on the highway is n't going to slow down traffic . "
As previously reported , data released from Britain 's Department of Transport suggested that as speed limits , speeding decreases -- adding credibility to assertions that there is a natural " safe speed " at which most drivers will travel .
On roads with a 30 mph limit , half of passenger cars exceeded the speed limit .
On similar roads with a 40 mph limit , just 25 percent of cars exceeded posted limit .
This seems to suggest that drivers know a safe speed , and high speed limits would not lead to equally high speeding .
In Britain , with highway limits of 70 mph , between 50 and 60 percent of drivers exceed the speed limit .
Etopia News – Strong opposition to proceeding with a hearing on Washington State Senate Joint Memorial 8016 ( SJM 8016 ) , which calls on the U.S. Congress to begin an investigation leading to a possible impeachment of George W. Bush and Richard B. Cheney for various alleged anti-Constitutional actions , scheduled for this coming Thursday , March 1 , 2007 , at 3:30 pm PST in the Washington State Capitol Building in Olympia , and a personal lobbying effort to de-rail this meeting , are coming from two prominent Washington State national electeds , U.S. Senator Patty Murray and U.S. Representative Jay Inslee .

In one of the regular inner yards of multi-stored buildings in St. Petersburg there is a whole collection of Middle - American Mayan statues standing under open air and not protected by anybody , left all by themselves .
The story of them appearing there starts in 19th century when Academy of St. Petersburg sent a group of explorers to Middle America .
They visited through all of Yucatan , collected different things for St. Petersburg ’s museums .
By the way they noticed and bought a set of Mayan idols from Chichen Itza ruins .
Upon the return of expedition smaller objects were placed into museums but nobody has found a good place for those Mayan statues and they were left all by themselves in the back yard , dug into ground .
A few years passed and Soviet Revolution happened , all the museums were messed up , all the buildings were nationalized by Soviets and were used for a totally different purpose then before .
In many churches warehouses were founded as the result of total atheism of new Russian authorities , and many museum were turned into something else as a result of ignorance .
So hundred years passed and those 1500 year old Mayan deities stand , abandoned and not worshiped by anyone except accidental Russian teens searching for a place to have a beer outside in some public backyard .

As a general rule of thumb , practicing Jews do not write the name God because of the laws delivered by Moses that are found in Deuteronomy 12:3 - 12:4 .
In this passage , the Jews are instructed to destroy anything and everything associated with their rival ’s gods , and they are not to let this happen to their own God.
Writing " G - d " instead of " God " is one way to prevent others from destroying the name of God .
Many practicing Jews write " G - d " instead of God to prevent others from desecrating the name of God .
Jews interpret the law given by Moses as a prohibition against transcribing the name of God because they feel that if the name is recorded onto a piece of paper , there is the possibility that it will be disrespected or destroyed in some way .
The general concern with writing the name in its true form is that it might be erased , defaced by being crossed out or scribbled upon , torn , thrown in the trash , or ravaged in some other way .
Writing " G - d " instead communicates the writer ’s idea effectively , but since the word is incomplete , there is no risk of defacement .
The Jews have other names for their creator , including Hashem , YHVH , Elohim , and El Shaddai , and these are also not written in their complete form .
Jews believe that it is acceptable to spell out God in places where it will not be disrespected , such as in the Torah .
There are , however , exceptions to the prohibition of writing " God . "
The Jews believe that , on occasion , it is acceptable to write " God " when there is no likelihood that the written word will be defaced .
This includes the written form in the Torah , which is the Hebrew Bible , also found in the first five books of the Christian Bible .
Writing the name is not prohibited when it is done carefully , with foresight and respect .
Due to the advent of technology that was not around when this law was written , the Jewish community , under careful deliberation , has decided that it is acceptable to write the name of God on a computer , as long as it is not printed to a permanent form .
Rabbis have decided that deleting the name on a computer , though not encouraged , is not in violation of the commandment .
I just picked up Carcassonne , based on recomendations read on boardgamegeek.com , and I am looking for some other interesting 2 - player games which I can play with my S.O.
I 've also been playing a lot of Tantrix and Scrabble lately , but that is the extent of what I know about current games .
Any recomendations ?
Good 2 - player board / card games ?
Ahh , to be young and in IT .
In my younger days I was full of big dreams of being like the tech guys in action movies .
You know , opening a socket to download a protocol so I can run a core dump on the secret agent 's wristwatch .
As a " trainee programmer , " Robert B. was enduring the typical crushing of his dreams that most of us went through early in our careers .
He was responsible for technical tasks such as making tea and coffee , picking up sandwiches , ordering printer cables , and sending software update disks to customers .
Robert was working at a successful company in the UK that built software for managing vehicle fleets .
Customers ranged from leasing companies with thousands of vehicles to tracking lawnmowers at Clem 's Lawnmower Rentporium .
One day Robert was asked to send out a disk to a client company 's maintenance division .
Brian , the company 's transport manager , was running a Commodore PET with a 5.25 " floppy drive .
Robert copied the files on a disk , put a label on it , and put it in a mailer .
With the disk , Robert included a note asking Brian to call him when the package arrived .
The next day , Brian called .
Brian : OK , I got the disk , what do I do now ?
Robert :
Take the disk out of the mailer and place it in the drive .
Brian : OK .
( several minutes pass )
Brian : OK , which side goes up in the drive ?
Robert ( resisting the temptation to scream ) :
You see the label that I put on it ?
That one goes up , then close the door on the drive .
Brian : ...
Robert : Is something wrong ?
Brian :
It 's just ... there are no labels on this disk .
Robert :
Are you sure ?
I 'm almost positive that I put one on .
Brian : Yeah , positive .
Robert :
Well , could you describe the disk to me ?
Brian : Sure .
It 's round , shiny , and brown with a big hole in the middle .
No labels .
Have you found the WTF yet ?
When Robert explained to Brian that he'd ripped off the disk 's casing , rendering the disk useless , Brian replied " I thought you 'd wrapped it well . "
The leaders of this agricultural commune – once young communists with visions of an agrarian Jewish state – say they are now prepared to take a once - unthinkable step : embracing the free market .
Kibbutz Gaash , a collective that has already replaced chicken coops with a strip mall , may be on the verge of rejecting its collectivist roots and privatizing .
If it does , as an upcoming vote is expected to decide , it will provide further evidence that the era of the iconic kibbutz is over .
Mostly secular and leftist , kibbutzim were hailed as the building block of the Zionist enterprise , the crucible in which to remold the old - world Jew as the new Israeli .
But modern pressures mean communes must cope with bank debt , attrition , and the waning collectivist spirit .
What this U - turn means for the shrinking number of kibbutzniks is that they 'll be living like most other Israelis : collecting a paycheck , competing on the open market , and balancing their own budget .
Stacked on the desk of Kibbutz Gaash Chairman Hanan Rogalin is the soon - to - be- voted - on plan to scrap the commune 's egalitarian dream and allow members to live according to their own earning power .
" The contemporary kibbutz does n't provide answers for life needs , and most important in my eyes , people 's aspirations , " says Mr. Rogalin .
" The kibbutz creates too much friction .
The secretariat dictates too many things to members .
And people want more freedom to take responsibility for their lives . "
The process of privatization among kibbutzim has been quietly proceeding for years , though two weeks ago , Israelis took notice when Kibbutz Degania , the first kibbutz established on the Sea of Galilee in 1909 , took the step .
With two - thirds of the 273 kibbutzim across Israel already privatized , the demise of Degania was a ringing reminder of the seemingly inevitable extinction of the kibbutz as Israelis know it .
" Does the kibbutz have a chance ? " asked an opinion article that mourned Degania on the movement 's website .
" As long as man feels in his soul the need to be in a society built on the bedrock of justice , of equality , of camaraderie , of mutual commitment and solidarity – there 's a chance . "
Frontiers of the new state
The communal agricultural estates laid down the fresh roots of Jewish settlement in the biblical land of Israel , assuring a degree of economic independence for the fledgling state .
The communities were given the task of settling what would become the frontiers of the new state .
" The kibbutz was an attempt to create a miracle and transcend human nature .
By trying to create a miracle , the kibbutz was instinctively seen by Jews as a worthy symbol of the miraculous return to Zion , " says Yossi Klein Halevi , a senior fellow at Jerusalem 's Shalem Institute .
" We 're so past the point of being shocked by the decline of the collectivist dream that this is n't a moment that took anyone by surprise .
Nevertheless there 's poignancy ....
We 've lost something precious and essential in what defines Israeliness , " he says .
Kibbutz members once dominated parliament and key spots in Israel 's lionized military .
Though secular and leftist , the movement , with its pioneering activism , inspired religious Jews who settled in the West Bank and Gaza Strip after 1967 .
With large tracts of public land to cultivate , the kibbutz followed directives from the Israeli Agricultural Ministry on what to grow .
" We did n't think if we were earning or losing money , we thought about what was good for the country , " says Yossi Katz , founder of Kibbutz Gaash .
" We were sure the entire country would become socialist . "
Walking past the old boarded - up dining hall and the seedy building that housed Gaash 's first chicken coop , he acknowledges that the kibbutz lifestyle could be oppressive and suffocating .
The kibbutz compelled members to turn over possessions for public use .
Children were raised in communal dorms rather than in parents ' homes .
Social life revolved around the dining hall .
A kibbutz committee approved plans for higher education and careers .
Whoever left was considered a traitor .
With the ascension of the right - wing Likud party to power in the 1980s , the government cut off generous subsidies that exposed waste and unprofitable kibbutz operations , as well as billions of dollars in debt .
A $ 17 billion bailout made the kibbutzim seem spoiled rather than selfless .
Meanwhile , observing Israel 's growing prosperity , kibbutzniks lost sight of the ideals behind their Spartan existence and began seeking the same creature comforts .
The collapse of the Soviet Union and communism also had an impact .
In the past 20 years , the kibbutzim have lost one - fourth of their population and members today number 120,000 , a small fraction of Israel 's 7 million people .
" I know that if I work hard , that I 'll earn the same as the person living next to me who works less , " explains Sharon Tirosh , director of human resources at Gaash , who also supports the change .
" There is something in the education , that begins at the bottom , that there 's no point in being terribly successful . "
Postprivatization kibbutzim cut down on waste , and experience a jump in member 's earning power of almost 40 percent , says Rogalin , Kibbutz Gaash 's secretary .
Members keep their pay , and pay fees for services .
They also contribute to a social safety - net fund .
In addition to ideological stress , it has worried people afraid of providing for themselves for the first time .
" If someone gets used to something for years , and suddenly it 's taken away , they lose focus , " says Rogalin , who is n't willing to bet whether the proposal will get the 75 - percent support necessary to pass .
Kibbutz ethic , high - tech times
At stake is the survival of economic enterprises – agriculture is now only a small part of kibbutz businesses that range from wineries to commercial real estate – employing some 30,000 workers , with combined output of $ 7.4 billion , in a $ 114.3 billion economy .
What remains of the kibbutz ethic of self - sacrifice , activism , and egalitarianism is unclear .
In Israel 's high - tech economy , do the old kibbutzim have a role to play ?
Rogalin says that their role will be to cultivate a quality education system that will teach children values of social justice .
And with a safety net for members , the kibbutz hopes to remain a model of social welfare in a society with a large gap between rich and poor .
Whatever the decision , founder Mr. Katz knows that the ideals upon which Gaash was founded are no longer attainable .
" At my age , I 've reached the conclusion that humans are egotists , and like to keep things for themselves rather than the general public , " he says .
" The idea that everyone will eat from the same plate does n't exist anymore .
I 've done my part .
It 's over .
We are n't an example for anyone . "
pdf2email is a CUPS backend that uses GhostScript to print a document to PDF and sends the final file to the user that requested the print via email .
This software is written in Python .
I had written this backend a few months ago , it has worked fine for me , so I decided to release it .
Your feedback is welcome .
Requirements
The following software is required so that this backend functions correctly :
Python ( http://www.python.org)
CUPS server ( http://www.cups.org/)
Ghostscript ( http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/) a postscript printer ’s PPD file .
( see Installation section ) Email server , on which usernames from the LAN workstations either match the users on the email server or proper mappings ( aliases ) have been set .
Installation
Put the “ pdf2email ” file in /usr / lib / cups / backend / and set the executable bit :
chmod +x /usr/lib/cups/backend/pdf2email
Configuration
Open the script in a text editor and set a couple of settings :
1 . Set the email server ’s hostname :
SMTP_Server = " mail.example.org "
2 . Set the email address of the sender as it will appear in the email :
print_admin = " admin@example.org "
3. ( Optional )
Set the path to a text file that contains PDFmarks .
If you do n’t know what PDFmarks are , you should leave this variable empty .
( see some more info in the PDFmarks section ) :
pdfmarks_file = " "
Configure a CUPS Printer
This section describes in brief all the required actions in order to add a printer that uses this backend to CUPS .
Decide the printer ’s name , eg “ TestPDFprinter ” .
Decide the directory , where the PDF files are saved temporarily .
This directory must be writable by the users .
Usually , /tmp is perfect for this .
Note , that no PDF files are left in this directory .
This piece of information is used in the Device URI of your CUPS printer .
For example , provided that the /tmp directory will be used , the Device URI would be : pdf2email:/ tmp
is perfect for this .
Note , that no PDF files are left in this directory .
This piece of information is used in the of your CUPS printer .
For example , provided that the directory will be used , the Device URI would be :
Get a postscript printer ’s PPD file .
You can find such files at : Your printer manufacturer ‘s web site .
Linux Printing Adobe ’s download center
WARNING : It is your exclusive responsibility to examine the printer driver ’s license prior to using the PPD file .
NO PPD FILES ARE SHIPPED WITH THE pdf2 email BACKEND .
Finally , add a new printer that uses this backend , either by using lpadmin from the command line or by using the web - based administration interface of CUPS or by using any other CUPS Server management software .
Using lpadmin from the shell
As root issue the following command :
lpadmin -p TestPDFprinter - E -v pdf2email:/tmp - P / path/to/myprinter.ppd
Using CUPS web - based interface or other software
Use the provided “ Add Printer ” facility .
Some notes that might be useful :
In the device dropdown box , select the following :
Direct PDF
Printing / Delivery to user email
In the device URI box use the writable directory , eg :
pdf2email:/tmp
If asked about the type of the print queue , use “ RAW “ .
USAGE
Make this printer available to the LAN through the IPP , SAMBA or any other protocol and add it to your printer list in your client machines .
Whatever you send to that printer will be converted to a PDF document and will be emailed to your user ’s email address .
Trouble ?
If any error occurs during the PDF creation process , there will be a failure notice in your inbox and a message in syslog ( / var/log/ messages ) .
In case you receive no email after requesting a print , check syslog for any error messages .
If there are n’t any , the check CUPS error log .
Finally , note that if you use a security layer like SELinux , then you might need to further adjust it so it lets 3rd party CUPS backends to function .
This is beyond the scope of this document .
PDFmarks
If you do not know what pdfmarks are , please do a web search about them .
This backend can include PDFmarks in the final PDF document .
Do not expect anything spectacular , as this script cannot process the document for bookmarks , links etc .
What it can do is to add pre-defined pdfmarks to all PDF documents .
For example , if , for example , you want to fill some of the document properties , save the following in a file :
[ / Title ( ) / Author ( ) / Subject ( blah blah ) / Keywords ( keyword1 , keyword2 , blah ) / DOCINFO pdfmark
By default the author ’s property is filled with the username that requested the print .
Finally , add the path to the pdfmarks file in the configuration section of the backend , as described in the configuration section :
pdfmarks_file = " / path/to/pdfmarks.file "
This feature has not been tested thoroughly .

Just what are these operations about ?
You may remember MI5 chief Eliza Manningham - Buller suggested last November that the intelligence services had discovered 30 " plots to kill people and to damage our economy " , often with " links back to al - Qaida in Pakistan and through those links al - Qaida gives guidance and training to its largely British foot soldiers here on an extensive and growing scale " .
The authority for such a statement , I assume , comes from MI5 agents .
The quality of such reports , though , must be treated with profound scepticism , dependent as they are on the doubtful calibre and knowledge of these agents and the tendency of such people to live in a semi- fantasy world of endless conspiracy .
The fact remains that , notwithstanding the huge security operations and the large numbers arrested , relatively few people have actually been charged .
The test of justice is , fortunately , more demanding than the criteria used to justify headlines and political hyperbole .
Of course , we must take terrorist threats seriously - but also the price we pay for these alarums .
They magnify our sense of trepidation and persuade people the worst is about to happen : it is under the cloak of such fear that governments on both sides of the Atlantic have been able to impose swingeing restrictions on civil liberties .
The fact remains , however , that deaths in the UK from Islamist terrorism have been far fewer than those perpetrated by the IRA .
Meanwhile , the price for these constant security operations is paid , above all , by our Muslim communities .
Every such operation tars them with the brush of terrorism , an intimation to rest of society that extremism lurks within their ranks .
The scapegoating of the Muslim community has become the stock in trade of politicians , the Conservatives recently accusing the Muslim Council of Britain of separatist tendencies , and New Labour all too frequently indulging in the same kind of refrain - notably during the most disgraceful period of its domestic rule last autumn , when cabinet ministers were falling over themselves to make disparaging remarks about the Muslim community .
The argument typically starts from the global terrorist threat and ends up by suggesting the Muslim community nurtures and sustains such a terrorist mentality by its failure to integrate .
Jack Straw squirmed about the veil , Ruth Kelly inveighed against imams , Alan Johnson proposed that faith schools admit up to 25 % not of the same faith ( patently directed against the Muslim community ) , and John Reid warned a Muslim audience of " fanatics looking to groom and brainwash [ your ] children ... for suicide bombing " .
Amid this panic - inducing rhetoric , there was little acknowledgment that Muslims suffer more discrimination than any other section of society , no recognition that every attack on their community can only intensify that prejudice .
Imagine what it feels like to be a Muslim , stalked by a constant sense of distrust and suspicion ?
As a society we may condemn racism , but when it comes to Muslims , it seems to be somehow acceptable , from the cabinet downwards .
And what is to blame for this failure to integrate ?
Prejudice , perhaps ?
Discrimination ?
Racism ?
No , according to David Cameron , Ruth Kelly and many others , the cause would appear to be multiculturalism .
Pause for a moment and spot the slippage in the argument .
It is no longer only about Muslims but all our ethnic minorities .
For enshrined in the principle of multiculturalism is the idea that the white community does not insist on the assimilation of ethnic minorities but recognises the importance of pluralism .
It is not about separatism but a respect for difference - from colour and dress to customs and religion .
The attack on multiculturalism is the thin end of the racism wedge .
It seeks to narrow the acceptable boundaries of difference at a time when Britain is becoming ever more diverse and heterogeneous .
None of this is to deny the importance of finding ways of integrating the Muslim community .
It is hardly surprising , though , that many young Muslims feel alienated .
They face worse discrimination in education and employment than any other ethnic minority , Anglo - American policy in the Middle East has had the effect of demonising the Muslim world , and the Muslim community here finds itself the victim of a barrage of hostile propaganda .
A major assault on discrimination involving the government , the media and the Muslim community is long overdue .
But while British foreign policy so profoundly discriminates against the Muslim world , and New Labour remains in denial about the connection between domestic Muslim attitudes and its foreign policy , there seems little prospect of making a new start .
Antipathy towards Muslims , meanwhile , threatens to roll back hard - fought anti-racist gains , which , over the decades , have won a degree of respect for ethnic minorities and an acceptance of the principle of difference .
These gains have always been fragile .
Important ground is now being ceded as Islamophobia becomes the acceptable face of racism and the attack on multiculturalism finds important new recruits .

OTTAWA – Economists from one of Canada 's big banks have thrown their support behind taxing industries and consumers who contribute to global warming , saying that government needs to attach a cost to pollution if any fundamental progress is to be made .
In a report released today by the TD Bank , economists argued that industry and consumers will not change their behaviour as long as it's cheap to pollute .
They advocate a policy that combines emissions regulations , taxes , subsidies and a trading system for emissions credits – a varied approach they say would mitigate the impact on the economy .
TD 's chief economist Don Drummond said he 's found it " bizarre " that the government and the business community have n't engaged in a more thorough public debate over such a major economic issue .
" When you think about most major initiatives we 've had in Canada , whether the fate of the deficit or the free trade agreements where there was n't consensus , there were fairly fulsome debates and different perspectives were put out . . . but I do n't see that happening , " Drummond said in an interview .
Any mention of a carbon tax – or taxation in general – is a taboo word among many politicians .
Liberal Leader Stephane Dion raised the possibility last week , and then quickly backtracked a day later .
But Drummond says taxing those who actually pollute creates an incentive to change behaviour .
He suggests that the tax should be applied when the pollution is created .
Thus , the consumer would pay for car pollution , and industry would pay for pollution associated with the production process .
The revenues would be shifted into cutting taxes in other areas or to finance subsidies that further help the environment .
" You 'd recycle every single cent , " said Drummond .
" You can recycle it in an indirect fashion through cutting other taxes such as income taxes or you can recycle it directly within the energy area . "
An emissions trading system would be another key component of a ``polluter pay " system , something the TD says has " proven benefits . "
In such a market , companies that reach their emissions targets can sell credits to other companies who can't seem to lower their greenhouse gas output .
While Drummond acknowledges that joining an international system might not appeal to Canadians at the moment , Canada should get involved in a domestic emissions trading scheme soon with an eye to connecting to the bigger markets later .
" You might be more successful at getting the buy - in if we started domestically . "
The crux of the problem – or " market failure " in economist - speak – is that clean air is considered a free commodity .
Simply legislating emissions cuts , Drummond says , only masks this problem and does n't create long - term conditions for industries and consumers to cut down on their emissions .
Taxing consumers for their auto emissions , for example , would cause them to seek more fuel efficient cars , and in turn force industry to do more research and sell cleaner vehicles .

Security checked every piece of luggage from the flight
A woman passenger on the United Airlines flight is said to have been involved in a confrontation with crew .
But reports that she was carrying items including a screwdriver , Vaseline , matches and a note referring to al - Qaeda have been denied .
Passengers and crew have all now disembarked from the plane safely .
Police took control of the plane after it landed , and security officials checked every item of luggage from the plane with sniffer dogs .
' Claustrophobic '
United Flight 923 from Heathrow Airport , with 182 passengers on board , was originally bound for Washington Dulles .
" There was an altercation with at least one female passenger , " a United Airlines spokeswoman said .
Nenette Day , a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Boston , said the 60 - year - old woman was apparently claustrophobic and had become disruptive on the flight .
" This is n't just an ' I want another drink kind of thing , ' it was a disruption that caused them to divert the plane , " she said .
" There are no known links to terrorism regarding this event at this time , " Christopher White , a Transportation Security Administration spokesman said .

Roll Call : Congress Members ' furious ' at FBI for ' blackout ' of 2001 anthrax attacks probe RAW STORY
Published : Thursday October 12 , 2006 Print This Email This Some Congressional members are " furious " at the FBI for its " blackout " of the investigation into the 2001 anthrax attacks which " left five people dead and dozens of others injured or facing lengthy courses of dangerous drug therapy , " according to Roll Call .
" The FBI has completely shut Congress out of its now five - year investigation into anthrax attacks on Capitol Hill and around the nation , with accusations flying up and down Pennsylvania Avenue about the probe into the worst biochemical attacks in U.S. history , " Paul Kane writes .
Roll Call reports that the " FBI and Justice Department have not briefed two key players in the attacks  former Sen.
Tom Daschle ( D - S.D. ) and Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) , the Senators who were targeted by anthrax - laden letters  in at least two and a half years . "
Excerpts from Roll Call article : # Late last month , in a letter to Holt , the bureau officially stated that it has been withholding all information about the attacks from Congress because of alleged leaks to the media following briefings on the Hill .
The FBI laid the blame for the blackout squarely at the feet of current and former Members and their staffs from briefings that apparently occurred in 2003 .
 After sensitive information about the investigation citing Congressional sources was reported in the media , the Department of Justice and the FBI agreed that no additional briefings to Congress would be provided ,  wrote Eleni Kalisch , assistant FBI director for Congressional affairs , to Holt in what appears to have been the first official recognition of leak allegations .
This briefing shutdown has left some Members furious with the FBI , leading them to publicly and privately conclude that the investigation clearly has stalled .
 I would like to think that they know a lot more than they did five years ago , but I have no basis to make that judgement ,  said Daschle , the Majority Leader at the time of the attacks , in a recent interview .
 From what little they have shared with us , I can only assume that things havent gone well in the investigation these past five years . 

Here are two places to start : Jim Brandt , who organized YAPC ::NA 2004 in Buffalo , is looking for volunteers to help with a Perl - based conference system .
See his TPF blog post for details .
I 'm looking for someone to write up a PR piece that we can publish about Coverity 's source code analysis of the Perl 5 source .
There 's already been an article about it from Coverity 's point of view , but I 'd like to have something where we can talk about how we , as the Perl community , are working with Coverity .
It 'd be a bit of research , and some PR - ish / newsy writing .
I 'd really like to encourage other companies to work with TPF .
Email at andy at petdance .com if you 're interested .
Thanks for your interest !

Feedster on : YAPC : I problemi di unicode Nel mondo moderno sembra che finalmente ci stiamo adattando ad usare utf - 8 come quasi- standard , sebbene questo si porti dietro un corredo di teorie basate sul sentito dire riguardo agli encoding ed ai character set , spesso con dimostrazione per giustapposizione .
Ad esempio utf - 8 è compatibile con ASCII e quindi è a grandezza fissa e quindi non comprende tutti i caratteri UCS - 4 , piuttosto che java usa utf - 16 perché è una codifica di dimensioni fisse che comprende tutti i caratteri anche gli ideogrammi .
Ora , questo post è solo per ricordare che , come al solito , abbiamo una visione terribilmente occidentale su Unicode .
Siccome il discorso su codifica / charset / collation / glifi / codepoint / caratteri è mooooolto al di là delle mie capacità di comprensione , posso provare a dare una versione elementare dei fatti per come li ho capiti : ci sono dei charset , insiemi di caratteri .
Alcuni sono piccoli , come ASCII , altri hanno 4 miliardi di caratteri , come Unicode poi ci sono delle codifiche dei vari charset , utf-8/32/16BE/16LE
sono tutte codifiche dello stesso charset ovviamente ottimizzate per scopi differenti Unicode è il prodotto delle Multinazionali Malvage , e quindi all ’inizio faceva schifo , poi quando si sono resi conto che un giapponese / cinese / vietnamita / koreano usando Unicode non avrebbe avuto accesso ad alcune cose lo hanno cambiato come tutte le toppe messe ex post , la soluzione attuale è a dir tanto subottimale , ma funziona per essere felici in occidente basta supportare unicode , per essere felici in oriente pure , ma per essere corretti in oriente ci sono un fottio di altri charset e codifiche da supportare in giappone fanno dei port dei software per fargli supportare i loro encoding , ad esempio esistono vari emacs giapponesi .
Una delle ragioni per cui esiste ruby è che perl non gestiva la codifica che serviva a matz Ora , perché questo discorso ?
Beh , perché secondo me è interessante , e poi mi permette di introdurre il link ad un post su ruby - talk dove viene annunciata la disponibilità in inglese di nuovi capitoli della Ruby Hacking Guide e c’è la traduzione di una presentazione fatta da matz a YAPC :: Asia .
Il collegamento è nel fatto che parrot / perl6 sarà , come python attuale , fondamentalmente basato su Unicode , mentre Rite / Ruby2.0 sarà basato su un concetto di totale indipendenza dalla codifica .
È evidente che è una soluzione per un problema al quale l’occidentale medio ( ma neanche il cinese medio ) neanche pensa , non per malvagità ma solo perché è fuori dal suo mondo .
Per concludere , un paio di link utili a capire il discorso su unicode :
Unicode Revisited , Han Unification , Unicode in Japan , TRON MultiLanguage Environment ( sapevate che TRON è il sistema operativo più usato al mondo ? )
E per concludere una citazione , sul fatto che alcune codifiche siano un po ’ troppo stateful : the Khmer area contains a pair of non-printing characters whose role was to switch between religious and non-religious mode

On a warm cloudless night during the last week of the program , she persuaded him to sneak away to a garden on a hill , where they sat talking for hours and sharing intimate secrets .
But they did n’t kiss .
“ I ’m not sure I would have known how — I was a very young 16 , ” said Mr. Abella , a lawyer who was until last September a counsel to a municipal investigative commission in Toronto , and whose mother , Justice Rosalie Silberman Abella , sits on the Supreme Court of Canada .
The next day in class they were embarrassed by the encounter , as teenagers can be , and pretended they had n’t talked .
“ He would look up and see me , and I would look down , ” she said .
Two days later they were at Heathrow Airport for their return home .
It was all coming down to their final goodbye .
But while he was in a washroom preparing something to say , she boarded her plane .
He had no contact information for her , and a big problem : he was infatuated .
So was she .
On the anniversary of their meeting , she tracked down his number in Toronto and left a message .
About to return to Oxford , he looked forward to calling her back during a long layover in Newark .
But he could n’t find her number .
“ I wandered around Newark airport for five hours looking for a Manhattan phone book , ” he said .
To paraphrase a classic line from Lily Tomlin , I worry that the person who thought up the rules for carrying liquids and gels on airplanes last year is busy thinking up something new this year .
The thought arises partly because of a scene just after Christmas at an airport security checkpoint , where a half - dozen festive snow globes — like the ones with Frosty the Snowman in a liquid - filled glass globe that simulates snowfall when you shake it — were lined up on a counter .
Was n’t that nice !
The Transportation Security Administration had decorated the checkpoint !
But as it turned out , Frosty and his co-conspirators had actually been busted — confiscated from passengers ’ carry - on bags pursuant to the following notification by the security administration :
“ Snow globes , regardless of size of amount of liquid inside , even with documentation , are prohibited in your carry - on . ”
Now , I am not sure what exactly constitutes a documented snow globe .
But I do know that the snow globe rule has intensified ridicule of airport security , and that can not be a good thing .

Technology intended to untie the American worker is actually taking a tremendous toll , according to new research from IT analysis firm Basex .
The report indicates that technology tools , including e-mail and instant messaging , are the main culprits when it comes to unnecessary interruptions that cost U.S. companies nearly US $ 600 billion per year .
The research claims the distractive impact of spam , the Web and telephone calls results in 28 billion lost man-hours per year in the United States at a cost of $ 588 billion .
" Technology promised to make workers more efficient , but it has the potential to cost companies billions unnecessarily , " read a statement from Basex , which just released its report , " The Cost of Not Paying Attention : How Interruptions Impact Knowledge Worker Productivity . "
A People Problem
But the underlying cause of such costly distraction , Basex CEO and chief analyst Jonathan Spira told TechNewsWorld , is not actually the technology .
" It 's not only technology , it 's how knowledge workers behave , " Spira said .
" Companies have to recognize we 're now dealing with a different type of work force , with significant changes .
Quite honestly , there has been a very poor job done educating the business world about managing knowledge workers . "
As an example , Spira reported that , in his firm 's survey of more than 1,000 executives and knowledge workers , more than 60 percent indicated they checked an incoming e-mail immediately or nearly immediately .
" That , I think , is in keeping with curiosity killed the cat , " he added .
" We 're our own worst enemy . "
Pursuing Productivity
Basex warned that 28 percent of every knowledge worker 's day could be wasted because of unnecessary interruptions that include instant messaging , spam e-mail , telephone calls and the Web in general .
Spira said the key to cutting into such losses is corporate management of the technologies and effective application of the various communication means .
" The most important thing to understand is that the misuse of technology that has the potential to make us more efficient can be very costly , but we can do something to fix it , and we can end up more efficient in the end , " he said .
Suggestions from Basex included : " Training knowledge workers to prioritize work at hand , " and " Providing them with the discretion to turn off technology or separate themselves from technology to do work . "
Maurene Caplan Grey , principal analyst of Grey Consulting , also told TechNewsWorld that the issues of time wasted on technology , particularly interruptions , are largely human behavior .
" It seems intuitively correct , but most people do n't have an idea of what technology to use , and when to use it , " she said .
Calling the problem " a cultural issue within an organization , " Grey said there is a burgeoning number of professional services focused on increasing productivity and efficiency by curbing the wasted time .
RSS and Other Relief
Grey stressed that all of the communication , regardless of which technology is being used , depends on the sender , and his or her awareness of the recipients ' technology and tastes .
However , the analyst added , some technologies -- such as really simple syndication ( RSS ) services that allow recipients to determine when and how they view sites or updates -- can turn the tables on the equation , and promote more efficiency in the process .
" With RSS , we 're talking about a different type of mentality , where the recipient is in charge , " she said .
" There , the recipient is subscribing to what he or she wants and looks at when he or she wishes . "
Pointing to successful efforts by the likes of Intel to improve worker efficiency with technology and cultural change programs , Grey said it is important to understand that companies are only interested in productivity gains that translate to profit .
" The only number that matters is that which brings revenue , " she said .
" What brings revenue into an organization is a higher level of efficiency across work groups . "

A CD spectrometer
>
A simple spectrometer can be built from a CD and a box .
Cut a slit on one side of the box .
Place the CD on the other side with about 60 degree angle .
Look down into the openning on the box .
The slit should not be too wide , otherwise the spectrum lines will be blurred .
It should not be too narrow either , otherwise the spectrum is too dim .
I use a 0.2 mm wide slit .
structure of the CD spectroscope
my cereal box spectroscope ( arrow : the slit )
viewing the spectrum
Let 's look at the spectra of some common light sources .
All photos by the authors with a Nikon coolpix 995 camera .
( 1a ) afternoon sun , altitude 24 degrees
( 1b ) setting sun , altitude 0.5 degree
( 1c ) high Sun spectrum
( 1d ) low Sun spectrum
(1) Solar spectrum is continuous with dark lines , i.e. the famous Fraunhofer lines .
Several Fraunhofer lines can be seen with this simple spectroscope ( 1c , 1d ) : C line in dark red ( H - alpha , 656nm ) , orange D( Na , 589nm ) , green E ( Fe, 527nm ) and b1, b2 ( Mg,518nm ) , blue F ( H - beta , 486nm ) , purple G( Fe and Ca , 431nm ) .
Interestingly the solar spectrum changes with the Sun 's altitude !
As the Sun is lower its light passes more Earth atmosphere .
Comparing ( 1c ) and ( 1d ) we found a new dark line ' a ' in red ( molecular oxygen in Earth 's atmosphere ) .
Who can tell me what the dark band under D is ?
( 2a ) incandescent light
( 2 b )
(2) Incandescent light is typical black body radiation , with continuous spectrum .
No black lines .
Same with tungsten halogen lamp .
( 3a ) fluorescent light
( 3 b )
(3) Fluorescent light has mercury gas emitting ( mostly ) ultraviolet light , which activates phosphor .
The latter emits broad band visible light .
Therefore we see bright mercury spectrum lines , most obviously green 546nm , on a continuous backgroud .
( 4a ) high pressure sodium light
( 4 b )
( 4c )
( 4d )
( 4e )
( 4f )
(4) The spectrum of high pressure sodium lights changes too !
When the lamp is just on , there are several bright spectrum lines including yellow sodium at 589nm ( 4c ) .
In a few seconds as the light gets brighter , the yellow line becomes wider , and a thin dark gap emerges at the center ( 4d , 4e ) .
After the lamp stablizes , cooler sodium vapor absorbs light at 589nm , and we see a thick gap ( 4f , 4 b ) .
Note the camera settings for ( 4 c - - f ) are the same .
( 5a ) computer display
( 5 b )
(5) Spectrum of white screen on a computer display .
( 6a ) laptop display
( 6 b )
(6) Laptop display is different from a CRT display .
( 7a ) red LED
( 7 b )
(7) Red LED emits continuous spectrum in red .
( 8a ) neon bulb
( 8 b )
(8) Neon bulb has many red and orange discrete bright spectrum lines .
( 9a ) night light
( 9 b )
(9) The night light uses phosphors and emits a continuous spectrum .
( 10a ) compact fluorescent light
( 10 b )
( 10 ) Compact fluorescent light is similar to a normal fluorescent light but with tri-color phosphors .
Instead of a continuous backgroup , it emits bright lines of various colors .
( 11a ) green and purple neon light
( 11b ) green tube spectrum
( 11c ) purple tube spectrum
( 11 ) The green and purple neon tubes actually contain argon and mercury , with different phosphors produce different color .
The mercury line is visible .
( 12a ) the moon
( 12 b ) use a telescope
( 12c ) lunar spectrum
( 12 ) I took this photo before the total lunar eclipse of 2004 .
Moonlight from a full moon was collected with an 8 " Dob telescope .
The spectroscope was held behind the eyepiece .
As moonlight is nothing but reflected sunlight , the spectrum looks the same as a solar spectrum ( 1 ) .
It is continuous with dark absort lines , i.e. the Fraunhofer lines ( some of them are marked ) .
( 13a ) candle
( 13b ) table salt
( 13c ) candle spectrum
( 13d ) table salt spectrum
( 13 ) Candle light has a continuous spectrum .
In the first few seconds after a candle ( or a match ) is lit , there is also the yellow sodium line which disappears thereafter .
If table salt is burnt , the yellow sodium line becomes prominent .
The sodium line should be double lines , but this simple device cannot resolve them .
( 14a ) metal halide lamp
( 14 b )
( 14 ) Metal halide lamp has a complex spectrum .
( 15a ) blue neon sign
( 15 b )
( 15 c ) red neon sign
( 15d )
( 15 ) The blue neon sign could be a mixture of argon and mercury ( or phosphors ) .
The red neon sign truly contains NEON , which is the same as in the neon bulb ( 8 ) .

The girl may have caught the virus from her brother rather than birds
The UK government has ordered 14.6 m doses of Tamiflu , but the Nature report suggests this may not be effective enough if an outbreak does happen .
At present , H5N1 flu strain poses only a limited threat to humans as it cannot spread easily between people .
But experts fear it soon might , and other drugs may be needed to combat it .
However British authorities said the study did not obviate the need to stockpile Tamiflu .
Emerging resistance
It may be that using Tamiflu ( oseltamivir ) for too little time or at too low a dose could contribute to the emergence of resistant virus , Yoshihiro Kawaoka from the University of Tokyo and colleagues say .
" Further investigation is necessary to determine the prevalence of oseltamivir - resistant H5N1 viruses among patients treated with this drug , " they warn .
The Department of Health said Tamiflu was the internationally agreed product of choice .
" Our antiviral strategy is kept under constant review , " added a spokesman .
The 14 - year - old Vietnamese girl they describe had been given the drug in February as a preventative measure .
It might be useful to stockpile zanamivir as well as oseltamivir in the event of an H5N1 influenza pandemic
The study authors
Although she had not had any known direct contact with infected poultry , she had been caring for her 21 - year - old brother who was thought to have caught bird flu .
The virus detected in the girl resembled that found in her brother .
The girl recovered without any problems , but her case raises the possibility that she could have been infected by her brother , rather than directly by birds .
Also , oseltamivir on its own may not be sufficient to fight a potential H5N1 pandemic and other drugs from the same family such as Relenza ( zanamivir ) may be needed too , say the researchers .
" Although our findings are based on a virus from only a single patient , they raise the possibility that it might be useful to stockpile zanamivir as well as oseltamivir in the event of an H5N1 influenza pandemic , " they said .
Reassurance
Professor Ian Jones , microbiologist at the University of Reading , said : " It 's worthwhile noting but it is not unexpected . "
He said past studies had shown viruses could become resistant to Tamiflu .
He said such resistant strains appeared to be less able to cause harm than the original virus , which was reassuring .
It does not mean that resistant viruses will emerge and transmit effectively
A spokeswoman from the Health Protection Agency
" They do n't grow as well so whilst the mutation does arise there is no reason to suppose that [ the mutant ] virus is going to be a very successful infectious agent . "
He added that antiviral drugs did not cure someone of the virus , but merely keep down the levels of infection to allow the body to mount its own response .
" I do n't think it obviates the need for stockpiling Tamiflu , but I do agree that it might be useful to have Relenza as well . "
A spokeswoman from the Health Protection Agency said : " This is an interesting and important scientific paper and we are aware that resistance is an issue and we have global surveillance .
" But it does not mean that resistant viruses will emerge and transmit effectively . "
Joel Spolsky came up with a twelve - item checklist in August , 2000 that provides a rough measure of – in his words – " how good a software team is " :
Do you use source control ?
Can you make a build in one step ?
Do you make daily builds ?
Do you have a bug database ?
Do you fix bugs before writing new code ?
Do you have an up - to - date schedule ?
Do you have a spec ?
Steve McConnell enumerated Software 's Ten Essentials in 1997 , ten things that every software project should have :
A product specification A detailed user interface prototype A realistic schedule Explicit priorities Active risk management A quality assurance plan Detailed activity lists Software configuration management Software architecture An integration plan
These are great lists .
But Spolsky 's list is 6 years old ; McConnell 's is almost 10 years old !
Does your software project meet all these criteria ?
The lists are still highly relevant and definitely worth revisiting today .
But I wonder if the field of software development has advanced far enough that we can take any of the items on this list for granted .
I also wonder if any new practices have emerged in the last 6 years that are n't accounted for on either list .
So here 's my question to you : what core set of practices constitutes modern software development in 2006 ?

The folks at etre were kind enough to do some eye tracking analysis of Squidoo .
You can see the entire tape , unedited ( but at slightly lower youtube resolution ) here :
This is fascinating stuff .
The blue dot shows you where the user is focusing her eyesite … it does n’t measure peripheral vision , which is crucial .
It reminds me of watching some bugs approaching food–or perhaps it ’s a trap …
The path is very jumpy , impatient , experimenting hither and yon .
You can see that some of the participants are slower , more linear readers , while others are jumping like mad , taking it all in .
I think websurfing is a hunting activity .
The eye is looking for anamolies , for things that do n’t belong .
( That might be why the word anomaly , spelled wrong in the previous sentence , got your focus ) .
Once our peripheral vision confirms that something is familiar , we can ignore it and just worry about the new stuff .
Squidoo is stuffed with new stuff ( nearly all our visitors are first - time visitors ) and so , for example , there ’s almost no focus on our Google AdWords .
That ’s because they ’re familiar .
One of the takeaways is that bad web design might actually be a good thing !
Slightly bad design is n’t familiar .
It ’s off .
It demands attention .
( Very bad design demands the ‘ back ’ button , of course ) .
One of the reasons that experienced power tool users–like table saws–can still lose a finger is that they do n’t pay attention … it ’s too easy to turn the thing on and just use it .
The biggest lesson was n’t news to me , but it might be to your boss : your prospects are not rational and organized and linear .
You ca n’t count on them sitting still and hearing your story from beginning to end .
They wo n’t .
The answer is not to try to change human nature .
It ’s to embrace the hunting skills that people are bringing online ( and to their daily offline media consumption ) and to make your media match their needs .
Mr. Khosla is to be commended for presenting his ideas to what I expect will be a relatively hostile audience .
So let 's be respectful , and if you have criticisms , please make them constructive criticisms .
Mr. Khosla has heard my specific objections on several occasions , so I wo n't reiterate them here .
But I have assured him that readers of The Oil Drum are a sharp group of people with diverse backgrounds , and this will be a good place not only to present his vision to people concerned about energy policy , but also to get some good technical criticisms of his proposals .
Mr. Khosla will be reading responses , so be sure to present your criticisms , praise , suggestions , or ideas with this in mind .
Many of us wish to influence the direction of energy policy in this country .
This discourse with Mr. Khosla is a golden opportunity .
One thing I strongly believe in is the issue of fairness .
I enjoy a good scientific debate , and I find that the best debates are those in which opposing sides are honestly presented .
With this in mind , below I present Vinod Khosla 's vision of our energy future .
If you are like me , you will find aspects of agreement , and aspects of disagreement , and perhaps even strong disagreement .
But it would benefit all parties to have a good debate on the technical merits of the issues .
Without further ado , I present the following guest post written by Vinod Khosla :
Imagining the Future of Gasoline : Reality or Blue-sky Dreaming ?
I recently received the following email : " I find it distressing and bothersome to see ...... how often people assume that we need to find a single silver bullet for our looming oil and / or natural gas challenges , as opposed to relying on a collection of smaller solutions -- what I 've been calling the " silver BB 's " approach ....
I 'm convinced that we do indeed face a set of harrowing challenges on the energy and environmental fronts , and that they will require all the ingenuity , flexibility , and collective effort ( from public policy to large commercial companies to the emergent properties of mainstream consumers embracing conservation ) we can muster . "
I agree .
If you are one of the people who think modern civilization is on the verge of collapse , stop reading .
If you think all rich people are bad or everyone has evil or self - interest as their only goal , stop reading .
People do care and while there are many people , and especially large corporations , who only care about their self - interest , there are people and corporations ( large and small ) who care about what happens on this planet .
Also stop reading if you believe in massive conspiracies , want to revolutionize the world with rebellion , change the consumption pattern ( 4 % of world population consuming 25 % of its resources - I hate it too but do n't count on it changing ) overnight , dramatically change behavior like getting Americans to drive less ( lots of idealized solutions I can think of but it wo n't happen except through legislation like higher CAFE ; or higher gasoline prices , and most such legislation is politically infeasible ) .
I support increased CAFE ; , free markets ( I am not a fan of ethanol subsidies or import tariffs in today 's environment and have proposed politically feasible compromises to reduce both : " A Near Term Energy Solution " at www.khoslaventures.com/resources.html) as long as we ensure a level playing field which we do n't have in the gasoline market today .
I do n't believe all oil executives are bad and I do n't bash them just to get votes for our ballot initiative in California , but because the oil interests are misleading voters in California and in general often slowing the adoption of alternatives to gasoline , using the massive financial power they have to hire hordes of consultants to spread mis-information ( like the royalty fee is a tax that will be passed on to consumers when the California Attorney General says it cannot be passed along and market forces will ensure that this pass - thru wont happen - www.yeson87.com).
Vote YESON87 if you are a California voter .
I am working with certain oil companies that are looking beyond the California ballot initiative to find and evaluate new businesses .
The single biggest thing we can do to help climate change is a carbon tax ( worldwide ) or a " cap & trade " system , but I do n't think it is politically feasible in the US today .
Its time will hopefully come soon , probably in the next decade .
I would also like to see much broader energy efficiency legislation but I suspect that is harder and will happen in pockets and spread slowly ( I am optimistic about the latest CAFE proposals ) .
I would love for us to bias towards public transportation ( even with subsidies ) but I suspect that will not happen easily and is not an effective use of my time .
The personal automobile is here to stay .
Finally I believe that the problem of stationary power ( electricity ) and mobile power ( mostly transportation ) are different and can be addressed separately .
So let 's not confuse the two problems .
I even separate the heavy ( diesel ) transportation from cars and light trucks ( gasoline ) .
I believe we need liquid fuels for transportation and have to live with coal for electricity for a while , even though I would love to see a greater emphasis on nuclear , wind and solar .
Without a material breakthrough in storage technologies , wind and solar combined will be no greater than 20 % of our electric power needs because of base load issues .
First , what am I invested in ?
One corn ethanol venture , one corn plus cellulosic ethanol venture , three cellulosic ( only ) ethanol ventures ( all very different approaches ) , three non-ethanol liquid fuel ventures ( next generation fuels to replace ethanol we hope ) , two gasification ventures ( one for coal to natural gas and one for biomass ) , one solar , one high efficiency lighting ( LED - very high risk project ) , one new high efficiency engine venture , one sugarcane venture , one low impact very low cost housing venture ( $ 5000 homes ) , a few microfinance institutions and a few others .
Battery technologies are among my highest priorities .
Many of these are very high risk science projects and will fail but many will succeed too .
So I do n't have a particular perspective or bias other than the fact that alternatives to dirty coal and oil have an important role to play in our planets evolution .
We have to find solutions and only the ones that are economically driven will achieve substantial scale .
To balance the large ongoing investments in oil , the only solutions that can compete effectively are ones that leverage Wall Street .
I like solutions that the average American can be coaxed into adopting , not the ones the 5 % who care most will adopt .
The 5 % fringe play a valuable role in buying early , demonstrating feasibility , establishing markets , but in the end impact happens when the average American adopts something .
New businesses happen when Wall Street gets excited about a new market or technology .
What have I done in my personal life ?
A solution I believe many if not most Americans would adopt more easily than buying a Prius - every car I buy gets a sticker to be a 100 % carbon neutral from www.terrapass.com and the rest of my life is carbon neutral by buying carbon credits on the Chicago climate exchange or from www.carbonfund.org.
But I am not spending my time convincing most Americans to bicycle to work or drop their personal automobile .
Why ?
On the public debate , why have I chosen to speak mostly about ethanol ?
I do support solar , wind , biodiesel , and many other alternative technologies .
First , I am only focusing ( for now ) on gasoline , not all petroleum .
Yes , later diesel , plastics etc will also have to be addressed but I handle " material but manageable " problems one at a time .
That is my nature .
It does not say that others should not address other problems or that I do n't care about other problems .
I spend my time where I am most effective per hour spent .
That means that some even more critical problems are left to others .
For example , if I had an equally effective solution for stationary power generation ( yes I am invested in that too - solid oxide fuel cells for greater efficiency ) I would spend more time there .
I do recognize it as an even bigger problem than gasoline replacement , especially as it pertains to green house gases .
But since I see an easy path I can believe in , ethanol ( really biohols which include all liquid fuels from the same feedstocks and same ICE engines - some of these are my other liquid fuel investments ) , I choose to spend my time there .
I do not focus on peak oil as much but that does not mean I do n't recognize it as a potential problem .
I do think we will probably ( nothing is certain ) run out of air to put the oil emissions into before we run out of oil .
I am personally not excited about coal to liquids technology because of its greenhouse gas implications which I consider a bigger issue than the peak oil issue .
But given I see no easy solutions to the stationary power from coal problem ( especially in India and China , I am very interested in clean coal technologies for stationary power .
But the reason to support ethanol in public policy debates for me is the feeling that I can really make a visible difference and it will lead to more than a marginal change .
But the real answer is my belief that it has the lowest risk strategy to impact peak oil , green house emissions , energy security and independence , while having huge collateral benefits like sustaining farm incomes , rural employment , and reducing worldwide poverty .
Ethanol has the best TRAJECTORY !
There are other options like coal to liquids and natural gas which are also reasonable options if one is not looking for a trajectory that leads to a 100 % renewable source .
Others , especially the oil companies are working on some of these .
It is all about the trajectory !
The factors that matter are TRAJECTORY , TRAJECTORY , & TRAJECTORY .
There 's a huge difference between people who focus on " what is " , and people who focus on " what can be " .
Ten years ago nobody in the established telecommunication world believed in the internet because the " what was " was not as good as an alternative technology called ATM .
Every telecom carrier said , " no way would we ever switch our core network " .
The state of the internet protocol was so much worse than the alternative ATM for telecom carrier purposes .
But " what can be " ended up so much better and so much cheaper because of the trajectory it was on , such that any company not adapting it will over time go out of business .
The difference between what is and what can be has to be reached in an evolutionary not a revolutionary fashion .
IP & the web browser had a useful purpose , got deployed , was used and hence attracted both implementation and R&D investments .
Next generation stuff was built on top ( like better routers , IP management and network software , JAVA , Flash , Dynamic HTML pages , AJAX , and the semantic web ) and is still being pursued because the technology had an incrementally improving path .
Both the incremental steps and the long term vision have to be attractive for a technology to cause a revolution .
If the two trajectories are in conflict , the incremental path generally wins .
It is the road more frequently traveled .
Cell phones have followed the same path , starting from heavy scratchy voice quality devices to being dominant today .
How many of you thought twenty years ago that they would mostly surpass land lines ?
Trajectory often determines where societal choices end up , especially when we cannot or do not legislate the outcome .
What can be with hydrogen is also great , but there is no way to incrementally get there from what is to what can be .
The most likely path for hydrogen is co-producing it from ethanol , running it in today 's internal combustion engines , getting hydrogen distribution , and then replacing internal combustion engines with higher efficiency fuel cells or improving the internal combustion engines .
A more likely path is ethanol in today 's internal combustion engines , followed by better hybrid technology to make hybrids more broadly acceptable , to increasing the amount of battery storage on cars to make them more " plug - in " capable and over time to reduce the size of the ethanol driven internal combustion engine , thereby reducing the amount of liquid fuel we need for our automobiles .
The more we use batteries the cheaper and better they will get , the more investment and R&D interest they will attract , and the faster the cost performance curve will improve .
Batteries will get cheaper and we will use more capacity in our cars , enabling longer range , making such cars cheaper and better and driving towards lower percentage use of liquid fuels .
If you tell me we should replace today 's cars with sixty mile range cars ( since that is what most consumers use ) , I wish you good luck getting in getting it done .
And the energy ratio of electricity is far worse than that of corn ethanol .
If we get more wind and solar we should be replacing coal plants with that additional capacity , assuming it is cost competitive .
In parallel we will see better liquid fuels , fuels I call biohols .
Butanol has already been proposed by BP and DuPont , and other liquid fuels have been discussed among researchers .
They are superior to ethanol in many ways but will use the same or similar feedstocks and run interchangeably with gasoline or ethanol in today 's engines .
Some will require minor engine modifications and others will not .
But if we tried to legislate butanol today it probably would not happen .
The bigger the ethanol market , and we must move it from a blend of only fifteen billion gallons a year US market to a primary fuel 200 billion gallons a year market , the more investment and R&D it will attract to reduce cost , improve engine performance to find additives and alternatives like butanol , to make it even better .
With ethanol and biohols in general it is very possible to get there incrementally without disturbing a lot of current investment , vested interests ( like automakers ) , and natural market forces .
The oil industry spends hundreds of billions in investments in oil every year and to find a replacement it must attract the same kind of capital .
The only source of such capital is Wall Street .
If we want to make change happen , make it worthwhile for the entrenched interests without making it easy enough for them to rest on their laurels .
Make it attractive for Wall Street .
In the end I do believe the oil companies will be big players in the biofuels game .
Why not biodiesel ?
First , its trajectory does not lead to cellulosic ethanol and other biohols .
Most importantly , though I like biodiesel , there is a fundamental difference .
Even though biodiesel has a better energy balance than corn ethanol , I do n't believe it will scale beyond hundreds of gallons per acre of land .
Ethanol , butanol and any liquid fuel that has a shot at replacing our gasoline needs has to scale up to 2,000 - 3,000 gallons per acre .
Add some form of increased CAFE ; ( the current 4 % a year increase proposed by Senators Biden & Obama seems good and even politically possible , even a 2 % per year compromise would be great ) , better engines ( we hope our startup in the area is successful and gets to fuel cell efficiency in an ICE engine but if not there are at least a dozen other ICE engine efficiency startups ) , 3,000 gallons per acre results in some part of our export crop lands and CRP lands being sufficient to replace all our gasoline needs ( my current best guess for 2030 - see Appendix A in " Is Ethanol Controversial ? " at www.khoslaventures.com/resources.html).
This involves improved yields of energy crops , cellulosic ethanol optimization but does not assume alternative biohols ( something that is very likely - butanol could reduce gallons of fuel needed by 25 % ) , improved engines ( easy to get even ethanol mileage per gallon close to that of gasoline , not 33 % lower as is assumed by many who base it strictly on energy content ) , higher CAFÉ standards ( likely by 2030 - even a 2 % per year increase in CAFE cuts our gasoline needs in half ) and other positive surprises .
If all these happen our likely needs will be a third of what we assume today , and we will get there incrementally and in a politically acceptable fashion .
But we do n't need these " extra " improvements to replace most of our gasoline consumption with ethanol .
And then there are better ethanol and biohols production strategies .
I have seen plans ( not one I funded ) to get 22,000 gallons per acre using current carbon dioxide sources ( like power plant exhausts ) , proposals for ocean based dense algae farms ( something that seems like a good idea ) that convert algae to biodiesel and ethanol .
We need to set a path that leads to revolutionary vision but has short term steps to renovate , innovate , and make money for our scientists , engineers , entrepreneurs and established companies that choose this new path .
The steps will be incremental .
The bigger the market , the more the attention , the greater the funding for both implementation and R&D , the greater the competition and hence a faster and faster pace of innovation and revolution .
This is the trajectory I believe is possible here in the short term .
So am I over promising on cellulosic ethanol ?
I do n't think so but if I am I do n't see another viable alternative .
What makes me believe in cellulosic ethanol ?
If the goal is ethanol production costs of $ 2 per gallon ( roughly equal to gasoline at today 's prices ) , we are there already .
We have a number of different ways to do it except that no investor is willing to bet on these price points being viable .
So the real question is do we expect cellulosic ethanol production costs to drop sufficiently to be competitive with corn ethanol ?
The expected dozen or so ( I have heard 60 + ) serious respondents to a recent Department of Energy RFP are willing to invest $ 60 - 70 m of their own private money on the belief that their particular technology can meet the requirements .
They could all be wrong but it is somewhat unlikely that so many different approaches and distinct technology sets will all prove wrong .
I have significant funds invested in three such projects and unfortunately those of you who looked at the technology in the public domain will never get to see what private companies are doing .
Am I certain this will work ?
No , but it is very likely that one of the dozen or more projects will achieve the cost target .
The risk of a failure is much lower than the risk of a battery breakthrough to make plug-ins economically attractive ( in my view ) .
Further if we did not have corn ethanol priming the pump , helping create a market for ethanol , getting the fuel infrastructure and FFV 's lined up , I would not be investing in cellulosic ethanol as the cascade of distribution , market demand and infrastructure risks with the technology risk would make it too risky for me .
In fact the corn ethanol investments we have made will make the cellulosic risk smaller as it is likely ( but not guaranteed ) that the initial cellulosic plants will be add - ons to today 's corn ethanol plants , making them economically viable sooner .
To make this future happen this is a pretty modest risk to take compared to the risks we are taking with oil today , shipping lanes , supply , and geopolitics .
We have a climate crisis and energy crisis .
We have a terrorism crisis and a foreign policy crisis and all of them are linked to oil .
Ethanol is a risk worth taking .
And it takes us down a path that can lead to revolution through a series of evolutionary steps , at little cost to government , consumers or US automakers .
Little cost , lots of upside - what is there not to like .
I do n't buy the argument that this will lull us into not pursuing other solutions ( like increased CAFE ; , better batteries ) in parallel .
To address the issues we disagree on according to Mr. Rapier , on corn ethanol most of the community does not get the questions right .
EROIE is not relevant ( By the way , the fossil energy ratio of electricity today is four times worse than corn ethanol according to the Argonne National Labs GREET model ! ) .
What is only the " somewhat wrong " question is the " fossil energy ratio " - fossil energy in to total energy out .
Renewable energy like solar is free , if one can take care of land conservation ( addressed later ) .
Otherwise a 15 % efficient solar cell would have an energy ratio of 0.15 !
And nobody thinks that is bad .
Here , more accurate than the fossil energy ratio is the fossil energy used per mile driven ( to take the differential mileage actually or potentially achieved into account ) , COMPARED TO GASOLINE .
Even better is to directly measure our goals - ( i ) how much petroleum do we displace and ( 2 ) greenhouse gas reductions .
So what is the trick ?
Most of the fossil energy used in corn ethanol production is natural gas , not petroleum so for peak oil fans , the typical US corn ethanol plant reduces petroleum use dramatically , according to the NRDC and Dr Wang at Argonne National Labs ( 90 % or more reduction ) !
That addresses peak oil and energy security issues even if it does not address the green house gas issues .
( 2 ) We get moderate , ( roughly 20 % depending on production methodology for corn ethanol plants ) green house gas reductions but as we try and reduce cost of production and make the process more energy efficient we can get 5X the fossil energy balance ( www.e3biofuels.com) as verified by the National Commission on Energy Policy ( personal communications ) even with corn ethanol .
As explained above , in my view the only solution we can implement rapidly will have to fit in today 's engines and we should chart a path for improving engines and improving fuels in smaller manageable steps without a dramatic big - step change .
If we require a big step we know it wo n't happen .
Pragmatics is what rules doability in my view .
Others are welcome to disagree and spend their time trying to make it happen .
I wo n't spend my time on it but I will sincerely hope they are successful .
As described above it will probably ( but not certainly ) lead to the same place .
Corn ethanol will lead to other fuels but will it be completely displaced ?
I do n't know the answer but probably not .
I do think it will become an immaterial part of our liquid fuel infrastructure because of its inherent limited capacity ( 15 billion gallons per year ) .
Biofuels in the US will be a 100 - 200 billion gallons per year market and if we have excess capacity ( something I think is likely ) excess capacity will be applied to bioplastics , stationary power and other applications .
Compared to what we are likely to pick as politically acceptable options , the consequences of failure are small .
I do n't know a pragmatic solution that will get past the various interest groups that I can advocate .
All electric cars in one step is not something I can believe in .
Despite incentives it has already failed and I do n't see a smooth path to massive adoption , except as described above .
If others are more successful with electric then nothing I am proposing will be in conflict .
We will get to oil independence sooner as electrics catch on rapidly .
I do hope they are successful .
Personally I believe running electric cars off wind power or off hydrogen generated from wind power is an unrealistic pie - in - the - sky idea from academics who have no understanding of the politics of change and have not participated in real change .
Theory and practice are often different .
But I wish them well .
Having dismissed energy ratios as mostly irrelevant I want to stress that even corn ethanol from a typical natural gas powered corn ethanol plant today has almost twice the energy balance of petroleum .
Apples to apples a unit of fossil energy will deliver between 1.3 to 1.8 units of liquid fuel energy out in corn ethanol and 0.8 units of energy out for gasoline per Dr. Wang at the Argonne National Labs and the GREET simulation model .
There is additional renewable energy going into corn ethanol production , mostly solar energy , but that is in my view free .
Otherwise solar cells would make no sense and would have a terrible energy ratio .
This fact is the subject of much confusion .
And this energy , being of higher octane can be used more efficiently than gasoline - some where between 10 - 30 % more efficiently depending upon the engine .
With 33 % less energy mileage with ethanol is between 5 - 25 % lower in most cases ( the 5 % case is hypothetical but feasible as real engines in the SAAB 9 - 5 Biopower car gets 18 % less mileage but about 20 % more horsepower .
If it was sized to give the rated 150 hp it gets on gasoline , mileage would improve substantially ) .
Even better , the ethanol production uses about 90 % less petroleum so for peak oil enthusiasts it is by far the best and easiest solution .
It will result in a 10 - 30 % lower green house gases per mile driven for environmentalists .
The plants one of my investments ( Cilion ) is building do not dry the distillers grain , cutting the energy use substantially and hence are much greener .
Later they will replace the rest of the natural gas by utilizing the manure from local cattle feedlots ( they are mostly building plants near cattle feedlots ) .
The following graph illustrates that even for standard corn ethanol plants ethanol comes out way ahead when evaluating ( 1 ) the amount of fossil energy needed or ( 2 ) the amount of petroleum energy needed .
Fig 1 : BTUs Spent per BTUs Available Source : DOE
The following NRDC chart shows green house gas emission per mile driven for various ways to produce corn ethanol .
E3 Biofuels corn ethanol and cellulosic ethanol are dramatically better than corn ethanol but traditional corn ethanol is good enough on all counts and we should not let perfect be the enemy of the good .
Fig 2 : Carbon Dioxide Emissions of various fuels Source : NRDC
Ethanol is clearly going down the right trajectory , even without other biohols like butanol which will improve the potential of this trajectory further .
The there is the food versus fuel controversy .
Why have the developing countries been fighting so hard to eliminate the food subsidies ?
Because with cheap western food exports their farmers cannot generate enough income to sell their own crops or generate enough income to feed their families .
There is no scarcity of food but rather a scarcity of income to buy it for the poorest of the poor .
The current Doha round of talks on international trade broke down mostly over this issue .
Developing liquid fuels based on biomass to replace gasoline is among the best things we could do to alleviate poverty and increase the value of lands in Africa , Latin America and other parts of the poverty belt .
Temporarily food prices in America may go up but long term this will be a boon to farmers and consumers in America and around the world .
Incidentally , we devote 250 million acres to animal feed in this country and it takes 15 ponds of corn to produce a pound of beef / pork / poultry today !
Beef use has been declining in favor of poultry and if that trend continues , we will use only 10 pounds of feedstock to generate a pound of meat , freeing up 33 % of the land currently used for meat production ( and lots of water ) .
If you see anybody extrapolating corn ethanol use to meet all of our gasoline replacement needs , you are seeing a person with an agenda .
Nobody in their right mind is proposing we meet more than a small fraction of our gasoline needs from corn .
Are there issues with ethanol ?
Sure .
Today it is less than perfect .
Corn uses more water and fertilizer than I like ( E3 Biofuels corn uses far less ) .
With all factors like fermentation emissions , crop growing and transportation etc it reduces green house gases only about 20 % ( actually between 10 - 30 % generally but getting better every day ) .
I would like to see much higher numbers on green house gas reductions and less intensive crop cultivations .
Cellulosic will make all these issues much less critical - Miscanthus will use a lot less water and almost no fertilizer ( after the growing season it sends its nutrients back to the root system ( stored in rhizomes for the winter ) which is not harvested , almost no tillage , richer soil because it actually fixes carbon into the soil ( hence the negative carbon per mile driven in the NRDC charts ) , and much greater biodiversity .
We will still have to do grass cocktails to avoid monoculture , probably more complex crop rotation schemes and better management of the land .
Unexpected problems with agriculture will crop up and will need to be managed .
Likely we will have mixed species of C4 photosynthetic grasslands .
Highly diverse native hay meadows , mowed annually , were once an important part of the Oklahoma landscape and should serve as models .
They can provide carbohydrates to convert into liquid fuels for our cars and remnant proteins to turn into animal feed protein .
It is not only unlikely that we will not get our gasoline replacement from corn ; it is also unlikely that economics will support our getting the biomass from byproducts of today 's annual crops like corn stover .
Economics will dictate biomass density of atleast 6 - 8 tons per acre initially and 15 + tons per acre later to keep the collection radius small ( below 30 miles probably ) and delivered cost of biomass below $ 40 per dry ton ( or about $ 0.40 per gallon of fuel ) .
This will dictate energy crops like Miscanthus .
We will probably design higher energy density fuels with even higher octane ratings and higher burn efficiency , higher compression ratios before knock occurs and more .
Finally on the issue of subsidies , we force the cheapest oil in the world from Saudi Arabia to compete with expensive US ethanol , while keeping out cheap ethanol from Brazil .
In addition there are plenty of direct and indirect subsidies for oil .
Keep in mind that oil is an even more potent political force than the ethanol interests and has many different subsidies , direct and indirect , that it receives .
A recent General Accounting Office of the Federal government listed a few of direct and directly measurable subsidies .
Something esoterically called the " Excess of Percentage over cost depletion " has been a $ 82 billion dollar subsidy to oil .
Expensing of exploration and development cost was listed as another $ 42 billion subsidy .
Add on alternative fuel production credit ( read oil shales , tar sands etc ) , oil and gas exception from passive loss limitation , credit for enhanced oil recovery costs , expensing of tertiary injectants , and other esoteric tools the oil lobby has inserted into various pieces of legislation , ( including shameless attempts to get royalty relief from Katrina related legislation to the tune of $ 7 b ) .
And none of this includes any of the indirect subsidies .
They have been variously estimated at from a few tens of cents to many dollars per gallon once one includes indirect costs like military costs .
We spend over $ 50 b per year defending the sea lanes through which oil passes !
But does ethanol need a subsidy to survive ?
NO .
It may get subsidies but it does n't need them to be competitive with gasoline at any projected price of oil within the next twenty five years ( Energy Information Administration projections , 2006 ) .
But the ethanol interest group is a potent political force and if it is getting subsidies , it wo n't give it up easily .
But getting it does not mean they need it .
We have a subsidy for ethanol but we also have a tariff of $ 0.54 per gallon , making expensive ethanol from the US compete with the least expensive oil in the world ( Saudi oil ) , while keeping out Brazilian ethanol .
Today , even if ethanol prices were cut in half or more to $ 1.40 a gallon wholesale , corn ethanol producers would make adequate margins of profit .
If we did not have a tariff or a subsidy ethanol would compete extremely well with oil .
And while we are at it , I should point out that cost and price are different things .
E85 market pricing would be much lower in a stable market because production costs are so much lower than gasoline .
If production costs are half of gasoline why should n't it sell for half of gasoline ?
Answer : because of distortion and mismanagement .
Frankly it is in the interest of the oil companies to keep ethanol prices high so as a primary fuel it does n't start to replace gasoline .
In the end for any commodity , price will be related to production costs but the oil companies are in no hurry to see rapid change happen here .
If we ever get a real cap and trade system like we should have it will make ethanol more competitive .
In some sense I view the current subsidy on ethanol as just offsetting the current subsidies to oil and in the future to substitute for what will be a cap and trade credit .
How much biomass can we produce ?
We can only go by current data points and the realization that corn yields have increased by 7X and are still increasing ( expected to go from 140 bushels per acre average currently to about 200 bushels per acre by 2015 ) .
We assume only a modest 60 % increase above experimental Miscanthus yields in our model after twenty five years ( 2030 ) of development and optimization using plant breeding and genetic engineering .
In the only side - by - side comparison of switchgrass and Miscanthus undertaken to date in the U.S. , Miscanthus averaged 16.5 dry tons / acre / year whereas switchgrass averaged 4.6 dry tons / acre / year for three Illinois sites with data taken over two years ( Heaton and Long , in preparation ) .
The fact that a well - controlled study showed a 3 - fold productivity increase relative to the cellulosic energy crop most widely - studied in the United States is indicative of the nascent status of the field .
At the best of three sites in the best of two years , a yield of 25 dry tons per acre per year was realized .
We assume this best yield will become the average yield after twenty five years , across 40 - 60 million acres of good cropland that is currently used for export oriented crops .
The maximum potential yield of switchgrass - based on simulations founded on plausible physics , biochemistry , and physiology of the crop in its normal growing environment - is estimated by McLaughlin et al. at 21 dry tons / acre / year .
New tools for plant breeding are available that are expected to foster fast gains .
These include marker - assisted breeding , which do not result in GMO plants , as well as development of transgenic plants ( McGlaughlin and Kszos , 2005 ) .
Sugar cane experts ( Frikkie Botha , South Africa Sugar Research Institute ; Fernando Reinach , Allelyx and Votorantim New Business ) project that breeding and cultivation of cane with the goal of maximizing total biomass yield can likely result in about 25 dry tons of harvestable biomass per acre per year in the relatively near term .
Megaflora corp. has measured productivities of 28 dry tons per acre per year from crossing North American Hardwoods with the polonia tree ( Ray Allen , personal communication ) .
Ceres , a leading plant biotechnology company , has concluded that available information " strongly suggest [s ] that over the next decade or so the deployment of modern breeding technologies will result in average energy yields of at least 15 tons per acre , and that these averages can be sustained across a broad range of geographic and environmental conditions , including the approximately 75 million acres of crop and pasture land in the United States that could easily be converted to their cultivation without impacting domestic food production . "
( Richard Hamilton , Personal Communication ) .
Many researchers , especially in the environmental community assume that energy crops will not use genetic engineering while we continue to use these techniques for row crops .
They further assume we will use marginal lands or get our biomass as a byproduct of crops on currently managed lands .
The DOE estimates that this scenario of collection of existing biomass with only small change in agricultural practices could generate 1.3 billion tons of biomass in the US .
We personally believe that it is likely we will use dedicated energy crops ( cocktails of C4 photosynthetic grasses like Miscanthus ) on lands that are currently used to produce export crops and 40 - 60 million acres of this land will be sufficient to meet most of our gasoline needs .
Quoting form the 2005 DOE study 's conclusion " In the context of the time required to scale up to a large - scale biorefinery industry , an annual biomass supply of more than 1.3 billion dry tons can be accomplished with relatively modest changes in land use and agricultural and forestry practices " ( Technical Feasibility of a Billion - Ton Annual Supply , US Department of Energy Report , April 2005 ) .
At an average of 100 gallons per ton , that should be a 130 billion gallons of ethanol .
We use 140 billion gallons of gasoline today .
And how much land could we use ?
We have over 120 million acres of CRP and export crop lands .
Our default assumption is that we will use some fraction of these lands to eliminate our oil imports for gasoline and then go on to replace even domestic oil used for gasoline .
It is also worth contemplating that harvested land has stayed constant as the US population has tripled and the per capita calorie consumption has gone up .
Further , in the US approximately 250 million acres of cropland are devoted to animal feed production ( including forage crops ) and pasture for meat production , essentially all of which could be used to produce energy crops .
In addition , about 350 million acres are devoted to range land , of which some but not all could be used to produce energy crops .
In 2005 , 75.1 million acres of corn grain were harvested in the U.S. , about 80 % of which was feed to livestock ( ~60 MM acres ; ) ; 71.4 million acres of soybeans were harvested , with 70 % going to feed animals ( ~50 million acres ) ; and 61.6 million acres of hay were harvested .
In 2002 , 62 million acres of cropland were used as pastureland .
An estimated 20 % of the 50 million harvested acres of wheat are used to feed livestock ( ~10 million acres ) .
Additional crops that are primarily fed to animals include sorghum ( 6 million ) , oats ( 2 million ) , and barley ( 3 million ) .
The total allocation for animal feed production , therefore , is an estimated 255 million acres , not including other crops commonly feed to livestock ( e.g. millet , rye , peas , beans , lentils ) .
Crop acreages from NASS , 2006 .
Pasture acreage from USDA , 2006 .
Corn grain and soybeans allocated to animal feed from Etherton et al. , 2003 .
Wheat allocated to animal feed based on FAO , 2006 .
Table 3 .
Feed conversion efficiencies for major animal food types .
Mass conversions from Smil , 2000 , assuming feed is corn ; corresponding caloric values from USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference
Changes in the relative proportions of various kinds of meat also have large potential impacts on land availability .
In 2000 , relative consumption of beef , pork , and poultry was as follows : 41 % beef , 27 % pork , and 32 % poultry .
Using these values and the data in Table 2 , a weighted average of 14.3 kg feed per kg edible animal product can be calculated .
Per capita meat consumption changed significantly throughout the 20th century however , and there would seem little reason to assume that it will remain constant in the future .
Between the mid seventies and 2000 , for example , beef consumption fell by 19 % , pork consumption remained essentially constant , and poultry consumption increased by 92 % .
For a hypothetical future scenario in which beef and pork accounted for 25 % of meat consumption and poultry accounted for 50 % - which would not seem unreasonable given recent trends - a weighted average of 10.85 kg feed per kg is calculated ; a 24 % change relative to the situation 2000 .
Devoting 24 % less cropland to animal feed production would make available very roughly 50 million acres .
We will also see the emergence of new practices .
For example , Sweet sorghum , ( currently being studied in India for fuel production ) can make an excellent and cheaper substitute for corn in ethanol plants and can be grown on marginal lands with less little water and fertilizer .
Failure to look at these possibilities is a failure of imagination .
We need to thread the needle between the " what is ... and let 's extrapolate today 's corn ethanol production " tunnel vision crowd ( generally done with an agenda - The American Petroleum Institute is concerned enough about world food supply and our welfare to have issued press releases on it ! ) and the " pie - in - the - sky academics who will dream up " what can be " without consideration for the path dependence of the choices we make and the pragmatics of how business works and what is needed to make a revolutionary future happen through a series of evolutionary steps .
We should take our lesson from nature - from single celled amoeba to complex humans was an evolutionary process .
It is the only way we can get billions of dollars deployed to make this alternative future happen .
It turns out that Wal - Mart is running targeted banner campaigns on The Pirate Bay to promote their DVDs .
They hereby contribute to the estimated $ 75,000 in ad revenues the Pirate Bay generates every month .
According to Variety , Wal - Mart placed targeted ads for DVDs of “ The Sopranos ” , “ Smallville ” , “ Desperate Housewives ” and the movie “ Office Space ” and other DVDs .
The ads appeared on pages that linked to corresponding torrents .
Last year there was some controversy surrounding an Australia Bank that accidentally advertised on The Pirate Bay .
The Bank first denied it had advertised on world ’s largest BitTorrent tracker , but later admitted the “ mistake ” .
Another big sponsor of TPB is broadband provider Verizon .
They advertise their “ high speed connections ” to the bandwidth craving pirates .
It ’s all about targeted advertising .
Microsoft 's new Windows Vista operating system is a giant step backward for your freedoms .
Usually , new software enables you to do more with your computer .
Vista , though , is designed to restrict what you can do .
Vista enforces new forms of “ Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) ” .
DRM is more accurately called Digital Restrictions Management , because it is a technology that Big Media and computer companies try to impose on us all , in order to have control over how our computers are used .
Technology security expert Bruce Schneier explains it most concisely :
Windows Vista includes an array of “ features ” that you do n't want .
These features will make your computer less reliable and less secure .
They 'll make your computer less stable and run slower .
They will cause technical support problems .
They may even require you to upgrade some of your peripheral hardware and existing software .
And these features wo n't do anything useful .
In fact , they 're working against you .
They 're digital rights management ( DRM ) features built into Vista at the behest of the entertainment industry —
And you do n't get to refuse them .
DRM gives power to Microsoft and Big Media .
They decide which programs you can and can't use on your computer
They decide which features of your computer or software you can use at any given moment
They force you to install new programs even when you do n't want to ( and , of course , pay for the privilege )
They restrict your access to certain programs and even to your own data files
DRM is enforced by technological barriers .
You try to do something , and your computer tells you that you can't .
To make this effective , your computer has to be constantly monitoring what you are doing .
This constant monitoring uses computing power and memory , and is a large part of the reason why Microsoft is telling you that you have to buy new and more powerful hardware in order to run Vista .
They want you to buy new hardware not because you need it , but because your computer needs it in order to be more effective at restricting what you do .
Microsoft and other computer companies sometimes refer to these restrictions as “ Trusted Computing . ”
Given that they are designed to make it so that your computer stops trusting you and starts trusting Microsoft , these restrictions are more appropriately called “ Treacherous Computing ” .
Even when you legally buy Vista , you do n't own it .
Windows Vista , like previous versions of Windows , is proprietary software : leased to you under a license that severely restricts how you can use it , and without source code , so nobody but Microsoft can change it or even verify what it really does .
Microsoft says it best :
The software is licensed , not sold .
This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software .
Microsoft reserves all other rights .
Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation , you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement .
In doing so , you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways .
To make it even more confusing , different versions of Vista have different licensing restrictions .
You can read all of the licenses at http://www.microsoft.com/about/legal/useterms/default.aspx.
It 's painful to read the licenses , and this is often why people do n't object to them .
But if we do n't start objecting , we will lose valuable freedoms .
Here are some of the ridiculous restrictions you will find in your reading :
If your copy of Vista came with the purchase of a new computer , that copy of Vista may only be legally used on that machine , forever .
If you bought Vista in a retail store and installed it on a machine you already owned , you have to completely delete it on that machine before you can install it on another machine .
You give Microsoft the right , through programs like Windows Defender , to delete programs from your system that it decides are spyware .
programs from your system that it decides are spyware .
You consent to being spied upon by Microsoft , through the “ Windows Genuine Advantage ” system .
This system tries to identify instances of copying that Microsoft thinks are illegitimate .
Unfortunately , a recent study indicated that this system has already screwed up in over 500,000 cases .
Free software like GNU / Linux does not require you to consent to these absurd licensing terms .
It is called free software because you are free to make as many copies as you want , and to share it with as many friends as you want .
Nobody will be monitoring your actions or falsely calling you a thief .
What you can do to help protect your freedom
There is a battle underway between those who value freedom , and corporations such as Microsoft who wish to profit by taking that freedom away .
DRM and absurd licenses are at the heart of that battle .
Please join us on the side of freedom by saying NO not just to Windows Vista and other DRM - enabled products , but to proprietary software in general .
Instead , use non-DRM , “ free ” software such as the GNU / Linux operating system .
You can get your work done while ensuring that your rights and freedoms will not be restricted now and into the future .
As more and more of our lives become digital , it is vital that we protect our digital freedoms just like we have always worked to protect our freedom of expression in print and speech .

The company that the new job is with requires that everyone attend a scheduled quarterly meeting on a Saturday .
If anyone does n't show up for the meeting , money with be deducted from their paychecks .
So my husband went to the meeting .
Little did he know that they would start this meeting with a group prayer .
My husband said he felt so uncomfortable in this situation ; it felt inappropriate .
He felt forced to be there because of the threat that money would be taken out of his check if he did n't attend .
Neither one of us has a problem with someone praying on an individual basis , it 's the group thing , as well as basically feeling forced to be there that has us both bothered .
Can this be legal ?
I am the worst at searching for info on the internet .
And since there are alot of knowledgeable people on dailykos I am seeking some info to find out what we can do .
My husband does n't want to go to the next meeting in three months , but he will be penalized if he does n't .
He is concerned if he tells the company that he is uncomfortable with group prayer he will be fired .
What can we do ?
And please note that this diary is not intended to offend anyone who prays .
The issues are prayer groups at the workplace , and being forced to attend .
Update :
Thank you all for the advice and for putting my diary on the recommend list .
I have to sign - off for a while , but I will be back to check all your comments .
Update 2 : Wow !
I am trying to keep up with reading everyone 's comments , and thank you for responding .
I wanted to mention that my husband did ask me to post this diary .
He is not a kossack like me , and he was n't sure what to do about the situation at work and quite frankly neither was I .
Thank you all again .
And most likely he will just grin and bear it and maybe when I am done getting my degree he can quit .
Peace .
My colleague Bryan Caplan has devoted many years to uncovering how the beliefs of ordinary people differ from the beliefs of economists , even after correcting for economists ’ differing incomes and ideologies .
In 2004 , Caplan summarized his findings as the public having four big biases : an anti-foreign bias , a make - work bias , an anti-market bias , and a pessimistic bias .
Arnold Kling quotes Caplan as saying :
One of the first things that stands out is anti-foreign bias .
When they contemplate economic interaction with foreigners , the general public gets unreasonably negative …
A second major pattern in the public ’s economic illiteracy is make - work bias …
In the long - run , blaming technology for unemployment is just silly .
As the mechanization of agriculture beautifully illustrates , when machines replace people in one line of work , they switch to another …
a blanket anti-market bias …
In the minds of public , prices apparently go up when businesses suddenly start to feel greedier .
Economists , in contrast , expect businesses to be greedy year - in , year - out ; but depending on market conditions , greed may call for prices to go up , go down , or stay the same …
A final catch - all category of economic illiteracy may be called pessimistic bias .
Conventional wisdom has it that conditions are going from bad to worse .
Most Americans think that real income has been falling for decades , most new jobs are low - paying , and doubt whether the next generation will have a higher standard of living .
Economists think that this conventional wisdom is dead wrong .
Caplan calls these biases , but I would rather call them correlated errors , if they were due mainly to people being ignorant about economics .
( To me , an error is an estimate differing from truth , a bias is a cheaply avoidable error . )
It is not clear , however , that ignorance is the main cause here .
Consider how differently the public treats physics and economics .
Physicists can say that this week they think the universe has eleven dimensions , three of which are purple , and two of which are twisted clockwise , and reporters will quote them unskeptically , saying " Is n’t that cool ! "
But if economists say , as they have for centuries , that a minimum wage raises unemployment , reporters treat them skeptically and feel they need to find a contrary quote to " balance " their story .
I see the same pattern with my students – they ’ll easily believe physics claims , but are very reluctant to entertain standard economics claims .
They come to class with strong incorrect preconceptions about the social world .
As Caplan emphasizes , the publics ’ problem with economics is not the things they do n’t know , it is the things they know that ai n’t so ; they act not ignorant but cocksure of error .
The reasons for this resistance are not entirely clear , but one plausible theory is that people want to believe certain things about the social world , regardless of whether those things are true .
For example , we want to believe foreigners are out to get us , as this makes us seem more loyal to non-foreigners .
If this theory is correct , then these four big errors are four big biases .
Addendum : Don Boudreaux at Cafe Hayek gives a relevant quote from Frank Knight , and Paul Krugman considers why non-economists " so consistently balk at the concept of comparative advantage . "
Further Addendum :
This post produced a lot of controversy , which I tried to respond the following Tuesday .

Forget the textbook story about tool use and language sparking the dramatic evolutionary growth of the human brain .
Instead , imagine ancient hominid children chasing frogs .
Not for fun , but for food .
According to Dr. Stephen Cunnane it was a rich and secure shore - based diet that fuelled and provided the essential nutrients to make our brains what they are today .
Controversially , according to Dr. Cunnane our initial brain boost did n't happen by adaptation , but by exaptation , or chance .
" Anthropologists and evolutionary biologists usually point to things like the rise of language and tool making to explain the massive expansion of early hominid brains .
But this is a Catch - 22 .
Something had to start the process of brain expansion and I think it was early humans eating clams , frogs , bird eggs and fish from shoreline environments .
This is what created the necessary physiological conditions for explosive brain growth , " says Dr. Cunnane , a metabolic physiologist at the University of Sherbrooke in Sherbrooke , Quebec .
The evolutionary growth in hominid brain size remains a mystery and a major point of contention among anthropologists .
Our brains weigh roughly twice as much as our similarly sized earliest human relative , Homo habilis two million years ago .
The big question is which came first - the bigger brain or the social , linguistic and tool - making skills we associate with it ?
But , Dr. Cunnane argues that most anthropologists are ignorant or dismissive of the key missing link to help answer this question : the metabolic constraints that are critical for healthy human brain development today , and for its evolution .
Human brains are n't just comparatively big , they 're hungry .
The average newborn 's brain consumes an amazing 75 - per cent of an infant 's daily energy needs .
According to Dr. Cunnane , to fuel this neural demand , human babies are born with a built - in energy reservoir - that cute baby fat .
Human infants are the only primate babies born with excess fat .
It accounts for about 14 per cent of their birth weight , similar to that of their brains .
It 's this baby fat , says Dr. Cunnane , that provided the physiological winning conditions for hominids ' evolutionary brain expansion .
And how were hominid babies able to pack on the extra pounds ?
According to Cunnane their moms were dining on shoreline delicacies like clams and catfish .
" The shores gave us food security and higher nutrient density .
My hypothesis is that to permit the brain to start to increase in size , the fittest early humans were those with the fattest infants , " says Dr. Cunnane , author of the book Survival of the Fattest , published in 2005 .
Unlike the prehistoric savannahs or forests , argues Dr. Cunnane , ancient shoreline environments provided a year - round , accessible and rich food supply .
Such an environment was found in the wetlands and river and lake shorelines that dominated east Africa 's prehistoric Rift Valley in which early humans evolved .
Dr. Cunnane points to the table scrap fossil evidence collected by his symposium co-organizer Dr. Kathy Stewart from the Canadian Museum of Nature , in Ottawa .
Her study of fossil material excavated from numerous Homo habilis sites in eastern Africa revealed a bevy of chewed fish bones , particularly catfish .
More than just filling the larder , shorelines provided essential brain boosting nutrients and minerals that launched Homo sapiens brains past their primate peers , says Dr. Cunnane , the Canada Research Chair in Brain Metabolism and Aging .
Brain development and function requires ample supplies of a particular polyunsaturated fatty acid : docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) .
DHA is critical to proper neuron function .
Human baby fat provides both an energy source for the rapidly growing infant grey matter , and also , says Dr. Cunnane , a greater concentration of DHA per pound than at any other time in life .
Aquatic foods are also rich in iodine , a key brain nutrient .
Iodine is present in much lower amounts from terrestrial food sources such as mammals and plants .
It was this combination of abundant shoreline food and the " brain selective nutrients " that sparked the growth of the human brain , he says .
" Initially there was n't selection for a larger brain , " argues Dr. Cunnane .
" The genetic possibility was there , but it remained silent until it was catalyzed by this shore - based diet . "
Dr. Cunnane acknowledges that for the past 20 years he 's been swimming upstream when it comes to convincing anthropologists of his position , especially that initial hominid brain expansion happened by chance rather than adaptation .
But , he says , the evidence of the importance of key shoreline nutrients to brain development is still with us - painfully so .
Iodine deficiency is the world 's leading nutrient deficiency .
It affects more than a 1.5 billion people , mostly in inland areas , and causes sub - optimal brain function .
Iodine is legally required to be added to salt in more than 100 countries .
Says Dr. Cunnane : " We 've created an artificial shore - based food supply in our salt . "

There are certain things that the vast majority of people put into their personals that are just plain stupid .
Mostly I 'm talking about the women , cuz I do n't read the guys very often , unless I 'm very bored .
But let 's go through some of these idiocies .... 1 . I like to have funThis is the dumbest thing you can say in your personal .
It 's sort of like saying , " I see things with my eyes " .
The whole point of fun , is that you like it .
There is n't a person on the face of the planet that will admit that they do n't like to have fun .
That 's not exactly an amazing trait to be listing .
In fact , when ever I read that I pretty much assume that the poster has the intelligence of your standard sorority barbie doll , plastic head and all .
2 . I do n't like guys who play gamesI do n't think that the men who do play games , would rarely acknowledge that they play games .
Hell , most of them probably do n't even realize they 're doing it when they are .
And maybe I just do n't read the guys ' personals enough , but I very much doubt you 're going to find anyone that says , " I like to play games , and am looking to fuck with someone 's head " .
It 's one of those crap - shoots that everyone has to ante into when you do the online dating thing .
Sort of like when you go to meet someone who has n't sent you a picture , and you 're really hoping that half their head has n't been taken over by a giant mole .
You just never know until you meet the person .
3 .
No Bush Supporters PleaseI 'm no fan of Bush either , but some of my good friends voted for him .
That does n't make them inbred retards or horrible people .
I can understand that personal politics can be a big issue for some people , but it 's not for everyone .
By playing the anti-bush card you immediately remove half of your possiblities , and then alienate even more who may not support Bush , but could n't give a rats ass about politics , politicians , and the people who 's lives revolve around pointing out the injustices of the powers that be .
You might as well say " My ideal first date includes protesting and civil disobedience " .
4 . I 'm looking for a good Christian who loves JesusHave you ever noticed Christians are the only people who make demands that their dates be of the same faith as they are ?
Seriously .
Look around .
You 'll never find ads that say " Must be Athiest " , " Buddhists Only Please " , or " Looking for a nice Hindu fella " .
While this irks me in someway , it 's also kinda nice .
It plants a big billboard on your personal that screams " I 'M A JESUS FREAK " .
Which to many of us reads as " WARNING : Poster has a loose grip on reality and a limited conversational repertoire .
Proceed with great caution !
" 5 . I 've got pictures on my websiteNo you do n't .
You have pictures of someone on your website , but it 's not you because you 're a guy !
That 's right .
I can see through your ruse .
You run a porn / model site and you 're trying to generate hits .
If you were a woman posting a personal , who had also created your own website with pictures of yourself on it , then you would know how to post your picture with your personal .
You might fool most people , but you do n't fool me !
6 . I 'm 18 and .... Okay stop right there .
You 're 18 and you 're already resorting to personal ads ?
Jesus , give the dating scene a change to crush your hopes before automatically resorting to the personals .
I do n't care how grown up you think you are .
If you 're 18 you do n't have enough life experience to bitch and moan about how hard it is to find the right person .
You have n't been trying hard enough .
Besides , most of the men who respond to 18 year olds are gonna be 40 + , and you do n't want to go there .
7 . I like to go out somtimes , but I also like to stay inSo you 're telling me that sometimes you leave your apartment , and somtimes you do n't .
That 's incredible because that 's what EVERYONE ELSE DOES !
The frequency varies from person to person , but everyone goes out sometimes , and stays home other times .
Is this really worth making mention of ?
If you 're a hermit that never goes out , that might be worth noting .
If you 're a wild drunken party animal that goes out every single night , that too may be worth mentioning .
But making the above statment just tells me that you 're trying really hard to sound normal , which leads me to believe that you 're not .
8. BBW 's without pictures .
Oh man ... good luck .
Seriously .
If you consider yourself a Big Beautiful Woman , you 'd better be able to back it up .
I am of the belief that big women can be beautiful .
But I , like most men , am not attracted to over weight people .
I 'm rather thin myself , and if you 're 6 inches shorter than me , and 100 lbs more than me , I 'm probably not going to be feeling the sparks .
Being big does not necessarily denote that you are beautiful as well .
But if you are ( or at least think you are ) you might wanna post a picture to prove it to the world .
Otherwise 99 % of the guys are gonna skip right over your message in search of someone more appropriately proportioned .
9 .
SWF , SWM , NSA , BBW , HWP , PVP , ETCWhen you start using acronyms in your personals , you 've been doing the personals thing for too long .
When I temped at an office , you could tell who'd been there forever because they had abbreviations for everything , that you only understood once you 'd been there for a few years .
I think the same thing applies to the personals .
You do n't want to be that person , and I sure as hell do n't wanna date that person .
10 .
Hi !
My name is Bethany and I'm 22 .
If you 're interested write me .
What 's there to be interested in ?
You 're giving us nothing but your name and age .
I can't say that I 'm overly impressed .
Maybe if you 're posting this in the Casual Encounters with a picture of yourself in some frilly lingerie , then maybe you could get away with that .
But if you 're looking for a date to meet up with at a coffee shop , you 're gonna have to put down a little more than your name and age .
If I 'm supposed to try and talk to you for an hour or two over a cup of joe , I would hope that you can say more than " Hi! I'm Bethany ! I 'm 22 ! " .
Because as it stands now , I 'd be surprised if you could tell me the time off a digital watch .
If you 're posting a personal ad , try and put a little thought into it .
Read through it when you 're done and see if it sounds like you , or if it sounds like everyone you 've ever met .
Make yourself sound unique and present qualities about yourself that most other people do n't have .
What makes you special ?
If you like to have fun , you 're not special ... you 're short bus special .
By Leo Babauta
Confession time :
My name is Leo , and I ’m a recovering creditcardaholic .
When I was just starting out in the world of adulthood , I shied away from credit cards .
My parents had had some troubles with them , so I had a bit of a phobia .
In my early 20s , I caved in and got a card , simply to build credit .
It only had a $ 500 limit , and I pledged to pay off the balance every month .
I did this for a few years , but for one reason or another , eventually let the balance creep up until I could no longer pay the balance every year .
I then paid it off and canceled the card , out of pure fear .
I went without a card for a little while , and then came the bad days .
I need to buy something important , and did n’t have the cash .
I got a card with a $ 5,000 limit , and felt the fear creep back in .
The first charge was well over $ 1,000 .
Then there were other large charges — expenses I wanted to pay for , but did n’t have the cash .
I tried to pay as much as I could each month , but when I started having other expenses , the credit card bill was n’t a priority .
I could pay it later .
Fast forward to a couple years ago : I could no longer afford to pay my minimum balance on my card .
I had other bills that were also out of control .
I canceled the card , and worked out a payment plan .
I struggled with my other bills until the beginning of 2006 , when I started getting things under control .
But I still had a Mastercard debit card , and I used this to buy stuff over the Internet .
Since it was n’t a credit card , that was OK , right ?
Today , I am scraping by , but here ’s the cool thing : I do n’t have a credit card at all .
Not even the Mastercard debit card .
I am paying off my debts ( the card should be paid off this summer ) and things are looking much rosier .
My recommendation : if you have problems paying off a card ’s balance each month , and have a hard time resisting impulse purchases , cancel your credit card .
Today .
They are a plague .
This point can be debated ad naseum , so I ’ll just say this : do what works for you , but be very careful with credit cards .
They are dangerous , and have caused many financial wrecks for many families .
The best policy for many people , and you may differ , is to go without a card for as long as possible .
But how do I live without a credit card ?
Here ’s how :
I pay my bills online or through automatic deduction .
It ’s simple , convenient , and automatic .
Hey presto !
I use cash for everything else .
Everything else ?
Pretty much .
Once in awhile I ’ll write a check , or use my debit card ( it does n’t have a credit card label on it , so I ca n’t use it online ) , but those occasions are rare .
I withdraw cash for groceries , gas and “ spending ” .
What about online purchases ?
Exactamundo !
You ’ve hit the nail on the head .
One of the biggest dangers of credit cards these days is that they make purchases so darn easy .
Doing some research on how to pay off your debt ?
Hey , there ’s a great book about it by Dave Ramsey .
One Click ( tm ) and it ’s headed to my door .
Credit cards allow you to buy stuff , anything really , without having to think about it .
And that ’s dangerous .
So if I REALLY need to buy something online , I might ask a relative to order it for me , and give them cash .
Obviously , this is inconvenient and you do n’t want to do this too often and wear out your welcome .
Which is why it works .
Before I canceled my Mastercard debit card last year ( about four months ago ) , I bought stuff online at the rate of about two things a week .
Not exactly a spending spree , but it adds up to a lot over the course of a year .
In the last four months , I think I ’ve ordered one item .
A reduction of nearly 95 % of my online discretionary spending .
I could also pay using PayPal or similar methods , but I have n’t yet .
The point is that it ’s much harder for me to buy things online now ( and to some extent , in the real world too ) , so I rarely ever do .
While we might think that buying things online is necessary , in almost every case , it ’s not .
Buying online simply makes you spend more than you normally would .
Take it from me , someone who is living evidence .
Using cash has other benefits .
I can see at a glance ( looking in my envelopes for each cash spending category ) how much I have left in that budget category .
That ’s hard to do when you ’re using a credit card .
Sure , you could check your balance online , but most people never do this .
Sure , you could update Quicken or Money , so you know your available balance , but this is much harder to do , especially if you ’re away from home , and so many people guesstimate their balance when they ’re on the road , and sometimes do n’t even bother to do that .
With a credit card , you can worry about it later .
At a high interest rate .
This has been a hot topic in the last month or so on personal finance blogs , with people weighing in on both sides .
I think it ’s a highly personal issue , and different methods work for different people .
See posts on this topic from Get Rich Slowly , No Credit Needed , and Digerati Life .
All good posts .
SEXUAL allure is often hinted as being the prize for buying this or that .
Yet advertising wares during commercial breaks in programmes with an erotic theme can be tricky : the minds of viewers tend to be preoccupied with what they have just seen and the advertisement is ignored .
New research now suggests that even if the commercial is made sexually enticing , people still fail to remember it .
Ellie Parker and Adrian Furnham of University College London devised an experiment to test three ideas .
The first was to confirm that men and women alike would struggle to remember the brand of a product that was advertised during a break in a programme that contained sex .
The second was that commercials that had an erotic element would be recalled more readily than those that did not .
Finally they wanted to know whether people would remember the advertisement more easily if its theme contrasted with the programme into which it had been inserted .
They recruited 60 young adults and divided them into four groups .
The first and third groups were treated to an episode of “ Sex and the City ” called “ Was it good for you ? ” in which the four female characters try to ascertain whether they are good in bed .
It includes kissing , foreplay , nudity and sex scenes , and a discussion of the merits of sex , sexual failings and homosexuality .
The second and fourth groups were shown an episode of “ Malcolm in the Middle ” , about the second - eldest of three boys raised at home in a dysfunctional family .
It contained no such titillating material .
During a commercial break in the screenings , the researchers showed the first and second groups a series of six advertisements for products including shampoo , perfume and beer , all of which played on sex .
The third and fourth groups were also shown a series of six advertisements for the same type of products that did not employ eroticism .
They then asked their subjects about what they had seen .
The results are published in the March issue of Applied Cognitive Psychology .
Those who had watched “ Sex in the City ” could remember little other than the programme .
They were less able to name which brands had been advertised than were the groups that had watched “ Malcolm in the Middle ” , whether or not the advertisement tried to be sexy .
Even when the researchers prompted their recall , by naming the type of product that had been advertised , the viewers of “ Sex in the City ” failed to remember what they had seen , compared with the groups that had seen more mundane scenes .
To test the second hypothesis , the researchers compared the recollections of those who had seen the advertisements that used the promise of sexual allure with those of the people who saw advertisements that did not titillate .
They found no significant difference between the two groups .
There was , however , a difference between the sexes : men were more likely to remember sexual advertisements ( albeit not the brand advertised ) whereas women were more likely to remember non-sexual advertisements .
Finally the researchers tested to see whether the people who had watched “ Sex in the City ” combined with non-sexual commercials and those who had watched “ Malcolm in the Middle ” combined with sexual commercials remembered what was being advertised better than those shown more homogenous fare .
Again , they found no significant difference between the two groups ; this time , men and women reacted in the same way .
Earlier work has suggested that sex and violence in television programmes deter people from paying attention to advertisements , but speculated that this may be overcome by using sex in the commercials as well .
The new work suggests that this view is mistaken .
It would appear that sex does not sell anything other than itself .
Lieberman was surrounded by a couple of cameras and a horde of reporters , all asking questions .
I walked up and waited behind the reporters , and after a few minutes he stopped answering questions and began to walk off .
I jumped forward , shook his hand , and introduced myself to him , all very politely .
Then I asked him , " Senator , do you feel you 've stuck to your campaign promise to get the troops out of Iraq as soon as possible ? "
He stopped in his tracks , turned to me , and put his hand on my shoulder .
He looked me straight in the eye , and said , " Michael , I always said I want to get the troops out as soon as possibly safely .
In order to get them out safely , we need to send in more troops now . "
Without waiting a second , I shot right back , " Senator , with all due respect , that makes absolutely no sense . "
He chuckled , and without another word , trotted away .
Right after that , several of the reporters came over to me and asked me a couple of questions about what just happened .
One of them posted a link online .
I know everyone on here has been attacking Lieberman non -stop since the primary , but this is the first time I 've met him face - to - face .
I never liked his view on the war , but I never realized he could be such a hypocritical deceitful disgrace .
I can't wait until we win a few more seats in 2008 and he will no longer be in the position to disrupt the balance in the Senate by threatening to switch parties .
Poll results show support for Iraq pullout , flag - burning amendment Results for the latest USA TODAY / Gallup Poll are based on telephone interviews with 1,000 national adults , aged 18 or older , conducted June 23 - 25 , 2006 .
The margin of sampling error , with 95 % confidence , is plus or minus 3 percentage points .
For results based on the 484 national adults in the Form A half - sample and 516 national adults in the Form B half - sample , the maximum margins of sampling error are plus or minus 5 percentage points .
POLL : Majority of Americans want out of Iraq Always keep in mind that In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

Mischa Barton lights up Last month , actress Mischa Barton 's younger sister , Hania was admitted to a rehabilitation center to get over her addiction to prescription drugs .
And now , to the dismay of her parents , Mischa is caught up in her own drug controversy .
Pictures of Mischa smoking a joint in her car recently surfaced on the Internet .
A source for Australian tabloid NW said , " This could n't come at a worse time .
Mischa 's family is furious with her tacky timing .
It looks like they are the worst parents in the world and that both their daughters are out of control and strung out on drugs . "
Mischa was likely using marijuana to numb her recent pain .
Last month was difficult for the actress as , in addition to her sister 's admission to rehab , she split with her longtime boyfriend , musician Cisco Adler .
Understandable as her drug use is , Mischa 's parents were disappointed in her decision to smoke in her car .
An insider said , " Mischa 's parents can't believe she'd be dumb enough to smoke and drive .
Look at what happened to Nicole Richie .
She 's facing time in jail if convicted for her recent ' drug - driving . ' "

Much of south - east England was braced last night to experience black toxic rain as oily soot from the burning of almost 16 m litres of oil , aircraft fuel and petrol started to fall over the region and the plume of gases reached ground level in some areas .
According to the Meteorological Office , a cold front was expected to stretch across the region , bringing rain and forcing the pollutants from the fires down to ground level .
The intensity of the fires throughout most of yesterday , combined with very light winds and a high pressure system , carried much of the pollution 2,750 metres ( 9,000 ft ) above an area stretching at one point from East Anglia to Salisbury Plain , in Wiltshire .
Health experts warned that the elderly , asthmatics and anyone with respiratory problems should take great care not to inhale the fumes , which they expected to worsen as the fires weakened and were unable to force the smoke so high .
Professor Warren Lenney , of the British Lung Foundation , said the consequences of inhaling soot particles from the acidic thick black smoke could be " unpleasant " .
" The trouble is there are all sorts of different chemicals in the smoke .
Petroleum products are known to produce a whole series of nasty acidic chemicals , as well as carbon monoxide . "
Prof Lenney , consultant paediatrician at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire , said side - effects could include coughing , difficulty breathing and a lack of concentration as oxygen levels in the brain dropped .
A police spokesman said : " We are advising people to close their windows and doors and to go immediately to a doctor if they breathe in the fumes . "
The potential effect of the explosion was being assessed by the Environment Agency last night .
The agency said the main areas of concern were the potential for water pollution and damage to land quality .
A spokesman said that would only occur if any of the substances , including kerosene , diesel , gas oil and gasoline , were to escape from the site .
Colin Chiverton , of the agency , said : " At the moment we are closely monitoring the situation for any potential environmental impact and will continue to do so . "
A spokeswoman for Total UK , the British arm of the US oil company which half owns 60 % of the site , said petrol and kerosene , as well as some diesel and crude oil were held there , but she did not know exactly what had caught fire .
" We understand air samples have been taken and they show the toxicity to be low , " she said .
Staff at Hemel Hempstead general hospital said extra beds and intensive care facilities had been set aside for anyone suffering smoke - related complications .
Dr Ivan Vince , a health , safety and environmental specialist for ASK Consultants , said he believed the smoke plume was not so dangerous at present because it was being lifted high above the ground and would be greatly diluted before it returned to ground level .
But he warned : " When the fire is dying , the smoke is less buoyant and so can cause a local hazard . "

Iraq 's oil is one of its most important resources
Midway Trading was accused of paying $ 400,000 in bribes to Iraqi officials for oil purchases under the UN scheme .
The scheme was devised to let Saddam Hussein sell oil and buy humanitarian goods while sanctions were in force .
But the Iraqi government , politicians and some UN officials are said to have illegally profited from the programme .
The UN's $ 64bn oil - for - food programme ran from 1996 until the US - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
Midway Trading - based in Reston , Virginia - agreed to pay the fine in a plea deal with Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau , who leads one of several investigations into corruption in the programme .

Reporter , BBC Click
Cities may cram people together like sardines in a supermarket , but many of those living an urban life can end up feeling more lonely than on a picnic on Pluto .
But one French networking website is trying to change all that .
Parisians are using the web to meet their neighbours
Just as most Parisians are too cool to visit the Eiffel Tower , most of us ignore the possibilities for friendships immediately outside our front door .
French social networking website Peuplade aims to bridge that small but often insurmountable gap by putting neighbours in touch with each other .
It also wants you to meet people different from your usual crowd .
" In life today we get to meet people in a very specific situation and social background .
You meet people from your school , from your family or from your work , " said Jérémie Chouraqui , a lawyer and one of the founders of Peuplade .
" With Peuplade you will meet people that you will usually not get to meet in cities : people with different ages and social backgrounds , but they all live in the same neighbourhood . "
The site is effectively a neighbourhood notice - board which started life in Paris 's 17th arrondisement and is now spreading to the rest of the city .
It carries a variety of information on upcoming events , but visitors can also make contact and meet up with people who live within a two - minute walk .
Social experiment
Peuplade aims to change the way we make friends and the sort of people we make friends with - when you sign up you leave your prejudices at the door .
The idea from the start was to create links between people who should n't really meet , who do n't really have an affinity , who are n't part of the same group or network
Nathan Stern , Peuplade
" We have a profile page in which we ask you a series of questions .
We do n't ask your age , sex or job because that can lead to discrimination .
We encourage you to leave a photo or image that moves you , rather than a photo of yourself , " said Stephane Legouffe , a sociologist and one of the co-ordinators of the site .
Log on and enter your details , scan your neighbourhood and there you go : someone to hook up with .
But it is not all one - on - one .
Regular small meetings , called Apero de quartier , give the denizens of the cyber world a chance to gather at a neighbourhood watering hole .
Peuplade was born out of a sociological experiment which aimed to turn on its head the way we meet .
Founder Nathan Stern said : " The idea from the start was to create links between people who should n't really meet , who do n't really have an affinity , who are n't part of the same group or network .
" How do we do that ?
We go beyond group status and membership and create accidents , chaos .
And when you come to these Apero de quartier for a while you develop a familiarity among people who you previously not think of belonging to your world . "
Rules of engagement
Apparently there is a science to this sort of social engineering .
One rule is that breaking the ice is often easier on the net .
Another is if you are hosting a party of people who have never met , choose a tiny venue .
It seems elbow - to - elbow people are forced to get along .
As a spoon to stir the melting pot Peuplade is admirable , but it has not really caught on in Paris 's really rich neighbourhoods , and the Apero de quartier visited by Click was mighty white .
But who said this novel website and pillar of the community has to cure all of society 's ills in one night ?

Google 's commitment to " green " means that the company sources carpet and sofas made without PVC , paints without volatile organic compounds , and cafeteria food from local growers .
It 's not surprising , then , that they would roll out the largest commercial solar deployment in the US — a 1.6MW installation that covers most of the buildings at Google 's campus and extends even to shaded parking spaces .
At the ETech conference in San Diego this week , Google 's Anthony Ravitz explained how Google did it , and why .
The move to solar made sense for Google , and not just " hippie Gaia - loving " sense .
Ravitz said that Google will earn its investment back in 7.5 years , after which it will continue to enjoy inexpensive power for decades .
With the company sprawled across a large campus of many low buildings , roof space was easily available .
Solar also has the unique property of pumping out more energy when power is the most expensive — peak afternoon hours .
When air conditioners across California kick into action on sunny days , Google generates the most power .
It 's still an expensive tech to install ( though prices are dropping ) .
Ravitz would n't give an exact figure for the project , but did say that it was only doable thanks to subsidies from local utility PG&E and a generous federal tax credit .
9,212 Sharp photovoltaic modules now cover the rooftops of the Googleplex , each one capable of pumping out 208W of DC power in full sun .
To gain even more solar surface area , Google installed solar panels as " shades " over several of its parking lots , keeping cars cool and generating power at the same time .
The installation can generate 30 percent of Google 's peak demand power , or enough to light about 1,000 California homes .
The solar modules are wired in series , 14 to each circuit , and their output is sent to 10 SatCon inverters .
The inverters transform the DC power to utility - grade AC , and are 96 percent efficient at installation ( efficiency drops each year that they are in operation ) .
The inverters are then tied into Google 's own power systems and the general electrical grid .
The system is set up for " net metering , " which means that any excess power generated by the panels is pumped back into the state grid and Google receives a credit for that power .
It 's a textbook example of the convergence of business and environmental concerns , and Ravitz hopes that Google 's example will inspire other firms to explore alternative energy sources .
It seems to have helped : an even bigger 1.9MW installation is going in just down the road .

末尾の付録に、 「水からの伝言」関係の簡単なリンク集があります。
というくだりは、 「病は気から」という諺を徹底的に押し進めたものだが、単純な説明の好例だろう。
そして、きわめつけだと思ったのは、私たちの魂の起源という、ある意味で究極の宗教的・哲学的難問への実に「シンプルな」答えだ。
私は、多くの人の健康相談にかかわってきた経験から、病気とはネガティブな感情によって引き起こされるものなのだと思い知らされました。原因となっている感情を消せれば、だれもが健康を取り戻すことができるのです。それには、努めてポジティブな感情をもつようにすることが大切です。（p.116）
という説明がある。これは、もはや科学としての誤りを批判するといったレベルの文章ではないと思うのだが、いずれにせよ、私たちの感情を元素という基本的な素材に還元してしまうという発想は究極の「 即物的 なわかりやすい説明」だろう。いうまでもなく、感情というのは、私たちの脳（ひょっとすると、脳と体）が複雑な過程の末につくりだす何物かであって、決して、元素に対応するようなものではないというのが、多くの人の考えである。ちなみに、 バクテリア から人間にいたるまで、すべての生物の体の質量の約 98 パーセントは、炭素、水素、窒素、酸素、リン、イオウというたった六つの元素からなっているそうだ。残りの部分の元素の豊富さが生物の種類によってどれほど異なっているのかは知らないが、少なくとも感情の有無とは関係がないと信じている。 また
高等生物になればなるほど、体内にある元素の数はふえていきます。植物がもつ元素の数は、人間にくらべて極端に少なくなります。元素が少ないとどうなるのでしょうか。おそらく、感情がそれだけ少なくなってしまうのではないかと思います。痛いという感覚は他の動物にもあるでしょうが、悲しいとか感動したといった高度な感情は、人間とそれに近い動物しかもちえないのではないでしょうか。（p.106）
といった美しい「教え」がくり返される。しかし、その「愛と感謝」の実践については、「あなたが水を前にして、それに愛をこめ、感謝の言葉を投げかけるとき（p.142）」といった、どちらかというと「人間味」のない記述しかみられない。「愛と感謝」を大切にして生きていきましょうという提案はすてきだと思うが、そういう美しいお題目を、現実の人生にどうやって活かしていけばよいのかはまったく当たり前ではない。というより、古来から、多くの宗教の実践者が、宗教の理想と複雑で泥臭い現実との折り合いをどうやってつけていくかについて、苦しみ、模索をつづけてきたのではなかったのか？
愛と感謝を実践しながら貧しくも清く生きてきた民の土地に、強い軍国が攻め込んで支配と搾取をはじめたとき、愛と感謝の民はいったいどうすればいいのか？
あるいは、テレビの人生相談にでてくるような、誰が悪くて誰が正しいのかわからないような、ぐちゃぐちゃの人間模様に出会ったとき、どうやって愛と感謝を貫き、生きる道を決めていくのか？
本書には、そういう「泥臭い」人間の話はまったくといっていいほど登場しないのだ。おそらくは、そういう具体的なテーマについて話しはじめれば、いくらじょうずに話をすすめても、少なからぬ読者が「いや、世の中、それほど簡単じゃないでしょ」といった感想を持つようにになるのだろう。水を前にして愛と感謝を抱けば世界が変わっていくというシンプルな物の言い方は、読者に深い疑問を抱かせず、「わかりやすい」と思わせるのかも知れない。しかし、それで本当に人生や世界についての何かが「わかった」ことになるのだろうか？
単純で 即物的 で、いっけ ん
「わかりやすい」説明は、これ以外にも、本書にたくさん登場する。たとえば、人間とそれ以外の生き物（みんな水が主成分だと思うが）の違いについては、
というのが、本書を貫く一つの流れなのである。本書が大いにもてはやされているという事実は、悲しいかな、こういった議論を「わかりやすい」と感じる読者が多いことを意味しているのだろう。しかし、「シンプルな答えがある、それは主成分が水であることだ」という主張を、自分の人生と生活に即してほんとうに理解しなっとくするのは、とてつもなく難しいことなのではないのだろうか？ この「わかりやすさ」は、単に、見た目と聴き心地の「わかりやすさ」であって、本当に深い何かが「腑に落ちる」という真の「わかりやすさ」ではないはずだ。 実際、本書では
と問題提起をする。 しかし、人類が長い歴史の中で失敗をくり返しながら学んできたのは、すべてを解決する魔法の一言などは存在せず、われわれが世界をよりよくしていくためには、試行錯誤しながら（時には絶望しながらも）ひたすら地道な努力を続けていく以外にはないということだったと私などは信じている。江本氏も当然そういう話をつづけるのかと思ったのだが、それはあっさり裏切られた。
だれもが、このアリ地獄のような世界の中で、救いを求めています。だれもが答えを求めているのです。その一言で世界が救われるような、シンプルで決定的な答えを、さがしつづけているのです。（p.11 ）
水の結晶につい て
つづいて、小学校の授業でも取り上げられることになった水の結晶にかかわる部分をみることにしよう。
水の結晶写真を撮るために私が行っている具体的方法はこうです。
水を一種類ずつ五十個のシャーレに落とします（最初の数年間は百のシャーレでした）。これをマイナス二〇℃以下の冷凍庫で三時間ほど凍らせます。そうすると、表面張力によって丸く盛り上がった氷の粒がシャーレの上にできあがります。直径が一ミリほどの小さな粒です。これを一つずつ、氷の盛り上がった突起の部分に光をあてて顕微鏡でのぞくと、結晶があらわれるのです。
もちろん、五十個全部に同じような結晶があらわれるわけではありません。まったく結晶をつくらないものもあります。これらの結晶の形を統計にとり、グラフにしてみると、明らかに似た結晶があらわれる水と、まったく結晶ができない水、あるいは、くずれた結晶しかできない水など、それぞれの水のもつ性質がわかるのです。（p.21）
実験の詳細はわからないし、「統計にとり、グラフにしてみる」というのがどいういことかも、この記述からはわからない。もちろん、彼らは科学の論文を書いているわけではないし、理科の教材を作っているわけでもないから、厳密に科学的な実験をしてそれをきちんと記述しろなどと要求するつもりはない。
いずれにせよ、上の記述だけからでもうかがえるのは、これが、きわめてデリケートで再現性の低い実験だということだ。つまり、たとえ同じ条件（のつもり）で同じことをくり返したとしても、（湿度、温度、光の当たり方などなどの）ごく微妙な条件の違いのために実に様々な結果（つまり、結晶の形）が現れると考えられる。また、結晶の寿命は短いらしいので、それを人が顕微鏡でみつけて写真を撮るとなると、どういう写真が撮れるかは撮影する人の腕や心持ちにも大いに依存する可能性がある。
ともかく、彼らは、こうして水の結晶の写真を撮り、都市の水道水は結晶をつくらず自然水は美しい結晶を作るという結論を出したと主張する（この結果にも、私は不信感をもっている）。つづいて、水に音楽を聴かせて（本当に、スピーカーから聴かせるらしい）そのあとに作られる結晶をみるという実験の話になり、美しいクラシック音楽を聴かせた水は美しい結晶をつくり、ヘビーメタルの曲を聴かせた水はばらばらに壊れた結晶しか作らなかったと結論する（私はこの結論は信じない）。そして、きわめつけの、言葉を書いた紙を（ちゃんと水に見える向きにして）水を入れたガラス瓶に貼り付けておき、その後で水の結晶をみるという実験に話がうつる。
前にも書いたように、今日の科学の知識と照らし合わせたとき、このような結果があり得ないことは断言できる。もともと実験がデリケートで結果にばらつきが大きいところに、実験をする人・データを整理する人の思いや希望などによるバイアスが自然にはいって、このような結論が浮かび上がってきてしまったと考えるべきだろう。別に意図的な捏造をしているといっているわけではない。捏造をする気がなくても、ある種の結論を期待していると、ついつい、それに一致する現象を余分に重みをつけてみつけてしまうのが、人間の性（さが）なのだ*3。
このように書くと、 「しかし、科学は万能ではなく、科学によって理解できないこともあるはずだ」とか、「『水の結晶が言葉によって形を変える』というのは新しい現象であって、これはまだ科学で解明されていないことなのだ」といった反論をする人がでてくるかもしれない。それらの疑問にまじめに答えておこう。
まず、 「科学は万能ではない」というのは、まさに、そのとおり。科学というのは、簡単に言えば、この世界を少しでもきちんと理解しようと、できる範囲内であらゆる努力をして、少しずつでもわれわれの知識と理解を深めていこうという営みのことだ。幸いにも、この世界はそう簡単に理解できるものではなかったので、未だにわからないことが山積みで、私たち科学者が人生をかけて挑戦する余地がたくさん残っている。「科学によって理解できないこともある」どころか、われわれのまわりは「科学で理解できないことばかり」と言っていいくらいだ。
そうは言っても、科学によってほぼ確実に理解できていることもある。たとえば、地球がおおよそ球形をした物質のかたまりであること、太陽は大きな光り輝く星であり、地球などの惑星は大ざっぱには太陽のまわりを楕円軌道を描いてまわっていること、などは、膨大な観察・実験・考察によって、ほとんど疑う余地がなく確立されている。もちろん、この世の中には絶対ということはない。たとえば、大地は亀の背中に乗っている丸い板で、太陽は空のレールを走っていく火の玉であり、宇宙船から地球をみた映像はみんな
CG のインチキ、地球を一周して飛行機が飛べるというのも航空会社の詐欺・・・といった可能性が本当にゼロだと言い切ることは誰にもできない。しかし、そんな可能性が猛烈に低いことは誰が考えても確実だろう。
それとほとんど同じことで、科学の中のきわめて確実な部分を総合して考えれば、「水の結晶が言葉によって形を変える」可能性が猛烈に低いと結論するしかないのである。結晶の形成は純粋に物理的なプロセスであり、そこに「言葉」が入り込む余地はない。これは単に科学者の信念や信仰ではない。人類の歴史をとおして蓄積されてきた膨大な経験事実にもとづく、どうしようもない事実なのだ。科学（の確実なところ）というのは、単なるバラバラのお話の集まりではなく、異なった部分どうしが互いに矛盾なく深く関係し合い補強し合っている実にしっかしりた建造物なのである。その一部分だけを、都合に応じて気楽に入れ替えたり修正したりということは、易々とはできないようになっているのだ（実際の自然がそうなっていたことの反映だと考えられる）。もし「水の結晶が言葉によって形を変える」ということを科学に取り込まなくてはならないとすると、自然科学の根幹にまでおよぶ全面的な大手術が必要になるだろう。もちろん、「水の結晶が言葉によって形を変える」ことが真実だという十分な証拠が本当に得られるというようなことになれば、われわれ科学者は、（おそらくは大喜びで）科学の大変革に取り組むだろうと思う。しかし、そういうことがおきる可能性は、「亀の背中説」が復活するのと同程度にあり得ないことなのだ。
ここから先、さまざまな言葉をみせた水の結晶についての説明と、たくさんのカラー写真が並ぶのだが、それらをいちいち説明するのはやめておく（IHM
のこちらのページでいくつかの例をみることができる）。それよりも、江本氏によるこの現象の説明をみておこう。
では、言葉を紙に書いて水に見せても結晶が変化するというのは、どのように解釈したらよいのでしょうか。書かれた文字自体にその形が発する固有の振動があり、水は文字のもっている固有の振動を感じることができると考えられます。
水はこの世界にあるすべての振動を忠実に写しとって、私たちに目に見える形に変えてくれます。水に文字を見せると、水はそれを振動ととらえ、そのイメージを具体的に表現するのです。文字というのは、言葉を視覚的に表現する発音記号のようなものだと考えられます。（p.73 ）
「 発音記号って文字の一種なのでは？」というツッコミはともかく、ここに示された世界観には唖然とさせられた。紙の上のインクの濃淡のパターンでしかない文字列が、それを日本語（ないしは他の人間の言語）に従って解釈したときにもつ意味に相当する「波動」を発している。そして、その「波動」が、水に影響を与えて、文字列の意味と相関するような形の結晶をつくらせる、というのだ。
これは、もはや、科学的とかそういうレベルの話ではない。言葉が摩訶不思議な力をもち、ふわふわした神秘の存在が世界を動かしている、ファンタジーの世界だ。くり返すが、科学は気ままですてきなお話の集まりではない。こういう物語が科学的な世界の見方と共存できる可能性は完全にゼロだと言い切っていいだろう。本書のこの部分を読んだ上でも、「水からの伝言」を小学校の教材に使おうと考える人がどれくらいいるのだろう？
さすがにそんな人はいないと考えたいのだが。
水の起源についての説に関しても、江本氏はファンタジーをふくらませる。まず、地球の水は宇宙空間から彗星によって供給されているという説（これは別にオカルト説ではないが、それほど信憑性は高くないようだ）を彼なりに紹介したあと、こうつづける。
水なしで生命が誕生しないのは、周知の事実です。生命の源である水が宇宙から届けられたということになると、私たち人間を含む生命は、みな地球外生命だということになってしまいます。（p.91）
たとえ水が惑星誕生の後に外からもたらされたものだとして、生命はあくまで地球で発生・進化した（そのことは江本氏も認めているようだ）のだから何故「地球外生命」ということになるのだろう？
そもそも、地球を構成するすべての物質は、もともとは初期宇宙で合成されたもののはず。水の起源などという以前に、地球をつくっているすべての物質は宇宙から届けられたといっていいはずだ。
そんなことを思いながら続く段落を読むと、驚きが待っていた。
しかし、水が地球外からやってきたという説をとるなら、水のもつ数々の不思議な性質というものも理解できるのです。
なぜ氷が水に浮かぶのか、なぜ水がこれほどまでに物質を溶かしやすいのか、あるいは、タオルのすそを水に入れておくと、重力にさからって吸い上がってくるのはなぜか。こういった水の不可解なふるまいは、水がそもそも地球の物質ではないという観点から解釈すると、すんなり納得できるのです。（p.91--92）
氷が水に浮くように、ある物質の固体が液体に浮かぶというのは、実はそれほど珍しい話ではない。たとえばコンピューターの頭脳を支える物質であるシリコンの場合も、シリコン固体がシリコン融液に浮かぶことが知られている*4。タオルを水がのぼっていく毛細管現象は、多くの液体でみられるはずだ。だから、これらの性質はとくに「不可解」ではないのだ。しかし、この文章が驚きなのは、そういう理由からではない。
仮に水が 「不可解」な性質をもっているのだとして、江本氏は、水の起源が宇宙にあると思いさえすれば、その不可解さが納得できると言っているのだ。ここまで来て、ようやく、彼が水の宇宙起源説にやたらと肩入れする理由がわかってきた気がする。おそらく、彼は、地上の物質と天上の物質とでは、その素性も性質も本質的に異なっているという世界観をもっているのだ！
言うまでもないだろうが、今日の自然科学では、地球は宇宙のなかの特別な場所ではなく、地上の物質も宇宙の物質も、同じ原子から作られ、同じ物理法則に従うという立場をとる（これも、絶対とはいえないわけだが、さまざまな証拠に支えられたきわめて確実に近い仮説だ）。もちろん、天上と地上を質の違う世界だとするファンタジーを思い描くことは自由だ。でも、それは、もはや科学と接点を求めるとか、いずれ科学的に証明されるかも知れないといった話の登場する余地のない、正真正銘のファンタジーに過ぎないのだ。
ついでにコメントしておけば、「不可思議なのは宇宙から来たからだ」というのも、江本流のいっけん「わかりやすい」（けれど、よく考えるとあまりよくわからない）シンプルな説明のよい例だろう。

魂はどこから来たのでしょう。宇宙の果てから水にのってやってきたことは、いままでみてきたとおりです。（p.204）
という部分も、神秘なものは宇宙から来たというシンプルな世界観にもとづいて読んでこそ意味があるのだろう。
A CARTOONIST tells it best .
An elephant lies snoozing .
Sensing the time is right , a crowd of Democratic mice surround it and move in for the kill .
“ What 's the plan ? ” asks one .
“ Plan ? ” asks another .
“ Maybe we should have a meeting , ” says a third .
“ What if we win ? ” frets a fourth .
The Republicans are so unpopular that any semi-competent opposition party should be sauntering to victory in the mid-term elections in November .
Only 36 % of Americans think George Bush is doing a good job as president .
Even Republican states are lukewarm : his approval rating is above 50 % only in Idaho , Nebraska , Utah and Wyoming .
And Americans like the Republican - led Congress even less : a paltry 23 % of them approve of its performance .
With America mired in Iraq and the Republicans mired in scandal , the Democrats have plenty of large , slow - moving targets to aim at .
When they accuse Mr Bush of valuing loyalty above competence , he obligingly refuses to sack Donald Rumsfeld , the bungler - in - chief in Iraq .
When they decry the ruling party 's “ culture of corruption ” , people think of Randy “ Duke ” Cunningham , a bribe - trousering ex-congressman whose marble - topped commode was among many ill - gotten items the FBI auctioned last month .
Yet Pat Oliphant , the cartoonist who drew the muddled mice , is not the only one to doubt the potency of the Democrats .
“ For the Americans in the middle , who have no strong partisan allegiances , we have failed to articulate a real plan or vision , ” say Markos Moulitsas Zúniga and Jerome Armstrong , two of the most popular Democratic bloggers .
“ It 's not that people know what we stand for and disagree ; it 's that they have no idea what we stand for , ” say James Carville and Paul Begala , two of the architects of Bill Clinton 's winning presidential campaign in 1992 .
The junior senator from Illinois , Barack Obama , one of the Democrats ' most admired politicians , has tried to make a joke of it .
“ You hear this constant refrain from our critics that Democrats do n't stand for anything , ” he remarked the other day .
“ That 's really unfair .
We do stand for anything . ”
In fact , both parties are a tangle of contradictions .
But whereas the Republicans have one clear leader — the president — the Democrats do not .
Should voters pay more attention to Nancy Pelosi , their leader in the House of Representatives , Harry Reid , the top Democrat in the Senate , or one of the scrum of Democratic presidential hopefuls ?
And since the Democrats control no branch of the federal government , their national record of late is one of speeches and protest votes , rather than actions whose merits can be judged .
All this makes it hard to predict what might happen were they to win back one or both houses of Congress in November .
A Democratic takeover is far from assured .
Granted , they have a double - digit lead in the polls .
In a survey by AP - Ipsos this month , 49 % of respondents said they would rather the Democrats ran Congress , whereas only 33 % preferred the Republicans .
But polls are unreliable .
Not everyone who grumbles about Mr Bush will vote : turnout in mid-term elections is typically not much more than a third .
And other obstacles must be overcome .
In the House , all 435 seats are up for election , but incumbents seldom lose these days .
Southern seats — those in the 11 states of the old Confederacy — became more competitive in the 1980s , but have since joined the trend elsewhere ( see charts ) .
Nowadays , no matter where they are , over 90 % of those who run tend to be re-elected ( 98 % in 2004 ) , thanks to gerrymandering and the ease with which those in power can raise money .
The Senate is unsullied by gerrymandering , since state borders cannot be redrawn .
But only a third of the Senate 's seats are up for election , and sitting senators are even better at raising money than incumbents in the House .
In the current campaign , the Republicans have so far raised $ 321 m and the Democrats $ 226 m .
The Democrats need to win 15 extra seats to capture the House and six to take the Senate .
The last time such a revolution hit Capitol Hill was in 1994 , when the Republicans seized both Houses .
That victory came partly because voters were fed up with a Democratic Party that had grown complacent after too long in office , much like today 's Republicans .
But it was also because Newt Gingrich and his cohorts offered a clear platform : the tax - slashing , government - shrinking “ Contract with America ” .
The Democrats have no manifesto to compare with this , but they have been trying , in recent weeks , to give voters some idea of where they stand .
The Mommy party girds for battle
Their weakest issue has long been national security .
On Iraq , the Democrats are tarred by association with the loopier critics of the war in Iraq , and by outbursts of defeatism among their own leaders .
Howard Dean , the party chairman , said last year that the “ idea that we 're going to win the war in Iraq is an idea which is just plain wrong . ”
As for the broader fight against terrorism , Democrats often sound as though they do not take it as seriously as other Americans .
Moreover , Democratic activists are obsessed with the idea of impeaching Mr Bush .
His alleged offence is to have ordered warrantless wiretaps to catch terrorists when , many lawyers argue , warrants were required .
The party leaders do not want to make this a campaign issue , because Republicans would then say Democrats cared more about terrorists ' privacy than American lives .
To combat the charge that they have a “ pre-9/11 world view ” , Democratic leaders have done their best to recruit ex-servicemen to run for the party .
And last month the top two Democrats in Congress , Mr Reid and Ms Pelosi , surrounded themselves with fire - fighters , police and veterans to unveil a strategy for “ Real Security ” .
This document would be more convincing as a call to arms if it did not read like a string of phrases chosen for their popularity with focus - groups and then crammed into one sentence after another .
For example : “ To Ensure Unparalleled Military Strength and Honour our Troops , we will rebuild a state - of - the - art military by making the needed investments in equipment and manpower so that we can project power to protect America wherever and whenever necessary . ”
Churchillian it may not be , but most of “ Real Security ” is sensible .
The trouble is that its main hard proposals — kill Osama bin Laden , train more special forces , reduce dependence on Middle Eastern oil and make 2006 “ a year of significant transition to full Iraqi sovereignty ” — sound awfully similar to Mr Bush 's plans .
Where the details differ , the Democrats ' suggestions are sometimes footling ( create “ a national tyre fuel - efficiency programme ” ) or daft ( criminal penalties for energy companies that “ price - gouge ” ) .
One throwaway commitment casually promises to reshape the world : the Democrats would “ [ e ] liminate terrorist breeding - grounds by combating the economic , social and political conditions that allow extremism to thrive . ”
To be fair , it is difficult to produce a national - security platform that amounts to much in a year when the presidency is not being contested .
Even if the Democrats win both houses of Congress , Mr Bush will remain commander - in - chief .
In the end , the national - security debate boils down to this .
Voters doubt that the Democrats take terrorism as seriously as the Republicans do , but they also doubt that the Democrats could be as incompetent in fighting it .
One recent poll showed that the Republicans ' long - standing advantage as the party people trust to protect America had dwindled to nothing .
That should scare the party of Dwight Eisenhower , Ronald Reagan and George Bush senior .
On most other issues , people tell pollsters that they prefer the Democrats .
On the economy , there are some good reasons to do so — though tempered by doubts .
America 's most urgent macroeconomic ill is the federal government 's budget .
Under Mr Bush , this has slithered from showing a surplus of $ 236 billion in 2000 to running a deficit of $ 318 billion in 2005 .
That would be worrying enough in normal circumstances , but with the baby - boom generation about to retire and start claiming Social Security ( government pensions ) and Medicare ( government health care for the elderly ) , it heralds catastrophe .
The Democrats are trying hard to sound fierce about the deficit .
Hillary Clinton , their most prominent presidential aspirant , declared recently that “ red-ink fiscal policies will undermine America 's competitiveness ” .
The party promises to restore the “ pay - as - you - go ” principle that was scrapped in 2002 .
In other words , all new tax cuts or spending would have to be balanced by new savings .
But do the Democrats propose any specific tax increases or spending cuts that might actually bridge the deficit ?
Apart from promising to repeal Mr Bush 's tax cuts for “ the rich ” — whom they take care not to define too clearly — no .
In opposition , anyway , they have clamoured above all for more spending .
All cheques , no balances
The two strongest reasons for thinking that voting Democratic might improve fiscal discipline have nothing to do with the Democrats ' campaign promises .
One is that the Republicans have been so profligate .
The other is that divided government would give both parties a scapegoat .
If Mr Bush had to share power , he could blame the Democrats for everything that hurt his supporters , and they could blame him for everything that hurt theirs .
That way , something might be done .
But in truth , neither party has a serious plan for grappling with the long - term shortfall that will be caused by the baby - boomers ' retirement .
Economists close to the Democratic Party understand the problem .
In a recent paper for the Brookings Institution , a Washington think - tank , Alan Auerbach , William Gale and Peter Orszag predict that the boomers ' demand for doctors , drugs and pensions will help inflate the federal budget deficit to a crippling 10.8 % of GDP .
But , they sigh , “ Dealing with these imbalances will require spending cuts or tax increases that are far beyond the scale of anything currently considered politically palatable . ”
One topic on which the Democrats are plainly less liberal than the Republicans is trade .
Bill Clinton may have had the courage to push through the North American Free - Trade Agreement in 1993 , but his party is now increasingly protectionist .
Mrs Clinton describes herself as “ a very staunch supporter ” of trade agreements , but voted against the Central American Free - Trade Agreement last year , and also against granting the president clear authority to negotiate such deals .
Only 25 % of Senate Democrats backed the Central American one , and only 15 out of 202 Democrats in the House .
Party leaders deny that they are protectionist .
They prefer to say they support “ fair trade ” .
That is , they want to impose rich - world labour standards on countries whose competitive advantage is low labour costs .
This is old - fashioned protectionism masquerading as compassion .
If “ fair trade ” became American policy , the results would be higher prices for American consumers and higher unemployment in the rest of the world .
Some Democrats argue that if support for globalisation is to be maintained , more must be done to ease the plight of those who are hurt by it .
Fair enough , but they would sound more convincing on this if they did not also shamelessly scaremonger about China , outsourcing abroad and the prospect of Arabs running American ports .
A Democrat - controlled Congress would pose a grave threat to the further liberalisation of world trade — and so to world prosperity — unless power prompted the party to become more responsible .
Issue by issue
On microeconomic issues , the Democrats offer a grab - bag of policies .
They want to raise the minimum wage .
They would extend Medicaid ( health insurance for the poor ) to include more , slightly - better - off people .
They would offer a tax credit to help small firms and the self - employed with their health costs .
They would let all 55 - 65 - year - olds buy their health insurance from Medicare .
They would subsidise saving for retirement by up to $ 1,000 a person for 100 m less - well - off Americans .
Taken as a whole , the party 's various economic manifestos sound cautious but fairly expensive .
More eye - catching ideas can be found among the party 's independent advisers .
The Hamilton Project , for example , has a new idea for schools .
Since studies suggest that the current system of teacher certification is worse than useless ( it puts off clever would - be teachers ) , the Hamiltonians propose that schools should ignore it and simply hire teachers with good academic qualifications , whose teaching ability would then be assessed after two years .
This has worked in Los Angeles .
The teachers ' unions would surely oppose it .
By embracing it , the Democrats would show they can stand up to one of their own interest - groups .
In “ Crashing the Gate ” , Mr Armstrong and Mr Moulitsas complain that
single - issue groups not only hurt the Democratic Party in its search for a common identity , but they help provide the Republicans with a treasure trove of attack opportunities .
While the Democratic Party should be the party of people , it has become , with a lot of help from Republican framing , a party of “ immoral ” abortionists , “ extremist ” tree - huggers , “ corrupt ” labour officials , “ greedy ” trial lawyers , “ predatory ” homosexuals and “ anti- white ” minority activists .
After all , these are the loudest and most influential voices in our party ... so it 's not a stretch for demagogic Republicans to paint Democrats as a loose collection of selfish people who are fanatical about their specific cause and have no larger concerns — for the economy , the military , or the country .
This is a shrewd analysis .
The Republicans have a crackpot fringe , too , but the Democratic Party often sounds as though it consists of little else .
Democrats seeking public office are besieged by single - issue groups urging them to adopt policies that most Americans disagree with , such as support for racial quotas and unrestricted late - term abortion .
Some Democratic politicians simply say no .
Brian Schweitzer won the governorship of Montana in part because he binned all the questionnaires that single - issue groups sent him to complete .
All but one — the form from the National Rifle Association .
“ You 've got to fill that one out , ” he told Mr Armstrong and Mr Moulitsas .
“ In order to get an ‘ A - plus ' , you 've got to shoot somebody . ”
Mr Schweitzer is an exception , however .
Many more Democratic politicians have , over the past 30 years , tried to duck controversial moral issues by leaving them to the courts .
Judges have stepped into the legislative vacuum , often infuriating conservatives and making Democrats sound ridiculous .
In January , for example , during the confirmation hearings for Samuel Alito , Mr Bush 's latest choice for the Supreme Court , some Democratic senators upbraided the judge for wanting to apply the law , not make it .
Surely it would be better , “ to ensure social progress ” , if judges took “ a more expansive , imaginative view of the constitution ? ” wheedled Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin .
In other words , Mr Kohl , a legislator , wants judges to do his job for him .
This is how abortion was legalised in America , how prayer was barred in schools and how gay marriage came to Massachusetts .
Another group with whom the party has stormy relations is typified by Mr Moulitsas , whose website , DailyKos.com , is the meeting - place for hundreds of thousands of people who hate Mr Bush .
Online activists , or “ netroots ” , as they call themselves , raise lots of money and provide lots of publicity for Democrats .
Since Mr Dean 's bid for the presidential nomination in 2004 , which was buoyed by large numbers of small donations raised online , party elders have paid respectful attention to young lefty bloggers .
Mr Reid , the Senate minority leader , has agreed to speak at the Daily Kos convention in June .
Mark Warner , one of Mrs Clinton 's rivals for the presidential nomination in 2008 , employs Mr Armstrong as an adviser .
The embrace is awkward , though , because the netroots are always goading the party to get as angry as they are .
They tend to favour the most frothingly anti-war , Bush - bashing candidates , who usually lose at the polls .
And they express themselves in terms both crude and petulant .
Four - letter words and wishes for Mr Bush 's slow death are common on left - wing blogs .
Somehow , the Democrats must harness their activists ' rage without themselves sounding unelectably shrill .
And it would help if they offered voters some bold , purposeful reasons to back them .
Their current platform is not , as Newt Gingrich put it , a mere “ Contract with San Francisco and Vermont ” .
But neither is it a compelling vision of America 's future .
That said , it may be enough to win in November .
After looking at the latest opinion surveys , a Republican pollster called Tony Fabrizio said : “ The good news is Democrats do n't have much of a plan .
The bad news is they may not need one . ”

The official Vatican newspaper has published an article praising as " correct " a recent U.S. court decision that intelligent design is not science .
" If the model proposed by Darwin is not considered sufficient , one should search for another , " Fiorenzo Facchini , a professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Bologna , wrote in the Jan. 16 - 17 edition of L'Osservatore Romano , The New York Times reported Thursday .
" But it is not correct from a methodological point of view to stray from the field of science while pretending to do science , " he wrote , calling intelligent design unscientific .
" It only creates confusion between the scientific plane and those that are philosophical or religious . "
Advocates for teaching evolution hailed the article .
" He is emphasizing that there is no need to see a contradiction between Catholic teachings and evolution , " Dr. Francisco Ayala , professor of biology at the University of California - Irvine and a former Dominican priest told the Times .
" Good for him . "
L'Osservatore is the official newspaper of the Vatican and presents the Vatican 's views , the Times noted .
Not all articles represent official church policy , but it would not be expected to present a view that dissents deeply from church policy .

WASHINGTON , March 19 — Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales was “ extremely upset ” that his deputy told Congress last month that a federal prosecutor had been fired for no reason , according to e-mail released Monday by the Justice Department .
Mr. Gonzales believed that the prosecutor , H. E. Cummins III , the United States attorney for Arkansas , was dismissed for performance reasons , the e-mail suggested .
But his deputy , Paul J. McNulty , testified that Mr. Cummins had been replaced to create a vacancy for J. Timothy Griffin , a political ally of the White House political adviser Karl Rove .
The e-mail messages , among more than 3,000 released by the Justice Department , reflect the tensions at the highest levels of the agency as officials tried to contain the political brushfire set off by the dismissals of eight federal prosecutors last year .
Agency officials said the documents showed the dismissals had been over performance , not politics , as critics have charged .
Any picture can speak 1,000 words , but only a select few say something poignant enough to galvanize an entire society .
The following photographs screamed so loudly that the entire world stopped to take notice .
1. The Photograph That Raised the Photojournalistic Stakes :
" Omaha Beach , Normandy , France "
Robert Capa , 1944
" If your pictures are n't good enough , " war photographer Robert Capa used to say , " you are n't close enough . "
Words to die by , yes , but the man knew of what he spoke .
After all , his most memorable shots were taken on the morning of D - Day , June 6 , 1944 , when he landed alongside the first waves of infantry at Omaha Beach .
Caught under heavy fire , Capa dove for what little cover he could find , then shot all the film in his camera , and got out - just barely .
He escaped with his life , but not much else .
Of the four rolls of film Capa took of the horrific D - Day battle , all but 11 exposures were ruined by an overeager lab assistant , who melted the film in his rush to develop it .
( He was trying to meet the deadline for the next issue of Life magazine . )
In an ironic twist , however , that same mistake gave the few surviving exposures their famously surreal look ( " slightly out of focus , " Life incorrectly explained upon printing them ) .
More than 50 years later , director Steven Spielberg would go to great lengths to reproduce the look of that " error " for his harrowing D - Day landing sequence in " Saving Private Ryan , " even stripping the coating from his camera lenses to echo Capa 's notorious shots .
2. The Photograph That Gave a Face to the Great Depression
" Migrant Mother "
Dorothea Lange , 1936
As era-defining photographs go , " Migrant Mother " pretty much takes the cake .
For many , Florence Owens Thompson is the face of the Great Depression , thanks to legendary shutterbug Dorothea Lange .
Lange captured the image while visiting a dusty California pea- pickers ' camp in February 1936 , and in doing so , captured the resilience of a proud nation facing desperate times .
Unbelievably , Thompson 's story is as compelling as her portrait .
Just 32 years old when Lange approached her ( " as if drawn by a magnet , " Lange said ) .
Thompson was a mother of seven who'd lost her husband to tuberculosis .
Stranded at a migratory labor farm in Nipomo , Calif .
her family sustained themselves on birds killed by her kids and vegetables taken from a nearby field - as meager a living as any earned by the other 2,500 workers there .
The photo's impact was staggering .
Reproduced in newspapers everywhere , Thompson 's haunted face triggered an immediate public outcry , quickly prompting politicos from the federal Resettlement Administration to send food and supplies .
Sadly , however , Thompson and her family had already moved on , receiving nary a wedge of government cheese for their high - profile misery .
In fact , no one knew the identity of the photographed woman until Thompson revealed herself years later in a 1976 newspaper article .
3. The Photograph That Brought the Battlefield Home
" Federal Dead on the Field of Battle of First Day , Gettysburg , Pennsylvania "
Mathew Brady , 1863
As one of the world 's first war photographers , Mathew Brady did n't start
out having as action - packed a career as you might think .
A successful daguerreotypist and a distinguished gentleman , Brady was known for his portraits of notable people such as Abraham Lincoln and Robert E. Lee .
In other words , he was hardly a photojournalist in the trenches .
In fact , Brady had everything to lose by making a career move - his money , his business , and quite possibly his life .
Nevertheless , he decided to risk it all and follow the Union Army into battle with his camera , saying , " A spirit in my feet said , ' Go ! ' "
And go he did - at least until he got a good look at the pointy end of a Confederate bayonet .
After narrowly escaping capture at the first Battle of Bull Run , Brady 's chatty feet quieted down a bit , and he began sending assistants in his place .
In the span of only a few years , Brady and his team shot more than 7,000 photographs - an astounding number when you consider that developing a single plate required a horse - drawn - wagon - full of cumbersome equipment and noxious chemicals .
Not exactly what you 'd call " point - and - shoot . "
Tethered as he was to his equine - powered darkroom and with film speeds being much slower then , Brady produced war photos that are understandably light on the action and heavy on the aftermath .
Still , they mark the first time Americans were so immediately confronted with the grim realities of the battlefield .
4. The Photograph That Ended a War But Ruined a Life
" Murder of a Vietcong by Saigon Police Chief "
Eddie Adams , 1968
" Still photographs are the most powerful weapon in the world , " AP photojournalist Eddie Adams once wrote .
A fitting quote for Adams , because his 1968 photograph of an officer shooting a handcuffed prisoner in the head at point - blank range not only earned him a Pulitzer Prize in 1969 , but also went a long way toward souring Americans ' attitudes about the Vietnam War .
For all the image 's political impact , though , the situation was n't as black - and - white as it's rendered .
What Adams ' photograph does n't reveal is that the man being shot was the captain of a Vietcong " revenge squad " that had executed dozens of unarmed civilians earlier the same day .
Regardless , it instantly became an icon of the war 's savagery and made the official pulling the trigger - General Nguyen Ngoc Loan - its iconic villain .
Sadly , the photograph 's legacy would haunt Loan for the rest of his life .
Following the war , he was reviled where ever he went .
After an Australian VA hospital refused to treat him , he was transferred to the United States , where he was met with a massive ( though unsuccessful ) campaign to deport him .
He eventually settled in Virginia and opened a restaurant but was forced to close it down as soon as his past caught up with him .
Vandals scrawled " we know who you are " on his walls , and business dried up .
Adams felt so bad for Loan that he apologized for having taken the photo at all , admitting , " The general killed the Vietcong ; I killed the general with my camera . "
5 . The Photograph That Is n't as Romantic as You Might Think
" V- J Day , Times Square , 1945 " , a.k.a .
" The Kiss "
Alfred Eisenstaedt , 1945
On August 14 , 1945 , the news of Japan 's surrender was announced in the United States , signaling the end of World War II .
Riotous celebrations erupted in the streets , but perhaps none were more relieved than those in uniform .
Although many of them had recently returned from victory in
Europe , they faced the prospect of having to ship out yet again , this time to the bloody Pacific .
Among the overjoyed masses gathered in Times Square that day was one of the most talented photojournalists of the 20th century , a German immigrant named Alfred Eisenstaedt .
While snapping pictures of the celebration , he spotted a sailor " running along the street grabbing any and every girl in sight . "
He later explained that , " whether she was a grandmother , stout , thin , old , did n't make any difference . "
Of course , a photo of the sailor planting a wet one on a senior citizen would n't have made the cover of Life , but when he locked lips with an attractive nurse , the image was circulated in newspapers across the country .
Needless to say , " V - J Day " did n't capture a highly anticipated embrace by long - lost lovers , but it also was n't staged , as many critics have claimed .
In any case , the image remains an enduring symbol of America 's exuberance at the end of a long struggle .
6. The Photograph That Destroyed an Industry
" Hindenburg "
Murray Becker , 1937
Forget the Titanic , the Lusitania , and the comparatively unphotogenic accident at Chernobyl .
Thanks to the power of images , the explosion of the Hindenburg on May 6 , 1937 , claims the dubious honor of being the quintessential disaster of the 20th century .
In the grand scheme of things , however , the Hindenburg was n't all that disastrous .
Of the 97 people aboard , a surprising 62 survived .
( in fact , it was n't even the worst Zeppelin crash of the 20th century .
Just four years earlier , the U.S.S. Akron had crashed into the Atlantic killing more than twice as many people . )
But when calculating the epic status of a catastrophe , terrifying photographs and quotable quotes ( " Oh , the humanity ! " ) far outweigh body counts .
Assembled as part of a massive PR campaign by the Hindenburg 's parent company in Germany , no fewer than 22 photographers , reporters , and newsreel cameramen were on the scene in Lakehurst , N.J. when the airship went down .
Worldwide publicity of the well - documented disaster shattered the public 's faith in Zeppelins , which were , at the time , considered the safest mode of air travel available .
During the 1920s and 1930s , Zeppelins had operated regular flights , totting civilians back and forth between Germany and the Americas .
But all of that stopped in 1937 .
The incident effectively killed the use of dirigibles as a commercially viable mode of passenger transport , ending the golden age of the airship not with a whimper , but with a horrific bang that was photographed and then syndicated around the globe .
7. The Photograph That Saved the Planet
" The Tetons - Snake River "
Ansel Adams , 1942
Some claim photography can be divided into two eras : Before Adams and After Adams .
In Times B.A. , for instance , photography was n't widely considered an art form .
Rather , photographers attempted to make their pictures more " artistic " ( i.e. , more like paintings ) by subjecting their exposures to all sorts of extreme manipulations , from coating their lenses with petroleum jelly to scratching the surfaces of their negatives with needles .
Then came Ansel Adams , helping shutterbugs everywhere get over their collective inferiority complex .
Brashly declaring photography to be " a blazing poetry of the real , " Adams eschewed manipulations , claiming they were simply derivative of other art forms .
Instead , he preached the value of " pure photography . "
In an era when handheld point - and - shoot cameras were quickly becoming the norm , Adams and other landscape photographers clung to their bulky , old - fashioned large - format cameras .
Ultimately , Adams ' pictures turned photography into fine art .
What 's more , they shaped the way Americans thought of their nation 's wilderness and , with that , how to preserve it .
Adams ' passion for the land was n't limited to vistas he framed through the lens .
In 1936 , he accompanied his photos to Washington to lobby for the preservation of the Kings Canyon area in California .
Sure enough , he was successful , and it was declared a national park .
8. The Photograph That Kept Che Alive
" The Corpse of Che Guevara "
Freddy Alborta , 1967
Sociopathic thug ?
Socialist luminary ?
Or as existentialist Jean - Paul Sartre called him , " the most complete human being of our age " ?
Whatever you believe , there 's no denying that Ernesto " Che " Guevara has become the patron saint of revolutionaries .
Undeniably , he is a man of mythical status - a reputation that persists less because of how he lived than because of how he died .
Unenthused by his efforts to incite revolution among the poor and oppressed in Bolivia , the nation 's army ( trained and equipped by the U.S. military and the CIA ) captured and executed Guevara in 1967 .
But before dumping his body in a secret grave , they gathered around for a strategic photo op .
They wanted to prove to the world that Che was dead , in hopes that his political movement would die with him .
in fact , anticipating charges that the photo had been faked , Che 's thoughtful captors amputated his hands and preserved them in formaldehyde .
But by killing the man , Bolivian officials unwittingly birthed his legend .
The photo , which circulated around the world , bore a striking resemblance to Renaissance paintings of Christ taken down from the cross .
Even as
Che 's killers preened and gloated above him ( the officer on the right seems to be inadvertently pointing to a wound on Guevara 's body near where Christ 's final wound was inflicted ) ,
Che 's eerily peaceful face was described as showing forgiveness .
The photo's allegorical significance certainly was n't lost on the revolutionary protesters of the era .
They quickly adopted " Che lives ! " as a slogan and rallying cry .
Thanks to this photograph , " the passion of the Che " ensured that he would live on forever as a martyr for the socialist cause .
9 . The Photograph that Allowed Geniuses to Have a Sense of Humor
" Einstein with his Tongue Out "
Arthur Sasse , 1951
Arthur Sasse / AFP - Getty Images
You may appreciate this memorable portrait as much as the next fellow , but it 's still fair to wonder : " Did it really change history ? "
Rest assured , we think it did .
While Einstein certainly changed history with his contributions to nuclear physics and quantum mechanics , this photo changed the way history looked at Einstein .
By humanizing a man known chiefly for his brilliance , this image is the reason Einstein 's name has become synonymous not only with " genius , " but also with " wacky genius . "
So why the history - making tongue ?
It seems Professor Einstein , hoping to enjoy his 72nd birthday in peace , was stuck on the Princeton campus enduring incessant hounding by the press .
Upon being prodded to smile for the camera for what seemed like the millionth time , he gave photographer Arthur Sasse a good look at his uvula instead .
This being no ordinary tongue , the resulting photo became an instant classic , thus ensuring that the distinguished Novel Prize - winner would be remembered as much for his personality as for his brain .
10 . The Photograph That Made the Surreal Real
" Dalí Atomicus "
Philippe Halsman , 1948
Philippe Halsman / Estate of Philippe Halsman
Philippe Halsman is quite possibly the only photographer to have made a career out of taking portraits of people jumping .
But he claimed the act of leaping revealed his subjects ' true selves , and looking at his most famous jump , " Dalí Atomicus , " it 's pretty hard to disagree .
The photograph is Halsman 's homage both to the new atomic age ( prompted by physicist ' then - recent announcement that all matter hangs in a constant state of suspension ) and to Dalí 's surrealist masterpiece " Leda Atomica " ( seen on the right , behind the cats , and unfinished at the time ) .
It took six hours , 28 jumps , and a roomful of assistants throwing angry cats and buckets of water into the air to get the perfect exposure .
But before settling on the " Atomicus " we know today , Halsman rejected a number of other concepts for the shot .
One was the idea of throwing milk instead of water , but that was abandoned for fear that viewers , fresh from the privations of World War II , would condemn it as a waste of milk .
Another involved exploding a cat in order to capture it " in suspension , " though that arguably would have been a waste of cats .
Halsman 's methods were as unique as they were effective .
His celebrity " jump " portraits appeared on at least seven Life magazine covers and helped usher in a new - and radically more adventurous - era of portrait photography .
11 . The Photograph That Lied
" Loch Ness Monster " a.k.a.
" The Surgeon 's Photo "
Ian Wetherell , 1934
While strange sightings around Scotland 's murky Loch Ness date back to 565 C.E. , it was n't until photography reached the Loch that Nessie Fever really took off .
The now - legendary ( and legendarily blurry ) " surgeon 's photo , " reportedly taken in April of 1934 , fueled decades of frenzied speculation , several costly underwater searches , and a local tourism industry that rakes in several million dollars each year .
But the party almost ended in 1994 , when a report was published saying that model - maker Christian Spurling admitted to faking the photo .
According to Spurling 's statement , his stepfather , Marmaduke Wetherell , worked as a big game hunter and had been hired by London 's Daily Mail to find the beast .
But rather than smoke out the creature , he decided to fake it .
Wetherell , joined by Spurling and his son , Ian , built their own monster to float on the lake 's surface using a toy submarine and some wood putty .
Ian actually took the photo , but to lend more credibility to the story , they convinced an upstanding pillar of the community - surgeon Robert Kenneth Wilson - to claim it as his own .
Just goes to prove the old adage , " The camera never lies . "
People , on the other hand , do .
12 . The Photograph That Almost Wasn't
" Gandhi at his Spinning Wheel "
Margaret Bourke - White , 1946
" Gandhi at his Spinning Wheel , " the defining portrait of one of the 20th century 's most influential figures , almost did n't happen , thanks to the Mahatma 's strict demands .
Granted a rare opportunity to photograph India 's leader ; Life staffer Margaret Bourke - White was all set to shoot when Gandhi 's secretaries stopped her cold :
If she was going to photograph Gandhi at the spinning wheel ( a symbol for India 's struggle for independence ) , she first had to learn to use one herself .
But that was n't all .
The ascetic Mahatma was n't to be spoken to ( it being his day of silence . )
And because he detested bright light , Bourke - White was only allowed to use three flashbulbs .
Having cleared all these hurdles , however , there was still one more - the humid Indian weather , which wreaked havoc on her camera equipment .
When time finally came to shoot , Bourke - White 's first flashbulb failed .
And while the second one worked , she forgot to pull the slide , rendering it blank .
She thought it was all over , but luckily , the third attempt was successful .
In the end , she came away with an image that became Gandhi 's most enduring representation .
it was also among the last portraits of his life ; he was assassinated less than two years later .
13 . The Photograph That Foreshadowed the Future
" Le Violon d'Ingres "
Man Ray , 1924
Before there was photoshop , there was Man Ray .
One of the world 's most original photographers , Ray was tireless experimenter .
In fact , his work was so inventive that he eventually left the camera behind altogether , creating his surreal " Rayographs " entirely in the darkroom .
" Le Violon d'Ingres " is perhaps his best - known photograph , and one of his earliest .
Like many pieces from the Dada movement ( which Ray is credited with bringing to the United States ) , it 's a visual pun .
By drawing f-holes on his model 's back , he points out the similarities between the body of a woman and the body of a violin .
But it 's a literal pun , as well .
Both the model 's dress and pose echo a famous painting by French artist Jean - Auguste - Dominiqe Ingres , whose hobbies were depicting female nudes and playing the violin .
More than just highbrow it , however , Ray 's work was far ahead of its time .
By ridiculing a now - obsolete concept - the photographic image as literal interpretation of reality - his pictures foreshadowed our own digital revolution .

Overcoming Procrastination
Authors · History · Print version
This book is about the problem procrastination or " task aversion " .
Procrastination is a big problem in today 's world .
This book includes a large chapter about how to eliminate procrastination .
Prime minister Helen Clark laid out a ambitious and amazing plan for the future of New Zealand .
In her opening speech to parliament Clark laid out her plan for reduction in emissions , and increased use of renewable energy sources .
“ I believe we can aspire to be carbon neutral in our economy and way of life , ” she said .
In her speech Clark said New Zealand could set an example for the world on climate change as it did in the 1980s with its nuclear - free policies .
“ We have to make a stand for our world , and for our own sake , ” she said . ( via )
This is no doubt an ambitious goal , powering an entire nation with enough renewables to become carbon neutral is going to take a radical shifting of how New Zealand gets power .
The glut of fossil fuels in the worlds energy streams represents a dominate force in the economy and politics .
Removing or even diverting that stream is going to be difficult , but not impossible .
Clark plans on meeting these goals through a variety of methods .
They included replacing 3.4 per cent of its gasoline and diesel sales with biofuels by 2012 .
She promised that the government would lead by example , with six departments committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2012 by reducing their emissions and offsetting them by planting trees . ( via )
With their struggle to meet Kyoto measures it is unclear if New Zealand can achieve these laudable goals , but even if they become less reliant on fossil fuels it will be a good step in the right direction .
What really makes this an interesting announcement is the fact that an elected leader is , leading .
Something we are lacking in America .
Clark ’s has a plan , a vision , and is working to implement it .
What is George W. ’s plan ?
Leaders set the stage for the debate , and in New Zealand the stage is not “ should we go renewable ” , but “ how fast can we go renewable ” .
The tragicomic tale of what happened to my first feature film has been told elsewhere .
Suffice to say , I had turned my back on the film industry and made my next film ( the one you can watch a bit further down on this page ) in my backyard , with $ 300 cash and an old Super 8 mm camera I bought on eBay .

No one was more surprised than me when Spiders on Drugs became a minor hit on the film festival circuit this summer , by which I mean it was seen by tens of people at festivals all over the planet .
But the festival guides usually listed it as a " spoof , " which I thought ruined the joke .
My fantasy had been to rent a slot on local TV at 2 a.m. and run it as a PSA .
I imagined people getting sucked in , and their minds blowing like old nickel fuses .
That 's when I became interested in YouTube .
I made three little films , and they got a few hundred hits each .
My dream was to do one a week for e-zines like , say , The Tyee or Slate.com , something like an editorial cartoon , except on video .
While the Tyee showed a bit of interest but waited around to make up its mind , I ran out of money and had to write more stuff about buildings and food to pay the rent .
But Christmas delayed all the cheques , and by Jan. 2
I still did n't have my rent , for the second month in a row .
Meanwhile I had discovered the greatest thing about YouTube : you can connect with everyone on the planet , because everyone is doing it .
That 's also the biggest problem .
There are 65,000 videos posted a day .
If you go to the videos page and click on " Most Recent , " you 'll see the newest hundred uploads have no hits at all .
That 's the fate that awaits most clips , even many of the good ones .
They disappear into that giant electronic hopper and vanish without trace .
This is somewhat similar to the problem writers encounter when selling a magazine article .
Editors are very busy people , and unsolicited manuscripts tend to pile up on their desks like snow and sit there for a week in what 's called the " slush pile " until they get a chance to slog through them .
Of course , there 's one big difference with YouTube : there 's no one checking the slush pile .
No editor .
No one driving the plane .
The Sorcerer 's Apprentice
How to stand out in all that slush ?
Late last Tuesday night I had an idea .
A simple experiment I could run right from my desktop that very night .
The only problem was , I needed a film to experiment with .
I had uploaded everything I had , and you can't upload the same file twice .
( You get a message that says : UPLOAD FAILED -- DUPLICATE FILE . )
And if I took one of my films down and uploaded it again , I would lose the scant few hundred hits it had taken me six weeks to garner .
I had uploaded Spiders On Drugs too , but it was in the private section of my YouTube home page .
That 's where you can upload stuff you only want to show your friends .
But I could n't post Spiders publicly because Comedy Central had seen it at the Worldwide Short Film Festival in Toronto , and bought a year - long Internet license for their broadband channel , Motherload .
In fact , that was how I survived while making the other three films .
I had hoped its appearance on their massively popular site might send a little traffic down my country lane , but CC had n't even posted it yet , and had n't returned my calls for a month .
I ran my experiment , and within an hour I started getting comments , which on average happens about once per thousand views .
The hit count suddenly went up to 300 .
Wow , I thought , it worked .
What I did n't know then was that it takes hours for the number of hits to refresh .
Hit me !
Then I read an article by Christopher Hitchens , and around 2 a .m. the alarm in my head went off : " Get some shut eye , Struthers !
You have to come up with $ 800 tomorrow ! "
I slept like a log , got up around 10 a.m. , made breakfast and gazed into space for a while , as is my wont .
Then I remembered the experiment .
Shit .
Did I take that posting down ?
I ran to the computer and roused it from its slumber .
Safari . Canada.com .
YouTube .
Home page .
Come on , come on ...loading ...loading ...
20,000 hits .
Oh shit .
My inbox was clogged with messages : " Do you know your spider film is on the top 10 list at *** Del.icio.us.com ?
At ***?*** At Reddit.com ? "
Oh shit .
Oh shit , oh shit , oh SHIT !
I clicked around the Net .
It was everywhere .
Someone had already sold it to Ebaum 's World for $ 500 , where it was the Editor 's Pick .
I sat sucking my teeth and watching the hit count go up 10,000 at a time .
I had no idea what to do .
The phone rang .
I was screening my calls in case it was the rental agency .
But it was Comedy Central .
Attack of the Clones
My parents came over for lunch .
I showed them the total -- 70,000 -- and told them what had happened .
Then I noticed there was a second posting called " Spiders On Drugs . "
It had been uploaded by a guy I 'll call PaddyWagon .
He already had 5,000 hits .
It was a crappy looking bootleg with an " Ebaum 's World " logo emblazoned on the front .
So much for never selling out .
I e-mailed PaddyWagon , explained the situation , and begged him to take his reposting down .
He told me to blow it out my ass .
( I think he 's Irish . )
When I looked at YouTube 's home page I was right at the top .
When I clicked on my own icon there were 10 clones under it , some of them already with hundreds of hits .
Comedy Central called again .
I guess the long months of unreturned e-mails were over .
When I told them what had happened they just laughed .
I felt a great surge of relief .
Then they asked if I could take my posting down .
I said if I did that , the clones would win .
There must be a way to get all that traffic over to the Motherload .
And how come they had n't posted my film there yet ?
They said they 'd check into it .
I said I would ask YouTube to take down everything , with my posting last .
I e-mailed YouTube .
I e-mailed them 20 times .
No reply .
But hey , the kids who started the site are 20 - something and they just got $ 1.5 billion .
I would n't be answering my e-mails either .
And by now I 'd begun to think I wanted to stay with YouTube anyway .
' Little bitch '
All afternoon I screened my calls in case it was the rental agency , or Comedy Central .
I thought :
This is pretty fucked up right here .
I 'm hiding from the network of my dreams .
Five o'clock came and went , Comedy Central shut down for the weekend , and the hits went up to 300,000 .
At midnight I posted a sternly - worded message in PaddyWagon 's comments section .
He blocked me from his comments section and called me a " little bitch , " meanwhile chuckling with the hundreds of people who had left compliments on his page about the brilliant clip he'd found .
I was reminded of the words of Captain James T. Kirk :
" KAAAAAHHHHNNNNN ! "
All weekend long I e-mailed clones '
YouTube home pages , and most of them took their postings down , and some of them said I was full of shit .
What really hurt was the quality of the Ebaum bootleg , and the fact that many of the clones had catchy titles like SPIDERS ON DRUGS ! ( SPOOF ! ) or FUNIEST SHIT I HAF EVER SEIN .
On Saturday I was # 1 top rated , top favourite , most discussed and top director on all of YouTube .
Sunday I came off the " This Week " page and went onto the " This Month " page , which left PaddyWagon with a clear field .
It looked for a while like his posting would eclipse mine .
Monday morning
Six days in , the hit count was up to 750,0000 and I had over a thousand e-mails .
I was shovelling them out like snow when I found one that said :
MTV -- REQUEST -- URGENT !!!
They wanted to show the film later that day on MTV LIVE .
I e-mailed back and asked how much they paid .
They said unfortunately they had no budget to pay for footage , this was more like free exposure .
I wrote back that I was already dying from exposure , but they could show my film for free on one condition : they had to stop playing Britney Spears videos and put The Aphex Twin in high rotation .
I never heard back .
An hour later The Tyee e-mailed me : " Hey , Let 's Talk . "
They wanted me to do a " video cartoon " with a small essay attached , that would come out exactly when I posted each one .
I love The Tyee , and I was happy to sign on .
But I was reminded of Johnson 's definition of a patron : " One who ignores a drowning man 's cries , and then once he has reached the shore , encumbers him with assistance . "
As the morning progressed , friends in office cubicles all over the planet started sending me links that were circulating their workplace .
But PaddyWagon had the top rated , top favourite , most discussed clip of the week on YouTube , whereas I had been relegated to the dusty " This Month " bin .
It was a bitter pill .
By noon PaddyWagon was closing in on a hundred thou , there were 40 clones screaming EBAUM'S WORLD roaring up the charts , a Spanish version and a German version .
Some guy had even photo - shopped a big red star over top of the spiders and filled it with info about his skater clothing line .
Finally , around lunchtime , YouTube replied to my hundredth e-mail and asked for proof that Spiders On Drugs was my film .
I said it had been on the film festival circuit for six months and directed them to a few websites that had had me listed as the creator .
Six hours later , around 11 pm on Monday night , I clicked on PaddyWagon 's link and it was gone .
Across the top of the page was an ugly red stamp like a police DO NOT CROSS banner :
THIS CLIP HAS BEEN REMOVED AT THE REQUEST OF COPYRIGHT OWNER ANDREW STRUTHERS BECAUSE ITS CONTENT WAS USED WITHOUT PERMISSION
Who 's the little bitch now , PaddyWagon ?
After the Gold Rush
As I say , the most amazing thing about YouTube is you can connect with everyone , even your enemies ( unless they block you from their site ) .
PaddyWagon blocked me from commenting , but I could still watch the films on his homepage .
He had uploaded about 30 clips , and 25 of them were of his new baby , a real little cutie .
He looked like an OK guy .
The sort of guy who works a dull job and dreams of better days ahead .
Anyway , it 's 3 p.m. on Tuesday , one week since I had the idea .
I 've just hit the million mark , and there are 55 pages of comments , many of which say things like CANADA ROCKS !
and I LOVE CANADA !
The funny thing is , I 've been showing the script for Spiders On Drugs to Canadian film producers for seven years .
Nobody bit .
I could have made a thousand of these little films in the meantime , but I was tied up with committees and meetings .
But that 's all in the past , just like the Canadian film industry .
And Hollywood , for that matter .
The long dark meeting of my soul is over .
I 'm shooting my next film in my living room as I type , and I 'll see everyone next week , right here , with another crazy tale of YouTubular adventure .
But first , I think I 'll lie down for a bit .
基本的に、まともな国際化ライブラリを使っていれば、上記のような不正な文字コードはきちんと処理してくれるはずです。実際、
Opera , Firefox , IE ともに適切にエスケープしてくれました。また、 UCS に変換した後にエスケープ処理を行うことでも対処できるかもしれません。しかし、複数のモジュールで構成されるような規模の大きいアプリケーションでは、そのすべてが適切な処理を行っていると保証するのも、なかなか難しいかと思います。ここはやはり、すべての外部入力に含まれる不正なシーケンスを、水際で正規化するという処理を徹底するのが一番かと思います。
例えば Ruby の場合、不正な UTF - 8 コードを検出する最も簡単な方法は、 String # unpack を使って UCS へ変換してみることです（昨日の記事への kazutanaka さんからのはてぶコメントにて、 iconv でも同様なことができるとご教示いただきました。まだきちんと確認していないのですが、
Ruby 以外でも使える汎用的なテクニックとして有用だと思います）。
utf8_str. unpack ( " U* " )
※コメントで PuniPuni さんがご指摘のように、 String #unpack , Iconv ともにサロゲートペアの領域が検出できないようです。サロゲートペアの領域も検出する必要がある場合は、やはり自分で検証を行わなければなりません。
もし utf8_str に不正なシーケンスが含まれていれば、例外が発生します。しかし、この方法だと不正なシーケンスを含んだ文字列は全体を捨てるしか方法がありません。単純に処理を中断することが許されない場合は、やはり自分で正規化を行うしかありません。参考までに、私の
JSON パーサー で使っている正規化処理を単体で使えるようにしたものを再掲載しておきます。この関数は、不正なシーケンスを見つけると引数 malformed_chr で指定された文字に置き換え、その結果の文字列を返します。
# str は正規化する UTF - 8 文字列、 malformed_chr は不正なシーケンスを置き換える文字です。 # malformed_chr は文字列ではな く Unicode の整数を与えてください。 def validate_utf8 ( str , malformed_chr ) code = 0 rest = 0 range = nil ucs = [ ] str. each_byte do |c| if rest <= 0 case c when 0x01..0x7 f then rest = 0 ; ucs << c when 0xc0..0 xdf then rest = 1 ; code = c & 0x1 f ; range = 0x00080..0x0007 ff when 0xe0..0 xef then rest = 2 ; code = c & 0x0 f ; range = 0x00800..0x00 ffff when 0xf0..0 x f7 then rest = 3 ; code = c & 0x07 ; range = 0x10000..0x10 ffff else ucs << malformed_chr end elsif ( 0x80..0 x bf ) === c code = ( code << 6 ) | ( c & 0x3 f ) if ( rest -= 1 ) <= 0 if ! ( range === code ) || ( 0xd800..0xdfff ) === code code = malformed_chr end ucs << code end else ucs << malformed_chr rest = 0 end end ucs. pack ( ' U* ' ) end
やっていることは、 UCS にいったん変換した上で不正なコードを malformed_chr に置き換え、再度 UTF - 8 に戻しているだけです。ですので、最後の行で配列 ucs をそのまま返せば、 UTF - 8 → UCS - 4 変換になります。他にうまいアルゴリズムなどがありましたら、教えていただけると嬉しいです。

( Below I use ' arrow ' to mean an arrow in a category ( or an ordinary Haskell function ) but an Arrow ( with capital A ) is one of the objects defined by Hughes .
I 'm not really going to say much about Arrows . )
A while back I looked at a paper on comonads and streams but could n't really see what comonads were offering .
Just recently , I was thinking about a design for a dataflow language for microcontrollers and found that Arrows captured some of the functionality I wanted .
But after writing some Haskell code I realised that I was writing the same ' glue ' over and over again .
So it was becoming clear that arrows were too general and I needed a class that filled in the glue for me automatically .
I wrote the code and it looked familiar .
I realised that I had rediscovered comonads and they now seemed entirely natural .
First , let me review monads .
There are countless web sites that purport to be introductions to monads but my way of looking at them seems a little different to most of those accounts .
( It 's not in any way unusual , just not in the beginner 's guides . )
I like to think in terms of Kleisli arrows .
I find this perspective unifies the different applications of monads such as encapsulating side effects or doing simple logic programming using the list monad .
A Kleisli arrow is simply an arrow ( ie. in Haskell , a function ) a→m b where m is a monad .
What monads allow you to do is compose these things .
So given f:: a→m b and g:: b→m c there is an arrow a→m c .
To me this is the raison d'être of monads but as far as I can see , the standard interface defined in Control .
Monad does n't actually provide a name for this composition function .
( Though the Control .
Arrow interface does provide a Kleisli arrow composition function . )
So here 's why I like to think in terms of Kleisli arrows : Consider what is almost the prototypical example of a Haskell monad - the Writer monad .
Suppose you have something that is conceptually a function f:: a→b but you want it to output a list of items to a log as a side effect .
In a functional programming language there is no way out - you 're pretty well forced to return the thing you want to log along with the object of type b.
If your log is a list of objects of type d , then you need to modify f to return an object of type ( b , [d ] ) instead of b .
But here we have a catch , if we have f : : a→ ( b , [d ] ) and g : : b→ ( c , [d ] ) ( ie. conceptually a function of type b→c producing a log of type [ d ] ) then we want to compose these things .
But the argument to g is no longer the return type of f .
We need some plumbing to concatenate these functions .
In this case the plumbing needs to take the output of f , split off the log keeping it for later , pass the remainder to g , and then concatenate the log from f before the log of g .
And this is what monads do , they provide the plumbing .
( If you knew nothing about monads and wrote the obvious code to plumb these things together , concatenating the logs , probably the first thing you wrote would look just like part of the definition of the Writer monad , except the Writer monad is generalised to monoids instead of lists . )
Let 's work through the details of composing Kleisli arrows : we want to compose f:: a→m b and g:: b→m c .
The obvious thing to do is add a gluing map between them m b→b .
But that 's uninteresting as it just throws away the fanciness .
Instead we use the fact that m is a functor ( part of the mathematician 's definition of monad ) to lift g to a function m b→m ( m c ) .
This now composes nicely with f but the catch is that we end up with something twice as fancy .
However , part of the definition of monads is that there is a map m ( m c ) →m c. ( Twice as fancy is still just fancy . )
And that can now be used to finish off the composition .
Consider another example of a monad , the list monad .
The idea is that we want a function to return multiple values , not just one .
So instead of f:: a→b we have f ::a→ [ b ] .
But suppose we have another one of these things , g : : b→[c ] .
How do we concatenate these ?
Conceptually what we want to do is run g on each of the return values of f in turn and then collect up all of the results in one big list .
This is exactly what the list monad does , it provides the plumbing to concatenate functions in this way .
In both cases we have f:: a→m b and g:: b→m c and we get a function a→m c .
Or more informally , monads give a way to compose functions that map ordinary types to fancy types providing the glue that allows the fancy output of one function to connect to the on - fancy input of the next .
And I like to view things this way because a functional program is a concatenation of lots of functions - so it 's natural to think about monads as simply a new way of building programs by concatenation of functions .
Anyway , I was thinking about stream functions .
A stream function from a to b is simply a function [ a ] →[ b ] .
( Strictly speaking we 're only considering infinite lists - streams . )
This does n't quite fit the pattern of non-fancy →fancy , it 's more like fancy →fancy .
And that 's what the Arrow interface allows us to do .
But I 'm not going to talk about Arrows here except to say that I started using them to write some stream code .
But then I noticed that I was only interested in causal stream functions .
This is a function where the nth element of the output depends only on the first n values of the input .
This pattern fits many types of processing in dataflow applications such as audio processing .
In order to compute the nth element of the output of a causal f : : [ a ] →[ b ] we need only compute a function f : : [ a ] →b .
To compute the entire stream we repeatedly use this function to generate each element in turn .
So , for example , if the input is the stream [ x1,x1, x2 , ... ] then the output is [f [ x1 ] , f[ x1,x2 ] , f[ x1,x2,x3 ] , ... ] .
In other words a stream function is really a function f : : [ a ] →b but we need special glue to concatenate them because the nth element of the output concatenation should look like g [f [ x1 ] , f[ x1,x2 ] , f[ x1,x2,x3 ] , ... , f [ x1 , ..., xn ] ] .
If you followed that then you may have noticed the pattern .
We want to compose two functions that map fancy types to non-fancy types to produce a new function that maps fancy types to non-fancy types .
It 's the exact opposite of what monads do .
And this is exactly what comonads are about : they are the correct abstraction to use when writing glue for fancy - to - non - fancy functions .
It all seems so natural I 'm astonished to find that Control .
Comonad is n't a part of the standard Haskell distributions .
Let 's look at the details more closely .
Let 's still use m to represent a comonad .
We need to compose f : : m a→b and g : : m b→c .
m is a functor ( by definition of comonad ) so we can lift f to a function of type m ( m a ) →m b .
This composes directly with g .
And to finish it off we use the function m a→m ( m a ) provided by the definition of a comonad .
And in even more detail for the case of ( lists considered as ) streams .
The lift operation is simply given by the usual map function .
You lift a function f by applying it to each element in the stream in turn and returning the stream of results .
The function m a→m ( m a ) is more interesting .
It maps [ x1,x2,x3 , ... ] to [ [ x1 ] , [x1,x2 ] , [x1,x2,x3 ] , ... ] .
In other words it maps a stream to its list of ' histories ' .
My use of the loaded word ' history ' should be a hint about where causality comes in .
If we lift a function f : : [ a ] →b to act on this list of histories we get [f [ x1 ] , f[ x1,x2 ] , f[ x1,x2,x3 ] , ... ] .
In other words , a comonad gives exactly what we need to work with streams .
Anyway , one of the cool things about monads is the special syntactic sugar provided by Haskell that allows us to write what looks like imperative code even though it 's actually functional .
I 've been trying to figure out what similar sugar might look like for comonads .
But I can't quite figure it out .
I can see roughly what it'd look like .
You'd be able to write lines of code likeso that even though it ' looks ' like b is merely twice the head of a , the compiler would produce the appropriate glue to make b actuually be the stream whose head is 2 *( head a ) .
In fact , you can do something a bit like this using Arrow syntax .
But I can't quite fill in the details in such a way that it nicely parallels the syntax for monads .
( Silly me ... I think I 've just figured it out now .
The ' codo ' block is different from a ' do ' block because it needs to define a coKleisli arrow , not an element of the comonad .
Hmmm ... )
And just some final words : I believe Arrows are the wrong approach to functional reactive programming .
Comonads are much more appropriate because they model causal functions much more closely - and causal stream functions are what FRP is all about .
SOME big American cities are flourishing as at no time in recent memory .
Places like New York and San Francisco appear to be richer and more dazzling than ever : crime remains low , new arrivals pour in , neighborhoods have risen from the dead .
New York is in the throes of the biggest building boom in 30 years , its population at an all - time high and climbing .
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proudly promotes his city as “ a luxury product . ”
But middle - class city dwellers across the country are being squeezed .
This time , they are being squeezed out by the rich as much , or more so , as by the poor — a casualty of high housing costs and the thinning out of the country ’s once broad economic middle .
The percentage of middle - income neighborhoods in metropolitan areas like Los Angeles , Chicago and Washington has dropped since 1970 , according to a recent Brookings Institution report .
The percentage of higher - income neighborhoods in many places has gone up .
In New York , the supply of apartments considered affordable to households with incomes like those earned by starting firefighters or police officers plunged by a whopping 205,000 in just three years , between 2002 and 2005 .
Does it matter if there is less room for a middle class ?
In strictly economic terms , plenty of economists say , it may not .
But they also say that in the long run , those cities may become places where they and other city lovers would prefer not to live .
It is a sad story in which the cure is sometimes worse than the disease .
When you see the magic , please pay close attention .
In an effort to broaden our coverage at The Oil Drum , this Southeast Asia report focuses on the tragic consequences of cultivating palm oil ( mongabay.com ) to produce biodiesel fuel .
So , why is it that oil - palm plantations now cover millions of hectares across Malaysia , Indonesia , and Thailand ?
Why has oil palm become the world ’s number one fruit crop , trouncing its nearest competitor , the humble banana ?
The answer lies in the crop ’s unparalleled productivity .
Simply put , oil palm is the most productive oil seed in the world .
A single hectare of oil palm may yield 5,000 kilograms of crude oil , or nearly 6,000 liters of crude according to data from JourneytoForever [ comparative vegetable oil yields per hectare ] .
For comparison , soybeans and corn—crops often heralded as top biofuel sources — generate only 446 and 172 liters per hectare , respectively .
Beyond biofuel , the crop is used for a myriad of purposes from an ingredient in food products to engine lubricants to a base for cosmetics .
Palm oil is becoming an increasingly important agricultural product for tropical countries around the world , especially as crude oil prices top $ 70 a barrel .
Beyond biofuel , the crop is used for a myriad of purposes from an ingredient in food products to engine lubricants to a base for cosmetics .
Palm oil is becoming an increasingly important agricultural product for tropical countries around the world , especially as crude oil prices top $ 70 a barrel [ written in April , 2006 ] .
The two largest producers of palm oil are Malaysia and Indonesia .
The oil palm grown in southeast Asia , , is actually native to tropical Africa .
Along with soybean oil , palm oil is a major world commodity .
And , just like soybean oil , great plans are afoot to use the crops for biofuels .
Here 's what the article cited at top has to say 
Comparative gallons / acre  Source : Mongabay
Figure 1
Some here at TOD will want to know the net energy yield of palm oil .
There is little real information , although the EROEI for biodiesel is generally favorable .
Some interesting remarks are available at biofuelwatch .
What we know is that , on average , biofuel crops grown in the tropics yield about five times as much energy as those grown in temperate zones .
Corn produces 145 kg of oil per hectare per year , sunflowers 800 and rapeseed 1000 .
The tropical jatropha produces 1590 kg of oil per hectare per year , oil palms a full 5000 .
This explains why , in a free market , we will have to rely more and more on imports from the tropics - even if were able to meet the official targets from European and US soils ( which is , of course , questionable ) : our crops simply cannot compete with tropical ones .
There is very little scientific information about growing biofuels in the tropics , except for basic data on energy balance ( i.e. energy input compared to energy yields ) .
The life - cycle assessments which have been done for biodiesel and bioethanol in the US and Europe will not apply to the tropics : 1 . A much higher energy and oil content from tropical crops means that the energy balance will be more positive for , say , jatropha or palm oil than it is for , say , rapeseed oil ....
Please read this resource for additional details .
Pressures to expand palm oil production to grow biofuels have added " fuel to the fire " , so to speak .
Here are the major issues covered below .
Food versus Fuel , rising commodity prices
Destruction of rainforests , peat forests , CO2 emissions
Unsustainable monocultural agriculture
A leading German utility has abandoned plans to convert a British power station to run on palm oil , in a blow to the promotion of biofuels in Europe ...
Widely used in processed foods , such as margarine , and in cosmetics , palm oil is burning bright on commodity exchanges .
The price in Rotterdam soared to an eight - year high last week of $ 620 per tonne ...
The Indonesian Government has signalled that 40 per cent of its palm oil crop will be designated for biofuel production in an attempt to reduce the country ’s reliance on crude oil .
RWE npower had hoped that palm oil would produce electricity in a carbon - neutral process that would not add to greenhouse gas emissions .
According to a spokesman for RWE npower , the process works but the company was unable to guarantee that enough palm oil could be bought from sustainable plantations .
“ There was n’t enough palm oil that we could demonstrate was sustainable , ” the spokesman said .
“ The bottom line is : are you contributing to global warming by chopping down rainforest ? ”
The company hired independent auditors to establish whether palm plantations in Malaysia could be accredited to standards set by the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil , an organisation committed to promoting a sustainable palm oil industry ....
Palm Oil Economics
These issues are summed up nicely in two news stories .
First , there is Alternative - energy boom roils Asian environments  originally from WSJ online , December 5 , 2006  and Concern for rainforest forces RWE to scrap palm oil project from the UK's Times Online .
From the latter  As of January 29 , 2007 , the crude palm oil price for February delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives exchange was 1899 MYR / ton , where MRY abbreviates .
The ringgit / dollar exchange rate is 3.50 : 1  so the front month price is ≅ $ 543 / ton , down from a Christmas spot ( cash ) price high of over $ 600 / ton. shows the two - year trend .
Crude Palm Oil ( CPO ) prices , 2005  2006
Figure 2  Click to enlarge
With rising CPO demand due to additional pressure on supply for biofuels , the upward price trend shown in Figure 2 is the expected outcome .
Naturally , there are predictions that the CPO price will continue to rise .
Crude palm oil price in 2007 will likely rise on account of a high demand for the commodity in the world market when all the while its production capacity is not on par with the demand , an official said .
The possible high demand for CPO this year may come from India and China as well as European countries , Indonesian Oil Palm Businessmen Association ( GAPKI ) executive chairman Derom Bangun said here Tuesday .
" Today , in some countries CPO has not only become raw material in food industry but also in biofuel producing sector , " he said .
He predicted Indonesia would produce 16.4 million tons of CPO in 2007 and the demand for the commodity may be greater than the production .
" There is no shortage of edible oil at the moment but prices have been driven higher by this talk of biofuels , " M.R. Chandran , an independent industry analyst and a former head of the Malaysian Palm Oil Association , told Reuters .
" It has already made palm oil out of reach for many people in India and China where purchasing power is less , " he told the Reuters Global Biofuels Summit ...
" I would think that there is enough palm oil in the world which can be used for biofuels and you could also have enough left over for the food industry , " said a leading commodity trader who attended the Reuters Summit in Singapore .
Industry experts said spiraling prices of vegetable oils against a backdrop of declining petroleum prices could weaken the competitive footing for the biofuel industry and slow expansion , freeing up availability for edible oils for the food sector .
The higher prices are not without harmful effects on poor consumers .
In the suspiciously titled article Food or fuel ?
The world has enough for both by Naveen Thukral and Sambit Mohanty , we learn what is happening .
It is good to know that we can have biodiesel from palm oil and , as a bonus , there will be enough left over for food , not to mention lipstick .
Furthermore , the competitiveness of the palm oil biofuels industry depends on the conventional oil price , which is now comparatively low .
At the current price quoted above , CPO costs about $ 74 / barrel ( using the standard conventional oil conversion 1 ton = 7.3 barrels ) .
However , future prices could also fall if a lot more land is converted to palm oil plantations .
Alternatively , the conventional oil price could rise enough to make palm oil competitive , even without subsidies .
At this time , however , the price balance does not appear favorable for biofuels derived from palm oil .
That could change quickly and many are betting that it will  back in July of 2006 , conventional crude was $ 74 / barrel and palm oil was going for $ 58 / barrel .
The situation is complicated by Indonesian fuel subsidies .
From the Christian Monitor 's Faced with soaring oil prices , Indonesia turns to biodiesel 
The dampening effect of the high cost of CPO on private investment in biodiesel in Indonesia [ in July , 2006 ] is compounded by the low price of regular diesel sold in the country .
Billions of dollars in government subsidies offset the high price of fuel bought overseas .
Indonesian consumers buy some of the cheapest petrol in the world - around 50 cents per liter ( $ 1.90 per gallon ) for gasoline and diesel .
Indeed , the rising cost of fuel subsidies is what is spurring government interest in biodiesel .
" The government is looking for alternatives a lot right now , " says Tara Khaira , a manager at EcoSecurities , a developer and trader of carbon credits on the global market .
" The only real reason is to reduce the subsidies . "
Rapeseed oil now makes up between 80 and 85 percent of the biodiesel produced by the EU , with soybean oil and a marginal quantity of palm oil accounting for the rest .
" We may be the new kid on the biofuel block , but the demand from Europe itself will keep palm diesel going strong against any other rival , " said S.J. Dhass , marketing manager at Bell Group , operator of Malaysia 's largest private palm oil mill .
The EU imports about 3.5 million tonnes of refined and crude palm oil every year , chiefly from Malaysia and Indonesia , and could supply up to a fifth of EU biodiesel demand by 2010 , Fediol , a vegetable oils trade organisation , said in May .
The Environmental Consequences
Indeed , the CSM goes on to note that " mass protests ... sparked by subsidy cuts " led , in part , to Suharto 's ouster in 1998 .
So , Indonesia 's government is spending money to build biodiesel refineries and develop new palm oil plantations .
Both the Indonesian and Malaysian governments have set aside palm oil reserves for biodiesel , anticipating large future demand from the EU and elsewhere if conventional oil prices continue to climb .
As of now  Some private investors are now scrambling to supply the nascent palm oil biofuels industry .
At this time , southeast Asia 's palm oil biofuels business is where Brazil 's sugar cane industry was 10 or 15 years ago .
Regarding the food or fuel problem , there is enough palm oil to go around for the time being , but the balance may change should an economically viable industry ramp up in future years .
This will all depend on conventional oil prices or government policies subsidizing biofuels use or production through tax breaks or direct investments .
Even as Malaysia and Indonesia hope for a booming palm oil biodiesel export market , the EU is getting cold feet because of the destruction of southeast Asia 's forests .
Indeed , the environmental news is very bad .
As the Wall Street Journal reports ( above ) , an EU parliamentary committee recommended a ban on all biofuels from palm oil .
And , as noted above , RWE npower cancelled their plan to use palm oil to generate electricity in England .
However , the EU now plans to use 20 % renewable power by 2020 , with 10 % of vehicle fuels coming from biofuels .
So , the EU is in a bind concerning biofuels from palm oil .
Their Hobson 's Choice is this  they can cut CO2 emissions and thus avoid disastrous climate change using biofuels from palm oil , or they can increase CO2 emissions and promote disastrous climate change using biofuels from palm oil .
Perhaps there is much larger overshoot and sustainability problem ?
For some background on the CO2 emissions from clearing peat swamp forests , see my story Burning Buried Sunshine .
The WSJ article focuses on the environmental damage .
Here on the island of Borneo , a thick haze often encloses this city of 500,000 people .
The cause : forest fires that have blazed across the island , some of which were set to clear land to produce palm oil -- a key ingredient in biodiesel , a clean - burning diesel fuel alternative ...
Among other problems , the fires set to clear forest land spew millions of tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere , experts say .
In doing so , they exacerbate the very global - warming concerns biofuels are meant to alleviate .
" Let 's be brutally frank : ( The push for alternative fuels ) is going to cause significant changes for the environment , " says Sean Darby , an equities analyst and expert on alternative - energy companies at Nomura International in Hong Kong .
He is most worried about the strain on water resources caused by accelerated crop production .
Water , he says , is " just as precious " as oil .
600 million tons is caused by decomposition of dry peat ( a process that will continue until all peat has disappeared ) and 1400 million tons is lost through the annual fires .
These amounts change the global picture concerning carbon emissions .
In the ranking of countries based on their total CO2 emissions , Indonesia comes 21st .
However , if peatland emissions are included , Indonesia is ranked third .
The country emits more than India , more than Russia , and several times more than the UK or Germany .
It emits more than all the efforts of western countries to reduce greenhouse gases under the Kyoto Protocol .
Western countries see oil palm as a good source of biofuel , a ‘ clean ’ alternative for fossil fuels .
The European Union implements all kind of legislation for a large scale use of biofuels .
Export of palm oil to European countries is growing rapidly .
However , more than 26 % of all Indonesian oil palm concessions are on peatlands , and similar figures apply to Malaysia .
It is estimated that production of one ton of palm oil will result in an average emission of 20 tons of CO2 from peat decomposition alone – not taking into account the emissions from fire and other CO2 emissions during the production cycle .
The Netherlands alone imported at least 400,000 tons of palm oil to meet its Kyoto target for 2005 , thus actually increasing [ its ] greenhouse gas emissions .
It 's good to know that fresh water and oil are considered equally important .
However , the WSJ mentions a study presented last November at a United Nations climate conference in Nairobi , which showed that Indonesia is the world 's third - biggest carbon emitter behind the U.S. and China , when emissions from fires and other factors are considered .
The press release , Shocking climate impact of wetland destruction in Indonesia , references Peatland degradation fuels climate change ( MS Word document ) , which provides some of the details .
From the press release  of the estimated 2 gigatons of CO2 emitted by deforestation in Indonesia alone :
And from the more detailed document  relating to palm oil : Whoops !
Although these huge numbers would have to be verified by further study and fit into the overall planetary carbons emissions budget , there is little doubt that there are very substantial CO2 emissions from land use changes that destroy the rainforests and peat forests of southeast Asia .
Palm oil monoculture in tropical ecosystems has other harmful consequences .
From the WSJ ( op. cit ) 
As residents are discovering , though , the spreading plantations have deleterious effects .
They can alter water - catchment areas , destroy animal habitats and contribute to the months - long bouts of haze that spreads hundreds of kilometers across Southeast Asia .
Beyond the loss of forest ecosystems , the production of palm oil , as currently practiced , can be quite damaging to the environment .
In 2001 Malaysia ’s production of 7 million tons of crude palm oil generated 9.9 million tons of solid oil wastes , palm fiber , and shells , and 10 million tons of palm oil mill effluent , a polluted mix of crushed shells , water , and fat residues that has been shown to have a negative impact on aquatic ecosystems .
Peat forest wetlands catch the rain and store the water .
Without them , the water runs off , leading to erosion of precious topsoils and even freshwater shortages in some areas .
Waste from palm oil production is also a problem .
From mongabay.com ()
 Finally , there is the tragic loss of Orang Utan forest habitat .
Threatened with extinction
A Note on Jatropha
Another tropical source of vegetable oil , jatropha , seems to offer many comparative advantages over palm oil .
Jatropha Beans  Source : Ecofriend
Europe Adopts Biodiesel : Can an African Bean Crack Europe 's Biodiesel Blockage ? is an excellent source of information .
One UK - based company , D1 Oils plc , has put itself at the forefront of efforts to fill this [ EU biofuels ] gap with Jatropha oil .
Jatropha grows quickly , is hardy , establishes itself easily even in arid land , and is drought - tolerant , requiring only 300 mm of annual rainfail .
It grows especially well in South and West Africa , and South East Asia .
Jatropha can even be grown on semi-arid land using waste water , making it a useful tool in the prevention of desertification .
Each Jatropha tree can produce an average of 3.5 kilos of beans each year depending on irrigation levels .
According to D1's estimates , if 2,200 Jatropha trees are planted per hectare , each hectare could yield up to 7 tonnes of beans per annum .
Jatropha beans can produce oil yields of up to 40 % and D1 expects each hectare to deliver about 3,000 litres of biodiesel .
Some Reflections
Britain has little forest left , as most land has been converted to agriculture .
Such a paucity of forest cover and the preponderance of agricultural land have resulted in reduced biodiversity and caused the loss of fauna and flora .
According to data from the Food and Agriculture Organisation , Britain has less than 12 per cent of its land under forest cover compared with 64 per cent for Malaysia .
Agricultural land makes up 71 per cent of its total land area compared with less than 19 per cent in Malaysia , of which oil palm accounts for two - thirds .
In the 1800s , Dutch and British traders began carving up parts of the island to produce rubber and other commodities .
Later , Malaysian and Indonesian timber barons devastated millions of hectares of forest logging tropical hardwoods .
Today , only a little more than half of Borneo 's once - ubiquitous rain - forest cover remains , according to WWF , the global conservation organization .
For all these reasons , Jatropha looks promising as a biodiesel source .
Now , it is easy for the EU , the Wall Street Journal and the author to take pot shots at Malaysia and Indonesia for attempting to lift themselves up economically by cultivating palm oil for biofuels .
In fact , the Malaysian Palm Oil Council issued a rebuttal to some topics reviewed in this story .
And although some of it is ridiculous , it does point out obviously hypocritical things like this  In the 19th century , Europeans were despoiling southeast Asia for the rubber and timber trades .
From the WSJ , peaking of Borneo  As a citizen of the United States  the world 's largest natural resource consumer driving much of the planet 's freefall  and largest abuser of the global commons , which is the environment upon which we all ultimately depend , I must add this apologetic to my criticisms of land use practices in southeast Asia .
After all , people are just trying to feed themselves , raise their families and prosper economically as far as that is possible .
Quoting the WSJ concerning Indonesia , " the arrival of new palm - oil plantations has meant jobs and opportunities for many Dayak families [ of Kalimantan ] , and some have even taken ownership stakes in the operations . "
There are environmentalists in southeast Asia just as there are here among the NGOs in America  I have quoted some of them .
At the same time , John Q. Suburban in the United States is just trying to feed himself , raise his family and prosper economically as far as that is possible .
So , in the short run , some will win , some will lose and everyone wants to live .
Over the longer term , however , the underlying problem is too many people ( wherever they live ) consuming too much energy and other natural resources .
Overshoot and unsustainable modes of living are not confined to southeast Asia , as any American should know .

We 're so screwed , I do n't even know what to worry about first .
Terrorist extremists ?
Yeah , they 're frightening - but what about those North Korean nukes ?
Or global warming , come to think of it ?
I need a personal bloody organiser to sort it out - a gizmo that 'll set me a " timetable of concern " just so I can break down my overall sense of creeping dread into manageable , bite - sized flurries of panic .
Otherwise , I 'm in danger of forgetting to worry about some things - like bird flu , for instance .
I have n't seriously crapped myself about that since , ooh , February ?
Whenever it was , a top - up 's long overdue .
I 'm not the only one .
I was reading a George Monbiot piece about climate change on the Guardian website the other day , and it painted such a bleak vision of our potential future , I swear I physically felt my will to live draining through the soles of my feet , as though it were being flushed out of me and replaced with a sort of heavy , porridge - like despair .
Below the article , in the comments section , a passer - by remarked , " I have two pieces of advice for anyone reading this : 1 ) Keep an overdose - sized supply of sleeping pills stashed away that is sufficient for yourself , your family and anyone else you care about .
2 ) When things start getting bad , use them . "
And this was one of the cheerier entries .
Still , the news is n't always violently upsetting .
No .
Sometimes the bad headlines turn out to be a false alarm - like the other day , when early reports of a second 9/11 happening RIGHT NOW turned out to be a comparatively minor accident involving a light aircraft .
Ca n't be much fun being one of the victims , of course - for one thing , you 've just been killed , and for another , your death was announced by an anchorman mopping his brow , and drowned out by a worldwide sigh of relief - but for the rest of us , it was the closest we 've come to hearing good news in ages .
With this in mind , perhaps news journalists everywhere would like to make our lives a little more bearable by running several deliberately petrifying and utterly fabricated stories a week , just so the genuine terrifying stuff feels a bit less terrifying by comparison .
And at the end of the week , simply reveal which stories were true , and which were fake .
That way , we 'll spend our last few years on Earth feeling like we 've lived through a string of lucky escapes , rather than a protracted , dispiriting meltdown .
Start with the pterodactyl example .
A week later , invent a health scare - some new hyper - contagious disease that makes your eyes boil and burst and run down your cheeks .
The gorier the better .
Then invent some bogus knuckle - whitening bullshit about a maniac on the Korean peninsula who 's got hold of a nuclear bomb and ...
Oh .
Oh bugger .
In the past , we 've covered evidence that the human brain can process information from visual inputs without letting the conscious portion of the brain know what it 's up to .
It 's been proposed that this filtering activity is needed to prevent people from getting overwhelmed by sensory input .
But some new research suggests that the filtering comes at a cost — in some cases , the mental price can be so high that it actually interferes with what you are trying to pay attention to .
The authors of a new study set up a task where subjects had to focus on a series of characters displayed at the center of their field of vision while small dots moved at the periphery .
Those dots either tracked a " coherent " path ( meaning they moved along a specific trajectory ) or moved randomly .
Previous studies had shown that the human brain can track the motion if the dots seem to be following a trajectory ; otherwise , their motion does n't register .
The research tracked whether the ability of the brain to " see " a dot 's motion interfered with character recognition , noting that " One would naturally assume that the degree of an invisible stimulus 's influence is generally weaker than that of a visible stimulus . "
That assumption turns out to be badly wrong .
If a non-moving dot was viewed as a baseline , equivalent character recognition success was obtained when the dot's path was greater than 20 percent coherent .
Below 20 percent , however , success rates dropped , reaching a low point at about 5 percent coherence .
In other words , as the motion of the dots became impossible to detect , the task performance plunged .
Making the dots harder to see by decreasing their brightness generated a similar result curve , but shifted to where the worst performance came at 30 percent coherence , again suggesting that the worst performance came when the dot 's motion was essentially invisible .
Using functional MRI , the authors also followed the activity of two areas of the brain : the one responsible for tracking motion , and the one responsible for suppressing distractions .
The area of the brain that tracks motion is most active when the motion was below the threshold for detection .
Once the motion became detectable , however , the distraction - killing area kicked in , and the motion tracking area was suppressed .
The authors propose that even when the motion of an object is n't coherent , the visual system expends a lot of effort trying to track it .
This , in turn , distracts the visual system from the primary task .
Once the brain gets a handle on the motion — when it perceives the motion as coherent — it 's able to make the distraction handling system aware of it , at which point it can be ignored .
In other words , something has to attract your brain 's attention before it can decide to ignore it .
All of this , of course , happens without you being consciously aware of it .

Much to my surprise , San Francisco 's real sexual revolution seems to be happening neither on the streets of the Castro , nor in the sex - positive , women - owned sex shops , nor in Victorian apartments besieged by prolific feminist porn companies .
Instead , it is happening in the last place I 'd think to go shopping for a whip .
At this very moment , the new discourse about reinventing intercourse ( and many non-vanilla - flavored activities ) is happening at the neighborhood yarn store .
If the idea of yarn craft sounds more like Martha Stewart than Dita Von Teese , then your reaction to the emergent sexy knitting meme is going to be more like mine : a combination of whimsical cynicism at the absurdity of such a concept , and then no small amount of dismay at the sexification of crafts .
Felt is so not hot .
But yarn ?
A craft pattern for which you have to show over - 18 ID as proof of legal age to knit ?
It just makes me giggle .
But if San Francisco's Domiknitrix has anything to do with it , my laughter would soon turn to tears should I find myself at the wrong end of Jennifer Stafford 's stern knitting needles .
No potholder - crafting submissive is she .
As evidenced by her new book , " Domiknitrix : Whip Your Knitting Into Shape , " wielding wool has many more arousing applications than the schoolmarms at the craft store let on .
This sexy take on demanding unexpected pleasures from perfecting a stitch is all about Stafford showing you " the ropes " on making perfect sweaters with uneven stitches .
And while not overtly sexual in content , the decidedly adult tone insists that yarn 's place is over your lap , ready for discipline -- or even groveling at your feet for a firm hand from a merciless wool disciplinarian .
The Domiknitrix 's book might not be as naughty as it implies , but never fear -- " Naughty Needles : Sexy , Saucy Knits for the Bedroom and Beyond " by Nikol Lohr is here .
While the back cover commands you to " Knit and Tell , " one peek under the covers shows that this book is one part knitting manual of style , and one part sex toy all by itself .
From start to finish , the book is filled with wickedly sexy pinup color photographs of hip - looking girls and guys in various demonstrations of the naughtily knitted product .
Two women wrestle in cavegirl bikinis .
Pasties are modeled by a sexy lineup of women who could only belong in a San Francisco burlesque troupe .
" Kinderwhore " is a knitting pattern for naughty schoolgirl socks shown on two mischievous adult schoolgirls .
In one adorable photo , a demure model pouts amid a pile of sex toys and hand - crafted cozies for almost every sex toy that keeps Good Vibrations in business .
Lest we forget that the ingredients for marital bliss can include love , a paddle and deft needles , one image shows a babe in latex playing cards on the back of a man made into a human table by way of the knitted blindfold and cuffs she 's administered .
And one delightful section called " Disobey Madame at Your Peril " shows several whips that can be created in an hour .
So basically , if he's an hour late , Lohr has your back .
Still , the concept of applying such a traditional , seemingly diminutive craft to dildo cozies and ball gags made me wonder just what the merit of homemade pasties might be , and also just how much those cute side - lace knickers might chafe me with scratchy wool .
I decided to ask cute - as - a - button Lohr a few hard questions about this new pervy knitting phenomena .
Violet Blue :
Your new book goes on my porn shelf .
Can you explain why knitters are getting all the action these days ?
Nikol Lohr : Knitting turns " cute " into " dreamboat sexpot . "
But knitting is also all about the deft hands .
Knitters are sexy the way chefs and mechanics are sexy .
You might not notice them on the street , but slice into some luscious yummy or watch someone rebuild a carburetor and , pretty soon , you 're fanning yourself .
VB : Ever field - test your sexilicious creations in the name of science ?
NL : Yes .
With A+ results .
VB : Do you use special yarn , or are scratchy pasties part of the BDSM experience ?
NL : Yarns these days are scrumpy -- they 're not like the scratchy grandma acrylic or coarse wools you might remember from childhood .
I mean , you can still use all that stuff -- there 's actually a ball gag in the book designed specifically for granny acrylic -- but you can also get the most lushy - plushy stuff imaginable : buttery alpaca and heavy , dripping silk and glitzy metallics , sequins .
They make yarn out of everything !
Besides critters like buffalo ( cashmere - soft : Who knew ? ) and possum , they also use soy and wood and corn , for crying out loud !
It 's nutty !
( To my knowledge , there are n't yet any yarns made from nuts .
But just wait . )
VB : The way you talk about alpaca makes the Hitachi Magic Wand seem anticlimactic .
Where can the knit fetishist find more ?
NL : Naughty Needles Knitting ( for the book ) and The Thrifty Knitter ( my knit - craft - pattern blog ) .
Naughty Needles Knitting will have some dandy free bonus patterns that would n't fit in the book ( bunny suit , pony hood and a somewhat menacing bondage sweater you can knit without the scary hood for a slinky sweater - meat showcase ) .
I 'm also Disgruntledhousewife.com , but there 's nothing overtly knitty there ( plenty of naked ladies , though ) !

Grade 4 technology class was today .
It was the first class of a new quarter .
The students were asked what they would like to learn about regarding technology .
We threw out some ideas .
We soon agreed that we'd like to learn a bit about graphics though this did n't quite follow the curriculum .
Games are a key component of class .
There 's an effort to have many games in the computer lab that encourage critical thinking and avoid the ( usually ) mindless " shoot - em up " games .
One game the students play is called " Same GNOME " by Callum McKenzie .
It 's a critical thinking game where the goal is to remove objects from the screen in a collective way leaving as few objects remaining as possible , thus increasing the score .
The game uses graphical themes for objects , such as colored balls and planets .
We decided to learn how to edit those graphical themes to customize the game .
A student then asked a question which illustrates a pervasive defaulting view in regard to the world of copyright .
He is concerned about creating new themes and editing existing themes .
He asks - By " " , he was referring to the creators of the game .
He assumed that we were learning to do something that " " would have to grant us permission to do beforehand .
Of course , no matter the licensing of the Same GNOME graphics , the class would be able to do this under " fair use " for educational purposes .
In fact , one is told how to edit themes under the help menu .
However , the question itself was rather telling .
We spoke about Same GNOME - released under the GNU GPL .
I mentioned that we would simply be editing the graphics in class and not try to pass them off under our names to deceive people .
After we talked a little about free software and the motives often found in those who create it , I ask the class what they think " " will do if they " .

New York 's Architectural Holdouts
from Powell 's New York 's Architectural Holdouts by Andrew Alpern and Seymour Durst .
The book is worth checking out , particularly if you are familiar with New York .
The canonical architectural holdout occurs when a developer is trying to assemble a large parcel of land for a big building , and a little old lady refuses to sell her home .
The book is full of astonishing pictures : skyscrapers built with holdout buildings embedded inside them and with holdout buildings wedged underneath them .
Skyscrapers built in the shape of the letter E ( with the holdouts between the prongs ) , the letter C ( with the holdout in the cup ) , and the letter Y ( with the holdout in the fork ) .

When Henry Siegel , a New York store owner , got news in 1898 that Macy 's was going to build a gigantic new flagship store on Herald Square , he bought the corner lot for $ 375,000 to screw over his competitors .
The Herald Square Macy 's still has a notch cut out of its corner ; see the picture at right .
The Macy 's store on Queens Boulevard is in the shape of a perfect circle , except for the little bit cut out of one side where the proverbial old lady ( this time named Mary Sendek ) refused to sell a 7 × 15 - foot back corner of her lot for $ 200,000 because she wanted her dog to have a place to play .
( Here 's a satellite view of the building .
The notch is clearly visible at the northwest corner , facing 55th Avenue . )
But anyway , the Spite House .
The story , as told by Alpern and Durst , is that around 1882 , Patrick McQuade wanted to build some houses on 82nd Street at Lexington Avenue .
The adjoining parcel of land , around the corner on Lexington , was owned by Joseph Richardson , shown at left .
If McQuade could acquire this parcel , he would be able to extend his building all the way to Lexington Avenue , and put windows on that side of the building .
No problem : the parcel was a strip of land 102 feet long and five feet wide along Lexington , useless for any other purpose .
Surely Richardson would sell .
McQuade offered $ 1,000 , but Richardson demanded $ 5,000 .
Unwilling to pay , McQuade started building his houses anyway , complete with windows looking out on Richardson 's five - foot - wide strip , which was unbuildable .
Or so he thought .
Richardson built a building five feet wide and 102 feet long , blocking McQuade 's Lexington Avenue windows .
( Click the pictures for large versions . )
The building soon became known as the " Spite House " .
The photograph above was taken around 1895 .
Lexington Avenue is torn up for maintenance in this picture .
Richardson took advantage of a clause in the building codes that allowed him to build bay window extensions in his building .
This allowed him to extend its maximum width 2 ' 3 " beyond the boundary of the lot .
( Alpern and Durst say " In those days , such encroachments on the public sidewalks were not prohibited . " )
The rooms of the Spite House were in these bay window extensions , connected by extremely narrow hallways :
As you can see , the Spite House was divided into two dwellings , each with a separate entrance , four floors , and two rooms on each floor .
The rooms were 7 ' 3 " wide and were connected by hallways 3 ' 4 " wide .
After construction was completed , Richardson moved into the Spite House and lived there until he died in 1897 .
The pictures below and at left are from that time .
The edge - on photograph below , showing the Spite House 's 3 ' 4 " frontage on 82nd Street , was taken in 1912 .
The Spite House was demolished in 1915 .

A masterful overview of SETI and its meaning to humanity - a classic - Eds .
Through all of our history we have pondered the stars and mused whether mankind is unique or if , somewhere else out there in the dark of night sky , there are other beings who contemplate and wonder as we do - fellow thinkers in the cosmos .
Such beings might view themselves and the universe differently .
Somewhere else there might exist exotic biologies , technologies and societies .
What a splendid perspective contact with a profoundly different civilization might provide !
In a cosmic setting vast and old beyond ordinary human understanding we are a little lonely , and we ponder the ultimate significance , if any , of our tiny but exquisite blue planet , the Earth .
The Search for Extra- Terrestrial Intelligence ( SETI ) is the search for a generally acceptable cosmic context for the human species .
In the deepest sense the search for extraterrestrial intelligence is a search for ourselves .
Until recently there could be no such search .
No matter how deep the concern or how dedicated the effort , human beings could not scratch the surface of the problem .
But in the last few years - in one millionth of the lifetime of our species on this planet - we have achieved an extraordinary technological capability which enables us to seek out unimaginably distant civilizations , even if they are no more advanced than we .
That capability is called radio astronomy and involves single radio telescopes , collections or arrays of radio telescopes , sensitive radio detectors , advanced computers for processing received data , and the imagination and skill of dedicated scientists .
Radio astronomy has , in the last decade , opened a new window on the physical universe .
It may also , if we are wise enough to make the effort , cast a brilliant light on the biological universe .
Some scientists working on the question of extraterrestrial intelligence , myself among them , have attempted to estimate the number of advanced technical civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy - that is , societies capable of radio astronomy .
Such estimates are little better than guesses .
They require assigning numerical values to quantities such as the numbers and ages of stars , which we know well ; the abundance of planetary systems and the likelihood of the origin of life within them , which we know less well ; and the probability of the evolution of intelligent life and the lifetime of technical civilizations , about which we know very little indeed .
When we do the arithmetic , the number " A single message from space will show that it is possible to live through technological adolescence . " that my colleagues and I come up with is around a million technical civilizations in our Galaxy alone .
That is a breathtakingly large number , and it is exhilarating to imagine the diversity , lifestyles and commerce of those million worlds .
But there may be as many as 250 billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy .
Even with a million civilizations , less than one star in 250,000 would have a planet inhabited by an advanced civilization .
Since we have little idea which stars are likely candidates , we will have to examine a huge number of them .
Thus the quest for extraterrestrial intelligence may require a significant effort .
Despite claims about ancient astronauts and unidentified flying objects , there is no firm evidence of past visitations to the Earth by other civilizations , and so we are restricted to looking for signals from afar .
Of the long - distance techniques available to our technology , radio is by far the best .
Radio telescopes are relatively inexpensive ; radio signals travel at the speed of light , faster than which nothing can travel ; and the use of radio for communication is not an anthropocentric activity : radio represents a large part of the electromagnetic spectrum , and any technical civilization anywhere in the Galaxy will have discovered radio , just as we have .
Advanced civilizations might very well use some other means of communication with their peers - " zeta rays , " say , which we might not discover for centuries .
But if they wish to communicate with less advanced civilizations , there are only a few obvious methods , the chief of which is radio .
The first serious attempt to listen to possible radio signals from other civilizations was set up at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank , West Virginia , in 1959 .
This program , organized by Frank Drake who is now at Cornell University , was called Project Ozma* , after the princess of L. Frank Baum 's Land of Oz , a place exotic , distant and difficult to reach .
Drake examined two nearby stars , Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti , for a few weeks " It is difficult to think of another enterprise which holds as much promise for the future of humanity . " with negative results .
Positive results would have been astonishing , because , as we have seen , even rather optimistic estimates of the number of technical civilizations in the Galaxy imply that several hundred thousand stars must be examined in order to achieve success by random stellar selection .
Since Project Ozma , there have been six or eight other such programs , all at a rather modest level , in the United States , Canada and the Soviet Union .
Not one of them has achieved positive results .
The total number of individual stars examined to date is fewer than 1,000 .
We have performed something like one - tenth of one percent of the required effort .
However , there are signs that much more serious efforts may be mounted in the reasonably near future .
All the observing programs to date have involved either tiny amounts of time on large radio telescopes or large amounts of time on smaller telescopes .
In a major scientific study for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , directed by Philip Morrison of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , the feasibility and desirability of more systematic investigations have been powerfully underscored .
The study has four main conclusions : " (1 ) It is both timely and feasible to begin a serious search for extraterrestrial intelligence ; " ( 2 ) a significant . . . program with substantial potential secondary benefits can be undertaken with only modest resources ; " ( 3 ) large systems with great capability can be built as needed ; and " ( 4 ) such a search is intrinsically an international endeavor in which the United States can take a lead . "
The study carries a reassuring foreword by the Reverend Theodore Hesburgh , President of the University of Notre Dame , that such a search is consistent with religious and spiritual values , and includes the following ringing sentiment : " The question deserves ..... the serious and prolonged attention of many professionals from a wide range of disciplines - anthropologists , artists , lawyers , politicians , philosophers , theologians - even more than that , the concern of all thoughtful persons , whether specialists or not .
We must , all of us , consider the outcome of the search .
That search , we believe , is feasible ; its outcome is truly important either way .
Dare we begin ?
For us who write here , that question has step - by - step become instead : Dare we delay ? "
A wide range of options is identified in the Morrison report , including new ( and expensive ) giant ground - based and space - borne radio telescopes .
But the study also points out that major progress can be made at modest cost by the development of more sensitive radio receivers and of ingenious computerized data - processing systems .
In the Soviet Union there is a state commission devoted to organizing a search for extraterrestrial intelligence , and the large , 600 - meter diameter " RATAN - 600 " radio telescope in the Caucasus , just completed , is to be devoted part - time to this effort .
And along with spectacular advances in radio technology , there has been a dramatic increase in the scientific and public respectability of theories about extraterrestrial life .
Indeed , the Viking missions to Mars were , to a significant extent , dedicated to the search for life on another planet .
Of course , not all scientists accept the notion that other advanced civilizations exist .
A few who have speculated on this subject lately are asking : if extraterrestrial intelligence is abundant , why have we not already seen its manifestations ?
Think of the advances by our own technical civilization in the last 10,000 years , and imagine such advances continued over millions or billions of years .
If any civilizations are that much more advanced than we , why have they not produced artifacts , devices and even cases of industrial pollution of such magnitude that we would have detected them ?
Why have these beings not restructured the entire Galaxy for their convenience ?
And why has there been no clear evidence of extraterrestrial visits to the Earth ?
We have already launched slow and modest interstellar spacecraft called Pioneers 10 and I 1 and Voyagers 1 and 2 - which , incidentally , carry small golden greeting cards from the Earth to any space - faring interstellar civilizations which might intercept them .
A society more advanced than we should be able to ply the spaces between the stars conveniently , if not effortlessly .
Over millions of years such societies should have established colonies which themselves might launch interstellar expeditions .
Why are they not here ?
The temptation is to deduce that there are at most only a few advanced extraterrestrial civilizations - either because we are one of the first technical civilizations to have emerged , or because it is the fate of all such civilizations to destroy themselves before they are much further along .
It seems to me that such despair is quite premature .
All such arguments depend on our correctly surmising the intentions of beings far more advanced than ourselves , and when examined closely I think these arguments reveal a range of interesting human conceits .
For example , why do we expect that it will be easy to recognize the manifestations of very advanced civilizations ?
Is our situation not closer to that of isolated societies in the Amazon basin , say , who lack the tools to detect the powerful international radio and television traffic which is all around them ?
Also , there is a wide range of incompletely understood phenomena in astronomy .
Might the modulation of pulsars or the energy source of quasars have a technological origin ?
Or perhaps there is a galactic ethic of noninterference with backward or emerging civilizations .
Perhaps there is a waiting time before contact is considered appropriate , so as to give us a fair opportunity to destroy ourselves first , if we are so inclined .
Perhaps all societies significantly more advanced than our own have achieved an effective personal immortality , and lose the motivation for interstellar gallivanting - which may , for all we know , be a typical urge only of adolescent civilizations .
Perhaps mature civilizations do not wish to pollute the cosmos .
There is a very long list of such " perhapses , " few of which we are in a position to evaluate with any degree of assurance .
The question of extraterrestrial civilizations seems to me entirely open .
Personally , I think it far more difficult to understand a universe in which we are the only technological civilization , or one of but a few , than to imagine a cosmos brimming over with intelligent life .
Many aspects of the problem , fortunately , can be experimentally verified .
We can search for planets of other stars ; seek simple forms of life on such nearby worlds as Mars , Jupiter and Saturn 's moon Titan ; and perform more extensive laboratory studies on the chemistry of the origin of life .
We can investigate more deeply the evolution of organisms and societies .
The problem cries out for a long - term , open - minded and systematic search , with nature as the only arbiter of what is or is not likely .
" It is possible that the future of human civilization depends on the receipt of interstellar messages . "
If there are a million technical civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy , the average separation between civilizations will be about 300 light - years .
Since a light year is the distance which light travels in one year ( a little under six trillion miles ) , this implies that the one - way transit time for an interstellar communication from the nearest civilization will be some 300 years .
The time for a query and a response would be 600 years .
This is the reason that interstellar dialogues are much less likely - particularly around the time of first contact - than interstellar monologues .
It might seem remarkably selfless for a civilization to broadcast radio messages with no hope of knowing , at least in the immediate future , whether they have been received and what the response to them might be .
But human beings often perform very similar actions as , for example , in burying time capsules to be recovered by future generations , or even in writing books , composing music and creating art intended for posterity .
A civilization which had been aided by the receipt of such a message in its past might wish to similarly benefit other emerging technical societies .
The amount of power that need be expended in interstellar radio communication should be a tiny fraction of what is available for a civilization only slightly more advanced than we , and such radio transmission services could be an activity either of an entire planetary government or of relatively small groups of hobbyists , amateur radio operators and the like .
Although probably no previous contact will have been achieved between transmitting and receiving civilizations , communication in the absence of prior contact is possible .
It is easy to create an interstellar radio message which can be recognized as emanating unambiguously from intelligent beings .
A modulated signal ( " beep , " " beep - beep , " ) comprising the numbers 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 13 , 1 7 , 19 , 23 , 29 , 31 , for example , consists exclusively of the first 12 prime numbers - that is , numbers that can be divided only by 1 , or by themselves .
A signal of this kind , based on a simple mathematical concept , could only have a biological origin .
No prior agreement between the transmitting and receiving civilizations , and no precautions against Earth chauvinism , are required to make this clear .
Such a message would be an announcement or beacon signal , indicating the presence of an advanced civilization but communicating very little about its nature .
The beacon signal might also note a particular frequency where the main message is to be found , or might indicate that the principal message can be found at higher time resolution at the frequency of the beacon signal .
The communication of quite complex information is not very difficult , even for civilizations with extremely different biologies and social conventions .
For example , arithmetical statements can be transmitted , some true and some false , and in such a way it becomes possible to transmit the ideas of true and false concepts which might otherwise seem extremely difficult to communicate .
But by far the most promising method is to send pictures .
The message might consist of an array of zeros and ones transmitted as long and short beeps , or tones on two adjacent frequencies , or tones at different amplitudes , or even signals with different radio polarizations .
Properly arranged in rows and columns , the zeros and ones form a visual pattern - a picture similar to those an imaginative typist can create by using the letters of the alphabet as a medium .
Just such a message was transmitted to space by the Arecibo Observatory , which Cornell University runs for the National Science Foundation , in November 1974 at a ceremony marking the resurfacing of the Arecibo dish the largest radio / radar telescope on Earth .
The signal was sent to a collection of stars called M13 , a globular cluster comprising about a million separate suns , because it was overhead at the time of the ceremony .
Since Ml 3 is 24,000 light years away , the message will take 24,000 years to arrive there .
If anyone is listening , it will be 48,000 years before we receive a reply .
The Arecibo message was clearly not intended as a serious attempt at interstellar communication , but rather as an indication of the remarkable advances in terrestrial radio technology .
The decoded message forms a kind of pictogram that says something like this : " Here is how we count from one to ten .
Here are five atoms that we think are interesting or important : hydrogen , carbon , nitrogen , oxygen and phosphorus .
Here are some ways to put these atoms together that we think interesting or important - the molecules thymine , adenine , guanine and cytosine , and a chain composed of alternating sugars and phosphates .
These molecular building blocks are put together to form a long molecule of DNA comprising about four billion links in the chain .
The molecule is a double helix .
In some way this molecule is important for the clumsy looking creature at the center of the message .
That creature is 14 radio wavelengths or 5 feet 9.5 inches tall .
There are about four billion of these " In the deepest sense the search for extraterrestrial intelligence is a search for ourselves . " creatures on the third plant from our star .
There are nine planets altogether , four big ones toward the outside and one little one at the extremity .
This message is brought to you courtesy of a radio telescope 2,430 wavelengths or 1,004 feet in diameter .
Yours truly . "
Especially with many similar pictorial messages , each consistent with and corroborating the others , it is very likely that almost unambiguous interstellar radio communication could be achieved even between two civilizations which have never met .
Of course our immediate objective is not to send such messages , because we are very young and backward ; we wish to listen .
The detection of radio signals from space would illuminate many questions which have concerned scientists and philosophers since prehistoric times .
Such a signal would indicate that the origin of life is not an extraordinarily unlikely event .
It would imply that given billions of years for natural selection to operate , simple forms of life generally evolve into complex and intelligent forms , as on Earth , and that such intelligent forms commonly produce an advanced technology .
But it is not likely that the transmission we receive will be from a society at our own level of technological advance .
A society only a little more backward than we will not have radio astronomy at all .
The most likely case is that the message will be from a civilization with a far superior technology .
Thus , even before we decode such a message , we will have gained an invaluable piece of knowledge : that it is possible to avoid the dangers of the period of technological adolescence we are now passing through .
There are some who look on our global problems here on Earth - at our vast national antagonisms , our nuclear arsenals , our growing populations , the disparity between the poor and the affluent , shortages of food and resources , and our inadvertent alterations of the natural environment of our planet - and conclude that we live in a system which has suddenly become unstable , a system which is destined soon to collapse .
There are others who believe that our problems are soluble , that humanity is still in its childhood , that one day soon we will grow up .
The existence of a single message from space will show that it is possible to live through technological adolescence : the civilization transmitting the message , after all , has survived .
Such knowledge , it seems to me , might be worth a great price .
Another likely consequence of the receipt of an interstellar message is a strengthening of the bonds which join all human and other beings on our planet .
The sure lesson of evolution is that organisms elsewhere must have had separate evolutionary pathways ; that their chemistry and biology , and very likely their social organizations , will be profoundly dissimilar to anything which is familiar here on Earth .
We may well be able to communicate with them because we share a common universe ; because the laws of physics and chemistry and the regularities of astronomy are shared by them and by us .
But they may always be , in the deepest sense , different .
And when we recognize these differences the animosities which divide the peoples of the Earth may wither .
The differences among human beings of separate races and nationalities , religions and sexes are likely to be insignificant compared to the differences between all humans and all extraterrestrial intelligent beings .
If the message comes by radio , both transmitting and receiving civilizations will have in common at least the details of radiophysics .
The commonality of the physical sciences is the reason that many scientists expect the messages from extraterrestrial civilizations to be decodable .
No one is wise enough to predict in detail what the consequences of such a decoding will be , because no one is wise enough to understand beforehand what the nature of the message will be .
Since the transmission is likely to be from a civilization far in advance of our own , stunning insights are possible in the physical , biological and social sciences , insights reached from the perspective of a quite different kind of intelligence .
Decoding such a message will probably be a task of years and decades , and the decoding process can be as slow and careful as we choose .
Some have worried that such a message from an advanced society might make us lose faith in our own , might deprive us of the initiative to make new discoveries if it seems that there are others who have made those discoveries already , or might have other negative consequences .
But I stress that we are free to ignore an interstellar message if we find it offensive .
Few of us have rejected schools because teachers and textbooks exhibit learning of which we were so far ignorant .
If we receive a message , we are under no obligation to reply .
If we do not choose to respond , there is no way for the transmitting civilization to determine that its message was received and understood on the tiny distant planet Earth .
The receipt and translation of a radio message from the depths of space seems to pose few dangers to mankind ; instead , it holds the greatest promise of both practical and philosophical benefits for all of humanity .
It is possible that an early message may contain detailed prescriptions for the avoidance of technological disaster , for a passage through adolescence to maturity .
Perhaps the transmissions from advanced civilizations will describe " Humanity is still in its childhood .
. . one day soon we will grow up . " which pathways of cultural evolution are likely to lead to the stability and longevity of an intelligent species , and which other paths lead to stagnation or degeneration or disaster .
Perhaps there are straight - forward solutions , still undiscovered on Earth to problems of food shortages , population growth , energy supplies , dwindling resources , pollution and war .
There is , of course , no guarantee that such would be the contents of an interstellar message ; but it would be foolhardy to overlook the possibility .
There will surely be differences among civilizations which cannot be glimpsed until information is available about the evolution of many civilizations .
Because of our isolation from the rest of the cosmos , we have information on the evolution of only one civilization - our own .
And the most important aspect of that information , the future , remains closed to us .
Perhaps it is not likely , but it is certainly possible that the future of human civilization depends on the receipt and decoding of interstellar messages .
And what if we make a long - term and dedicated search for extraterrestrial intelligence and fail ?
Even then we surely will not have wasted our time .
We will have developed an important technology , with applications to many other aspects of our own civilization .
We will have greatly added to our knowledge of the physical universe .
And we will have calibrated the importance and uniqueness of our species , our civilization and other planets .
For if intelligent life is rare or absent elsewhere , we will have learned something about the rarity and value of our culture and our biological patrimony , which have been painstakingly extracted over four billion years of tortuous evolutionary history .
Such a finding will stress as perhaps nothing else can our responsibilities to future generations : because the most likely explanation of negative results , after a comprehensive and resourceful search , is that societies destroy themselves before they are advanced enough to establish a high - power radio transmitting service .
Thus , organization of a search for interstellar radio messages , quite apart from the outcome , is likely to have a cohesive and constructive influence on the whole of the human condition .
But we will not know the outcome of such a search , much less the contents of messages from interstellar civilizations , if we do not make a serious effort to listen for signals .
It may be that civilizations are divided into two great classes , those which make such an effort , achieve contact and become new members of a loosely tied federation of galactic communities , and those which cannot or choose not to make such an effort , or who lack the imagination to try , and who in consequence soon decay and vanish .
It is difficult to think of another enterprise within our capability and at relatively modest cost which holds as much promise for the future of humanity .

Carl Sagan is the David Duncan Professor of Astronomy and Space Sciences and Director of the Laboratory for Planetary Studies at Cornell University .
[ Webmaster 's note :
This is the original text from Cosmic Search .
Carl Sagan died on December 20th , 1996 . ]
Before coming to Cornell in 1968 , he served on the faculties of Harvard University and of the Stanford University Medical School .
Born in New York City in 1934 , he received his doctor 's degree from the University of Chicago in 1960 .
His interests encompass the physics and chemistry of planetary atmospheres and surfaces , planetary exploration , origin of life on the earth , and the possibilities and means of detection of extraterrestrial life .
He has been closely associated with the NASA planetary explorations involving the Mariner , Viking and Voyager missions .
Besides hundreds of scientific and popular articles , he has published a dozen books including " The Cosmic Connection : An Extraterrestrial Perspective " ( Anchor Press , 1973 ) , winner of the Campbell Award for the best science book of the year , and " The Dragons of Eden : Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence " ( Random House , 1977 ) , winner of the 1978 Pulitzer Prize for non-fiction .
As one of science 's most eloquent expositors , Sagan has contributed greatly to a better public appreciation of astronomy .
In f977 , to improve the presentation of science on television and in motion pictures , he formed " Carl Sagan Productions : Science for the Media , Inc . "
An initial project is a 13 - week series on astronomy .
Sagan edited the proceedings of the first international meeting on communication with extraterrestrial intelligence held in Armenia in 1971 .
He is also Editor - in - Chief of " ICARUS : International Journal of Solar System Studies " and a member of the Editorial Board of COSMIC SEARCH .
Figure 1 . Surface temperature analysis map for December 2006 from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies .
The datum period for comparison is 1951 to 1980 .
Note the large positive temperature anomalies over large tracts of North America , Europe and Russia which were 4 to 8 degrees C warmer this December compared with the datum period .
With oil approaching $ 50 / bbl and natural gas prices languishing in the doldrums I thought it was appropriate to look at one reason for supressed demand and prices .
North America , Europe and Russia are all experiencing uncommonly mild winter weather .
Figure 2 . Surface temperature analysis map for January 2006 from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies .
Figure 2 shows the situation in January 2006 , where , after the potent 2005 hurricane season , the whole of North America experienced uncommonly mild weather during the 2005 / 06 winter .
This essentialy rescued the situation with gas supplies depeleted / disrupted following all those hurricanes .
In January 2006 , the situation in Europe was very different , with extreme cold weather in Russia and Eastern Europe leading to heavy demand for gas and disruption to gas supplies .
The situation now is one where North America , Europe and Russia are all experiencing milder winter conditions that will soften demand for natural gas and for heating oil .
It looks like the self - regulating Earth is rescuing the energy crisis for the time being with the prospect that warmer temperatures are compensating for depleting fuel supplies .
From Figure 1 , it is also interesting to note the anomalous cold weather over the Middle East and Turkey during December .
This led Iran to suspend gas exports to Turkey as the cold weather boosted Iran 's domestic demand .
Turkey 's main source of gas is Russia supplimented by LNG imports from Algeria .
The other feature to note in Figure 1 is the El Nino event building in the East Pacific Ocean off the west coast of Peru represented by the elongate tongue of dark orange colours .
As a general rule , El Nino events correlate with reduced hurricane activity in the N Atlantic but increased storm activity in the eastern Pacific .
It ’s hard to believe that Fog Creek needs more office space already … it ’s been less than a year since we finished expanding to take over the whole 18th floor here at 535 Eighth .
This summer , unfortunately , with all the summer interns , we ’re going to have some people doubling up in offices , and by May 2008 our lease here will have run out .
In calculating how much space we ’re going to need , I ’m using this formula .
Offices :
Most full time employees get 70 or 100 sqft .
For summer interns , we ’re planning three interns per large office , 150 sqft .
Reception area : 250 sqft .
Bookshelves and mailing station : 75-100 sqft .
Supply room : 100-200sqft .
Server closet : 65 sqft .
Lunch room : 30 sqft per employee .
Kitchen : 200 sqft
Conference room / Lounge : 250 sqft .
Shower : 75 sqft
You take the total that gives you and add 30 % for circulation ( hallways and passageways ) which gets you something often called the carpetable square footage .
It would be really nice if office space listings were given in carpetable square feet , because that ’s what the tenant cares about , but the landlords instead make up some kind of number that includes :
building mechanicals
elevator shafts
exterior walls
common bathrooms
a percentage of the building ’s common areas including the lobby , loading dock , superintendent ’s office that you ca n’t go in , roof deck that you ca n’t get out on , and the building owner ’s house in Queens which if you tried to go near a goon would shoot you in the knees ( despite his very fetching daughter trying to seduce you from her bedroom window ) .
Theoretically the building has something called a loss factor which converts between how much space you have to rent and how much actual room you get for offices and espresso stations , but in reality , this just gets you in the ballpark , and every space is different ( long narrow spaces need more circulation space ) so there ’s no alternative to having your architect take the floor plans and actually figure out how many offices will fit in there .
The other problem we ’re going to have is that we can assume that we ’ll be growing during the course of the typical 5 - 10 year lease , and we certainly can’t afford to rent enough space for our 2017 needs right now .
The brokers we spoke to suggested three ways to solve this problem :
Move frequently .
Works best rents are going up , because you can get out of your lease early or sublet your old space .
Increases the costs of construction and is a pain in the butt .
Get space + an option to expand .
Landlords might be able to give you an option to expand at a particular date in the future in their building .
Get too much space and immediately sublet some of it .
Landlords do n’t love this because they do n’t like their tenants competing against them to rent out space in their own building … the tenants are usually desperate to sublet their extra space and will always undercut the landlord .
We ’re also toying with a fourth idea : getting too much space and renting it out in small chunks to software startups that need an office or two while they ’re bootstrapping , and who would appreciate a working environment designed for programmers rather than a coffee shop or one of those coworking places .
The trouble is that it would end up costing something on the order of $ 1500 a month for a private , Fog Creek - quality office , which might be out of the range of bootstrapped startups .
I might owe some people an apology .
I recently posted about a song from “ Scrubs the Musical , ” a television episode that aired a few weeks ago .
The title of this tune is presumably “ Everything comes Down to Poo . ”
It is a clever and funny tune , but it is also dangerous .
For me ( hopefully not for you ) that song morphed into an “ earworm , ” another name for a song that can get stuck in one ’s head .
This crazy tune from Scrubs has been following me around relentlessly for the past two weeks .
It has sometimes been distractingly annoying during the day .
It even kept me awake one night last week .
What to do ?
I just happen to be reading a cogsci/ music book : This is Your Brain on Music , by Daniel Levitin .
Here ’s what I learned from Levitin :
There is relatively little scientific work done on the topic of earworms .
What is clear is that
musicians are more likely to have ear worm attacks than non-musicians , and . . . people with obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) are more likely to report being troubled by ear worms — in some cases medications for OCD can minimize the effects .
Hmmm . . .
This makes me wonder whether Walgreens carries any over - the - counter medications for OCD . . .
Levitin suggests that the neural circuits representing a song somehow get stuck in “ playback ” mode , but usually only a small fragment of a song ( 15 to 30 seconds ) is involved .
Ear worms are most likely “ simple songs and commercial jingles . ”
Marketing professor James J. Kellaris , PhD , of the University of Cincinnati has also studied earworms .
( Kellaris has also done some interesting research about customer reactions to the use of music by busisnesses ) .
He has found that nearly 98 % of people have had songs stuck in their heads .
He has found that people tend to be haunted by their own idiosyncratic demon tunes .
Musicians are more often bothered by non-musicians .
He also notes that women are afflicted significantly more than men .
As Kellaris writes ,
Songs with lyrics are reported as most frequently stuck ( 74 % ) , followed by commercial jingles ( 15 % ) and instrumental tunes without words ( 11 % ) , ” Kellaris writes in his study abstract .
“ On average , the episodes last over a few hours and occur ‘ frequently ’ or ‘ very frequently ’ among 61.5 % of the sample .
Kellaris has published his students ’ “ Top - Ten Earworm List ” :
1. Other .
Everyone has his or her own worst earworm .
2. Chili’s “ Baby Back Ribs ” jingle .
3. “ Who Let the Dogs Out ”
4. “ We Will Rock You ”
5. Kit -Kat candy - bar jingle ( “ Gimme a Break … ” )
6. “ Mission Impossible ” theme
7. “ YMCA ”
8. “ Whoomp , There It Is ”
9 . “ The Lion Sleeps Tonight ”
10 . “ It ’s a Small World After All ”
According to a separate list on Yahoo , other common earworms include “ Raindrops Are Falling on My Head ” and “ Chicken Noodle Soup . ”
Over the years , my personal demon has been “ Jingle Bell Rock . ”
My wife ’s demons have included “ Sing a Song . ”
My father - in - law was long haunted by “ Rudolf the Red Nosed Reindeer . ”
In an article called “ ’ Brain itch ’ keeps songs in the head , ” we learn this from a jingle writer :
For both advertising purposes and pop music purposes , you want something that once heard is not forgotten quickly or easily , ” explained jingle writer Chris Smith , adding that a good earworm was “ Insidious – and often quite blatant .
One of the key elements of an earworm is repetition , ” he said .
“ If you have something with a lot of varied content , it ’s not so easily assimilated . ”
Smith indicates that “ Even the greatest musicians had suffered with earworms ” :
Mozart ’s children would “ infuriate ” him by playing melody and scales on the piano below his room – but stopping before completing the tune .
He would have to rush down and complete the scale because he could n’t bear to listen to an unresolved scale . ”
What can you do if you get a song stuck in your head ?
Some people say that you must force yourself to sing the entire song .
I ’ve tried that , but it only makes it worse for me .
Others say that you need to replaced the earworm with another earworm , which functions as an “ eraser tune . ”
That is the idea behind an enterprising site called “ Maim that tune . ”
This tormented soul tried yet another potential remedy :
[ R]umor has it that chewing on cinnamon sticks will help make the song begone .
I ’ll see if that works .
All I know is that by the time I ’d finished drafting this post , “ Springtime For Hitler ” had been replaced by “ The Lion Sleeps Tonight . ”
Not to frighten anyone needlessly , but earworms sometimes bloom into “ musical hallucinosis , ” where people vividly hear music that is n’t being played .
Such a hallucination can occur without any other distortion of reality and it can last for months .
Some research suggests infections of the brain , such as syphilis and Lyme disease , can trigger musical hallucinations by inflaming parts of the brain .
Curing the diseases sometimes cures the hallucinations as well .
And in other cases , the songs just stop .
Hmmm .
I ’m again thinking about going to Walgreens . . .
In conclusion , I ’m not going to ask anyone to comment on his or her most feared earworm .
Simply writing the title might trigger the extended playing of that song in your head .
Do n’t risk it .
It ’s not worth it .
Really .
Do n’t you dare !
Then again , what is your most commonly recurring earworm ?
If you have more than 1 GB RAM , you can force your windows xp to load the kernel in your RAM .
This will speed up your windows performance tremendously !
If computer instruction process in RAM is far more faster than hard disk .
DO NOT try this on low memory system !

The Masri Case White House Fears ACLU Campaign
Khaled El - Masri was innoncently detained in a secret CIA prison .
Now US civil liberties advocates are helping him take the intelligence service to court .
His chances of winning the trial are slim -- but his case is stirring up negative publicity for the Bush administration .

Michael emailed in to ask if will I ever included menâ€™s fashion on SASSYBELLA.com .
And I knew I had forgotten something ( after that one Chanelling piece on Chad Michael Murray I completely forgot to add more for the guys ) .
Oh and did I mention it is Menâ€™s Spring Fashion Week 2007 ?
Oh and that I had spent a good hour or so looking at The Sartorialist blog on Men. Style.com from Paris and Milan .
Just look how gorgeous this Calvin Klien model is ( pictured ) .
Is n’t he fantastic eye candy ?
I must admit Iâ€™m not all that knowledgeable about men ’s fashion .
But I do know two Australian menswear labels that I adore for their tailoring as well as their fashionable sleek look ’s that are n’t too flashy .
If I had a boyfriend ( or if my brother was old enough ) I ’d shop there for them .
Who are they then ?
AG and Calibre .
Love them .
And it ’s a bonus that they are both Melbourne labels that I have come across at various fashion shows .
They ’re tailoring is great .
Also after having to hem their pants , and get gorgeous male models in and out of their clothes for the catwalk , they are definitely stand out clothes .
For more casual wear , give Josh Goot or Bowie a go .
As for cool men ’s fashion websites to check out Michaelâ€¦ there is :
I quite like Australian GQ the magazine , but they do n’t have a full website .
For ideas on what to wear , menswear trends tend to not change so drastically from season to season like womenswear , but what I find useful is to pick a stylish guy ( or celebrity ) whoâ€™s clothes you always like , and channel his look .
The sportier suit look is suppose to be coming back in for guys , but really jeans and a tshirt or jeans and shirt can never go wrong for most occasions .
Taking looks straight off the catwalk for men is always a big no no .
After all this would n’t be a good look now would it ?
Just pick the right print and you ’re good !
Oh and never believe everything you read about whatâ€™s coming back “ in ” .
I read today that beards are coming back in .
I hope they donâ€™t mean scruffy beards .
Gross .
In a spontaneous fit of self - referentiality , I ’m now going to mention a book , in this blog , that mentions this blog , in the book . 🙂
Scott Rosenberg ’s new book Dreaming
In Code , which is mostly about the Chandler project I work on for OSAF , mentions a couple of my blog posts here about the project , mainly to describe them as , uh , “ indelicate ” .
One of the posts , Python is Not Java , remains highly popular to this day .
But Rosenberg bizarrely interprets this post as “ publicly exposing the OSAF team ’s goofs ” , despite the fact that the code was available for anybody on the internet to download and see for themselves !
Plenty of them did – and some Pythonistas critiqued it far more harshly than I did .
I was the only person who attempted to write something educational about what should be done instead , rather than writing the project off as a joke .
That post will continue to be a useful article for people migrating from Java to Python , long after its relationship to Chandler is forgotten .
( Not that most people know the relationship in the first place – you ’d have to have examined the Chandler code base yourself , or read somewhere else that the post was related , despite Rosenberg ’s claim that it was “ pretty clear who [ I ] was talking about ” .
Clear to whom ? )
Strangely , the two mentions of my blog in the book do n’t seem to go anywhere ; they ’re almost a sidetrack , as though there was going to be a subplot about the work I was doing , that faded out because it got too technical or something .
( My first big OSAF project was ripping out all the XML schema / UI specification and replacing it with a faster , more maintainable Python API – not exactly mainstream bestseller stuff . )
Honestly , if I were editing the book , I ’d probably have cut my three pages out entirely , because it ’s a tangent of little interest that goes nowhere .
( Heck , for all I know , an editor might have actually cut those three pages out of the final version , because I ’m just reading a preview version that ’s been circulating amongst OSAF staff . )
It seems that the only purpose was to show how great OSAF is because they were able to look past my “ indelicate ” nature and still “ adapt good ideas ” from my work .
But that bizarre conclusion springs from Rosenberg ’s misunderstanding of the purpose of Spike .
The problem I was experiencing at OSAF initially was that nobody was taking my refactoring proposals seriously , because they could n’t conceive of what the end result would look like .
It was just too foreign a concept at that point , and therefore the perceived risk of my initial proposals was too high .
Essentially , people were arguing that what I proposed was impossible , because they did n’t see how it could be done .
So the idea of Spike was to provide a concrete example to point to of “ see , this is how something written Pythonically could work ” , and to demonstrate that something of that sort could in fact be implemented both quickly and robustly , while providing an easy - to - use and understand API .
In other words , the point was never to be an actual replacement for Chandler ’s architecture , but rather to provide a prototype of what it could be like .
So , the whole point of the exercise was to “ adapt good ideas ” from it !
That ’s also why it was done as quickly as possible and in as minimalist a style as possible – its purpose was to sell ideas to management and developers , not to deliver a replacement architecture .
Spike ’s purpose , in short , was to raise OSAF expectations about what could be done in Python ( mirroring the theme of the blog posts Rosenberg cites ) and to make a shift in thinking from ruling things out as “ not possible ” , to asking , “ what should we do , and how can we do it ? ”
In short , Rosenberg ’s narrative creates a dramatic tension that did n’t actually exist in the situation , while ignoring the ones that actually did exist in the situation .
Which makes me wonder how much more of the book ( which is mostly about stuff that happened “ before my time ” at OSAF ) actually reflects what was really going on in the rest of the project .
Oh well .
One person at OSAF explained it to me this way : Rosenberg was n’t really writing about the Chandler project , he was writing about software projects in general , using Chandler as an example to illustrate the principles of software development that he already wanted to write about !
So , if what you really want to know about is what actually happened on the Chandler project , this may not be the book for you .
On the other hand , if you want lyrical rhapsodies about how “ public static void ” can be read as a kind of machine poetry , and how the gap between zero and one is the gap between man and machine , by all means have a go at it .
( Those parts of the book are actually interesting and fun , I find . )
Just do n’t make any assumptions about how these abstractions map back to the real people and real tasks of the real project used to illustrate them .
At last week 's " Future of Radio " House Telecom and Internet sub - committee hearing that focused on the horrible ruling that could shut down Internet radio stations and the XM / Sirius proposed merger , Congressman Mike Doyle ( D - Pittsburgh , PA ) brought his fellow members into the current century with a story about one his constituents -- who happens to be one of the hottest DJs of the moment ... ( after the jump is my user - generated transcription ) ...
It seems that we have a closest electronic music lover in the house .
And , by the house , I mean The House .
As I was prepping for my trip to music mecca tomorrow ( SXSW in Austin ) , I was checking out various music blogs to catch up on some of the 1,300 acts playing .
Needless to say , I did n't expect to run into a meaty tech policy nugget from the all - important Pitchfork while trying to figure out how I could possibly see Sondre Leche , The Bird and the Bee , and Fugiya & Miyagi all in the same night .
Congressman Doyle : Mr. Chairman , I want to tell you a story of a local guy done good .
His name is Greg Gillis and by day he is a biomedical engineer in Pittsburgh .
At night , he DJs under the name Girl Talk .
His latest mash - up record made the top 2006 albums list from Rolling Stone , Pitchfork and Spin Magazine amongst others .
His shtick as the Chicago Tribune wrote about him is " based on the notion that some sampling of copyrighted material , especially when manipulated and recontextualized into a new art form is legit and deserves to be heard . "
In one example , Mr. Chairman , he blended Elton John , Notorious B - I - G , and Destiny 's Child all in the span of 30 seconds .
And , while the legal indie-music download site eMusic.com took his stuff down due to possible copyright violation , he 's now flying all over the world to open concerts and remix for artists like Beck .
The same cannot be said for Atlanta - based , hop - hop , mix - tape king DJ Drama .
Mix -tapes , actually made on CDs , are sold at Best Buys and local record shops across the country and they are seen as crucial in making or breaking new acts in hip - hop .
But even though artists on major labels are paying DJ Drama to get their next mixed - tape , the major record labels are leading raids and sending people like him to jail .
I hope that everyone involved will take a step back and ask themselves if mash - ups and mixtapes are really different or if it's the same as Paul McCartney admitting that he nicked the Chuck Berry bass - riff and used it on the Beatle 's hit " I Saw Her Standing There . "
Maybe it is .
And , maybe Drama violated some clear bright lines .
Or , maybe mixtapes are a powerful tool .
And , maybe mash - ups are transformative new art that expands the consumers experience and does n't compete with what an artist has made available on iTunes or at the CD store .
And , I do n't think Sir Paul asked for permission to borrow that bass line , but every time I listen to that song , I 'm a little better off for him having done so .
Until our questions about the future of music get answered , we first have to look at the future of radio ... ( and then he wraps up his talk with a few words about the Webcast issues of the day ) ...
Wow .
Hard to believe ?
You can see the video here , yourself .
BTW , not that we are giving ourself any credit for educating Congressman Doyle ( or his staff ) , but as far as we can tell , we 're the only site out there that has made a connection to what Drama got arrested for and what Girl Talk is ( still ) celebrated for .
See what we wrote back in January when we covered the Drama arrest .
We also quoted Girl Talk on copyright ...
" The statement I ’ve been issuing is that I think the music industry is starting to realize that this type of music is n’t really hurting anyone .
No one ’s really picking up my album instead of someone I sample .
If anything , it ’s just getting people excited about music in general , so I think that ’s the reason the record labels have n’t really had a problem because they realize , if anything it ’s a promotional tool for their artists .
" ... the interesting thing is a lot of major labels , pretty much all of the four majors or some subsidiary of them , have been contacting me non -stop to say that they liked the album and are interested in working on something in the future . "
Since we want to live to see another scene like the Girl Talk DJ performance below , we also wrote :
... we hope that the silver lining here is that folks turn their attention to the fact that the mixtapes may not have only had promotional value but could be considered valued creative outputs on their own that do n't subtract from the opportunity of the artists being mixed .
Given this , there should be a copyright system that makes it a heck of a lot easier for DJs and other recombinant artists to license samples that can be used to create new creative tracks that bear little resemblance to the originals .
This is obviously one of the ideas around Creative Commons and why Larry Lessig is out pushing for a copyright system that matches a 21st Century digitally driven entertainment world .
And , while it was simply a short statement from a Congressman from Pittsburgh , you have to start somewhere .
And , if you are going to start somewhere , make it spot on and name check Girl Talk and DJ Drama .
But , do we have any illusions that Congress is suddenly going to " get " how new digital mediums can make new art on top of old , the next Congressman who spoke after Doyle said : " Hey , Mr. Chairman , I was just trying to figure out half of the words that Mike Doyle just mentioned .
I am clueless .... "
But , this small step matters because half the battle here is education and demystifying technological advances .
If there are folks like Doyle who teach other members about digital media without making them feel stupid or showing them up , than it will go a long way .
The reality is that given all that they have on their plate , policymakers are clueless about plenty other things until they absolutely need to learn the subject matter .
Fortunately , there are also folks like the legendary artist Gilberto Gil have leadership positions in Brazil .
As the New York Times reported today , Gil would be a brother - in - arms with Mr. Doyle and will help show how next generation copyright policy can create new creativity and even new opportunities for commerce ....
Brazil ’s official stance on digital content and intellectual property rights is in large part derived from Mr. Gil ’s own experience .
In the late ’60s he and his close friend Caetano Veloso , along with a handful of others here and in São Paulo , started the movement known as Tropicalismo , which blended avant - garde poetry , pop influences from abroad and home - grown musical styles then scorned as corny and déclassé .
In a way , the Tropicalistas engaged in sampling before digital sampling existed , using cut - and - paste , mix - and - match collage techniques that are common now but were considered bizarre at the time .
In recent years their music and approach has been embraced by pop performers as diverse as David Byrne , Nirvana , Beck , Nelly Furtado and Devendra Banhart .
When “ world music ” first appeared in the United States and Europe and Mr. Byrne , Paul Simon , Peter Gabriel and others began incorporating Brazilian rhythms into their work , Mr. Gil was initially skeptical of the phenomenon , complaining of “ cultural safaris ” by adventurers in Land Rovers “ looking for all the rare specimens . ”
But thanks in large part to technological advances , he said , that practice has “ changed completely , ” and pop stars are now “ more respectful ” of other cultures .
“ Today the hegemony of the North has , in a certain form , been broken , ” he said .
“ Local tendencies are allowed to manifest themselves and adopt their own languages and forms of packaging .
It ’s no longer that vision of transforming some regional raw material into a single , standardized product .
Today you have all kinds of local scenes that utilize universal elements , ” like Brazilian , South African and Arab rap .
As we offered back in January , download a Girl Talk remix of " The Knife " by Grizzly Bear ( that has dond a lot to bring attention to Grizzly Bear ) .
More on Girl Talk from the Pitchfork post that got me all distracted ...
OK , i can no longer resist posting this even though it ’s not so very nice .
In a moment of snarkiness , i was thinking about how to frame the perceived attitude of the three big search companies : MYG ( Microsoft , Yahoo , Google ) .
By thinking on a global landscape and thinking about empires , i decided that you could draw similes between each company and powerful nation - states in the 20th century .
Yes , it ’s a crude and rude model drawing off of stereotypes to build caricatures .
But it is kinda funny .
I was trying to resist posting this because it feels so inappropriate , but why should that stop me ?
Microsoft is Germany .
They did some pretty evil things a while back but you do n’t remember the details , you just know that you really hate them .
Even though they ’re really no worse than any other large corporpation / country , you ca n’t help but distrust them permanently because , well , you always have .
Yahoo is Japan .
It had an economic crisis that almost destroyed it and it plays too nice with all of the other evil empires , supporting the most evil endeavors .
It has n’t really innovated for a while , but it tries to improve on known products to support average people .
It ’s currently trying to sell culture in the form of animated cutesy iconic images which you kinda like and kinda despise .
Google is the United States .
It has never seen trouble on home turf .
It is arrogant and loved by the elite .
You know you ’re supposed to respect them for being better than everyone else , because they think they are , but you actually kinda resent them for being so rich and powerful .
Yet , you really like their cool toys .
Note :
This post is meant to be humorous in that way when you make fun of things which are intimately a part of your life .
I have much respect for all three companies and while parallels are drawn that sting , it is meant in jest , to poke at the issues of how attitudes by each company are perceived .
I also know that this post can be read as xenophobic because i draw on stereotypes of different powerful nation - states .
With both the companies and the countries , i am not saying anything about the employees / residents – this has to do with corporate and historical brands , not with the actualities or individuals .
I tried to draw parallels that were equally dismissive and offensive of each company , so do n’t think that i’m aiming for one company in particular .
I do respect all three companies and countries , even when they ( as institutions ) make a fool of themselves .
In fact , i work for Google because i respect Google .
But in any case , i figured you ’d enjoy these caricatures and tear them to pieces ( or at least critique the hell out of them ) .

A couple weeks ago , I wrote about all the well - deserved attention being placed on the idea of the economics of abundance .
The discussion around that topic , both in the comments and in a series of emails has been quite interesting .
Not everyone agrees with the concept , and that presents something of a challenge .
It always interests me to figure out what the points of disagreement are in various intellectual debates .
Larry Lessig recently quoted Al Gore in talking about the importance of " removing blocks . "
Basically , the idea is that , when people disagree with you , look closely at the points on which they disagree , and try to figure out why that disagreement is occurring .
You can often learn some very interesting things , while challenging your own opinion on things .
I am planning a series of posts on this topic , to see if we might be able to clear out the blocks concerning the economics of digital content .
To start it off , I 'm going to recap the talk ( and the reasoning behind it ) I gave back in April .
When Jim Harper of the Cato Institute kindly invited me to be on a panel discussion about copyrights at Cato in their Washington DC office , I had a lot of trouble figuring out what I was going to talk about .
I had been spending a lot of time trying to understand why there was such a split among folks who prided themselves on having a " free market " or libertarian view of the world -- but who seemed to completely disagree on the economics of content .
It bothered me that people who started with the same fundamental toolbox ( " the free market is good " ) would end up at such widely divergent views .
On the one side were folks like the Progress & Freedom Foundation , who felt that strong intellectual property laws ( including things like stronger protections of DRM ) were necessary to build an economy around content .
On the other , were folks like myself , Tim Lee and David Levine , who saw that these intellectual property laws were basically government granted monopolies that could hold back economic progress .
As I mentioned in my recap to the panel discussion , I had my " Eureka ! " moment on the airplane to DC .
While I 'd been reading through a bunch of text books on the economics of intellectual property , the history of intellectual property and the history of economics -- none seemed to answer the question of where the breakdown occurred .
So I gave it all up , and decided to reread a book I 'd picked up at a used book sale a few years back , calledwhich is a fascinating history of the number zero -- and the fact that not only did it take societies ages to even recognize the number zero , it was considered heretical in some areas for a while .
Zero caused all sorts of problems in that it did n't work like other numbers .
Ita number .
It 's the absence of a number , and that screws up a lot of things .
For thousands of years , it held back progress .
You can't have advanced math or physics without an understanding of zero -- and the difficulty in accepting it was a real problem .
Of course , for all of us who learned about zero in elementary school , this seems laughable .
How could zero be such a difficult concept to understand ?
Except , as I read the book , it occurred to me that it 's the exact same problem that was causing this breakdown in the discussion .
It 's incredibly easy to misunderstand zero in economics .
That 's because economics , we 're often taught , is the " science of scarcity " or understanding resource allocation in the presence of scarcity .
All too often , economics itself is defined by scarcity .
The " zero " changes all of that .
Plugging a zero into an equation that expects a non -zero sends it haywire ( think of what happens when you divide by zero ) -- and that leads people to think that the equation must be broken .
So , for example , basic economics tells you that a free market will push prices towards their marginal costs .
If their marginal costs are zero ( as is the case with digital goods and intellectual property ) , then it says that price will get pushed towards zero .
However , this makes people upset , and makes them suggest the model is broken when a zero is applied .
They see a result where there is no scarcity , and it does n't make sense to them since they 've always understood economics in the context of scarcity .
However , the point is that if you understand the zero , there 's nothing to worry about and the model works perfectly .
It just requires a recognition that the scarcity does n't exist .
Instead , you have abundance .
You can have as much content as you need -- and in that world , it makes perfect sense that there 's no costs , because without scarcity there need not be a cost .
Supply is infinite , and price is zero .
That does not mean , however , that there 's no business .
Instead , it just means you need to flip the equation and use the zero to your advantage .
Instead of thinking of it as forcing a " price " of zero , you think of it as being a " cost " of zero .
Suddenly , you 've lowered the cost of making something to nothing -- and you should then try to use as much of it as you can .
One simple example of this is to use that item that " costs " zero as a promotional good for something that does not have a zero marginal cost .
When you realize how zero factors in , you realize that there 's nothing new or radical here at all .
It 's just coming to terms with the idea that free market economics still works in the face of zero ( in fact , it thrives ) and there 's no reason to put in place government - sanctioned barriers to shape the market .
( This is the foreword to Rick Chapman ’s new book , In Search of Stupidity . )
In every high tech company I ’ve known , there ’s a war going on , between the geeks and the suits .
Before you start reading this great new book full of propaganda from software marketing wizard and über - suit Rick Chapman , let me take a moment to tell you what the geeks think .
Play along with me for a minute , will you ?
Please imagine the most stereotypically pale , Jolt - drinking , Chinese - food - eating , video - game - playing , slashdot - reading Linux - command - line - dwelling dork .
Since this is just a stereotype , you should be free to imagine either a runt or a kind of chubby fellow , but in either case this is not the kind of person who plays football with his high school pals when he visits mom for Thanksgiving .
Also , since he ’s a stereotype , I shall not have to make complicated excuses for making him a him .
This is what our stereotypical programmer thinks : “ Microsoft makes inferior products , but they have superior marketing , so everybody buys their stuff . ”
Ask him what he thinks about the marketing people in his own company .
“ They ’re really stupid .
Yesterday I got into a big argument with this stupid sales chick in the break room and after ten minutes it was totally clear that she had no clue what the difference between 802.11a and 802.11 b is .
Duh ! ”
What do marketing people do , young geek ?
“ I do n’t know .
They play golf with customers or something , when they ’re not making me correct their idiot spec sheets .
If it was up to me I ’d fire ‘ em all . ”
A nice fellow named Jeffrey Tarter used to publish an annual list of the hundred largest personal computer software publishers called the Soft - letter 100 .
Here ’s what the top ten looked like in 1984 :
Rank Company Annual Revenues # 1 Micropro International $ 60,000,000 # 2 Microsoft Corp. $ 55,000,000 # 3 Lotus $ 53,000,000 # 4 Digital Research $ 45,000,000 # 5 VisiCorp $ 43,000,000 # 6 Ashton - Tate $ 35,000,000 # 7 Peachtree $ 21,700,000 # 8 MicroFocus $ 15,000,000 # 9 Software Publishing $ 14,000,000 # 10 Broderbund $ 13,000,000
OK , Microsoft is number 2 , but it is one of a handful of companies with roughly similar annual revenues .
Now let ’s look at the same list for 2001 .
Rank Company Annual Revenues # 1 Microsoft Corp . $ 23,845,000,000 # 2 Adobe $ 1,266,378,000 # 3 Novell $ 1,103,592,000 # 4 Intuit $ 1,076,000,000 # 5 Autodesk $ 926,324,000 # 6 Symantec $ 790,153,000 # 7 Network Associates $ 745,692,000 # 8 Citrix $ 479,446,000 # 9 Macromedia $ 295,997,000 # 10 Great Plains $ 250,231,000
Whoa .
Notice , if you will , that every single company except Microsoft has disappeared from the top ten .
Also notice , please , that Microsoft is so much larger than the next largest player , it ’s not even funny .
Adobe would double in revenues if they could just get Microsoft ’s soda pop budget .
The personal computer software market is Microsoft .
Microsoft ’s revenues , it turns out , make up 69 % of the total revenues of all the top 100 companies combined .
This is what we ’re talking about , here .
Is this just superior marketing , as our imaginary geek claims ?
Or the result of an illegal monopoly ?
( Which begs the question : how did Microsoft get that monopoly ?
You ca n’t have it both ways . )
According to Rick Chapman , the answer is simpler : Microsoft was the only company on the list that never made a fatal , stupid mistake .
Whether this was by dint of superior brainpower or just dumb luck , the biggest mistake Microsoft made was the dancing paperclip .
And how bad was that , really ?
We ridiculed them , shut it off , and went back to using Word , Excel , Outlook , and Internet Explorer every minute of every day .
But for every other software company that once had market leadership and saw it go down the drain , you can point to one or two giant blunders that steered the boat into an iceberg .
Micropro fiddled around rewriting the printer architecture instead of upgrading their flagship product , WordStar .
Lotus wasted a year and a half shoehorning 123 to run on 640 kb machines ; by the time they were done Excel was shipping and 640 kb machines were a dim memory .
Digital Research wildly overcharged for CP / M - 86 and lost a chance to be the de-facto standard for PC operating systems .
VisiCorp sued themselves out of existence .
Ashton - Tate never missed an opportunity to piss off dBase developers , poisoning the fragile ecology that is so vital to a platform vendor ’s success .
I ’m a programmer , of course , so I tend to blame the marketing people for these stupid mistakes .
Almost all of them revolve around a failure of non-technical business people to understand basic technology facts .
When Pepsi-pusher John Sculley was developing the Apple Newton , he did n’t know something that every computer science major in the country knows : handwriting recognition is not possible .
This was at the same time that Bill Gates was hauling programmers into meetings begging them to create a single rich text edit control that could be reused in all their products .
Put Jim Manzi ( the suit who let the MBAs take over Lotus ) in that meeting and he would be staring blankly .
“ What ’s a rich text edit control ? ”
It never would have occurred to him to take technological leadership because he did n’t grok the technology ; in fact , the very use of the word grok in that sentence would probably throw him off .
If you ask me , and I ’m biased , no software company can succeed unless there is a programmer at the helm .
So far the evidence backs me up .
But many of these boneheaded mistakes come from the programmers themselves .
Netscape ’s monumental decision to rewrite their browser instead of improving the old code base cost them several years of Internet time , during which their market share went from around 90 % to about 4 % , and this was the programmers ’ idea .
Of course , the nontechnical and inexperienced management of that company had no idea why this was a bad idea .
There are still scads of programmers who defend Netscape ’s ground - up rewrite .
“ The old code really sucked , Joel ! ” Yeah , uh - huh .
Such programmers should be admired for their love of clean code , but they should n’t be allowed within 100 feet of any business decisions , since it ’s obvious that clean code is more important to them than shipping , uh , software .
So I ’ll concede to Rick a bit and say that if you want to be successful in the software business , you have to have a management team that thoroughly understands and loves programming , but they have to understand and love business , too .
Finding a leader with strong aptitude in both dimensions is difficult , but it ’s the only way to avoid making one of those fatal mistakes that Rick catalogs lovingly in this book .
So read it , chuckle a bit , and if there ’s a stupidhead running your company , get your résumé in shape and start looking for a house in Redmond .
